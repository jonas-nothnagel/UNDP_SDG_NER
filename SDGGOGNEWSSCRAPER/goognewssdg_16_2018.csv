The communication initiative notes that it is time to turn worldwide enthusiasm for the SDGs into action, and the targets are meant to guide engagement on a personal level.

Target icons are available when clicking on the associated SDG. An abbreviated title for each target is included next to its icon, along with the original textual formulation of the target.

A Global Goals for Sustainable Development press release notes that enthusiasm for sustainable development is “stronger than ever,” and that expanding the communication system for the Goals can help ensure enthusiasm is turned into action. The targets are “the real working parts of the Goals,” it notes, as they provide a detail list to guide engagement on a more personal level.

As agreed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 17 SDGs are accompanied by 169 targets: seven targets for SDG 1 (no poverty); eight targets for SDG 2 (zero hunger); 13 targets for SDG 3 (good health and well-being); ten targets for SDG 4 (quality education); nine targets for SDG 5 (gender equality); eight targets for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); five targets for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); 12 targets for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth); eight targets for SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); ten targets for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); ten targets for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 11 targets for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); five targets for SDG 13 (climate action); ten targets for SDG 14 (life below water); 12 targets for SDG 15 (life on land); 12 targets for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and 19 targets for SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).

The Netherlands recently issued its review, while Canada has announced plans to conduct one. In total, more than 100 SAIs have shown interest in carrying out SDG-related audits, according to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).

SAIs are independent governmental entities with an external audit role established by a constitution or supreme law-making body. They primarily oversee public expenditure but, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), they are increasingly taking a broader, more comprehensive view to address reliability, effectiveness, efficiency and economy of policies and programmes. INTOSAI is an umbrella organization for the external government audit community, promoting development and transfer of knowledge, improving government auditing worldwide and enhancing professional capacities. It is an NGO with special consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

In December 2016, SAIs gathered for the biennial International Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions (XXII INCOSAI), in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The agenda for this meeting included the theme, “How INTOSAI can contribute to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including good governance and strengthening the fight against corruption”. The INTOSAI website includes a section for ‘Audit reports produced by individual SAIs on the SDGs;’ the Netherlands’ review of preparedness to achieve the SDGs is the first report on this list.

The Netherlands’ review concludes that the government has made a “swift and well-organised start,” but there are “a number of areas that require attention to ensure a lasting long-term impact.” The review was carried out by the Netherlands Court of Audit (NCA), and its conclusions were conveyed to the House of Representatives of the Dutch Parliament in a letter of 13 September 2017. Per the letter, the NCA conducted the review from March to June 2017, based on a seven-step framework it developed with the European Court of Auditors. The framework’s steps include a firm commitment on the part of the government to achieving the SDGs, the involvement of society as a whole and of all relevant stakeholders, and the development of a suitable system for monitoring progress. The letter recalls that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation wrote to the House of Representatives in September 2016, presenting a plan of action for SDG implementation, and indicated that the Netherlands would strive to achieve all Goals by 2030. It also states that Statistics Netherlands issued its first SDG monitoring report on 4 November 2016.

The review points to a number of areas the Dutch Government needs to pay special attention to, in order to “ensure the successful and coherent achievement of the SDGs in the longer term.” These areas include: raising awareness of the SDGs in the education curriculum; analyzing the impact of government policy on the ability of subnational authorities and others to reach the SDGs, and vice versa; and examining how the SDGs can be included in the regular budget and accountability cycles of the government.

A “light-touch approach” to coordination may not be sufficient to avoid conflicts or overlap among policies, the review finds.

The review stresses the need to ensure clear coordination and assessment of policy proposals in order to avoid conflicts or overlap, and suggests that the “light-touch approach to coordination” by the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation may not be sufficient. It highlights the importance of considering the impact of any policy proposal (whether positive or negative) on one or more of the SDGs, and discusses the relevance of using an SDG assessment tool in this regard.

The review was based on interviews with: the national coordinator for the SDGs; the SDG ‘focal points’ at various ministries; Statistics Netherlands; the international division of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG); Partos, a partnership of development organizations; and members of the Netherlands’ SDG Charter, which involves companies, public authorities and NGOs. It also used public sources.

The Abu Dhabi Declaration resulting from XXII INCOSAI outlines the importance of undertaking audit and review work on the SDGs through four different approaches, which are defined in INTOSAI’s Strategic Plan 2017-2022: assessing the preparedness of national governments to implement, monitor, and report on SDG progress; undertaking performance audits that examine the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of key government programs that contribute to specific SDG aspects; assessing and supporting, as appropriate, the implementation of SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and being models of transparency and accountability in SAIs’ own operations, including auditing and reporting.

Canada is expected to issue a full review of its preparedness to achieve the SDGs in April 2018.

The Center, expected to open during the first half of 2018, will work to accelerate implementation of the SDGs in Côte D’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – also known as the Mano River Union countries – which requested the establishment of the West African SDGC/A.

African leaders established the SDGC/A in July 2016 to support SDG implementation in line with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The SDGC/A is based in Kigali, Rwanda, and works to create partnerships across the SDGs to ensure their effective implementation across Africa. The West African SDGC/A Sub-regional Center will contribute to the Center’s overall goal of accelerating SDG implementation across Africa, with a focus on members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

The West African SDGC/A Sub-regional Center will focus on strengthening the capacity of the Mano River Union countries to achieve the SDGs, including by providing support for coordinating SDG activities. For example, the Center plans to establish a program to map agricultural policies and interventions in support of SDG 2 (zero hunger).

In remarks before the signing ceremony, Liberia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Marjon V. Kamara welcomed the Center’s establishment, emphasizing that the “SDGs embody the aspirations and wishes of the African people and of the developing world.” He said the Center will help to maintain momentum to achieve the SDGs in Liberia and in the region.

He also provided details on a system-wide strategy for gender equality.

The briefing for UN Member States took place on 16 January 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Opening the briefing, the Secretary-General noted that since he took office in January 2017, several global challenges have intensified: conflicts have deepened and new dangers have emerged; global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at their highest since the Cold War; climate change is moving faster than governments are moving to take action; inequalities are growing; horrific violations of human rights are happening; and nationalism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise.

Guterres highlighted 12 areas of concern where priority action is needed, alongside the empowerment of women everywhere, which he said is a cross-cutting imperative. The 12 areas are:

Promoting a real “new deal” for an equitable globalization, whose benefits are shared with everyone: the Secretary-General urged Member States to respect their financial commitments and to set in place stronger mechanisms that address fiscal evasion and illicit financial flows (IFFs);

Noting that in 2016, for the first time in the last three years, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased and the past five years have been the warmest in history, the Secretary-General called for stepping up climate action and announced that he will hold a climate summit in 2019 to increase momentum;

Taking advantage of global mobility through the adoption of the first Global Compact on Migration;

Taking advantage of advances in technology, while protecting societies from its risks: Guterres noted that the UN will serve as a platform for Member States to come together with the private sector, the scientific community and academia to discuss on how to use the potential and address the risks;

Achieving the peaceful de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;

Deescalating tensions in the Middle East;

Strengthening the UN’s partnership with the African Union (AU);

Pushing back the dangerous tide of nationalism in Europe, and revitalizing mediation initiatives – including the Normandy Format and Trilateral Contact Group on Eastern Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh, the Geneva International Discussions related to Georgia, and the “5+2” process on Transnistria;

Maintaining a strong focus on counter-terrorism: Guterres announced the convening in June 2017 of a Summit of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies to advance multilateral cooperation;

Strengthening UN peace operations: the Secretary-General noted that a detailed plan of action for that purpose is being prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and said that, in February 2018, he will present his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace;

Reversing the large-scale exodus of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, for which the full implementation of the Rakhine Advisory Commission recommendations is vital; and

Overcoming the “false contradiction” between human rights and national sovereignty: Guterres mentioned that the UN stands ready to support states in building their capacities to uphold the rule of law, promote respect for human rights, and eliminate all forms of discrimination.

The Secretary-General noted that his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace to be presented in February will contain “very strong” proposals on strengthening the Peacebuilding Fund. He observed that the AU needs strong support and clear mandates from the UN, and announced that the UN and the AU will sign a framework of agreement on development, aligning the 2030 Agenda and Africa 2063, during the AU Summit taking place at the end of January 2018.

On gender equality, Guterres said his approach rests on three pillars. The first pillar is empowering women and girls. To that end, he noted the September 2017 launch of his roadmap for achieving gender parity at all UN levels, and announced that in 2018 the UN reached full parity in the 44-member UN Senior Management Group. He added that he also mandated an internal task force to review the UN’s spending on gender equality.

The second pillar of his gender equality approach, Guterres said, is preventing sexual exploitation and abuse against women. With this aim, he appointed the UN’s first-ever Victims’ Rights Advocate, who will work closely with Member States and across the UN system. He noted that 82 Member States are part of a Voluntary Compact to prevent these crimes and respond swiftly to allegations.

The third pillar on which Secretary-General’s gender equality approach rests is preventing and addressing sexual harassment. He reiterated his personal commitment to eliminating sexual harassment at the UN, adding that his zero-tolerance approach was recently reaffirmed in a joint letter with staff unions to all UN personnel. He reported that he has set up a task force, led by Jan Beagle of the Department of Management, to review UN policies and capacities to investigate, to ensure accountability, and to look at the support and protection offered to those affected. Guterres said his team is currently working on more detailed measures to simplify the procedures for reporting harassment and raise awareness of the issue throughout the UN.

The Secretary-General added that 2018 will be “a decisive year for reform,” and noted that the repositioning of the UN development system will facilitate better support for Member States in achieving the SDGs.

Countries welcomed a more in-depth definition of “sustaining peace.”

In the ensuing discussion, many countries, including Cuba, Iran and Singapore, stressed the need for the UN to defend and promote multilateralism. Brazil and Cuba noted that reform of the UN peace and security pillar will not be complete without reform of the UN Security Council. Singapore expressed hope that the Secretary-General will act as advocate for an open and fair world trade system. China called for attention to the root causes of the refugee crisis. Guatemala and El Salvador welcomed a more in-depth definition of the “sustaining peace” concept, with El Salvador adding that the concept should include human rights and be addressed under the peace and security pillar.

4,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-issues-vnr-handbook-revised-voluntary-guidelines/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"DESA Issues VNR Handbook, Revised Voluntary Guidelines","January 2018: The UN Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has issued a draft unedited version of a handbook on preparing Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). The handbook provides “basic, practical information” on the steps that countries may take when preparing a VNR, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the UN Secretary-General’s proposal of voluntary common reporting guidelines for VNRs, which were updated in December 2017, and are included in the handbook.

VNRs are part of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are presented annually by UN Member States during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). They are intended to track progress in implementing the SDGs and their targets in all countries in an open, inclusive, participatory and transparent manner.

The ‘Handbook for Preparation of Voluntary National Reviews’ includes sections on: how to initiate a review; organization and preparation of the review; multi-stakeholder participation; key building blocks for preparing the review; preparatory workshops and submission of VNRs; presentation of the VNR at the HLPF; and “after the presentation.” It also features country examples, and a VNR preparation checklist outlining actions related to: initial preparation and organization; stakeholder engagement; VNR preparation; and HLPF presentation.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should not be seen as separate from the implementation of the SDGs, but should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals. On organization and preparation of the review, the handbook notes that for most VNR countries, preparation time is very short, and therefore it is advisable to begin the process as early as possible. The handbook recommends drawing up a work plan or roadmap that covers the main deliverables and deadlines for the national preparatory process. Components of the roadmap could include: the coordination structure for the review; costs of the review and possible sources of funding; scope of the VNR; a list of bodies and agencies that will be providing data and information; key stakeholders to engage and methods of engagement; ways to access to high quality, up-to-date, and disaggregated data; and allocating time for technical editing as well as a high-level review of the VNR and its main messages.

On timeline, the handbook notes that VNR countries should submit their main messages (conclusive summary of the VNR) by 18 May 2018. The final reviews should be submitted to DESA by 18 June 2018.

The handbook states that the preparatory process for the VNRs includes global workshops based on countries’ previous experiences in participating in the VNR process. The workshops are organized by DESA, and are designed to facilitate peer learning and interaction. The handbook indicates that a first global workshop seeks to cover key components of the preparatory process, and involves current and former VNR countries. A second global workshop facilitates the sharing of experiences among VNR countries, including lessons learned and challenges encountered. A third global workshop covers final preparatory matters, and engages countries in a discussion of anticipated follow-up to their VNRs. In preparation for the 2018 VNRs, the first workshop took place in Geneva, Switzerland, in December 2017. The second workshop is planned for early March 2018, in Dakar, Senegal, and the third and final one is scheduled for 15 July 2018, in New York, US, according to the handbook.

The handbook “goes beyond” the UN Secretary-General’s proposed guidelines, the authors note. Those voluntary common reporting guidelines, which are included in an annex to the handbook, provide a framework for the VNR reports, while allowing for flexibility. They were first issued in January 2016, as part of the UN Secretary-General’s report on ‘Critical milestones towards coherent, efficient and inclusive follow-up and review at the global level’ (A/70/684), and were updated in December 2017 based on lessons learned from the VNR experiences in 2016 and 2017. The guidelines comprise sections on: follow-up and review guiding principles; structure and content of the VNR report; and making presentations at the HLPF.

The authors of the handbook also highlight other sources may further assist countries in their preparations, such as the synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs prepared by DESA, and the Guidelines to Support Country Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (2017) prepared by the UN Development Group (UNDG).

In 2018, 48 countries will present their VNRs during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF (16-18 July).

The meeting will take place on 1 February 2018, in New York, US.

Following the adoption of UNGA resolution 68/1 titled, ‘Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 61/16 on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council,’ in 2013, ECOSOC underwent a series of reforms to strengthen the Council. By that resolution, UN Member States must review the arrangements during the 72nd UNGA session.

In their letter to UN Member States on 20 December 2017, co-facilitators Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, and Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, invite delegations to share their views on the timeline and outcome of the review process. They also pose four key questions for the informal meeting on 1 February, addressing: the approach to carry out the review in order to cover the substantive and structural aspects of resolution 68/1; ensuring that the review accounts for related processes without overburdening its focus; ways by which ECOSOC could generate effective “leadership, strategic direction and specific guidance” including through its annual main theme; and suggestions for augmenting the added value of the various interlinked functions of the ECOSOC cycle.

Resolution 68/1 outlines arrangements on ECOSOC’s functions and architecture. Among other provisions, it calls on the Council to: adopt a July-to-July cycle for its programme of work; have a strengthened issues-based approach to enhance its lead role in achieving a balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development; and base its annual programme of work on a main theme that takes into account the role of the Council in promoting sustainable development and enables the Council to promote UN system-wide coherence and coordination. The resolution also outlines arrangements for ECOSOC segments and meetings, including for its operational activities for development segment, its humanitarian affairs segment, its high-level segment, its integration segment, and its coordination and management meetings. The resolution calls on ECOSOC to: continue to strengthen and further promote implementation of the financing for development (FfD) agenda; promote the active participation of Major Groups, NGOs, other relevant stakeholders and regional organizations in the activities of the Council; further promote the integration of youth into its deliberations; and devote time to the specific needs of countries in special situations.

6,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-sanitation-economy-the-new-economy-set-to-tackle-sdg-6-2/,"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Sanitation Economy: The New Economy Set to Tackle SDG 6.2,"The news often reports the desperate lack of access to safe sanitation faced by a staggering 2.3 billion people globally. Around the world, one in three people still lacks access to a toilet, and hundreds of thousands of children die annually from diarrheal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. There is an abundance of heart wrenching stories to share.

To address this challenge, in 2015, the global community adopted a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). Target 6.2 under this Goal calls for, “by 2030, achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation.” This article discusses the untapped opportunity for the private sector to help achieve SDG target 6.2. Not only can business be a part of the solution that provides clean water and sanitation for all, but it can make a profit at the same time.

So, where do we begin? From the outset, overcoming this global issue is daunting. Where do we look for the solution, when the issue includes complex cultural nuances, societal taboos, and the general ‘yuck’ factor?

To start, the global business community and savvy entrepreneurs can take a closer look at the bottom of our toilets. Yes, it may sound unpalatable, but there is method in the madness.

The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

In its latest report, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) introduces the ‘Sanitation Economy‘ – a market that presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses. This new economy monetizes toilet provision, products and services, biological resources, health data and information, to provide benefits across business and society.

This research shows that the market could be worth US$62 billion in India alone, by conservative estimates; it could turn trillions of liters of human waste into valuable biological resources each year; and it could hold a vast reservoir of information about human health.

It is rare today to find white spaces in the economy open for business and innovation, and that address such an urgent global challenge as outlined in SDG 6.

The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies. They include: the Toilet Economy, which encompasses toilet product and service innovation that provides toilets fit for purpose for all environments and incomes; the Circular Sanitation Economy, which means toilet resources (commonly known as human waste) feed into a circular economic system that replaces traditional waste management; and finally, the Smart Sanitation Economy, which involves digitized sanitation systems that optimize data for operating efficiencies, maintenance, plus consumer use and health information insights.

The Toilet Economy

Providing basic access to a toilet and the sanitation systems that safely manage human waste is a serious issue. Access to “sanitation for all” made the least progress during the era of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that spanned from 2000 to 2015. As a result, the world is now watching, and acting, to ensure progress over the next 15 years under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.

The Government of India is leading the way with its ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Clean India Campaign’, which aims to provide universal access to all Indians in just five years (2014-2019), become open defecation-free, and build more than 100 million toilets. The campaign is making swift progress in providing access to toilets and awareness is high among citizens. China is now following in its footsteps.

It is not just national governments rising up. Citizen movements are also encouraging behavior change. In November 2016, the Global Citizen Festival was held in Mumbai, India, to put a spotlight on the need for sanitation for all. About 100,000 citizens gathered to listen to an impressive mix of celebrities, musical artists, and sanitation experts – including Coldplay, JAY-Z, and famous Bollywood stars about the importance of sanitation. In 2017, Bollywood launched ‘Toilet: A Love Story,’ a film about a woman who turns down a marriage proposal until her husband-to-be agrees to buy her a toilet. Such cultural activities help educate people about the importance of sanitation and drive behavior change alongside the creation of toilets.

The Circular Sanitation Economy

The past decade has seen business embrace sustainable development, where private sector practices address growing constraints on resources and new responsibilities for the customers and communities they serve. Leading corporations have found new market opportunities by looking at where their unique value propositions can also address unmet needs, and market failures that underpin the SDGs, where no one is left behind. The circular economy – the mining of waste and available resources to save costs and generate new revenue – is trendy among global businesses.

Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources. If what goes into our toilets has value, those interested in extracting that value will invest in ensuring that the resource is properly managed.

And there is no shortage of this resource. Approximately 7.6 billion people globally create excreta every day, to the tune of 3.8 trillion liters of resources – an amount that is growing with our population growth. These resources, when captured and mined, present very interesting biological resource use cases.

For instance, entrepreneurs and businesses are starting to monetize these resources and are creating valuable products such as nutrient-rich organic fertilizers, electricity, bio-fuel, water, and proteins. All of these products were previously, and in many cases, are still, flushed down the toilet. From manufacturing operations to municipalities, there is growing demand for these new, renewable resources and organic or biological products. They help fill food, fiber, agriculture, animal feed, consumer goods and healthcare needs.

The Smart Sanitation Economy

The future of industry is being shaped by what the World Economic Forum is calling the fourth industrial revolution – a digital economy. This is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Sanitation and toilets have a place here, too. There is a key opportunity now to apply new technologies and digitization to sanitation to create new business opportunities as future sanitation systems are developed. While the Smart Sanitation Economy is the least developed area of the Sanitation Economy to date, we believe that it could be a game changer for how we view our sanitation and toilets into the future. It can provide valuable data and insights on health, and for sanitation system operating efficiencies.

A Call to Action – Making ‘Your Business’ Business

The Sanitation Economy is the business response to a global crisis and resulting market and societal failures. With collaboration and investment on all fronts, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s toilet-related resources and data into valuable, life-saving resources and critical information.

This is our call to action to the global business community – because sanitation is every business’s business. It’s time to step up and be counted.","The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.
The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies.
Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources.

The report ranks 16 of the world’s largest publicly listed auto companies on readiness for a low carbon transition.

The companies included in the report titled, ‘Driving Disruption: Which automotive companies will seize the opportunities in a low-carbon economy?’, have a total market capitalization of US$790 billion and represent over 75% of the global passenger vehicle market. According to CDP’s ranking, BMW, Daimler and Toyota are the best performing car companies on climate-related metrics.

The authors explain that the car industry is “facing a double hit of disruption from EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous and shared driving,” with over a fifth of profits likely to shift to technology companies like Uber and Google by 2030. Over 30% of new car sales are projected to be zero emissions and plug-in hybrid by 2030, representing a potential US$1 trillion market. By 2022, EVs could become as affordable as petrol and diesel cars, making it easier for car makers to profit from a low-carbon economy. Accelerating the deployment of such vehicles is critical for reducing carbon emissions meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

CDP CEO Paul Simpson said technology and software disrupters have forced the car industry to innovate quickly to ensure their survival in the low-carbon transition. Traditional car companies are increasingly investing (over US$11 billion since 2015) in autonomous and shared vehicle companies, and setting aggressive electric and autonomous vehicle targets. For example, General Motors is working towards an ‘All Electric-future.’ However, nearly 50% of car makers risk penalties by missing their emissions targets, and in the EU, some companies will need to increase their share of EV sales by 20% in order to meet the EU’s 2021 targets.

For traditional car engines, complying with emissions regulations will increase to over US$2,200 per vehicle by 2025.

The report details a number of risks and opportunities for the car industry. For example, governance and remuneration structures must be aligned with the low carbon transition, and the cost to comply with emissions regulations for traditional car engines is expected to increase threefold by 2025 to over US$2,200 per vehicle. In addition, China is critical, says CDP, as it accounts for 29% of global passenger vehicle sales, and has set aggressive targets for new energy vehicles such as EVs beginning in 2019.

CDP leverages investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage environmental impacts, and drive companies and governments to reduce their emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. CDP has reported on the oil and gas, steel, cement, automotive, electric utilities, chemicals and mining industries in recent years.

Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

To address this issue, the UN SDG Action Campaign is encouraging people to engage in SDG implementation and monitoring, while the IAP, a global network of science agencies, has published a guide to the SDGs for its members.

Market research conducted jointly by PepsiCo, Paragon Partnerships, and the UN SDG Action Campaign found that just 5.9% of 10,000 people interviewed in the Philippines were aware of the SDGs, with this percentage falling among lower-income respondents. The survey also found that poverty, hunger and ill health were the issues of most concern to respondents, corresponding to SDGs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The majority of respondents (68.2%) believed that the situation with regard to these concerns had not changed in the past year, while about a quarter (28%) felt the situation had improved.

Commenting on the results of the Philippines survey, Dilek Ozler of Paragon Partnerships expressed hope that more country governments will choose to measure progress and promote SDG implementation. Paragon Partnerships is a network of government, research agencies, NGOs, companies and client organizations that seeks to use data to generate insights for policy making and programme development towards SDG implementation.

The UN SDG Action Campaign is an initiative of the UN Secretary-General administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

Among its activities are the MYWorld 2030 platform for data sharing and citizen engagement and the ‘World We Want’ partnership with civil society for hosting SDG-focused consultations.

Separately, the IAP, a global network of science, engineering and medicine academies, conducted a survey of its members, which likewise found limited awareness of the SDGs. The IAP has published a 20-page guide to “demystify” the structures and processes by which the SDGs are to be implemented, and to encourage scientists to apply their knowledge to the challenge of implementation. The guide titled, ‘Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guide for Merit-Based Academies,’ includes a database of peer-reviewed publications on the SDGs that academies have produced since 2014.

Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman. So we have maintained gender balance… in these processes.” [Press Conference Transcript] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Second Report of Secretary-General on UNDS Reforms] [UNGA President’s Comments at Closing Plenary of Main Part of 72nd UNGA] [All SDG Knowledge Hub Coverage of Migration Process] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on UNGA Adoption of Parts of Management Reform] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Second Report of UN Secretary-General on UN Development System Reforms]","20 December 2017: The UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) main priorities for the next several months relate to migration, sustaining peace, SDG implementation, and reform processes, according to a statement by President Miroslav Lajcak during a press conference at the end of 2017.

The authors outline approaches towards an economy that balances environmental sustainability and wealth creation.

The report titled, ‘Green Industrial Policy: Concept, Policies, Country Experiences,’ provides an overview of policy approaches and practical experiences in several countries, including Brazil, China, Germany and Morocco. The countries have different levels of income and technological capacity, but all found ways to foster jobs and create competitive advantages in new industries, while simultaneously greening their economies. The authors note the need for a stronger emphasis, however, on developing countries because of their need for growth, their high potential for transformation, and the fact that they are not yet locked into unsustainable pathways. The report calls for a diverse, cross-sector approach to restructure industrial systems, and a framework that encompasses environmental and energy policies.

Current incentives guiding how people invest, produce and consume must be redesigned to internalize environmental costs.

The report highlights the enormous costs of environmentally unsustainable practices. For example, the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health estimates welfare losses due to environmental pollution at more than US$4.6 trillion per year, or 6.2% of global GDP, while the economic cost of climate change has been estimated at more than US$1.2 trillion per year. The authors argue that current incentives guiding how people invest, produce and consume must be redesigned to ensure that environmental costs are internalized, pollution is minimized, material consumption is reduced, and inputs are reused or recycled.

The report addresses: challenges of green transformations and the ways green industrial policy must go beyond business-as-usual; economic and social co-benefits, such as improving human health and conserving resources for future growth; how environmental protection can enhance the competitive advantages of companies; and how a green transformation can create employment benefits, including by creating new jobs in the environmental goods and services sector.

It also discusses: specific policies such as those that phase out environmentally harmful industries and measures that develop environmentally sound substitutes; how to achieve the phase-in of green alternatives, which typically need to compete with established technologies; the need for environmental fiscal reforms that enhance competitiveness of clean industries; circular economy approaches to decouple production from resource consumption and pollution; and how procurement policies can be used to source greener products.

13,https://www.edie.net/library/Five-steps-to-take-the-lead-on-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals/6807,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",edie.net,SDG roundtable: Five ways to move from ambition to action,"Sustainability and corporate responsibility managers from a range of businesses across the country recently gathered in London for an exclusive roundtable hosted by edie and UL EHS Sustainability, which explored the steps required to take the lead on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

George Ogleby","So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs?
Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week.
Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action.
Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned.
Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda."

Now, imagine that area stripped entirely of its trees. This is the amount of forest area lost to the world each year. The total cost of this deforestation is immeasurable, with impacts extending far beyond the forest itself.

Once forests and trees have disappeared, so too will the integrity of the soil and water systems they supported — often permanently. Approximately 75% of all freshwater for farms, industry and homes comes from forests and wetlands. Forests also sequester more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem, and when they are destroyed, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, impacting adversely on the global climate.

Deforestation’s negative impacts for people and the environment are thus far-reaching and serious. Increased forest loss also means that, without major corrections in land use, the world will fail to meet crucial global targets, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Deforestation threatens achievement of forestry targets under the Goals, as well as SDGs on eradicating hunger and poverty, preserving health and fighting climate change — which rely heavily on the goods and services that forests provide.

To put this degree of interdependence into perspective, we need to look at SDG 15 on ‘Life on Land.’ In July, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards this Goal, which calls for, by 2020, promoting the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and substantially increasing afforestation and reforestation globally. These are highly ambitious targets. SDG 15 requires the world to ensure that through the sustainable management of forests, we also protect biodiversity; restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; and halt and reverse land degradation.

None of these measures can be achieved if forests are not at the heart of policies, development strategies, and actions that go far beyond the forest sector.

This is because many drivers of deforestation lie outside the forest sector and are rooted in wider social and economic issues, including challenges related to reducing poverty, and policies that favor land uses that produce higher and more rapid financial returns, including energy, mining, transportation, and agriculture.

Further, a growing world population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 makes it critically important to find ways to feed people while maintaining and expanding forests to meet other human needs.

This can be done.

Research published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has shown how, over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover. Food production can expand through agricultural intensification and other important policy measures. Ghana, Tunisia, and Viet Nam are just a few examples from very different countries that all show strong results when decision-makers coordinate policies across sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, land-use planning, and rights to land tenure.

Over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover.

Sharing expertise and increasing awareness is a critical part of this process. Governments at all levels must work closely with indigenous peoples, community representatives, private-sector associations, and international organizations. Corporate responsibility commitments by large companies operating in the agricultural sector are equally important. An inclusive and broad engagement can lead to a re-evaluation of the role of forests in agriculture production. Innovative technology must be shared and applied to a greater degree, international financial instruments and private-public partnerships considered, and governance issues, including tenure, reviewed.

There is no time to waste. Halting and reversing deforestation globally presents an enormous challenge and will require both political will and concerted action across all sectors at all levels. This effort may influence pivotal decisions expected this year when the HLPF takes stock of progress toward the SDGs in July. This will, in turn, influence follow-up actions by States, business, and civil-society partners at all levels. With collective action now, we can address the global challenge of deforestation, achieve our targets, and ensure that the world today, and in the future, continues to enjoy all of the goods and services that forests provide.

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra made the call in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, California, US.

Mahindra, who will co-chair the GCAS, said approximately 500 companies are expected to “step up and commit to set science-based targets” by the September summit. He commended the more than 330 companies that have already committed to align their strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through the Science Based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that helps companies determine how much they must cut emissions to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Almost 900 more companies have announced their intent to set science-based targets within the next two years in their CDP disclosures, indicating a “new normal” in the way businesses are developing future strategies, according to the We Mean Business Coalition.

Mahindra said that businesses can “future-proof growth” and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting science-based targets, which also shows governments that businesses are serious about aligning their strategies with the Paris Agreement.

This call, made during the 48th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, which convened from 23-26 January 2018, is the first of multiple ‘Summit Challenges,’ which are expected in advance of the GCAS. Such challenges aim to help deliver GHG reductions to help ensure global emissions start “trending downward” no later than 2020, as well as to help the Summit contribute to an energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth. The GCAS aims to showcase such climate action and new commitment in advance of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 24) in November 2018.

In his statement, Mahindra also sought to dispel the idea a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing profits, among other “persistent myths” about business action on climate change. He explained that initiatives to reduce emissions have generated a return, and in the last five years, his company has saved 58 million KWh of energy, which could power 15,000 homes in India. He added that climate change represents a US$6 trillion financial opportunity over the next two decades.

Also at the WEF, French President Emmanuel Macron committed to shutting down France’s coal-fired power stations by 2021.

In a blog post, UNDP Indonesia shares nine characteristics that are key to its Country Platform’s potential success.

The UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 envisions the role of Country Support Platforms as helping countries design and deliver integrated SDG solutions, with variation among platforms according to the country context. The platforms respond to increased demand for collaboration among a wider range of actors.

UNDP Indonesia presents the SDGs as “the trillion-dollar investment opportunity that they are” rather than focusing on potential funding shortfalls. According to UNDP Indonesia, 79% of Indonesians donated money in the past month, making Indonesia the second most generous country in the world. Islamic law mandates that all Muslims who are eligible donate at least 2.5% of their income or accumulated wealth to the poor and needy, a practice known as Zakat. UNDP Indonesia calculated that, if every eligible Muslim pays US$74 annually, the country could generate US$16 billion, an amount that “represents a huge potential to support the SDGs.”

The nine key characteristics of Indonesia’s Country Platform are:

A collaborative space: The Platform involves the UN, the Government of Indonesia, private sector and civil society, both in Indonesia and globally, in developing solutions to achieve the SDGs;

Focus on partnerships: UNDP Indonesia has invited a wide range of actors to participate in the Platform, including to set the agenda, provide funding, second staff and become investment partners;

Pilot and scale innovation: The Platform has tested new solutions with the aim of replicating solutions within and across countries and advises large-scale investments on inclusivity and sustainability;

A networked Platform: The Platform is composed of a horizontal network of platforms that are linked with other countries to facilitate South-South cooperation;

Focus on SDG financing: The Platform is focused on designing financing instruments, informing investments and developing and advising partners on policy and knowledge sharing, an approach aimed at responding to demand and producing results;

Maximum innovation: The Platform has “one foot inside and one foot outside the government,” a position that allows the Platform freedom to innovate and leverage change;

Capacity-building: The Platform utilizes skills like Islamic finance and private investment, SDG impact measurement, systems thinking and design and technological solutions;

Sustainable: The Platform’s business model relies on a combination of grants and service fees, with the aim of increasing fees over time; and

Integrated: UNDP serves as an integrator in the Platform by facilitating a system-wide approach to the SDGs, bringing together partners and providing a space for innovation.

The partnership between BAZNAS, the state zakat agency, and UNDP Indonesia is the first time a Zakat organization has committed to supporting the SDGs. Zainulbahar Noor, BAZNAS, said that the agency’s conversations with UNDP helped BAZNAS to realize that “when you are talking about SDGs, you are talking about zakat.” Noor said UNDP and BAZNAS are collaborating on zakat inclusion, explaining that when the agency collects zakat through branchless banking, it can use the funds to support the SDGs.

The report stresses that a change in mindset and perspective is necessary to achieve sustainable development for all. It proposes a nexus approach to overcome barriers between sectors and disciplines, and ensure sustainable natural resource management.

The report titled, ‘From Isolation to Integration: Five Years of Advancing a Nexus Approach to Environmental Resource Management,’ introduces the nexus approach to resource management, which examines the interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales. The report argues that considering these relationships can increase resource efficiency while minimizing ecological degradation and environmental risks. Conversely, the report cautions that failure to consider inter-connectedness can result in adverse impacts.

As an illustration, the report shares how a project in China mitigated soil erosion but contributed to food and water scarcity. In this context, the project achieved progress on SDG 15 (life on land) but hindered progress on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). The report argues that understanding these interlinkages can help develop strategies for achieving multiple SDGs. It provides an example of a wastewater treatment project in Mexico City that aims to address progress on SDG 2, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 6 and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The report identifies knowledge and capacity gaps in moving from isolation to integration. These gaps include the need for more rigorous research and examples to develop policy recommendations and development of independent, reliable and current data to identify linkages and analyze the effects of management strategies. The report further suggests development of guidelines for decision-makers to implement inter-ministerial and cross-ministerial collaboration and implementation. The report elaborates on ways to address each of these gaps based on UNU-FLORES’ experience.

The report’s recommendations center on research, data, tools, capacity development, networking and advocacy. Each of these focuses on ways to implement a more holistic approach to resource management. The report also provides information on UNU-FLORES’ research projects that elaborate the connections between water, soil and waste planning, management and trade-offs.

Did you know Indonesia is the second most generous country in the world, with a whopping 79 percent of people having donated funds in the last month?

Zakat, a mandatory annual donation under Islamic law, is estimated to be worth US$16 billion in Indonesia. This may seem like a huge sum, but if every eligible Muslim were to pay $74 a year, that figure can be reached. Now, just one percent of that amount is collected.

Together with domestic private investment, which accounts for almost half of all financing in the country, this represents a huge potential to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And it points to a key consideration for establishing an SDG Country Platform in Indonesia.

The UNDP Strategic Plan 2018-2021 envisions Country Support Platforms to help countries design and deliver integrated solutions on the SDGs. These Platforms respond to a greater demand for collaboration among a wider range of actors, and they will look different according to context. This is where our local knowledge comes in.

Indonesians are generous people, and there is immense potential for religious giving and private investment to support the SDGs. At the same time, funding from international development partners is falling and the Government has a budget deficit preventing the needed $353 billion in infrastructure investment. Only $23 million has been channelled towards impact investment, a potentially trillion-dollar global industry that is still in its infancy in Indonesia.

The challenge that we have set ourselves as UNDP Indonesia is how to attract these abundant resources in the country to where they are needed, that is, to support the SDGs. Our response, the Innovative Financing Lab, is a pioneering Country Support Platform to support the 2030 Agenda.

With our new focus on the SDG financing challenge, it became clear we had to work differently. We sought out partners unlike ourselves, including commercial investors, and began working in a strongly collaborative manner, where organizational boundaries are blurred. We broke down barriers between units and invested in new skillsets and profiles, including Islamic finance scholars and young people. A platform provided the solution to consolidate and scale up the multiple initiatives underway into a line of services and a lean, open way of working together.

These nine characteristics are key to our Country Platform

A collaborative space: It involves UN, Government, private sector and civil society in Indonesia and around the world to come up with better solutions for achieving the SDGs.

Partnerships are at its core: We are asking the banking sector, business, government, religious funds, philanthropists and investors, international financial institutions and civil society to get involved. Participation can include setting the agenda, providing funding, seconding staff, becoming investment partners and providing space.

It tests and scales innovation: The platform pilots new solutions that can be replicated within and across countries. It also advises large-scale investments to ensure that they are more sustainable and inclusive.

It is networked: The platform is part of a horizontal network of platforms, linked with and servicing other countries, where countries can guide each other through South-South Cooperation.

Focused on SDG financing: By focusing on financing, we are responding to a demand and are able to produce tangible results. The platform’s scope is designing financing instruments, informing investments, developing and advising on policy and knowledge sharing.

Positioned for maximum innovation: Positioning the platform with one foot inside and one foot outside the government means that it can leverage change and be free to innovate.

Capacity-building: The skills in the platform include systems-thinking and design, SDG impact measurement, private investment and Islamic finance, technological and web solutions.

Sustainable: The estimated annual cost is between $450,000 and $1 million, depending on ambition level. The business model is based on a combination of grants and fees for services, with reliance on the latter increasing over time. A pricing policy has been developed and waiver is under preparation to allow provision of services to the private sector.

Integrated: In line with the emerging principles UN reform, UNDP acts as integrator in the platform, bringing together partners and a system wide approach to SDGs, providing a space for innovation and bolstering the role of the Resident Coordinator.

Through the platform, we present the SDGs as the trillion-dollar investment opportunity that they are, rather than focusing on the funding shortfall. The appetite among partners and the momentum around this work has caught us by surprise.

“Once we started discussing with UNDP, we realized that when you are talking about SDGs you are talking about zakat,” said Zainulbahar Noor, Deputy Chairman of BAZNAS, the state zakat agency. “We are working together on zakat inclusion: when we collect zakat through branchless banking, we can use the funds for SDGs with UNDP.”

I’ll conclude with the words of Anita Nirody, UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia:

For the first time, the United Nations in Indonesia, through UNDP’s Country Support Platform/Innovative Financing Lab, has an exceptional opportunity to test new financial instruments and unlock significant resources from multiple private and religious sources to support SDG implementation. The services and knowledge generated by the Platform will have benefits for Indonesia and beyond – for other UN offices that are working on innovative and integrated solutions for the SDGs.

We are excited at the prospects for our Country Platform, which we think sits well in the context of Indonesia. We look forward to hearing from other Country Offices and learning from their experiences developing their own platforms.

Progress for Every Child in the Sustainable Development Goals Era is the first comprehensive assessment by the UNICEF of the progress made in achieving the child-related Sustainable Development Goals.

Based on current trends, it will show trajectories to 2030 for a wide range of indicators – pinpointing where faster progress is needed to realize the rights of every child to survive and thrive, learn, be protected, live in a safe environment and have a fair chance in life.

The report shows Belarus making steady achievements in many respects. For example, the country has already achieved its goals across half of the indicators which characterize the life and prosperity of children.

In addition to the indicators directly related to the realization of children's rights in the Substantial Development Goals era, the report cites the ranking of the national statistical capacity in the countries to reflect the willingness of the countries to monitor and provide reporting on all SDGs, not only those related to children. For the past five years, Belarus has been consistently among the 10% best countries (14 out of 146 countries in 2017) on this ranking compiled using the World Bank's methodology.

23,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-transparency-and-accountability-in-the-2030-agenda/,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Transparency and Accountability in the 2030 Agenda,"This week’s brief looks at a number of tools and approaches that seek to drive transparency and accountability in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Recently announced resources approach transparency and accountability through the lenses of corruption, gender equality, agriculture, and financing for sustainable development. This brief also reviews recent releases on the monitoring and review process for the SDGs.

The SDGs acknowledge that corruption can be a hindrance to sustainable development, with target 16.5 calling for the substantial reduction of the practice, as well as bribery in all forms. Transparency International’s Marie Chene writes on Medium that civil society actors and activists can monitor corruption using alternative indicators and data sources, which also chart corruption’s impacts on SDG achievement. She also highlights the role of civil society actors in increasing accountability through peer reviews of countries’ Voluntary National Review (VNR) reports, which are submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and conducting parallel reviews and shadow reports that complement—and potentially challenge—countries’ official VNRs.

Transparency International released one such country-level “shadow report” for Afghanistan. The report titled, ‘Policy, SDGs and Fighting Corruption for the People: A civil society report on Afghanistan’s Sustainable Development Goals,’ builds on a series of analyses conducted in 2017, which uses a common methodology to examine country progress towards SDG 16. Looking particularly at SDG targets 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows), 16.5 (substantially reduce corruption and bribery) and 16.10 (ensure public access to information), the report outlines how corruption negatively impacts on development through poor service provision and insecurity. It highlights Afghanistan’s progress on these thress targets, such as anti-money laundering efforts and the establishment of institutions to protect against corruption, but flags that, in practice, there is an implementation gap and low inclusion of civil society in anti-corruption legislation. A Transparency International press release is available.

Also on target 16.4, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) announced a new initiative to measure illicit financial flows in Africa during the 49th session of the UN Statistical Commission, which was held from 6-9 March on the theme, ‘Better Data, Better Lives.’ The SDG Knowledge Hub’s story on that session’s discussion of the SDG indicators is here.

Turning to gender and accountability, as covered on the SDG Knowledge Hub, the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation, in partnership with Women Deliver and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), launched the ‘Practice Guide to Auditing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Gender Equality’ on the sidelines of the 62nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 62), which is currently convening in New York. The guide reviews international commitments to gender equality and supports supreme audit institutions (SAIs) by developing an approach to ensure accountability and institutions’ meeting their commitments.

In the boardroom, BlackRock recently sent letters to 367 companies that have fewer than two female board members, asking these companies to justify the gender imbalance, Bloomberg has reported.

At the regional level and on agriculture-related SDGs, a research article in Sustainability informs the development of a “composite baseline index of the agriculture-related SDGs in Southern Africa to guide progress reporting.” The paper summarizes agriculture’s presence across the SDG framework, and uses data for eight indicators under five SDGs (1, 2, 6, 7 and 15) to develop the index for 13 southern African countries for which data on all indicators were available. The authors note that, in the face of data limitations and constraints, the results may be used to ensure accountability in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as a range of national investments and commitments prioritize agricultural developments. Further, the index can be used to track progress towards implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

On monitoring and accountability in the context of the broader 2030 Agenda, the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC) published the collaborative report titled, ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the Voluntary National Review Reports Submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017.’ The report aims to strengthen accountability by highlighting best practices in reporting, as well as gaps (notably around data). Highlights of the paper’s launch event and a detailed summary of the report by contributing author Nathalie Risse are available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A baseline of Australia’s SDG progress has been developed, with a dashboard to track 72 targets and 133 indicators.

The above knowledge products all point to the importance of transparency and data availability. These two pillars have been the focus of Australia’s approach to SDG implementation, as highlighted by Lisa Cornish on Devex. The 2018 Australian SDGs Summit was convened on 13 March 2018, in Melbourne. Previewed during the event, a baseline assessment of Australia’s progress towards the SDGs uses four methods to create a dashboard examining trends for 72 targets and 133 indicators. The document is being developed by the National Sustainable Development Council with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). With robust data and publicized findings, interested stakeholders can track the status of their priority goals, and become increasingly empowered to hold their governments accountable when progress is lacking.

On finance and accountability, Eurodad’s María José Romero writes on UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Hub that public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be less favored than standard public procurement processes if there is increased transparency about their costs. Although PPPs increasingly are used to finance development projects and can enable cross-sector collaboration, the cost of “capital, profit expectations by the private partners and transaction costs associated with the negotiation of complex PPP contracts” can detract from cost efficacy. The blog suggests that PPPs’ accounting practices can create a false narrative in governments’ balance sheets, and calls for increased transparency around PPPs and the disclosure of their long-term fiscal implications.

24,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-water-council-publishes-policy-recommendations-for-hlpf/,"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Water Council Publishes Policy Recommendations for HLPF,"21 March 2018: At the Eighth World Water Forum (WWF-8) in Brazil, the World Water Council and Korea Water Council launched a synthesis report on progress made since WWF-7. The report shows that agencies have accomplished 61% of their aims since WWF-7 took place in the Republic of Korea, and are continuing their efforts. The report also offers 14 policy recommendations to the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (HLPF) for when it convenes in July 2018 to review progress on the SDGs, including SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation.

The publication titled, ‘Synthesis Report on Implementation Roadmaps 2015-2018’ covers 16 water-related issues that the global water community previously identified as priorities in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Implementation Commitment (DGIC), an outcome of WWF-7. ‘Implementation Roadmaps’ (IRs) are intended to provide a framework for WWF partners to act on their commitments. The IRs provide continuity between each Forum, promote collaboration among partners, and contribute to global water-related processes. Between WWF-7 and WWF-8, review meetings took place in the Republic of Korea in 2016 and 2017 to monitor progress on these commitments.

The IR themes for the past three-year period since WWF-7 relate to overarching concerns of water security; water for prosperity and development; water for sustainability; and implementation mechanisms. Many of the themes identified at WWF-7 in 2015 foreshadowed specific water-related targets under the SDGs: for example, on water quality, WWF-7 participants agreed to improve water quality by 2030 by reducing pollution, minimizing the release of hazardous agro-chemicals, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and increasing recycling and safe reuse. In comparison, SDG target 6.3 is very similar, but refers to “hazardous chemicals and materials” instead of agro-chemicals, and includes a commitment to eliminate dumping. The report provides an overview of progress on each of the 16 themes identified for action.

The report’s policy recommendations for the HLPF highlight water security as a prerequisite to the achievement of all the SDGs, not only SDG 6. The authors call for increased financing to be directed towards the overall goal of water security and for financial flows to be channeled to sub-national and local governments, where appropriate, to enable a holistic approach to water management at the city level, with co-benefits in land planning, solid waste management, energy, and transport. Other recommendations reflect, inter alia, concerns for promoting complementarity between sewered and non-sewered city sanitation services, and increasing the visibility of climate-related risks in policy dialogues.

In their respective forewords to the report, Korea Water Forum President Jung-Moo Lee and WWC President Benedito Braga affirmed the work of many international, national, regional and local agencies, referred to as DGIC Champions and Core Groups, for their policy leadership and efforts in advancing progress on the various water issues. The report is published by the World Water Council in collaboration with the Korea Water Forum and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea.

25,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/co-facilitators-issue-background-paper-to-inform-ecosoc-review/,"Tue, 06 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Co-facilitators Issue Background Paper to Inform ECOSOC Review,"16 February 2018: The co-facilitators for the review of UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) reforms have issued an informal background paper as an input to future discussions. Per the paper, the ECOSOC review process offers the potential to discuss whether the Council’s current arrangements are sufficient for supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related commitments, and offers the potential to make refinements as needed.

The ECOSOC review was mandated by UNGA resolution 68/1, which calls for government to conduct a review of reforms undertaken to strengthen ECOSOC following an earlier resolution (A/RES/61/16). Alya Ahmed Al Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, serve as co-facilitators for the review process.

Titled ‘Review of General Assembly resolution 68/1,’ the informal background paper outlines “key issues” in the implementation of UNGA resolution 68/1 in the context of the 2030 Agenda. It includes sections on: strengthening ECOSOC’s common vision and strategy; pursuing substantive integration; fostering effective system-wide coherence and coordination; addressing the “development-humanitarian-peacebuilding continuum” and emergencies; bringing global attention to emerging issues; engaging stakeholders; improving working methods; and key questions for further consideration.

Some have criticized the “distinct but closely related” themes of ECOSOC and the HLPF as creating confusion.

According to the paper, some have criticized the current arrangements as creating confusion, especially regarding the “distinct but closely related” themes of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. The paper therefore notes that Member States could further discuss the current approach of selecting and using an annual main theme for ECOSOC and a separate theme for the HLPF sessions held under its auspices. It adds that the work of ECOSOC and HLPF, including agendas and schedules, could be more strongly aligned, and decided upon with sufficient time for planning, coordination and building opportunities for synergy.

On leadership and strategic direction on the 2030 Agenda, the paper notes that Member States could discuss how ECOSOC can improve the impact of its overall policy dialogue and recommendations, through its Ministerial Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the HLPF and High-level Segment, or through the agreed conclusions, decisions and resolutions resulting from the ECOSOC system’s deliberations.

On integration, the paper indicates that there are approximately 30 UN bodies with a direct reporting relationship to ECOSOC, including: eight functional commissions; five regional commissions; three standing committees; one ad hoc body; eight expert bodies; and four related bodies – and discussions could explore ways to more effectively integrate the subsidiary bodies into ECOSOC’s work. The paper also suggests a discussion on the ECOSOC Integration Segment, addressing: whether it could be better timed to more effectively feed into the HLPF and ECOSOC High-level Segment; whether it should mainly discuss areas requiring significantly strengthened integration efforts towards the 2030 Agenda; and ways by which its policy recommendations could better inform discussions at the HLPF and at the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

The paper outlines that changes to the content and structure of the Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS) could be discussed to address its “unfulfilled potential” as an accountability platform for system-wide performance on the 2030 Agenda. This could be achieved, it notes, by holding two OAS sessions per year, including one that could provide policy guidance on system-wide action at all levels, and one that could focus on strengthening the normative-operational linkages across sustainable development, humanitarian assistance and peacebuilding efforts.

On engaging stakeholders, the paper indicates that more than 4,860 NGOs are currently in active consultative status with ECOSOC, and the growing demand for inclusion remains an important aspect of the Council’s work. It suggests to consider the challenge of streamlining the rules and practices of participation of such stakeholders in ECOSOC, its forums and Functional Commissions, noting that currently, the rules and practices “vary greatly.”

The paper also observes that there is scope for further improving ECOSOC system’s working methods to ensure that the sequencing of its sessions will culminate in the global review of the 2030 Agenda at the HLPF and the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

Member States held two informal meetings on the ECOSOC review process, on 6 and 26 February 2018. Per a letter dated 16 February 2018, the co-facilitators intend to prepare a food for thought paper in advance of the next meeting, scheduled to take place on 19 March.

27,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/intergovernmental-consultations-on-un-development-system-reform-commence/,"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Intergovernmental Consultations on UN Development System Reform Commence,"8 March 2018: During the first meeting of the intergovernmental consultations on the repositioning of the UN development system, UN Member States expressed their views on the process and the outcome document of the consultations. Co-facilitators Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, provided governments with updates regarding the timeline for the process and the proposed basis for negotiations.

The “repositioning” process started with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. Since the QCPR’s adoption in December 2016, the UN Secretary-General has delivered two reports containing reform proposals, in June and December 2017, as mandated by the QCPR. The reform proposals contained in the reports were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings organized by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, from 29 January to 22 February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” that respond to questions raised by Member States during the briefings. The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during the ECOSOC Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), which was held from 27 February to 1 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US.

The co-facilitators plan to send a timeline for consultations soon, with one or two meetings per week until April and with more meetings per week in April, as the deadline approaches.

Opening the meeting on 8 March, Boukadoum said the OAS summary circulated by the ECOSOC Vice-President on 6 March serves as an input to the discussions. Petersen noted that the deadline for finalizing the consultations is mid-April, until which time the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) will also evaluate the financial implications of the agreed reform proposals. The consultations are expected to commence on 16 March. He added that the co-facilitators would send an elements paper for the zero draft on 12 March, to which delegations are invited to submit written feedback by 14 March. The co-facilitators also plan to send a timeline for consultations soon, he said, with one or two meetings per week until April and with more meetings per week in April, as the deadline approaches. Petersen further proposed that the co-facilitators remain the “penholders,” as was the case with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, rather than discussing compilations of text.

Canada, Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), the EU and Norway said many issues do not require deliberations because mandates already exist, including for the Resident Coordinator (RC) system, the system-wide document and making UN’s work more efficient and accountable. They cautioned against reopening the QCPR by renegotiating issues included in it. Rather than that, they called for a short text and a process that respects clear deadlines, adding that they trust the co-facilitators to remain the penholders. The EU, supported by the US, stated that issues pertaining to ECOSOC, such as the OAS format, should be dealt separately, in the context of the ECOSOC review process. He expressed the EU’s full support for the Secretary-General’s proposals on the RC system, UN Country Teams (UNCTs) and the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs). He also expressed support for the proposals on creating a system-wide evaluation unit, restructuring the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) and the regional approach.

Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), and Pakistan, stressed that: the process should provide sufficient time for receiving inputs from Member States; the quality of discussions should be prioritized over deadlines; and the outcome needs to be substantive. G-77/China noted that the OAS summary can only serve as “food for thought” for governments, while only Member States’ inputs should be the basis for negotiations. To that end, he said the Group will submit a position paper that will include all the elements that should be included in the zero draft, based on both the explanatory notes and the opinions expressed in the ECOSOC informal briefings. He added that the ECOSOC reform should take place after the negotiations on the UN development system conclude, in a sequential and not a parallel manner. He also required clarification on whether the funding dialogue, proposed by the Secretary-General for agreeing on the new Funding Compact, will be part of this process.

The US said the draft should be limited in scope and have no programme budget implications. He added, supported by Mexico, that the ECOSOC review should start “in earnest” and take place in parallel, not sequentially.

Paraguay for the land-locked developing countries (LLDCs) highlighted that countries in special situations need to remain a priority in this process. Nigeria for the African Group stressed that the reform needs to address Africa’s priorities and be focused on: closing the widening digital gaps; addressing the “excruciating” costs of technologies for Africa; poverty eradication; and tackling international financial flows (IFFs). He added that the reform should also address “the perennial difficulty” in financing the RC system in Africa, as well as the development-humanitarian-peace nexus, through the lens of sustaining peace.

Switzerland noted that the Secretary-General’s reform proposals identify seven key areas, while the QCPR focuses only on three of them. She said the outcome should also capture the other four areas, including a road map for the Funding Compact. She underlined that the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) reform needs to be informed by the reform of the UN development system. Mexico also said discussions should not be restricted to the QCPR. He added that the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) needs to be protected, and its resources should not be included in the package being negotiated.

The Russian Federation announced the preparation of a position paper that will be sent to the co-facilitators. He said the process should focus on quality rather than on deadlines, and the resolution should be concise and set a path for the areas that need more discussions, such as the RC system and the Funding Compact.

The Festival focused on how to put the SDGs into action through discussion on five key issues: innovation; citizen engagement; communication; mobilization; and multi-stakeholder engagement.

More than 1,500 participants from over 150 countries attended the second edition of the Global Festival, which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 21-23 March 2018. The UN SDG Action Campaign, an initiative of the UN Secretary-General that is administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), organized the event with support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the German Federal Foreign Office.

In opening remarks, the director of the SDG Action Campaign, Mitchell Toomey, described the unique character of the event, which is driven by and reliant on participants’ actions. He stressed that the Festival “is a perfect example that solutions can come from everywhere” and underscored the importance of building strong networks for action in achieving the SDGs.

The UN SDG Action Campaign, Digital Promise Global and Occulus launched the MY World 360° project, which invites youth to share their perspectives and advance positive action towards the SDGs through digital skills and “360° media.” MY World 360° will launch national pilot programs in Germany and India, with selected schools receiving 360° video production equipment from Oculus and targeted local media support and mentorship. Youth from around the world can contribute submissions.

Also at the Festival, Canon Europe launched the 2018 Young People Programme, aiming to harness the power of positive storytelling to drive change. The Programme uses the SDGs as a framework for young people to share global issues that affect their futures.

The UN SDG Action Campaign announced eight winners and 48 finalists of the first UN SDG Action Awards. The awards ceremony honored initiatives in the following categories: communicator; connector; include; innovator; mobilizer; storyteller; and visualizer. Winning initiatives are mobilizing Belgians to implement the SDGs in their daily lives, fighting corruption in Nigeria and promoting human rights education in Sri Lanka, among other actions. The ‘Unreasonable Goals’ initiative won the connector category for its work to bring together highly scalable entrepreneurial solutions with cutting-edge technologies, and match them with world class mentors to help in scaling up their efforts to achieve the SDGs. SDG Youth Morocco won the mobilizer award for educating and empowering Moroccans to achieve the 2030 Agenda through multi-stakeholder partnerships. Global Goals for Local Impact/Open Institute Kenya received the visualizer award for collecting citizen generated data from every household in Lanet Umoja, Kenya on all aspects related to the SDGs and working with community leaders to identify development gaps that need to be addressed to achieve the SDGs.

In addition to the Festival’s thematic session, the event featured the ‘SDG studio,’ a live stage with TED-style talks, interviews and discussions, interactive spaces, film screenings and a virtual reality zone. Participants had the opportunity to play ‘Go Goals!’, an SDG board game developed by the UN Regional Information Centre (UNRIC).

The water accounting reports are meant to support implementation of national development plans as well as the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6).

Water accounting seeks to capture the value of water resources to the economy. The Botswana water accounts describe water use in the years 2015-2016. The Centre for Applied Research, Botswana, is drawing attention to the policy implications of the results, including the need to improve water-use efficiency, invest in non-conventional water resources, apply the knowledge gained in implementing Botswana’s Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and development plans, and ensure stakeholder participation.

In a journal article titled, ‘Economic Accounting of Water: The Botswana Experience,’ published in ‘Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C,’ the authors highlight that, while public attention focuses mostly on water service providers, self-providers such as mines and the agricultural sector account for more than half of total water abstracted from the environment. They call for greater attention to the role of self-providers in IWRM implementation.

The Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) partnership, led by the World Bank, provided initial training and support for producing water accounts in Botswana. WAVES, which promotes the mainstreaming of natural resources in national economy accounts and development planning, has been working with countries since 2013 to develop approaches to ecosystem accounting based on the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). It has pilot sites in India, Peru, and the Philippines. The UN Statistical Commission recognizes SEEA as the international standard for environmental-economic accounting. Subsystems of SEEA focus on specific sectors, including energy, water, fisheries, agriculture, and land and ecosystems.

Monitoring of SDG 6.5 on IWRM and SDG 6.6 on protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems requires information on use of water resources and abstractions from the environment.

The ninth meeting of the negotiating committee of the regional agreement on access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in LAC convened in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 28 February to 4 March 2018, to conclude negotiations of the agreement, which enshrines the protection of human rights defenders in environmental matters.

During the closing ceremony, Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís said the agreement will help fight crime, poverty, inequality and hate, and is crucial “for the very survival of our species.” He pointed to “environmental democracy” as a new legal term that implies the participation of all in protecting the environment.

Alicia Bárcena, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said the agreement ensures the right of people to participate in decisions that affect their lives and surroundings. She explained that the “second-generation accord” links the environment to human rights and rights of access, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

During the meeting, signatory countries invited all LAC countries to sign and ratify the agreement as soon as possible. The agreement will be open to the signature of the 33 LAC countries at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from September 27, 2018 to September 26, 2020. The agreement establishes the creation of a Conference of the Parties (COP), which ECLAC, serving as technical secretariat of the agreement, will convene no later than one year after the agreement enters into force and which will hold ordinary meetings at regular intervals, in accordance with what the Conference decides.

Speaking during the meeting, Miguel Ángel González, Chile, stressed that any decision made by an authority overseeing environmental matters must include a participatory analysis of what that decision means on the ground and for the populations involved. UNEP LAC Office Director Leo Heileman said the agreement provides the opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level.

Also during the meeting, ECLAC released the publication, ‘Access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean: Towards achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ which reviews the laws and institutional frameworks that safeguard the rights of access to information, participation and access to justice in environmental matters in the 33 LAC countries. The publication draws on material compiled by the Observatory on Principle 10 in LAC, which analyzes legislation, policies, jurisprudence and treaties that guarantee the rights enshrined in Principle 10. The updated version of the publication, which was first published in 2013, reflects recent developments and the traction they have gained in the LAC region, and includes new examples of good practices and emerging issues.

Despite every nation on earth voting to adopt the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals less than three years ago, one early adopter wants more UN support.

“I don’t see a campaign. I see a cacophony of things coming out of the UN,” said Dow Chemical chief sustainability officer Neil Hawkins, an early adopter of the SDGs who implores the UN to use change-management practices to drive rapid action among governments globally.

“I think the UN needs to be in there with them,” said Hawkins of the partnerships between NGOs, government and business necessary to address what he called the “big hairy problems” addressed in the 17 SDGs, adopted by the 193 members of the UN in 2015.

The $20 billion Midland, Michigan, chemicals giant, which became the world’s largest material sciences company after acquiring DuPont, has used the SDGs to drive collaboration on issues impossible to tackle as a single company, said Hawkins, referencing clean water prototypes that need to scale to make significant impact. He made the comments at Globe Forum, a sustainability conference in Vancouver.

Beyond driving partnerships, Dow’s most tangible use of the SDGs involves storytelling, said Hawkins.

“It puts a context around your research programs and your product offerings,” he said, adding that investors, senior leadership, the board of directors and employees are key audiences benefitting from seeing issues like light-weighting of vehicles and food preservation technology through the SDG framework.

For the Vancouver-based mining company Goldcorp, the SDGs allowed EVP Brent Bergeron to ask whether the human aspects of their operations were being considered as much as the environmental. Using the Global Goals as a lens allows the gold producer to emphasize positive impacts to communities where they mine, such as access to employment, upgraded regional infrastructure, and the royalties and taxes paid to municipalities.

With sustainability is now being stressed at all levels of management, including local mine general managers whose bonus compensation is tied to ESG, Goldcorp has benefitted from a faster pace of innovation, including work on mining technology that does not require water, and an all-electric mine that does not rely on diesel engines.

“The pressure to conserve water is going up, not down,” said Bergeron, adding a benefit to the innovation is delivering water savings well ahead of regulators requiring action.

Acting ahead of regulators, with the SDGs as guide, is also being seen in the gaming industry, says Gwen Migita, social impact & inclusion vice president, chief sustainability officer, Caesars Entertainment.

While the Las Vegas-based company has built context-based goals into its business planning for years, including Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, much of the current SDG work involves the social aspects of operating in a region that hosts 40 million tourists annually.

A coalition that includes competitors and nonprofits is tackling human trafficking, homeless youth, healthcare for first-generation immigrants, long-term mental health care and other issues seemingly far afield from running casinos.

“It's not just about doing the right thing,” said Migita, who sees benefits to the business including a better pipeline of recruits to work for Caesars’ 14 brands and 400 operations, some of which are in states far more conservative than Nevada and more likely to enact regulations if industry does not act first.

The Responsible Tax Principles were developed in collaboration with leading companies, civil society organizations, institutional investors and international institutions.

The B Team is a global nonprofit initiative co-founded by Sir Richard Branson, Derek Handley and Jochen Zeitz. It brings together a group of global leaders from business, civil society and government to “catalyze a better way of doing business that prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet.” The Principles delineated in the report titled, ‘A New Bar for Responsible Tax,’ offer a framework of good tax practice, including in the areas of tax management strategy, interactions with authorities, and reporting. The Principles have been endorsed by businesses including Allianz, BHP, A.P. Moller – Maersk, Natura Cosméticos, Repsol, Safaricom, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Unilever and Vodafone Group Plc.

The seven Principles proposed by The B Team are:

Make boards accountable for tax policy; Comply with the tax legislation of the countries in which you operate and pay the right amount of tax at the right time, in the countries where you create value; Be transparent about the entities you own around the world and why; Develop cooperative relationships with tax authorities, based on mutual respect, transparency and trust, including by not bribing or inducing tax officials, government officials or ministers with the aim of obtaining more beneficial outcomes with respect to tax matters; Seek and accept tax incentives only where they are aligned with real business, and in the manner intended, and give governments data on impact “where appropriate”; Engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation and administration; and Provide regular information to stakeholders, including investors, policy makers, employees, civil society and the general public, about your approach to tax and taxes paid.

Welcoming the launch of the Principles, Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International, said they have “raised the bar” on what constitutes responsible corporate tax behavior by setting a new standard for companies that claim to operate ethically. She invited all companies to meet these standards, adding that “truly forward-looking” companies should do even more.

Alex Cobham of Tax Network Justice, however, writes that the Principles “lack any hard criteria against which to evaluate progress.” Given the range of existing standards and proposals that do have such criteria, he writes that this makes the “new bar” proposed by The Responsible Tax Principles a lower bar. For example, on Principle 2, Cobham notes that the agreed G20/ OECD position of aligning declared profits with “real economic activity” rather than with “value creation” represents a clearer equivalent and it is thus stronger. On Principle 7, he suggests that other sets of principles, such as the OECD standard, allows for the comparisons needed to judge progress.

The B Team tax principles were launched ahead of the first global conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, which took place on the theme ‘Taxation and the SDGs,’ from 14-16 February 2018. The Platform is a joint initiative by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD, UN and the World Bank Group, and it is designed to foster cooperation and build consensus around responsible tax practice.

Oommen C. Kurian

The world’s progress in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends to a large extent on India’s progress. India plays a strong leadership role at the global level around meeting these targets set by the international community in 2015. In July 2017, India reiterated its commitment to meeting the SDGs when it submitted a Voluntary National Review report on seven goals including poverty, health, hunger and nutrition, as well as gender equality at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

Despite progress in recent years, India continues to be hobbled by high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Disease, malnutrition and preventable loss of life pose a huge economic challenge and are a drain on the nation’s human resources. Indian policy documents have started acknowledging this lately. For one, the Economic Survey 2016 by the Ministry of Finance acknowledged that while there are intrinsic reasons to invest in maternal and early-life nutrition programmes, they are particularly important for their high returns on investment. These programmes contribute to early physical and cognitive development that significantly influence the success of subsequent interventions—schooling and training— and outcomes in adulthood. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent months has used various platforms to emphasise the importance of “development for all” and “development of all”. The prime minister recognises that a country aspiring to reach double-digit economic growth rates—and sustain them—must focus on health and nutrition policy, which are the mainstays of a productive workforce. This thinking is amply reflected in the ambitious Ayushman Bharat initiative as well as the National Nutrition Mission.

The SDGs are fundamentally interdependent goals and as such, action is required across various sectors in order to achieve them. Further, several of the goals and their collective externalities have the potential of contributing to India’s economic growth. For India to realise its growth potential, it is crucial to address the building blocks of better health, enhanced nutrition, women’s empowerment, and digital financial inclusion—all of which have the power to unlock the demographic dividend. In this context, the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) explored the various issues related to the implementation of the SDGs in India through a high-level conference on 30 August 2017. This volume builds on the themes discussed at the conference. India’s performance on the SDGs is critical for the world to achieve the goals. Is there an “India model” that can offer lessons to the world? For that, India must deliver on the SDGs in an equitable manner and ensure development for all citizens. India needs to move forward on this agenda by working on the SDGs in an integrated manner.

Meeting health goals has implications on India realising its demographic dividend and its growth potential. Indeed, India stands to lose some US$4.58 trillion every year due to productivity losses related to NCDs and mental illness, among other health problems. Every year, more than 60 lakh people are being pushed below the poverty line by prohibitive health expenses. Public expenditure on health is only 1.4 percent of GDP, and although India’s total health expenditure stands at 4.7 percent of GDP (around INR 5 trillion) – much of it is out-of-pocket expenditure. Similarly, while 20-30 percent of healthcare is sought through the public sector, almost 70 percent of care is sought in the private sector.

The public-private mix of financing and service provision for health in India raises the question: Do solutions also need to be hybrid? The SDGs bring with them the challenge of finding a comprehensive approach – the goals are intrinsically linked, they focus on multi-sectoral action, and they emphasise equity. Can India respond to this challenge by leveraging the entire health system – involving both the public and private sectors –to deliver on national goals?

India’s high economic growth and increasing food production have failed to transform the nutritional status of its population. Malnutrition, in turn, has a deep impact on cognitive development in children. It is estimated that in India, every US$1 invested in nutrition has a return of $36 (or three times more than the global average). Both academic research and India’s experience on the ground show that to address malnutrition, a multi-sectoral approach is required. This translates to prioritising action across poverty alleviation, education, gender empowerment, agriculture, and sanitation. Joint planning to make programmes nutrition-sensitive is key to addressing malnutrition, along with independent implementation and joint monitoring. How can a multi-sectoral approach help solve India’s complex challenges?

Lack of data often hinders effective evaluation of health schemes and reduces the scope for mid-course correction. There is a need to strengthen the national statistical system to allow for goals to be tracked at disaggregated levels. Technology must be harnessed to streamline processes, and there should be an integrated system which allows for analyses to be run across different data sets. Experience of data-use by stakeholders needs to be discussed to identify systemic constraints that hamper evidence-based decisionmaking in the country’s health sector.

Finally, an integrated set of solutions is needed to address complex issues challenging the economy and society. Ensuring progress on gender, health, and nutrition will be key to driving India’s economic growth and development. While India has focused on a set of reforms, those in the area of human development have not received adequate attention. These reforms are critical to India’s growth. India should acknowledge the strong linkages between national goals and act in an integrated manner, leveraging national initiatives like ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ and ‘JAM trinity’ (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) to improve development outcomes.

India for the World; India for India

Shalini Rudra

Solutions to development challenges in a nation with 1.3 billion people should be more than just scalable replications of venerable remedies offered by the wealthy nations. This was the scope of the conference, “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, held in Delhi in August 2017 and attended by stakeholders from government, academia, and development organisations.

The conference was one in a series of events that are being organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to ponder issues related to the implementation of the SDGs framework in India. The theme of the event was linking the SDGs to India’s growth agenda. The discussion was framed around the criticality of such frameworks in offering solutions to reconcile sustainability with equitable development, focusing on health and allied sectors.

Mr Sunjoy Joshi, ORF Chairman, in his welcome address said that the SDG framework was a robust and comprehensive development objective that represents India’s aspirations. The SDG goals, Mr Joshi said, should remain at the core of responsible policy-making being embraced by India to attain the country’s economic and social goals.

The health-nutrition-sanitation triad of well-being holds the key to a nation’s social, political and economic advancement. Contrasting realities across India—of excellent performance in some attributes and massive failure in others—projects India as a hub of innovating resilient policies that juxtaposes contrasts. For instance—on one hand, India’s economic aid diplomacy has made an impact across Africa and Asia, while on the other, it is home to almost a quarter (195 million) of the world’s undernourished. Even as India steadily gains ground as a global power, it is yet to complete its own domestic transformation and address its fundamental developmental challenges.

Investing in health, nutrition and sanitation, mandated under the SDGs framework, also gives the Asian economies scope to harness the strengths of the largest cohort of the young. By spearheading policies to reap the benefits of a healthy demographic dividend, developing economies like India and China have the potential to make the present century, truly the “Asian century”.

To push the SDGs agenda, the key highlights of policies and programmes in India should be on developing a robust institutional framework supported by the right kind of combinations of skills and financial resources. Second, India needs to find solutions by employing data-driven analytics and monitoring solutions to strategise course correction. Thus, work on the 2030 agenda should begin with an acknowledgement of the interdependence and links between goals, with all complexities intertwined. While developing solutions to mitigate the development challenges, countries like India have had success stories that are worth looking at. Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in India, observed that India has on various occasions exhibited a business model that can be replicated. He referred to the successful implementation of the JAM trinity—Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile penetration—as well as Indian leadership in generic drugs manufacturing and production and distribution of low-cost LED bulbs.

These schemes have defied problems linked to scalability by channeling the least-cost and most innovative methods, and maximising the involvement of government to co-produce sustainable development. India, being the largest functioning democracy with immense scope of industrial growth, can mobilise its strengths to conceptualise participation in an industrial revolution of smart manufacturing. Discussing the cornerstone position of the democratic system, Mr Afanasiev emphasised how due processes in a democratic setup like India work out solutions to problems with a certain degree of sustainability and efficiency. Thus, instead of simply emulating established successful models from elsewhere, India must build on its people’s strengths of innovation and creativity—and call it ‘jugaad’ with a positive spin.

In his address, Dr David Wilson of the World Bank highlighted aspects related to human development in India. He noted that while India is ranked by the World Bank as the world’s third-largest economy by purchasing power, in the World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index, India stands 105th out of 130 countries—behind all the BRICS countries and Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Another paradox is that India has the largest number of tertiary graduates in the world while being home to the largest number of the world’s illiterates. India ranks a low 116th of 157 countries on the SDG Index and given its population share, India has an uphill task ahead to achieve urgent improvements in education, employment and health. In fact, child health and nutrition is of fundamental concern because of its long-term impact on individual well-being and the economy. India has the ability to identify developmental concerns and the capacity to arrive at policy solutions. The case of successful HIV/AIDS prevention programmes through vast community engagement and effective surveillance is an important example of India’s organisational ability and programme management. Here, management and administration of national and state-level AIDS Control Society has played a major role.

Policy-making in India is effective because it builds on existing strengths and works around the weaknesses of institutions and models. Similarly, India formed major national and international partnerships with developmental agencies (such as BMGF, USAID, DfID, and the World Bank) for programme support, technical inputs and capacity building.

To achieve the SDGs, India must display an urgency and adopt a similar model that harnesses the skills at the national, state and local levels. India should expand its focus beyond conventional public-health strategies and devise alternatives that are based on community engagement, accountability, and the recognition of rights. Social and economic inclusion are also necessary to achieve greater impact from various technical public-health solutions. With advances in science and technology, policymakers and programme managers can make use of Big Data, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and other technologies for efficient targeting and delivery of various services.

Communication and outreach have also improved tremendously and should be used effectively in programme design. The eradication of Tuberculosis, for example, is an area where direct benefits of such technological coordination and community engagement can make an immediate impact. The Government of India has allocated an increased share of budget towards TB eradication. However, the constant search for a cost-effective model of healthcare delivery is critical, as sometimes, different solutions are required for varied problems.

Overall, it is important that India continues its focus on development innovations and programme implementation based on dynamic partnerships between government, the private sector, civil society and communities. Further, promotion of citizen engagement, accountability, and rights can further accelerate the approach toward the SDGs. India should embark upon achieving Agenda 2030 with an approach that market failure in the delivery of social goods and services such as health and education is a problem everywhere. But collaborations with the private sector for ideas, delivery expertise, finance, can be leveraged to the advantage of the public sector to boost the human capital agenda underlying the SDGs.

The UHC Trajectory: Ensuring Quality Health Services and Financial Protection to All

Priyanka Shah

Goal three of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires all countries to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. This entails access to quality essential health care services; access to safe, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines; as well as financial risk protection for all at all ages. UHC could, therefore, be regarded as an umbrella goal for health in the new development agenda. The importance of this particular target cannot be overemphasised – it not only transcends all other health-related targets but also draws linkages with the rest of the development goals. The achievement of UHC is critical to the success of the overarching vision of the SDGs, which is “to leave no one behind”. Given the population size and health burden of India, one can also posit that the global accomplishment of the SDGs is contingent on India’s success.

While healthcare in India has witnessed considerable progress over the past decade, the pace of improvement has been slow and the country continues to be plagued by multiple challenges. A Lancet study published in 2017 ranks India 127th in terms of meeting the United Nations health-related SDGs – the lowest among its BRICS peers (Figure 1). It is clear, therefore, that India’s fast economic growth has failed so far to translate to significant progress in the health sector. To ensure sustained growth levels, the country requires a strong and healthy workforce – this is possible only when citizens are protected against health-related financial risks and can access quality health services. If India is serious about goal three—as it should be, given that health is a building block for the country’s growth and development—it needs to address the various obstacles to the accomplishment of UHC.

Figure 1: Performance on the Health-related SDG index among BRICS countries

First, it is imperative to look at UHC through a gender lens. This does not mean a discussion on women’s health alone, but an approach to UHC that is inclusive in nature and attends to the needs of men and women. What is needed is a shift in narrative: to recognise that the onus of a woman and child’s health does not fall on women alone but on the entire society. Addressing such issues requires going beyond health and delving into challenges that arise from societal attitudes, and gender discrimination when it comes to nutrition, education and sanitation. Given the patriarchal nature of Indian society, gender equity in health would need approaches that are much more women-centric and supportive of their multiple roles. These social determinants and root causes should be recognised while framing policies to extend UHC in the country.

Next, achieving UHC requires long-term, high-level political commitment. This, unfortunately, has been absent in the Indian context. At a macro level, the government spends a measly proportion (1.18 percent) of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health – among the lowest globally. The long-awaited National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 proposed to increase public health spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025. This is disappointing, to say the least, given that eight years from now India intends to continue spending well below the current world average of 5.99 percent. Together with low public sector investments in health, the system also suffers from poor coordination caused by the presence of a vast number of vertical health programmes (many of which deal with similar issues) and several institutions within the health department that must work together if they are to deliver anything worthwhile. This often leads to bureaucratic apathy and inertia, which tends to slow down delivery of healthcare services and hampers the smooth functioning of the healthcare system.

Finally, given that the private sector is the largest provider of healthcare services in the country, it would be impossible to achieve the 2030 goals without its active involvement. The government, however, should keep the lead as no country has built a successful health system devoid of a central authority. The challenge is in defining the role that the government wants the private sector to play in the provision of healthcare and how it can ensure that funds are spent efficiently. One way to do this would be through price control, as already done with stents. This is an effective tool to extend quality health services at affordable prices. Other such mechanisms need to be explored and implemented to maintain a balanced participation from the private sector.

Way Forward

While it may be tempting to follow the path that other countries have embarked upon to achieve UHC, it is important to remember that India has its own unique challenges and therefore requires context-specific solutions. Within the country, too, certain states are performing exceptionally and so rather than looking outside for lessons, India should look inwards and take lessons from the successes and failures of its own states.

Central to the UHC theme are access, affordability and quality. Given the crucial role of the private sector in the healthcare delivery system, India needs to begin seriously finding an ideal mix of public-private investments. It would also help to clearly define and distinguish the purview of public and private sectors within the health system. The government should leverage private sector resources to fill in the healthcare delivery gaps. Resource allocation is a critical decision that also needs to be taken. Speaking at a high-level consultation organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr. C.K. Mishra, Health Secretary, stated that majority of resources should be directed towards “primary healthcare, to preventive and promotive health. It does not make sense to go on increasing hospital beds and simultaneously go on increasing the number of patients in the country. Therefore, all policies must converge on getting investment into primary healthcare”. In fact, the NHP released this year calls for two-thirds of health resources to flow into the primary health sector.

Should investments flow from public or private sectors, and how much? Where should resources be allocated? How can underlying socio-economic issues causing gender inequities be addressed? How can government accountability and transparency be maintained to ensure political commitment for UHC? Often, asking the right questions is the key to finding solutions. In order to redesign the Indian healthcare system so as to make it conducive to UHC, India needs to first recognise its failures. Perhaps it is time for a dose of realism – identifying gaps and flaws will only help find viable solutions and lead to informed policy-making.

Addressing Malnutrition through a Multi-Sectoral Approach: The Unfinished Agenda and Emerging Challenges

Malancha Chakrabarty

India has won significant battles against malnutrition. Unlike a few decades ago, instances of severe malnutrition such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are now rare. Latest figures from the National Family Health Survey revealed that there has been a ten percentage-point decline in stunting from about 48 percent in 2005-06 to 38.4 percent in 2015-16. However, national figures mask regional variations. On the one hand, there are states like Kerala and Goa which have a low burden of undernutrition. On the other hand, there are states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh which have a high incidence of undernutrition. Within the states, there is also considerable variation. For example, despite Odisha having stunting levels of 34.1 percent (also known as ‘high prevalence’) certain districts such as Cuttack (15.3 percent) and Puri (16.1 percent) are among the top 10 ‘low stunting level’ districts in the country. Similarly, in Karnataka, districts like Mandya have stunting rates as low as 18.6 percent while others such as Koppal have levels as high as 55.8 percent. Overall, however, India’s record in addressing undernutrition has been much poorer when compared to other countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Thus, the war against undernutrition is hardly over and meeting the World Health Assembly targets will be an uphill task for India. Moreover, the problem of undernutrition in India coexists with the problem of overweight and obesity and associated non-communicable diseases for a small, affluent section of the population.

The panellists at the ORF-BMGF conference agreed that India has a plethora of policies that address almost all aspects of the undernutrition problem but the implementation of those policies has been uneven. According to Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, the fundamental flaw in India’s approach has been its “food-centric” understanding of undernutrition. The discourse on undernutrition has largely ignored the social determinants of undernutrition; in particular, the role of women has been underappreciated. Gains in nutrition will be much faster with a more “woman-centric” approach towards tackling undernutrition because it is not food but birth which determines whether a child will be stunted or not. In Menon’s words, “the biggest risk factor for being stunted is who you are born to”. A highly significant burden of stunting is borne by the fact that children in India are born to mothers who are also stunted, uneducated, and not empowered enough to take care of their children. According to Menon, women-centric factors account for a bulk of the difference between high and low stunting rates in India’s states. Therefore, nutrition policies must try to address the key determinants of undernutrition such as women’s body mass index, women’s education, early marriage, and access to ante-natal care.

The panel observed that a multi-sectoral approach towards addressing nutrition is the need of the hour because nutrition does not belong to a single ministry. In fact, narrow departmentalism has been a critical constraint in the case of India. Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development stressed that a whole range of initiatives, better sanitation, clean drinking water, and trained rural medical practitioners, were required to achieve better nutrition in rural areas. Nutrition outcomes tend to be better in areas where public investments have also been made in primary education and health centres, along with nutrition interventions. He gave the example of China where there was a dramatic reduction in child undernutrition and infant mortality during the period 1949-1979—a number of initiatives were behind such success. First, the green tea kettle in school enforced the habit of making children drink boiled water. Public health facilities were improved through immunisation against diseases and training of traditional doctors. Lessons must also be learnt from better-performing states and districts of India. Sinha also underscored the role that communities play in improving the nutritional status of the population by highlighting the successes of women’s self-help groups in states such as Tamil Nadu.

Saumya Swaminathan, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research, emphasised the need for dietary diversity and absorption of nutrients, as over half of the Indian population is deficient in micronutrients. This is mainly because of a cereal-based diet. Carbohydrates account for over 80 percent of the diet along with small portions of fat. The bulk of the population is completely deficient in proteins and micronutrients. However, fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals are beyond the reach of most of the people in India who are poor. Access to a healthy diet that is rich in essential nutrients is necessary but not sufficient for better nutrition if the body is not able to absorb the nutrients. Often, young children, even from high-income households, get colonised by infections due to exposure to contaminated air and water.

The panel made the following recommendations. First, nutrition policies must take into account the role of social factors, particularly gender inequality. It will be next to impossible to address the challenge of undernutrition without addressing the key issues of early marriage, lack of control over child birth, and poor health of mothers. Most interventions must be targeted to two age groups: children between 0-1,000 days and adolescent girls. This is so because the first 1,000 days are crucial for the baby. Undernutrition during this period can have profound implications on the development of the child into a healthy adult. Similarly, it is important to target adolescent girls because they are likely to be the future mothers. Second, to address the issue of diabetes and micronutrient-deficiency, it is important to invest in improving nutrition literacy in India. Third, the basket under the public distribution system must be widened to include pulses, and processed fruits and vegetables to ensure dietary diversity. Last, linking agriculture to nutrition is critical. Farmers must be encouraged to produce nutritious crops and vegetable not only for the market but also for household consumption.



Equity through Accountability in the Health Sector: Towards UHC in India

Oommen C Kurian

Multi-sectoral convergence and integrated solutions considering regional specificities are needed in the health sector. To facilitate effective implementation in a situation of wide district-level disparities even within states, a performance-based categorisation of districts similar to what Karnataka has tried will be immensely useful. Availability and use of regular, good quality health data thus becomes a policy imperative. “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, the panel discussion organised in August 2017 by ORF and BMGF, explored issues of data in health and nutrition towards the SDGs.

Better data is needed for making a robust case for more state intervention in sectors like health and nutrition, and for harnessing the strengths of the well-entrenched private sector to achieve public health goals. In May 2016, the Health Secretaries of the States and Union Territories of India gathered in the capital and issued “The Delhi Commitment on Sustainable Development Goals for Health”. Among other measures, the document called for greater investments in health data collection, analysis and research. Given that the success of global SDGs over the next 15 years will largely depend on India’s performance, it is important to measure progress closely and ensure mid-course corrections when needed.

Real-time data flow will also have a major role to play in breaking the thick wall of suspicion that exists between the private and the public health sectors in India, given the inevitability of private sector engagement. After all, 70 percent of the population depends on the private sector for care. Data flow in itself can be a confidence building measure. High-quality data will be essential to ensure that the country’s health programmes hurdle the last mile. Huge unused bed strength in the private sector and long waiting lines in the public sector co-exist in India in secondary and tertiary healthcare, and a robust information infrastructure is a necessary condition for any solution that reconciles issues of financial and physical access using government’s bargaining power.

India has covered some ground in terms of streamlining its public-sector health information infrastructure. At present, as Graph 1 shows, 676 out of the 700 Indian districts regularly report public facility-level data to the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). Ninety-seven percent of Sub Centres, 94 percent of Primary Health Centres, and 85 percent of Community Health Centres submit regular health data. The quality of the HMIS data has improved over time, and some important information on improvements in equitable distribution of health infrastructure has become available.

Graph 1: HMIS Data Reporting from Public Hospitals: All India.

Over the last decade, a 65-percent increase in public health infrastructure in Adivasi areas was recorded, compared to the much lower 10-percent increase in non-Adivasi areas. Similarly, the gap in human resource availability in the public sector between Adivasi and non-Adivasi areas has come down in the last ten years from 21 percent to three percent. It is also known that immunisation coverage is improving rapidly for Adivasi areas in states like Odisha and Chhattisgarh, at a much higher rate than the respective state averages. Gender gap in under-5 mortality rate too, is narrowing down, noted Mr Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary & Mission Director, NHM, during the ORF-BMGF event.

The National Health Mission (NHM) is using data from diverse sources including HMIS to zero down on geographies and populations that need more attention, and high-priority districts thus identified within Empowered Action Group (EAG) states already receive per capita 1.3 times more funds than other districts. Quality and reliability of the HMIS data still remains a problem despite improvements; and on some parameters, the difference between HMIS estimate and a third-party survey estimate can be reportedly as wide as 50 percent. Underutilisation of other existing datasets like National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys remain a concern too.

India has not fully tapped into the potential that Information Technology (IT) offers to integrate the health information systems in the country. Notification of EHR standards was done to facilitate interoperability. The NHP 2017 has suggested that a national digital health authority will be responsible for developing common standards, notifying them, and to ensuring that there is buy-in from stakeholders. This is important, as the private sector, which provides care for almost 70 percent of the population is still mostly outside the purview of the national health information system. To overcome this binding constraint, a National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) is currently being rolled out.

Much of the health policy debate in India typically happens post-facto: not during or before decisionmaking. To enable focus on using data, resolution of structural issues on both supply and demand sides are required. Given the complexity of the systems and the multiple stakeholders involved, there is a need for transparency in the datasets behind policy decisions for the sake of open and democratic decisionmaking. A strong digital architecture will help address both the supply as well as demand level concerns.

The government is doing considerable work around e-Health information systems, according to Mr Ashish Sharma, Partner, Strategy&. The digital architecture will need to be open and inclusive so that the private sector participates voluntarily. In addition, it needs to be universally adoptable so that even if different stakeholders build components individually, these are built consistently and uniformly across the overall system.

The new health information infrastructure will also have to find ways of overcoming the inter-sectoral, inter-ministerial incoherence and inter-organisational incoherence in terms of numbers. Prof. Aasha Kapur Mehta of IIPA, New Delhi pointed out that, for example, while NITI Aayog’s three-year action agenda seeks to reduce MMR to 120 per 1 lakh live birth by 2020, the National Health Policy 2017 aims to decrease the MMR to 100 per 1 lakh live births by 2020. Therefore, India has two different targets for the same year for MMR. The Indian Statistical Service, which forms the backbone of the National Statistical System, needs to be reformed and overhauled, starting with the vital registration system.

The trained personnel who collect data have been one of the first to bear the brunt whenever there is a cut-back, and over time, this has had an impact on the quality of the data collected, particularly morbidity data. The administrative data on morbidity exists in hospitals, but are never compiled or analysed. As a votary of the open data initiative, India needs to find ways of organising existing data in the system in a manner that every stakeholder finds useful. Improved levels of standardisation at the point of data collection will facilitate data use, and policy discussions informed by relevant numbers.

India has a great opportunity: it has the resources, owing to the consistently high growth rate, freeing up for improving healthcare coverage for its population. Giving priority to health is an area where perhaps India can learn from China, according to Dr David Wilson, Global Lead for Decision & Delivery Science of the World Bank. The Chinese government had concluded that catastrophic health spending forced so many Chinese to save at such disproportionately high rates, to an extent that they could not consume and contribute to the rebalancing of China’s economy towards domestic consumption-led growth. China had a real economic reason to invest in universal health coverage, apart from equity. Given that India has a considerable proportion of its population falling under the poverty line every year because of healthcare spending, public health spending in India can be an investment for the future.

To make that investment meaningful, high-quality data is inevitable. India is planning to undertake an ambitious step towards UHC through the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), which will reportedly cover 70 percent of the Indian population. Ensuring a seamless transition from the existing RSBY to the proposed NHPS will require insights from the analysis of RSBY scheme data as well as survey data on impact. It is time for India to drop the much-discussed apprehension to programme evaluations and to liberate data being collected at institutions and by schemes including the RSBY data to facilitate independent evaluations.

Human Capital in the Knowledge Age: Investing in India’s Billion-Person Data Set

Samir Saran

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will prompt a tectonic shift in the way the world has traditionally organised economies. The Knowledge Age is giving way to a new barometer of economic aptitude – one that is predicated on possession of data and information, rather than the conventional advantages of cheap labour, or even coal and petroleum. This is because the ability of modern-day innovations, such as mobile supercomputing and machine learning, to enhance the way we live, work and exist is contingent on the consumption of data. In a context where data is the key to economic success, India is uniquely positioned to distinguish itself as a formidable actor. While data is regularly exchanged among developers, advertisers and consumers for services, its value is linked to the capabilities of the population it describes.

India is home to a young, billion-person community. Correspondingly, the country has the potential to access and develop a billion-point (1.3 billion to be precise) data set. Access to data of that scale is uncommon and generally monopolised by a handful of private stakeholders. In the United States, for example, the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) source and analyse the data of billions of diverse users on a daily basis. Similarly, in China, the BAT conglomerate (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) dominate the data collection market of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. India is the only country that has integrated data into its public infrastructure – the Aadhaar programme enables every resident of India to register for a unique biometric identification. With 1.18 billion Aadhaar enrollments, India is the largest country in the world with a unique digital identity.

The challenge for India, however, is to streamline systems to cultivate a data set that is educated, healthy and sustainable so that both the capacity of Indian citizens and the corresponding value of their data are strengthened. This re-conceptualisation of individuals essentially overturns India’s approach to human capital investment itself – where such investment is no longer viewed as an altruistic, social welfare enterprise, but instead as an economic imperative that is necessary to sustain the country’s rapidly expanding economy. Technology-based innovation has proved to be a successful social model in the past, and it can certainly be a remedy for the pervasive gap in services and skills that exists in Indian society today. If India is able to bridge this gap, it has the chance to possess a nearly unparalleled source of human capital and data that will catalyse the country’s growth for the foreseeable future.

Commodifying Human Capital

The state of the human will define the state of the economy. To reflect this reality, India will need to reshape its understanding of social services and investment. For nearly 50 years following independence, India’s economy was largely insulated. This meant that for years there was minimal external competition on its products, and in turn, on the quality of its labour force. Investments in health, education and skilling were therefore considered parallel social initiatives and rarely featured in the country’s growth strategies, if at all.

Today, however, in a global environment increasingly dependent on data, human capital investment serves both an economic and a social purpose. Simply put, human development and economic growth should be viewed as interdependent measures. To reflect this reality, India must turn towards technology-based solutions to develop a healthy and well-educated society and capitalise on its data set.

A Technology-Driven Framework for Investment

The digital platform presents India the opportunity to approach investment in human capital as a pragmatic, value-creating scheme that improves human knowledge and capacity. Where traditional social institutions have struggled, India’s expansive digital economy can assume an efficient and cost-effective service-delivery mandate. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme is a classic example of this potential. In an effort to streamline the way subsidy benefits were handed out, the government cut out the middleman and began depositing subsidies directly into eligible citizens’ bank accounts. The result? An overwhelming decrease in subsidy scams, duplication and service-delays, which also saved the government some INR 50,000 crore.

Digital innovation for the bottom of the pyramid changes the approach to public goods delivery altogether – from a supply-driven mechanism to a more effective demand-driven one. In public institutions, if app-based programmes provided education and health coupons directly to beneficiaries instead of the institutions themselves, schools and hospitals would be forced to compete for customers, at least in urban and peri-urban settings. It would also allow communities to establish self-arranged solutions and mitigate governance or accessibility issues.

Investment through digital innovation can also ensure a greater level of oversight at the state and local level. Through decentralised programmes, customised by state and locality, digital applications can source baseline data regarding health and education indicators, starting with civil registration and vital statistics. This initiative would create a real-time monitoring system of states’ progress in human development. A subsequent system could develop based off of this data that incentivises or rewards states that successfully improve their human development capacities.

Similar to how governments invested in the steam engine during the First Industrial Revolution or in financial systems during the rise of Wall Street, in this age, the Indian government can find value through investment in the health and education of its growing labour force. As the investments in social services materialise, India’s human development capacity will expand, leading to more qualified participants in the labour market and a more sophisticated set of available data. For India, in the Knowledge Age, its prospects for economic growth and power will be inextricably tied to innovations in technology, data and human capital investment.

“African countries acknowledge ICT as a pillar for socio-economic growth. And, satellites play a key role in connecting Africa to the rest of the World,” Nyirishema said.

He added, “Definitely, satellite is very important particularly for SDGs, we need to have the means to link various parts of work, to monitor targets, to collect required data from across the continents, analyse it and help to inform policy and regulation and all development interventions.”

Nyirishema was speaking at the opening of a week-long regional workshop on satellite regulations, in Kigali, yesterday.

The workshop, which has attracted delegates from African countries including ICT regulators, and representatives of International Telecommunication Union (ITU), aims at raising awareness about satellite regulatory issues.

“This workshop is very important not just for Rwanda but for the East African region and the continent in general because satellite is a critical and important technology for communications. Africa is a large continent and a very big part of Africa relies on satellite to be connected to the rest of the world, whether it’s for TV, Internet or communication in general,” said Nyirishema.

According to Nyirishema, the cost of launching satellite has gone down in the recent past and what would stop the country from building and launching its first satellite in the orbit is not just the skilled manpower and resources but also other processes including regulatory matters —which are to be partly addressed in this workshop.

“We (Rwanda) are already looking at getting involved with CubeSat and Microsatellites. This is a trend, we have seen some countries do that and we are exploring that, we are taking steps towards that. But that leads to a bigger objective, which we hope that, as continent, we can organise ourselves to launch even bigger satellites and build a knowhow to do that,” he said.

“Africa and Rwanda, to be specific, use satellite. But what we are asking ourselves most is why African counties have not managed to launch satellites.”

“We have realised that all the cost of being able to launch a satellite is going down. It’s not about the knowledge and resources but also it is about the process for the country to be able to successfully launch the satellite.”

Nyirishema added that a time when Africa is trying to claim its position in space, it is good to have ITU experts come here to train African experts to have a complete understanding of what is required to successfully launch a satellite from a process standpoint.

He said, there are a few countries that have already launched their satellites.

“We are looking at getting more countries or regional blocs or the continent working together to also get into the space-faring nations and to build own satellites.”","“African countries acknowledge ICT as a pillar for socio-economic growth.

35,https://www.morrisburgleader.ca/2018/03/08/sdg-getting-ready-to-roll-out-new-community-improvement-plan-fund/,"Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Morrisburg Leader,SDG getting ready to roll out new Community Improvement Plan fund,"MORRISBURG – As a lead up to the pending roll out of its Community Improvement Plan funding opportunity, the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry hosted a series of six consultation sessions that wrapped up here in Morrisburg March 8th.

About 20 people consisting of SDG and South Dundas officials, council and a handful of business and business organization representatives attended the breakfast meeting at the McIntosh Inn.

Tim Simpson, SDG chief administrative officer, who led all of the meetings, said that each attracted a similar-sized crowd.

The counties presented the details of its Community Improvement Plan that will have $100,000 available to area commercial, industrial and institutional property improvement projects later this year.

The purpose of the consultation sessions was to get feedback on the counties CIP plan proposal which is intended to foster regional/local economic development.

The SDG CIP money will only be available in municipalities that have their own Community Improvement Plans in place.

While South Dundas does not yet have its own CIP in place, staff is working towards one, with the aim to roll out its plan about the same time that the counties launches its program.

Simpson describes the Counties CIP as a framework that can be dropped into local CIPs to make funds available to stimulate economic development and community revitalization through financial incentive.

SDG’s CIP strategy is to support regional economic development through proposed funding streams which include: agriculture value-added and facility improvement projects; brownfield redevelopment; re-purposing commercial, institutional and industrial buildings; and, development of roofed accommodations within the rural areas of SDG. Roofed accommodations include bed and breakfasts and are essentially anything that is not a tent or a campsite.

County officials are now in the process of determining eligibility criteria and ironing out the details of the intake process.

The goal is to have the SDG CIP ready for review and council approval by late spring.

Simpson is aiming to keep the application process as simple and seamless and local as possible.

It will likely provide 50 per cent funding grants for selected projects and may even provide interest free loans to successful applicants.

“Our ultimate goal is to have the CIP money available in Summer 2018,” he said.

Simpson acknowledged that the initial $100,000 allocation, “is not a lot,” and that he expects that the demand will far exceed the funds available.

The CIP will be reviewed after a year, and that amount will likely be increased, with council’s approval, in future years.

South Dundas economic development officer Rob Hunter agreed that the $100,00 is likely to be over-subscribed for this year.

“But, just because it’s a small plan, doesn’t mean that it can’t be impactful.”

As an example he pointed to a CIP improvement project in Winchester through which an investment of only $8,000 resulted in a marked improvement to a small business’ curbside appeal. Of that, $4,000 came from the local CIP fund which North Dundas has, matching the owner’s $4,000 investment.

As touched upon in February through the lens of financial inclusion, the international community is rapidly exploring the technology’s applications to sustainable development challenges.

Distributed ledger technology stores information on a decentralized system, where sealed “blocks” of data are copied and distributed across a network of peers, thus forming a “chain.” Although blockchain has risen in profile in the past several months as the underlying technology to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that uses the platform to enable the transfer of funds on a peer-to-peer basis, this is just one of its potential applications to development.

A white paper from the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development explains the underpinnings of the technology and outlines how it can be used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. The paper titled, ‘The Future is Decentralized: Block chains, distributed ledgers, and the future of sustainable development,’ is the first volume in a series that aims to show how blockchain can be used to build multi-stakeholder, cross-sector partnerships as well as mitigate potential risk. The Commission looks at six areas of application—development aid effectiveness, digital identity, remittances, supply chain management, energy and property rights—and indicates the SDGs to which they apply using the Goals’ icons at the start of each section.

The report’s foreword acknowledges recent political controversies and perceived risks in the technology’s nascent stages, but notes that blockchain should not be seen as a threat to existing governance systems. Some countries have banned cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, or expressed caution due to perceived risk of its being used for money laundering or financing of illicit activities. The report suggests means of mitigating some of the broad risks, calling for risk management rather than risk avoidance. A press release linked to the white paper describes how the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) are leveraging the platform.

Legislation needs to provide guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.

Delving into additional thematic applications and specific solutions, BlockX Labs’s Laura Marissa Cullell links blockchain case examples to the SDGs in an article on Medium. The post summarizes recent initiatives on SDGs 2, 5, 13, and 16 (on zero hunger, gender equality, climate action and peace, justice and strong institutions, respectively). Programmes implemented by UN-led funds and programs such as the World Food Programme (WFP) yield immediate savings by reducing transaction costs and international bank transfer fees. The DLT-based programmes also enable more transparent finance delivery to specific sites, where, for example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) administers its Green List of Conservation Areas. However, the article also notes challenges for blockchain, reminding readers that it is not a silver bullet: there must be buy-in and support from policymakers, as legislation needs to provide “guidance on what can and can’t be accomplished with Blockchain.” Additionally, the lack of adequate infrastructure for high-speed internet access presents a hurdle in some contexts where blockchain applications could provide a solution to development challenges.

Applying blockchain to SDG-advancing projects does not necessarily mean working within (or even with) the UN system. The Plastic Bank, a for-profit social enterprise, seeks to address marine plastic waste in developing countries. The endeavor uses blockchain technology to track recyclable materials and the virtual currency tokens offered to collectors. A Sustainable Brands article featuring co-founder Shaun Frankson outlines his and co-founder David Katz’s business model, which can be scaled to contribute to SDGs 12 and 14 (responsible consumption and production, and life below water, respectively) on a global scale.

Virtual tokens and payments are not only becoming a viable option at the base of economic pyramid. Devex’s Sara Jerving sat down with a USAID consulting firm Konektid International, which is currently experimenting with using cryptocurrency both to receive payments from clients and to pay employees. In the article, Konektid CEO Mike Shanley notes that one reason for the switch is the avoidance of wire fees and the delays often associated with transfers, saying it’s “just a better payment system.”

GreenBiz Editorial Director Heather Clancy explains in a post from February 2018 how the technology can disrupt energy markets, including by advancing streamlined distributed grids. Linking blockchain to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), she writes that units of energy and smart metering appear to be a natural fit with the ledger system, which in turn can help generate verified renewable energy credits (RECs). Clancy also offers an example of how blockchain can increase transparency across products’ supply chains, which serves to accelerate progress on other Goals. She spotlights a Walmart-IBM collaboration kicked off in 2016 to demonstrate how better supply chain information can increase food safety (SDG target 2.1) and reduce food loss and waste (SDG target 12.3). The information gathered on the blockchain enables more strategic removals of tainted or questionable products, avoiding wasteful mass recalls.

In addition to these writings and projects, a number of recent events also examined blockchain’s applications for sustainable development. The Blockchain for Sustainable Solutions Conference took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US, on 2 March 2018. The agenda covered a range of sustainability and development issues that directly map to the SDGs, including climate change (SDG 13), deforestation (SDG 15), energy (SDG 7), water (SDG 6), food (SDG 2), transparency (SDG 16) and finance (SDG 17). A recording of the conference livestream is available on YouTube.

At the Global Festival of Action on Sustainable Development held from 21-23 March, in Bonn, Germany, Tauni Lanier posited that cryptocurrencies and their current popularity could be used to fund SDG projects, particularly in cities. She cited the inherent value of the environment and the transparency gains noted above as selling points for such a currency. An article on Development & Cooperation by Drake Jamali shares remarks from Lanier on new sustainable development financing methods such as diaspora bonds and social impact bonds, in addition to her comments on cryptocurrencies.

Discussions of blockchain’s potential for solving problems facing the international community have appeared in several other news items on the SDG Knowledge Hub in recent months. For further reading, see:

In January 2018, the UNFCCC Secretariat created the Climate Chain Coalition, which uses DLT to strengthen monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of climate actions, as covered by Leila Mead;

In March, a competition was held by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the UN Department of Management’s Office of Information and Communications Technology (UN-OICT) to use blockchain to combat child trafficking in Moldova, as covered by Catherine Benson Wahlén; and

Also in March, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres highlighted the use of blockchain in nuclear safeguards or machine learning in multilateral disarmament verification, as examples of ways for new technologies to support disarmament and non-proliferation, at a roundtable event in New York, also covered by Leila Mead.

Looking ahead, a workshop on ‘Blockchain for Sustainable and Inclusive Finance’ will take place on 25 April, in Zurich, Switzerland, convened by the Responsible Finance and Investment Foundation (RFI), the Swiss-Arab Network (SAN), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Bank of the Argentine Nation and European Partners for the Environment.

Canada is slated to present its VNR on progress in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in July 2018, during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Noting Canada’s commitment to build a more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world as envisioned by the SDGs, the press release states that the Canadian Federal Government will: reach out to all Canadians to develop a national strategy to catalyze nationwide SDG implementation; work with partners to raise awareness and build partnerships and networks; establish an SDG team to support integrating the SDGs into policies and programs of federal departments and agencies; continue to contribute to the UN’s SDG Indicator Framework; and present its first VNR.

To develop the VNR, the release further announces the launch of a VNR Web Portal allowing Canadians to contribute to the report’s development. Organizations and communities are invited to provide “snapshots” of their work towards “a more sustainable and prosperous future,” including information on efforts focusing on specific SDGs, measuring progress towards achieving those goals, and innovative approaches related to sustainable development. A selection of the submissions received will be used as contributions to the VNR or may be featured as examples of SDG implementation in the report. The portal will be open for contributions submitted online or by email until 4 May 2018.

Several events and publications during the first half of 2018 are expected to contribute to Canada’s review of progress and its VNR, including the following:

In April, the Brookings Institution released a working paper titled, “A Canadian North Star: Crafting an advanced economy approach to the Sustainable Development Goals.” The report identifies which issues in Canada are “on track” for success and which issues require a “breakthrough,” and provides recommendations regarding the roles of different groups of actors.

On 24 April 2018, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development of the Auditor General of Canada presented the 2018 Spring Reports, including a report on Canada’s Preparedness to implement the SDG. The report represents the first national audit of a country’s preparedness to implement, monitor and report on SDG progress following a framework developed by the International Office of Supreme Audit Organizations (INTOSAI).

An audit of biodiversity conservation in Canada was also released as part of the Commissioner’s 2018 Spring Reports. This report examines whether Environment and Climate Change Canada provided national leadership and coordination to conserve Canada’s biodiversity, and whether responsible federal departments and agencies were working to meet selected biodiversity conservation targets. Progress in conserving biodiversity will be reviewed in depth at the HLPF in July 2018 as part of its review of progress on SDG 15 (Life on Land).

In May 2018, Statistics Canada is expected to launch an indicator portal to track SDG implementation at the national level. The portal is expected to provide access to indicator data that is aligned with, comparable, or complementary to the indicators proposed by the UN’s SDG Indicator Framework.

Several SDGs are also reflected in the themes Canada has chosen for its presidency of the G7. The G7 Summit, to be held 8-9 June 2018, in Charlevoix, Canada will focus on, among other issues: gender equality and women’s empowerment, contributing to SDG 5 (gender equality); working together on climate change, oceans and clean energy, contributing to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy for all), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water); growth that works for everyone and preparing for jobs of the future, contributing to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); and building a more peaceful and secure world, contributing to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

To track action for SDG implementation in Canada, a group of NGOs has just launched the Alliance2030 Portal, which will function as a searchable database of the work undertaken in Canada in alignment with the SDGs, including through news posts, storytelling, blogs and podcasts.

Its outcomes will serve as a contribution to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF).

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum convened from 9-12 April 2018, in Indore, India. Its outcomes include: a dialogue among Asian mayors and city authorities on how the 3Rs and resource efficiency can make their cities sustainable; a declaration by cities; the launch of a report on the state of 3Rs in the region; and awards recognizing Indian recipients for their contributions to the 3Rs in their country.

The Eighth Forum’s theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3R and Resource Efficiency – A 21st Century Vision for Asia – Pacific Communities,’ focused on how the 3Rs, resource efficiency, and promoting the principles of a circular economy can contribute to achieving the targets of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). For example, a plenary session devoted to water noted how street cleaning, improved waste management infrastructure and practices, no open defecation, and basic sanitation services can reduce water pollution and water scarcity, improve the provision of clean drinking water, and reduce vector- and water-borne diseases, as well as improve resilience to natural disasters.

A plenary session on air examined how cleaner streets and the prevention of open trash burning reduces asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Participants also discussed ways to switch from the common practice in Asia of burning agricultural wastes such as rice straw, which reduces air quality, to recycling the wastes to produce bio-ethanol for use as fuel and chemical inputs.

Other plenary sessions addressed: how 3R principles and strategies can contribute to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems from land-based activities, particularly marine litter; how to “green” small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and get them involved in the circular economy; 3Rs technologies appropriate for addressing special waste issues, such as plastics, e-waste and medical wastes; and financing 3R infrastructure and programs. A parallel event examined strategies for addressing marine litter in the South Asia region.

During the Forum, a parallel Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue convened on the theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3Rs and Resource Efficiency,’ co-chaired by the mayor and commissioner of the host city of Indore, respectively, Malini Laxman Singh Gaur and Manish Singh. The Dialogue discussed the contribution of the 3Rs to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Guar and Singh discussed Indore’s efforts to meet the seven targets of SDG 11 before the 2030 deadline, including efforts on housing, transport, participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning, municipal waste management, green and clean public spaces, and disaster and climate resilience. Special sessions of the Mayors’ Policy Dialogue addressed waste challenges specific to Asian cities such as plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical wastes.

The Mayors’ Policy Dialogue concluded with the signing of the ‘Indore 3R Declaration on Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air in Cities’ by mayors and city authorities of 37 Asian cities. The declaration calls for collective efforts on 3R and resource efficiency and the signatory cities pledge to, inter alia:

Accelerate holistic waste management;

Implement local-level actions to make cities clean, safe, smart, resilient, resource efficient, inclusive and sustainable;

Partner with civil society organizations (CSOs), including integration of the informal recycling sector with the formal waste management chain;

Work towards a complete ban on the use of plastics in eco-sensitive or eco-fragile areas, including in tourist areas close to oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;

Work for wastewater treatment and reuse; and

Focus on effective management of special waste streams such as micro-plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical waste.

Two more cities signed the Declaration before the close of the Forum, and it remains open to signature by other Asian cities through 2030.

The Forum also launched a report titled, ‘State of the 3Rs in Asia and the Pacific.’ Mandated by the sixth Forum in 2015, the report is envisioned as a regular assessment of Forum member State progress towards achieving the commitments in the Ha Noi 3R Declaration (2013-2023) adopted at the fourth meeting held in 2013 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The 2018 report makes a series of recommendations, including: highlighting 3Rs as part of the global sustainability agenda, particularly SDG 12; continued prioritization of resource productivity, waste prevention and reduction activities; ensuring comparable and credible data across countries in Asia and the Pacific; and giving greater attention to e-waste, marine litter and coastal plastic waste, micro-plastics, food waste and food loss issues in the region.

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum was organized by the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ), and India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was attended by delegates from 45 countries, including government representatives of 28 Forum participating countries.

Created by the East Asia Environment Ministers Meeting in 2008 based on a proposal by Japan, the Forum is intended as a framework for high-level policy dialogue on the 3Rs among central and local governments, international organizations, aid agencies, research bodies, NGOs and the private sector. As of the Fifth Forum held in Surabaya, Indonesia, the platform was extended to include participation by Pacific nations, particularly the Pacific small island developing States (P-SIDS).

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

It is hosted by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS). adelphi is an independent think tank and public policy consultancy on climate, environment and development.

40,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-analyzes-ocean-conference-commitments/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Analyzes Ocean Conference Commitments,"March 2018: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has published a summary and an analysis of the voluntary commitments made in support of the UN Ocean Conference and achievement of SDG 14 on life below water. The commitments covered all SDG 14 targets, with most relating to more than one. The most frequently addressed target was 14.2 (sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems), followed by target 14.1 (preventing and reducing marine pollution by 2025). By the text, a majority of the commitments were registered by governments, followed by NGOs and UN entities, with academia, the scientific community and philanthropic organizations registering the fewest commitments.

The high-level event titled, ‘UN Conference to Support the Implementation of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ (the Ocean Conference), convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from 5-9 June 2017. As part of the outcomes of the Conference, stakeholders registered voluntary commitments for implementation of SDG 14. To date, 1,406 have been logged, and the registration continues. The summary cautions that a number of deliverables pre-date the Ocean Conference, often by many years, indicating ongoing projects.

In analyzing the voluntary commitments geographically, the publication finds that overall, voluntary commitments had good global coverage, spanning most countries and including almost all countries with access to the ocean. They covered all ocean basins, with most commitments relating to the North Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Regions contributing the largest number of voluntary commitments were Western Europe, Central America, North America and Oceania. The text notes that developed regions with high GDPs made commitments, but many of these focused on activities within their own regions. UN entities provided commitments covering the largest number of countries and global contributions, or contributions not targeting specific countries.

541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion.

The authors mention that using the best, currently available data, a total of 541 individual commitments include the provision of financial resources, with the total financing amounting to approximately US$25.5 billion. In addition, almost all the commitments include in-kind funding as well as staff and technical expertise.

The voluntary commitments will contribute, when achieved, an additional 2.85% to the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs). The increase in protected areas will add to the MPAs present today, covering 6.35% of the ocean. These actions will contribute to the achievement of target 14.5, and, together with the already proposed but unimplemented MPAs (about 1.3% coverage according to the World Database on Protected Areas), will help reach the 10% target, with approximately 10.3% attained by 2020.

The report also offers an analysis of how the voluntary commitments may contribute to the attainment of other SDGs. It shows close linkages between SDG 14 and SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, and SDG 2 on zero hunger. Voluntary commitments on SDG 14 were most often linked (by a count) to SDG 13 on climate action.

The report also reveals a number of gaps. On targets and priority issues within those targets, the publication notes that more attention needs to be paid to both the politically sensitive topic of fisheries subsidies and the issues impacting small scale and artisanal fishers. In addition, answering the many open scientific questions on ocean acidification should also be made an urgent priority. Other issues, such as marine biotechnology and innovative ocean technologies and engineering solutions, such as renewable ocean energy, the text observes, could also benefit from further attention. While there were no glaring geographical gaps, the authors mention that some adjustments might be necessary to ensure that efforts to increase scientific knowledge, capacity building, and technology transfer (target 14.a) focus on those regions and countries that need it most. This is also the case, the text underlines, for capacity building relating to ocean acidification research (target 14.3).

Noting the large number of commitments and the variety of the types of information submitted when registering them, the publication reports that some aspects of successful follow-up should include:

a framework, such a web-based registry, to review commitments and incorporate progress reports to assess individual and collective progress in a public follow-up;

defined methods, data and indicators to support follow-up;

regular reporting by commitment makers in a manner that accounts for diversity between commitments, while including common elements that allow progress to be summarized across targets and SDG 14 as a whole;

and maintaining momentum through face-to-face meetings, possibly at the margins of oceans-related conferences.

As new commitments are continuously registered, the authors mention that this analysis will be periodically updated. They further note that the Ocean Conference voluntary commitments should be analyzed in relationship to other similar commitments, such as those registered during the ‘Our Ocean’ Conferences or those found in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) related to the Paris Agreement as well as National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). They recommend a study that looks in detail into the collective impact of all ocean relevant commitments.

Meanwhile, the Plastic Bank is using blockchain technology to incentivize the collection and recycling of plastic waste.

The Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance represents an agreement among the UK, Ghana, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Vanuatu to jointly tackle marine plastic. The countries have pledged to ban microbeads in personal care products and rinse-off cosmetics and to cut plastic bag use by 2021. The Alliance aims to drive action on SDG 14 (life below water) and to encourage other Commonwealth countries to sign up to and implement international agreements to protect the ocean, including the UN Clean Seas campaign, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative and the London Protocol.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced £61.4 million to support the Alliance. This funding includes £25 million to support research on marine plastic from a scientific, economic and social perspective; £25 million to address plastic and other environmental pollution generated by manufacturing in developing countries and prevent this waste from entering the ocean; and £16.4 million to improve waste management at a national and city level, and prevent plastics from entering the water. Participating developing countries are also eligible to bid for support to improve their waste management systems and implement other initiatives to address plastic waste. In addition, the UK Department for International Development will match public donations to the Alliance.

The UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said, through the Alliance, the UK aims “to harness the full power of the Commonwealth in pushing for global change and safeguarding our marine environment for future generations.

The Alliance will work with business and NGOs, including the World Economic Forum, Sky, the Coca-Cola Company, Fauna and Flora International and WWF. Fauna and Flora International CEO Mark Rose said, “urgent and collective action is now needed to reduce the levels of plastic reaching our oceans” and expressed his organization’s commitment to help the Alliance achieve its aims.

Also on plastic pollution, the Plastic Bank aims to incentivize people in Brazil, Haiti and the Philippines to bring plastic waste to recycling collection areas. The Bank rewards plastic collectors with digital tokens that can be accessed by smartphone and exchanged for goods such as food, water or phone minutes. The Plastic Bank works with Cognition Foundry and IBM to implement this exchange using blockchain technology, which helps to ensure a cashless method that can support financial inclusion and minimize individuals’ risk of robbery. According to its co-founder, Shaun Frankson, the Plastic Bank provides an opportunity for “anyone with a smartphone and scale to create their own local recycling business and ecosystem.” The Bank plans to expand into Indonesia, Ethiopia, India and South Africa within the next year.

The event took place on 22 April 2018, at the Westin Hotel Grand Central in New York, US, in advance of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum). The Fair was organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), in collaboration with the UN Global Compact, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Addressing lessons learned about investment, Cristina Duarte, Cabo Verde’s Former Minister of Finances, Planning and Public Administration, noted that building institutions and regulatory systems conducive to investment can take 10-15 years, and it requires policy coherence and integration. Admasu Nebebe, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Finance and Economic Cooperation, spoke about the importance of investing in human development, noting that Ethiopia is currently investing 25% of its national budget in education. He observed that Ethiopia is the country with the third-largest public investment in infrastructure, which he said is also essential for attracting private investment.

The acting mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, said the local government has collaborated with the national bank of Colombia to develop a strategy to target extreme poverty eradication and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Sergio Londoño Zurek, who is also the Director General of the Presidential Cooperation Agency (APC-Colombia), also reported that 55,000 people live in extreme poverty in his city.

Anne Simpson, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), observed that the SDGs bring benefits for pension funds because they address risks. She said that after the 2008 financial crisis, CalPERS decided to rethink investment in terms of long-term value creation, and concluded that it needs to manage three types of capital: financial; human; and natural. As these three types of capital are also addressed by the SDGs, she said, the Goals are great for the sustainable investments that funds must harness in order to pay pensions.

Simpson moderated a series of presentations on successful PPPs in Kenya, Nigeria and Brazil. Ormat Olkaria III (Kenya) – the first privately funded and developed geothermal plant in Africa – reflects the importance of successful risk allocation between the private sector and public sector in achieving efficiency. The project was funded through two separate rounds of equity and debt financing, resulting in profits for the private investor and a decrease in energy costs for consumers.

Among the ingredients that led to the project’s success, Paul Mbuthi, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, noted the government’s focus on removing barriers to investment such as tariffs, as well as shouldering the high costs of the first explorations. Nachman Isaac, Ormat, explained what makes projects bankable and thus prone to success: long-term power purchase agreements; strong sovereign support, including support letters from the government; strong existing provisions that guarantee the recovery of a sufficient part of the investment; international arbitration; stable and predictable regulatory frameworks; and risk sharing.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) – OLAM Farmers Partnership (Nigeria) provides smallholder rice farmers with access to a profitable and reliable market, and OLAM with a consistent source of high quality produce. The project leverages multilateral financing from IFAD to attract funding from a large multinational firm (OLAM) to provide a consistent source of income to small-scale farmers, which, in turn, should lead to increased capital investment by the small-scale farmers. Odoemena Benjamin, IFAD, said multilateral agencies can help governments catalyze the necessary resources for projects aligned with national needs and priorities.

The Renewable Energy Market and Pacific Hydro Wind Farms (Brazil) was financed by a national development bank, and shows that private infrastructure investment can be successful even without financing and/or guarantees from international lenders. Based on the success of this project, Pacific Hydro is currently pursuing several much larger renewable energy projects in Brazil, illustrating how smaller investments can spur larger-scale, long-term investments.

The panel discussions were followed by thematic parallel working groups on ‘Large-scale, Capital- intensive Infrastructure,’ ‘New Investment Opportunities in Agriculture,’ and ‘Innovative Financial Instruments to support the SDGs.’

With an estimated 250 million international economic migrants worldwide and 66 million people forcibly displaced as refugees or internally displaced persons (IDPs), the platform represents a response to a request made by the G7.

The platform was launched on 20 April 2018, on the margins of the World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meetings.

The MDBs presented a strategic framework for action at the G7 meeting in Bari, Italy, in May 2017, and announced the platform in October 2017. Since then, MDB representatives have met several times and identified four priority areas where there is high potential to increase impact. In its initial phase, the platform will focus on:

Refining the common framework for MDB engagement; Advancing cooperation on knowledge, evidence, and data; Ensuring strategic coordination on priority topics in coordination with governments, the UN and other partners; and Deploying better-targeted instruments and products.

The participant MDBs are the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), WBG, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The project has reached around 30,000 people.

UNFG also hosts an annual youth event, which focuses on urban agriculture, resilience, community engagement and food security, and aims to ensure that the voices of youth are heard in implementation of the SDGs. In northern summer 2018, UNFG will launch a partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) to showcase equipment used by small-scale farmers in the field, highlighting the importance of technological innovation to promote food security.

The audit concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs because, at the end of the audit, no governance structure, implementation plan or system to measure, monitor and report progress were in place.

To implement the SDGs domestically, national governments must not only take direct action, but also support implementation by other actors including cities, local communities, business and civil society organization, and develop a system to measure, monitor and report on progress. To assess – or audit – whether national governments are taking the necessary steps to fulfill these responsibilities, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Organizations (INTOSAI) developed a framework, and more than 80 audit organizations committed to performing such assessments. The audit for Canada based on the INTOSAI framework was presented by Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development Julie Gelfand, who is part of Canada’s office of the Auditor General.

The audit report titled, ‘Canada’s Preparedness to Implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,’ concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs. According to the report, at the end of the audit period in November 2017, no governance structure for implementation or implementation plan existed, only limited national consultations and engagements had occurred, and no system to measure, monitor and report on national progress was in place. However, the report notes that Canada’s federal budget, published after the audit concluded, provides for the establishment of an SDG Unit to support coordination of SDG implementation, and support for Statistics Canada to expand monitoring and reporting activities relating to SDG implementation.

On federal leadership, the report recommends:

Establishing a federal governance structure that clearly articulates roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of other responsible and accountable federal organizations;

Developing an inclusive communications plan and engagement strategy to raise awareness of the SDGs, and consult and engage other levels of government and Canadians, including measures to report the results of consultations and take them into account when establishing national targets; and

Establishing and communicating an implementation plan to achieve national targets and the SDGs in Canada, including: clearly defined and attributed accountabilities for involved federal organizations; provisions for effective cooperation with other levels of government and with relevant stakeholders; clear national targets; coherent actions, which will collectively achieve the national targets; and a system for measuring results and for monitoring and reporting national progress in SDG implementation.

The report further recommends that lead federal organizations and departments should analyze the extent to which their policies and programmes could contribute to SDG implementation in Canada, in order to set realistic targets and identify policy and programme gaps.

In ‘The Commissioner’s Perspective’ published by the Office of the Auditor General, Julie Gelfand concludes that three years after Canada committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda the audit shows that “Canada has yet to complete some of the fundamentals—such as establishing a governance structure and plan—to position itself to deliver on this international commitment.”

The report on Canada’s readiness to implement the SDGs is the first of a series of national audits in different countries expected to be released in the coming months. In early 2018, the government of the Netherlands released a report, also aligned with INTOSAI’s framework, finding that the Government needs to focus more on the importance of policy coordination and cooperation between central and local governments, the connection between the SDGs and the national budgetary cycle, and the need to better include SDGs and sustainable development in general in primary and secondary education.

Canada is expected to present its first Voluntary National Review on progress on SDG implementation at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), taking place in July. To prepare that report and strengthen SDG implementation, Global Affairs Canada recently launched a portal for consultations and laid out its plan for SDG implementation.

Many supported a strong focus on children and the gender dimension of migration, with Australia calling to also add reference to people with disabilities. This third round of intergovernmental negotiations on the Compact convened from 3-6 April 2018, in New York, US.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference to convene from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico.

While Jamaica noted that all migration brings positive development outcomes, Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and China said that, when mentioning the positive role of migration in development, the text needs to read “regular” migration.

Many countries, including Austria, for a group of 27 European States, Norway and Australia, welcomed the stronger language of the revised draft on human rights and the protection of vulnerable migrants. Russia said the strong language on human rights is not justified.

Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Austria for a group of 27 European States, Norway, and Mexico welcomed strengthening the gender dimension of migration in the text.

Comoros, for the African Group, and Ethiopia stressed that the root causes of migration such as poverty and development would require the implementation of projects in countries of origin, thus call for a new, separate objective and actionable area on international cooperation on financial support for countries of origin to implement projects that address the root causes of migration, as well as for a special fund and a capacity building mechanism. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, expressed concern that the language on root causes of migration – such as corruption, access to justice, respect of human rights, good governance, rule of law, and strong civil society – has been reduced. South Africa noted that conflict as root cause would be better placed in the Global Compact on Refugees, while in the Global Compact on Migration, the root cause should be underdevelopment and addressed through, inter alia: infrastructure development; market access; investment in agriculture; technology transfer; investment in education and training; and respecting official development assistance (ODA) commitments.

Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, said paragraph 39 of the revised draft, which recognizes “the discretion of all States to determine their national legislation and policies with regards to the implementation of the actions envisaged in this Global Compact” is problematic as it leaves it to the discretion of the Member States to implement the actionable commitments and weakens an already nonbinding document. China insisted on changing the term “actionable commitments” in “policy options and best practices,” explaining that the Compact should not create new commitments for Member States. Brazil stressed that the sovereignty of the State is not absolute, but it is limited by international law. Thus, States are sovereign to decide who are irregular and regular migrants, within the parameters of international law. Japan called for flexibility in implementation and follow-up. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia warned against using prescriptive language in the text, suggesting “should” or “could” instead of “must” or “commit.”

Several countries, including the African Group, Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, Tuvalu, and the Holy See welcomed the inclusion of reference to migrants affected by the slow onset of climate displacement in the document. Nauru, for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (P-SIDS), said the Compact should include calls for the international community to plan for the management and support of climate-related migration. Ethiopia said climate change and natural disasters should be approached as root causes and addressed under each objective and actionable area. Canada called for adding language on climate migration in the Guiding Principles section. China said climate change causes refugees and not migrants, thus it should be addressed in the Global Compact for Refugees. Russia requested the deletion of references to the Paris Agreement on climate change and to the UN Convention to Combat Diversification (UNCCD).

The African Group and the Holy See called for the abolishment of migration detention camps and detention of migrants. Pakistan noted that the draft focuses too much on drivers of migration in countries of origin and too little on creating opportunities in destination countries. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia called for emphasizing the duty of nations to accept the return of their nationals, consistent with human rights law.

Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, called for measures to support family reintegration and for legal pathways for low-skilled families to migrate with their children. The need to protect migrant children was also emphasized by Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, and Bangladesh, Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Guatemala, Turkey, Venezuela, Norway, Mexico, Panama and the Republic of Moldova.

On implementation and follow-up and review, Austria for a group of 27 European States, expressed hope to receive a proposal on the capacity building mechanism, information on the financial implications of the proposals in the text, as well as clarifications of who are the actors involved in each of the proposals (States regions, the UN, stakeholders).

Several countries, including China and Russia, requested clear emphasis in the text on the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. Bangladesh and Uganda stressed that references that the document is not legally binding makes the text weak.

The next round of negotiations will take place from 14-18 May 2018 in New York, US.

48,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/shell-sky-scenario-outlines-pathway-to-well-below-2c/,"Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Shell Sky Scenario Outlines Pathway to Well Below 2°C,"27 March 2018: Shell has issued a report titled, ‘Sky: Meeting the Goals of the Paris Agreement.’ The report introduces a scenario that aims to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C through a combination of “mutually reinforcing drivers being rapidly accelerated by society, markets and governments.”

The scenario recognizes that extending current efforts, such as efficiency mandates, carbon taxes or renewable energy support, is insufficient. It argues that concurrent climate policy actions, and the deployment of disruptive new technologies in government policy environments to incentivize investment and innovation will be required.

In 2013, Shell published its New Lens Scenarios focused on mountains and oceans, which, for the first time, featured scenarios with energy-system modeling to 2100, enabling the viewing of long-term transitions in their entirety. These scenarios showed that the application of CO2-targeted policy frameworks would lead to net-zero emissions in the energy system by the end of the century. However, because this falls short of the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sky Scenario looks at a possible decarbonization pathway of achieving net-zero emissions from energy use by 2070.

Under the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040.

The scenario begins with the current structure of economic sectors and government policies, and assumes “very aggressive, but plausible,” ratcheting up of policy commitments through the first two global stocktakes (GSTs) under the Paris Agreement. It notes that, following the GSTs, greater uncertainties regarding policy implementation and technology development exist, which is why the scenario aims to be both ambitious and realistic by adopting an approach grounded in the energy system’s current reality combined with the long-term temperature goal.

In the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040. Liquid hydrocarbon fuel consumption would decrease by 50% between 2020 and 2050, and fall by 90% by 2070. The scenario also includes sector transformations in transport, buildings, industry, electricity and energy.

The Sky Scenario is based on the following assumptions from now to 2070:

a change in consumer mindset where people preferentially choose low-carbon, high-efficiency options to meet their energy service needs;

a step-change in energy efficiency;

carbon-pricing mechanisms adopted during the 2020s, leading to a CO2 cost embedded in consumer goods and services;

the electrification rate of final energy more than triples, with global electricity generation nearly five times the current level;

new energy sources grow by a multiple of fifty, with primary energy from renewables surpassing fossil fuels in the 2050s;

10,000 large carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are built, compared to fewer than 50 in operation in 2020; and

net-zero deforestation is achieved, and an area the size of Brazil is reforested offering the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Shell has also published quantitative data sets for the Sky Scenario for public use.

Shell is one of the world’s largest publicly traded oil companies, and produces approximately 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

51,https://www.businessamlive.com/global-water-tariffs-need-rise-5-9-a-year-to-achieve-sdg-gwi-report-shows/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",BusinessAMLive,"Global water tariffs need rise 5.9% a year to achieve SDG, GWI report shows","Water tariffs globally will need to increase 5.9 percent each year in order to generate the $449 billion of annual investment required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on water and sanitation between 2018 and 2030 and maintain existing infrastructures, a new market report has found.

The report, published by Global Water Intelligence (GWI), and sent via e-mail to businessam comes at a time when the funding model for water infrastructure is evolving to incorporate more private and commercial finance sources, in the face of ageing infrastructure, population growth and climate change.

Entitled Financing Water to 2030, the report argues that in order to achieve these targets whilst reducing utility dependence on grant finance, tariffs around the world will need to increase substantially, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9 percent and taking the global average combined tariff from $2.08 /m^3 to $4.38 /m^3 in 2030.

In Southern Asia, where average combined water and wastewater tariffs are just $0.14/m^3 compared to a global average of $2.08 /m^3, this means that tariffs would need to rise by 15.2 percent annually in order to meet the investment required by 2030 for SDG6.

Christopher Gasson, publisher at GWI and co-author of the report commented, “we are at an inflection point in the way water is financed. For the past two decades, there hasn’t been much change in the way utility assets are paid for. Going forward, there will be. We will see the utility sector steadily building its financial independence and the corollary of

all this is that tariffs will have to rise.”

The report states that meeting SDG 6, utilities will need to mitigate the effects of ageing infrastructure, industrial pollution, growing urban populations, and the more extreme flooding and droughts brought by climate change, and will need to access more finance sources to meet these challenges.

GWI forecasts that the amount of global private finance used to fund water infrastructure will increase from $3 billion during 2013 / 2017 to $35 billion a year in the next 12 years, providing 7.7 percent of global infrastructure investment needs by 2030.

Within the same time frame, funding for water infrastructure by central government grants and international transfers is expected to fall from 31 percent to 18 percent of annual investment needs, according to the report.

GWI notes that the key driver of this trend is governments moving away from financing water projects on their own balance sheets and through grants to utilities, and towards providing more loans and encouraging public-private partnerships.

In the USA for instance, the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment plan brings with it only $200 million of federal finance. Financing Water to 2030 explains that the rest is expected to come from the private sector.

In Saudi Arabia meanwhile, the government is contemplating the largest water privatisation programme since the UK government sold off its water assets in 1989. The report detailing how the governments of countries such as Japan, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, and Vietnam have recently announced major plans and new legislation for bringing private finance into their water infrastructure, examines how the trend towards mobilising more private finance for water infrastructure is also being driven by development, finance institutions (DFIs), pointing to the “blended finance” strategies at major DFIs like the World Bank.

This increasingly involves developing structured financial products designed to attract commercial finance for more credit-worthy clients, while directing more concessionary resources to places and projects for which they are critical.

Though blended finance has been growing as a concept for several years, the US government’s denial of a capital increase for the World Bank has given the strategy added impetus and visibility.

GWI also found that utility consolidation and government reforms aimed at improving the bankability of projects will be crucial in order to attract the infrastructure finance that utilities need to achieve the SDG on water and sanitation. The report examines several political developments as part of this trend.

In Japan, recent legal reforms to support and incentivise the consolidation of its 2,800 small-scale water and wastewater utilities have been introduced. The USA has also seen growing discussions on utility consolidation with many of the country’s small utilities struggling to maintain their infrastructure. The report explains that the elimination of $509 million in grants for small rural utilities by the federal government will likely make the discussion even more relevant.

GWI will next host The Global Water Summit 2018 in Paris on 15-16th April 2018. The summit’s 2018 agenda will feature a pre-conference workshop on the privatisation of Saudi Arabia’s water sector, along with expert-led sessions and roundtables on PPP opportunities in emerging markets and utility bankability, and sessions on blended finance run in partnership with the World Bank.","Water tariffs globally will need to increase 5.9 percent each year in order to generate the $449 billion of annual investment required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on water and sanitation between 2018 and 2030 and maintain existing infrastructures, a new market report has found.

He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

The VLR, to be presented during the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), will be modeled after the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs Penny Abeywardena made the announcement on 1 May 2018. According to the press release on the announcement, New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs, and its VLR will highlight the City’s achievements in sustainability since 2015. The VLR will be presented during the HLPF’s “sessions dedicated to local government engagement.”

The VLR, produced by the Global Vision | Urban Action programme of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs in close collaboration with relevant NYC agencies, compiles and presents existing New York City’s data and programs, the press release notes. An article by Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, indicates that the VLR will look at the City’s progress on a set of key SDGs, and will both reflect on successes and identify areas where New York can learn from others to address remaining challenges.

New York’s Global Vision | Urban Action programme shares innovations in sustainability with cities and countries around the world, “using the lens of the SDGs.” Established in December 2015 by the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, the programme seeks to, inter alia: engage with experts and representatives from New York City and the international community interested in achieving the SDGs; organize public events, expert meetings, and site visits to allow participants to see the SDGs in action and learn from each other about successes and challenges they face; and research links between New York City’s sustainable development work, the Mayor’s commitment to equity, and the SDGs. Hiniker reports that since the establishment of the programme, the City has hosted tours, panel discussions and other events to discuss how NYC is localizing the SDGs.

Global Vision | Urban Action also identifies links between the SDGs and the 2015 ‘One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City’ (OneNYC), the City’s roadmap on economic growth, sustainability, and resiliency. OneNYC commits to lift 800,000 New Yorkers out of poverty or near poverty by 2025, to expand access to nutritious and affordable food, and to fight against climate change and strengthen resilience, among other goals. As outlined in the document, ‘OneNYC 2018: Progress Report,’ which assesses New York City’s progress on the plan, New York’s accomplishments so far include: a “record job and wage growth” and a “record low unemployment,” with gains in all five boroughs; and the lowest poverty level since the Great Recession. The report also notes that New York is the first major city or state in the US to commit to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels, and the first city to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The OneNYC plan is available on the OneNYC website, along with its progress reports each year. The website also includes a list of indicators and initiatives related to the plan, and links to the NYC Open Data platform.

The HLPF will convene from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, on the theme, ‘Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ It will conduct in-depth reviews of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The 2018 report also looks at how the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, respectively, are driving business strategy.

To generate the report, Ethical Corporation surveyed over 1,500 business professionals in a range of roles and sectors around the world, with 70% coming from Europe and North America. The survey identified how companies and business leaders are seeking to transform operations and outputs in order to deliver on the SDGs and Paris Agreement.

Among the findings, over two-thirds of corporate-brand respondents indicated that their company is integrating the SDGs into business strategy, which the authors note represents a significant and consistent increase in the two years since the Goals’ adoption in 2015. Of the remaining third of respondents, half indicated that they do not intend to do this in the future. Regionally, businesses in Europe and Asia-Pacific feature higher rates of integration than those in North America.

On the stage of SDG integration, 82% of respondents noted that they are currently in the mapping stage or integrating the Goals into business strategy. Only 12% claimed that the SDGs have been integrated across departments with clear goals set.

Despite this incomplete integration, the report finds that over half of respondents’ companies are using the SDGs as a framework to report on and communicate sustainability impacts. Thus, the authors underscore a risk of “SDG washing,” with companies using the SDGs as a communication tool “without much actual adaption to strategy or measurement of their impact towards the Goals.”

Indeed, 56% of respondents’ companies are not measuring their contributions to the SDGs. These findings are consistent with recent reports by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and KPMG.

On the primary SDG with which companies are engaging, the reports finds SDG 13 on climate action to be the clear leader across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America, with roughly two-thirds of companies in each region identifying SDG 13 as that which they engage in the most. The report also finds promising scope for climate action by US cities, states and corporations alike, highlighting the #WeAreStillIn movement as an important convergence of like-minded actors in response to the US announcement of its intention to withdraw the country from the Agreement. While respondents primarily see governments as being the most influential actors in ensuring that the Paris Agreement is met, over one-third felt that companies will be most influential. The report indicates that the vacuum of climate leadership from the US federal government has increased expectations and placed an onus on business leaders to carry climate objectives forward, as 68% of respondents report expecting their respective companies to “take a lead in helping meet the Paris Agreement.”

Similarly to previous years, responses show that there is still much progress to be made. In particular, businesses are struggling to measure the return on investment (ROI) of sustainability activities. However, 75% of respondents stated that “their CEO is convinced of the value of sustainability,” a slight increase from previous years.

Per the paper, almost all the 43 VNRs outline the importance of communication and public awareness regarding the SDGs, and approximately 20 of them refer directly to communication strategies or campaigns targeting the general public.

Two independent consultants on behalf of the P4R secretariat produced the non-paper titled, ‘Comparative Analysis of 43 VNRs Submitted to the HLPF 2017.’ It assesses VNRs from the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.

The paper finds that VNR reports vary in many aspects, such as length, structure, and thematic coverage, and that references to national follow-up and review “come in many different shapes and sizes.” For instance, it notes that some VNRs use the term “follow-up” to describe implementation, while others use it as a heading to explain their next steps, and some interpret “review” as “reporting,” although both terms are used interchangeably, with an emphasis on monitoring progress. The paper outlines challenges related to the SDG process, including on: monitoring, evaluation and statistical capacity; general data availability and difficulty of compiling and using disaggregated data; alignment of national strategies and plans, and of institutions; and financing and resource mobilization.

The authors find that the main institutional mechanisms steering the overall SDG process are assigning the responsibility to a specific ministry, or to a cross-sectoral (and sometimes multi-stakeholder) committee or council. Per the report, 23 countries have assigned the lead for SDG implementation to a specific ministry or to the offices of the Presidency or the Prime Minister, and a smaller number of countries are building on pre-existing sustainable-development related councils, commissions or committees to coordinate SDG planning and review. The authors also note that 16 countries have “recently” established lead councils, commissions or committees to steer and coordinate implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and that the 2017 VNRs indicate “an increasing recognition” of sub-national level actors and institutions as key to successful SDG implementation, compared to 2016.

According to the paper, all 43 VNRs describe efforts to ensure participation of non-state actors (civil society, private sector and academia) in the SDG process, with some devoting entire chapters or annexes to individual stakeholder groups, describing their roles, the mechanisms of their involvement and/or their contributions to the implementation of specific SDGs. The two main approaches used for non-state actor involvement are representation in institutionalized committees, and participation in special consultations, the paper notes, but both are not mutually exclusive. It adds that while some countries engage in special projects or partnerships with the private sector, countries have established private-sector or academic advisory committees in very few cases.

On statistics and data, the 2017 VNRs show considerable variation, according to the P4R paper, with countries providing different levels and structures of disaggregated data, from “mere numerical presentation” to charts, graphs and verbal explanations, and with statistical annexes ranging from one to more than 100 pages. The paper also outlines few references to the use of non-official data, with 14 countries mentioning big or other “alternative” data. Six VNRs mention data contributed by civil-society and other stakeholders.

P4R is a transnational multi-stakeholder network composed of government representatives and stakeholders from civil society, the private sector and academia. Initiated “on behalf” of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, P4R facilitates dialogue and peer learning on SDG challenges, provides space to explore best practices and lessons learned, and shares expertise on new and emerging issues related to national monitoring and review processes.

The non-paper was prepared in advance of a P4R meeting that took place from 11-12 April 2018, in Tbilisi, Georgia. It adds to a series of reports consolidating and analyzing VNRs, such as the report ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the VNR Reports Submitted to the HLPF in 2017’ published by the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC), in collaboration with other civil society organizations. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has also issued synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs, as well as a compendium that synthesizes institutional arrangements adopted by the 64 countries that presented their VNRs during the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the HLPF.

78 percent believe that new technologies will compel businesses to improve their environmental impact on their own, regardless of pressure from regulators, consumers or investors.

75 percent of companies consider the environmental impact of a technology when deciding to implement it.

80 percent of business leaders believe consumers will start holding businesses more accountable for environmental impact due to the ubiquity of new technologies.

Extending Our Horizons: Assessing Credit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate (UN Environment, Oliver Wyman and Mercer) sets out a methodology for assessing risks and opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. The methodology is based on input from 16 global banks.

Global Carbon Account 2018 (Institute for Climate Economics) finds that 46 countries and 26 provinces/cities have adopted carbon pricing policies. The report also estimates that carbon pricing initiatives generated $32 billion in revenues in 2017 — up from $22 billion in 2016.

Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2018 (UN Environment, the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre and Bloomberg New Energy Finance) finds that global investment in renewables exceeded $200 billion for the eighth year in a row, with China investing a record $126.6 billion — up 31 percent compared to 2016 levels. The report also finds that a record 98 GW of new solar capacity was installed globally last year, outpacing fossil fuel power generating capacity additions.

The Production and Use of Renewable Natural Gas as a Climate Strategy in the United States (World Resources Institute) explores renewable natural gas (RNG) production trends, climate benefits, economic feasibility and more. The report concludes that renewable natural gas could serve as a viable climate change strategy in the United States when it meets two conditions: It is produced from waste; and its use reduces methane emissions to the atmosphere.

SDG Sector Roadmaps (WBCSD) lays out a methodology to help companies establish their sector’s current level of interaction with the SDGs across the value chain; identify their sector’s top opportunities for impact, as well as barriers, potential solutions and impact accelerators; and establish key action items and monitoring systems that chart a course towards the sector’s 2030 vision.

The Work Ahead: Machines, Skills, and U.S. Leadership in the Twenty-First Century (Council on Foreign Relations) assesses the impact that technological advances will have on jobs and workers in the U.S., as well as the implications for the U.S. economy and national security. The report also lays out seven recommendations to help U.S. leaders meet the workforce challenges of the 21st century.

Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report (International Energy Agency, the International Renewable Energy Agency, United Nations Statistics Division, the World Bank and the World Health Organization) provides an update on the world’s progress against global energy targets on access to electricity, clean cooking, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Key findings include:

1 billion people — or 13 percent of the world’s population — still live without electricity; an estimated 674 million people are projected to still live without electricity in 2030.

3 billion people — or more than 40 percent of the world’s population — do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies.

As of 2015, the world obtained 17.5 percent of its total energy consumption from renewable sources; the global renewable share is expected to reach 21 percent by 2030.

Why Carbon Pricing Matters: A Guide for Implementation (WBCSD) makes recommendations to policymakers on how to best implement a carbon price. The guide also draws on business insight to identify the top-5 reasons why policymakers should adopt carbon pricing: lowest-cost pathway; technology neutrality; flexibility; transparency and burden sharing; and long-term signals encouraging development.","Building Pressure (CDP) ranks 13 large publicly listed cement companies, representing 15 percent of global cement production, on their business readiness for a low-carbon transition.

The report reflects on Africa’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and makes recommendations for integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The report titled, ‘Integrating and Tracking Performance on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: From Theory to Practice,’ urges countries to consider the interlinkages among the two agendas’ goals, targets and indicators to ensure horizontal and vertical integration of initiatives into national development plans. In the report, horizontal coherence refers to coherence between a national development plan and a country’s international development commitments and initiatives. Vertical coherence relates to synergies among goals, targets and indicators, such as between the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. According to the report, levels of convergence between the two frameworks include 90% convergence at the Goal level, and 69% at the target level.

To support integration, the report presents the UNECA’s integrated planning and reporting toolkit, which aims to facilitate integration of multiple development frameworks into national development plans and to track implementation progress. The toolkit is intended for use by line ministries and others responsible for development planning at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as for civil society and the private sector to track progress.

Users can apply the toolkit to evaluate the extent to which their national development plans and sectoral plans align with external frameworks. The software asks the user to identify the national goal, target or indicator that best matches the corresponding variable of the 2030 Agenda or Agenda 2063. If the goal, target and indicator is an exact match, the alignment is classified as “full.” If the national variable is a proxy, the alignment is considered to be “partial.” Variables can also be defined as having “no alignment.”

The software also facilitates performance tracking on all indicators of a country’s integrated national development plan.

In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs.

According to the 35 messages currently available online, most of these countries have put in place institutional arrangements to advance SDG implementation, and have outlined the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders.



VNR main messages provide a brief overview of more comprehensive document which is currently prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts. On 7 June 2018, main messages were available for countries from all five UN regional groups, as follows: six from the African Group; eight from the Asia-Pacific Group; eight from the Eastern European Group (EEG); six from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC); and six from the Western European and Others Group (WEOG). VNR main messages were also available for Palestine, a UN observer State.

Countries have taken various approaches to highlight their main messages: some mainly focus on the SDGs under review at the 2018 HLPF, while others take a broader approach by referring to the 17 SDGs as a whole. Two highlight that they are considering an 18th SDG, specific to the national context. Countries generally outline efforts to implement the SDGs at the national level, while a few report on implementation efforts at the sub-national level and on integrating the SDGs as part of their international development frameworks.

African Group

Cabo Verde’s messages note that equitable, universal and sustainable access to energy, and water and sanitation are among the greatest challenges for the country, and mention the municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans as an example of local multi-stakeholder SDG platform. Egypt says that ensuring sustainable water resource management is a high priority for the Government, and its national strategic plan ‘Vision 2030’ is in line with SDGs. Guinea announces that its government will organize a national symposium on Sustainable Development and Fragility in June 2018, and plans to produce a VNR report annually.

Niger’s messages indicate that: the country’s VNR focuses on the six SDGs under review at the HLPF, namely: SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible Consumption and Production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Niger also reports that: its National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth and its Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021 are consistent with the SDGs; and 43 SDG targets and 66 indicators are considered as a priority for the country.

Sudan says its VNR was supported by recommendations resulting from the National Dialogue Conference that took place in 2015-2016, its debt burden is unsustainable (SDG target 17.4), and the “continuing reluctance” to admit Sudan to the group of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) is “unjustifiable.” Togo notes that access to electricity increased from 22.5% in 2008 to 35.6% in 2016, and rural electrification went from 3% in 2008 to 6.3% in 2016. It identifies securing land, decentralization, the digitalization of the economy, national statistics, and the financing of its economy as major SDG challenges.

Asia-Pacific Group

Bhutan notes it is “well on track” to implement the SDGs, and plans to establish an “entrepreneurship ecosystem” to provide a platform to generate green jobs through the participation of corporate and private sectors. As “one of the poorest countries in the Pacific,” Kiribati indicates that it has a special SDG Task force as part of its Development Coordination Committee, and is integrating its Mid-Term Review of its Development Plan 2016-2019 with its VNR.

Messages from Lao People’s Democratic Republic say its VNR report focuses on all 17 SDGs, and it has adopted an additional Goal 18 on “Lives Safe from Unexploded Ordnance (UXO),” considering that it is “the most heavily bombed country” in terms of bombs dropped per capita. The messages also note that: Lao PDR was among the “earliest countries to localize the SDGs;” it has a National Steering Committee for SDGs implementation chaired by the Prime Minister that includes members from all concerned ministries and agencies; and nearly 60% of its Eighth National Social-Economic Development Plan indicators are linked to SDG indicators.

According to Lebanon’s messages, its National Committee to oversee the roll-out of the SDGs is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes representatives from all line ministries, civil society and private sector representative. The country also: established a parliamentary committee on the SDGs and a statistical task force; has organized three workshops related to SDGs; and held regional consultations with civil society, while temporarily hosting 1.5 million displaced from Syria. Qatar says it has aligned its National Development Strategy 2018-2022 with the SDGs, and reports that: 100% of its population benefits from safe drinking water services; solid waste generation fell from about 9.6 million tons in 2011 to 4.6 million tons in 2016; protected areas represent 29.8% of Qatar’s total area, which is “one of the highest rates in the world,” and the government intends to establish and operate a biodiversity database by the end of 2022.

Saudi Arabia’s messages note that its VNR highlights progress on the 17 SDGs, and key SDG priority areas include: continuing the alignment of state programs and strategies with global SDGs targets and indicators; strengthening the role of SDGs at the sub-national level; and enhancing monitoring and evaluation infrastructure on SDGs. Singapore reports that its Inter-Ministry Committee on SDGs has organized multi-stakeholder consultations to assess progress, and that it used international rankings and indices to get an independent perspective of its progress vis-à-vis other countries. Sri Lanka says increasing multi-stakeholder engagement for the 2030 Agenda has been a key objective of its VNR process, and mainstreaming the SDGs into institutional plans is its main strategy to achieve the Goals. It reports that: its National Budget 2018 focuses on a “Blue Green Economy;” 89.5% of its population has access to safe drinking water; and renewable sources account for 53% of total primary energy supply.

Eastern European Group (EEG)

All EEG countries that are volunteering to present their VNR at the 2018 HLPF have submitted their main messages. Albania reports that its parliament has unanimously approved a resolution confirming Albania’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda, and the country has prepared an SDG baseline report which indicates that 83% of the SDG targets are directly tied to specific components of its National Strategy for Development and Integration 2016-2020. Armenia says it has established a National SDG Innovation Lab, in addition to other structures such as the ‘SDG Nationalization Inter-agency Task Force,’ and data for indicators have been developed by the National Statistical Service to assess SDG progress.

Hungary stresses the importance of building the SDGs and targets on the principles of guaranteeing human rights, solidarity and global partnership. It reports that 75% of the global SDG indicators are available in the country, and that all line ministries and other stakeholders, including the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, the Office of the Ombudsman for Future Generations, youth and the business sector, contributed to its VNR.

Main messages from Latvia state that its VNR sets the baseline for all 17 SDGs, based on a mapping of the 169 SDG targets against its policies and plans, and the Cabinet of Ministers will decide on Latvia’s medium-term goals, indicators and targets within available funding limits. Lithuania reports that its VNR has been prepared by a group of experts that involved representatives of various ministries, NGOs and municipalities. It identifies, among other priorities, social inclusion and the promotion of eco-innovation and investment in new technologies. Poland says its VNR, prepared by ministries and other stakeholders through a “participatory approach,” includes a diagnosis, priorities, and key actions on SDGs.

Romania reports that it is in the process of reviewing its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) based on the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. A process of localizing the SDGs started in 2016, and has fed into both this VNR and its review of the NSDS. In its main messages, Slovakia expresses its commitment to implement the 2030 Agenda by integrating it into “all its public policies” at all levels, and outlines six national priorities that integrate the 17 SDGs: 1) education (SDGs 4, 8 and 10); transformation towards an environmentally sustainable and knowledge-based economy in the context of demographic change (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12); sustainability of settlements, regions and the countryside in the context of climate change (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13 and 15); social inclusion (SDGs 1, 2 and 10); rule of law, democracy and security (SDGs 5 and 16); and good health (SDGs 3 and 10).

Bahamas’ main messages report that youth unemployment rose to 30% in 2015, and that the government in collaboration with civil society and other stakeholders has created a pilot initiative for a traditionally marginalized region known as the “Over the Hill Community,” that focuses on social and economic empowerment, rejuvenation, smart and green technology and programmes on youth and the elderly. The Dominican Republic says work is underway to identify objectives and policy mixes that will boost synergies and accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda through reducing multidimensional poverty, more competitiveness and decent jobs, promoting sustainable production and consumption, making populations resilient to climate change and other risks, and achieving a strong and inclusive institutional framework at the State level.

Jamaica’s document notes that it has a national coordination mechanism for the 2030 Agenda, and there is a 91% alignment between both its Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs, but policy coherence and building capacity on policy integration need to be improved. It adds that it has a roadmap for SDGs implementation and 66 indicators to monitor the goals, and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica leads the process to establish a coordinated national statistical system.

Among its institutional arrangements for SDG implementation, Mexico’s messages outline its SDG Specialized Technical Committee for the SDGs, which coordinates the generating and monitoring of data. The messages also indicate that Mexico can follow up on 169 of the 232 global SDG indicators, and that it conducted an analysis of the contribution of federal budget programs to the SDG targets in 2017. At the sub-regional level, it reports that: by May 2018, 28 out of 32 Mexican states had SDG monitoring mechanisms in place; the federal government has developed a guide to incorporate the 2030 Agenda approach into state and municipal development plans; but capacity of sub-national governments need to be strengthened.

Paraguay says it has been working since 2016 to advance the alignment of the National Expenditure Budget with its national development plan ‘Paraguay 2030’ and the SDGs, and has created the Inter-institutional Coordination Commission for the implementation, follow-up and monitoring of the SDGs, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Related to the SDGs to be reviewed in depth at the HLPF, Uruguay reports that 95.2% of its population has access to safe water, and it is one of the most electrified countries in Latin America.

UN Observer State

Palestine reports that its Council of Ministers issued a decree establishing a national team headed by the Prime Minister’s Office and “composed of all relevant partners” to head SDG monitoring and implementation. It says its National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 includes 75 of the SDG targets, and it has adopted a set of principles to ensure the active participation of non-governmental actors in SDG implementation. Palestine proposes a 18th SDG on “Ending the occupation, and the consolidation of the independent State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” and states that “the continuation” of Israel’s occupation, and its “systematic and widespread violations of international law” is the biggest impediment for Palestine to achieve the SDGs.”

The HLPF will take place from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, and will consider the theme, ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’ VNRs will be presented during the Forum’s ministerial segment, from 16-18 July.

63,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-report-2018-finds-conflict-climate-change-inequality-hindering-progress/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Report 2018 Finds Conflict, Climate Change, Inequality Hindering Progress","20 June 2018: The UN has launched the 2018 version of the yearly Sustainable Development Goals Report. It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

The 2030 Agenda recognizes the positive contributions of migrants. In the declaration, heads of state and government commit to “cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights” (paragraph 29), which is similar to language used in SDG target 10.7. The SDG Knowledge Hub has covered the Global Compact on Migration (GCM) process, including the most recent round of negotiations, their outcomes, additional consultations and the Secretary-General’s report, ‘Making Migration Work for All.’ This policy brief highlights research and thought pieces behind the process and issues.

At the start of the calendar year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued a publication titled, ‘World Migration Report 2018.’ The ninth of its kind, this volume “demystifies” migration, noting in its forward the heightened importance of understanding migration’s complexities in today’s “post-truth” era. Using data through June 2017, the report outlines: global migration trends; regional development; the current migration governance structure; features of current news coverage of migration; and linkages between migration, social exclusion and other hardships faced.

IOM also issued a report titled, ‘Migration in the 2030 Agenda,’ which compiles papers linking migration to thematic challenges across the SDGs. The papers suggest ways to address migration as part of efforts to implement individual Goals. As highlighted by IOM, migration is included in SDG targets 4.b, 5.2, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7, 10.c, 16.2 and 17.18.

A pilot study by IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) represents an effort to illustrate how far migrants are left behind, using harmonized census data. It discusses the potential to use such data to further monitor progress towards the SDGs, disaggregated by migratory status. SDG target 17.18 calls to increase the availability of data disaggregated by migratory status (among income, gender, age and other characteristics).

IOM GMDAC also authored a bulletin on a tool to quantify displacement and mobility. It describes IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), which aims to enable decision-making and targeted assistance in times of crisis. The DTM tracked over 30 million individuals across 72 countries in 2017, and is continuously being expanded in partnership with actors from the private sector and academia, and has fed into other reports, including the Global Report on Internal Displacement noted below. The GMDAC’s ‘Data Bulletin’ series informs the GCM process, with support from the EU.

The GMDAC previously developed Migration Governance Indicators (MGI), which have been used as a basis for assessing “well-managed migration policies,” per SDG target 10.7. The indicators help governments review the extent to which their migration policies are comprehensive, identify gaps, and advance the dialogue on migration, particularly in the context of the SDGs and the GCM. The first MGI assessment report for 15 pilot countries was released in 2016; a second report reviewing a new set of countries is forthcoming.

Also on data, the Migration Data Portal offers a tool to visualize and analyze migratory flows by country or region, as well as examine important data points on migrants’ vulnerability, well-being and remittance payments and costs. The Portal also features information on migration policy and public opinion, which can also affect other indicators such as migrants’ well-being. A summary guide is available on Data Driven Journalism. The Portal’s blog offers additional support, including a post on how to improve data on missing migrants, given the urgent need to address the more than 27,000 migrant deaths and disappearances recorded since 2014.

These efforts to collect and manage migration data are not implemented alone. The Global Migration Group (GMG) and Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) released a flagship publication in November 2017 with the IOM, World Bank Group, Governments of Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, and the broader UN system. The report is divided into four parts: concepts and criteria on migration; reasons for migration; linkages between migration and development; and protection of migrants. Titled, ‘Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ the report aims to be the go-to guide for integrating migrant priorities, policies and data into national development plans and strategies. It synthesizes best practices and lessons learned across the 16 GMG members, highlighting data needs, sources and gaps, and calling for common measures that allow comparisons migration patterns across countries and regions.

The KNOMAD partnership publishes regularly on ‘Migration and Development,’ and released its 29th brief on the subject in April 2018. This brief focuses on migration and remittances, reviewing trends in remittance and migration flows and the topic of “transit migration” where migrants temporarily stay in a country other than their intended final destination. The brief describes reasons for transit migration (both push and pull factors), regional patterns, and transit migration’s impacts on individuals, families, and the three countries involved (origin, transit and destination). The brief also notes that a significant percentage of transit migration is facilitated by smugglers. A full list of KNOMAD publications is available here.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released a report that finds over 2.5 million migrants were smuggled worldwide in 2016. Titled ‘Global Study on Smuggling of Migrants,’ the publication describes major smuggling routes around the world, and quantifies the scope of the issue, estimating that smugglers are collectively paid over US$7 billion per year. It underscores that smugglers expose migrants to risks including violence, theft, exploitation, kidnapping and death.

June 20 marked World Refugee Day. Released one day prior, the UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) ‘Global Trends’ report examines forced displacement in 2017. It finds that over 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced as of the end of 2017, 16.2 million of them being displaced that year. More than half of displaced persons are children. Of these figures, the report notes that 40 million people are internally displaced, 25.4 million are refugees who have fled their home countries to escape conflict, and 3.1 million are asylum seekers.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released a publication titled, ‘Global Report on Internal Displacement.’ The report focuses on the global displacement landscape and regional overviews, progress in reducing internal displacement, and the need for better data. It flags displacement from natural disasters as a key driver within countries, noting the issue as “both a cause and consequence of insecurity and low or unequal economic and social development.” The report sees national sovereignty as an opportunity, calling for country-led strategies to account for internal displacement risk, build governance capacity and integrate the risk into existing mechanisms. Harjeet Singh, ActionAid International, flags the report’s coverage of climate migration in an op-ed on IPS News. Separately, IOM’s Environmental Migration Portal also serves as a platform to share knowledge on the migration-environment nexus.

In its discussion on the budget for 2021-2027, the EU is proposing a near-tripling of funds for migration, asylum and border management. The Center for Global Development reviews the proposal here. Stay tuned for more on the EU budget and aid in the coming weeks.

65,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unwto-report-links-sustainable-tourism-to-17-sdgs/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNWTO Report Links Sustainable Tourism to 17 SDGs,"6 June 2018: The UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has published a two-volume report titled, ‘Tourism for Development,’ that makes recommendations on the ways in which tourism could contribute to sustainable development and the SDGs, and illustrates the global reach and positive effects of tourism on other sectors.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

66,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/vnr-2018-main-messages-available-for-45-countries/,"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,VNR 2018 Main Messages Available for 45 Countries,"18 June 2018: Of the 47 countries presenting their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July, 45 have made their report’s main messages available. Some of these countries presented their VNRs at previous HLPF sessions (Benin, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Switzerland, Togo and Uruguay), and are updating their progress on the SDGs.

The VNRs were called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate the sharing of national experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. The “main messages” provide a brief overview of more comprehensive review documents that are prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts during the HLPF.

By 7 June 2018, main messages were available for 35 countries, including all of the Eastern European Group (EEG) countries that will present at the 2018 HLPF. Between 8 and 18 June, 10 additional countries’ messages became available: Benin, Mali, Republic of Congo and Senegal; Bahrain, UAE and Viet Nam; Colombia and Ecuador; and Andorra.

African Group

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized. The prioritized SDGs are: SDG 2 on zero hunger, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 15 on life on land, and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

Per its summary, the Republic of Congo established a steering committee in charge of following-up on the SDGs, and is preparing an action plan for SDG implementation that should provide information on related costs for their implementation. It notes mobilizing funding for the effective and efficient operationalization of the SDGs as one of the main challenges facing the country.

Senegal’s messages note that the process of alignment between the SDGs and the ‘Plan for an Emerging Senegal’ (PES)– a policy framework to get Senegal onto the road to development in 2035 –was launched in January 2016 by the government. Its priority actions cover nearly 77% of the SDG targets. It also reports that “inclusive” mechanisms, such as an SDG monitoring platform for CSOs, were established, but that participation of some stakeholders such as the private sector, parliamentarians and local elected representatives, should be further strengthened.

Asia-Pacific Group

Bahrain’s messages state that the Government Plan of Action (GPA) is aligned with 78% of the SDGs, and the country’s Constitution and public policies guarantee universal access to basic services, and gender equality. The country reports that basic education is free and compulsory, healthcare is free and universal, and two committees instituted by the Supreme Council for Women ensure equal opportunities and gender responsive budgeting. It also indicates that: women hold 55% of supervisory positions, with 53% and 33% participation in the public and private sectors respectively; public and civil society-led programs extend to migrant workers to safeguard their rights, provide health insurance and shelter, and combat human trafficking; five new sustainable cities are being developed; and remittances of migrant workers in Bahrain amounted to approximately US$2.5 billion in 2017.

In its messages, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announces that the SDGs and sustainability will be a central focus of Expo 2020 Dubai, and its SDG National Committee serves as a platform for multi‐stakeholder engagement. The Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, is vice-chaired by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, and comprises 17 federal government organizations, according to the VNR messages.

On progress related to SDG implementation, the UAE indicates that the SDG National Committee has: prioritized targets “to pursue on an annual basis;” determined criteria for incorporating SDG targets into the national development agenda; assessed the scope of SDG implementation “given resource capacities and constraints in a particular year;” and developed a comprehensive communication strategy to engage societal stakeholders on the SDGs. The UAE also notes that: a Private‐Sector Advisory Council reports to the vice‐chair of the SDG National Committee; it has a Minister of State for Youth Affairs; it launched the Emirates Youth Council; and seven emirate‐wide Local Youth Councils are involved in official deliberations concerning SDG implementation.

Viet Nam states that the 17 SDGs have been nationalized into 115 Vietnamese SDG targets and in its national action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It adds that sustainable development principles have been mainstreamed into its 2011-2020 Social and Economic Development Strategy and its 2016-2020 Social and Economic Development Plan. The country’s key messages note that the Viet Nam Business Council for Sustainable Development aims to enable the business community to share and spread good practices, and to play an “important role” in realizing the SDGs.

Per the messages, Viet Nam has a number of policies aimed at promoting social equality to ensure that no one is left behind, and the country has achieved a number of SDG-related results. For instance, its national multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.9% in 2015 to less than 7% in 2017; 93.4% of households in 2016 had access to safe water, and 99% of Vietnamese households had access to electricity during the same year.

Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)

Colombia’s executive summary notes that in addition to the SDG initiatives it reported on in its 2016 VNR, it has developed a national strategy (CONPES 3918) to implement the goals. The strategy, it says, includes, inter alia: a monitoring process with national indicators and quantifiable targets; institutional responsibilities; a plan for strengthening statistical capacities; and a communication strategy seeking to promote alliances with non-governmental actors.

The summary indicates that the website www.ods.gov.co comprises updated information on the country’s progress towards the goals, and that a mapping of resources from different public domestic sources and their allocation to each SDG has been prepared as a starting point for the development of a financing strategy. It also reports that a joint initiative is being developed with the private sector where companies can provide information that will enable them to make their SDG support more visible, and dialogues took place in different parts of the country to highlight SDG challenges and successful experiences.

According to its main messages, Ecuador has developed SDG “Flagship Interventions,” and has established mechanisms for the alignment, monitoring and evaluation of its planning with the 2030 Agenda. Among the SDGs to be examined in depth at the HLPF 2018, the VNR messages report that: guaranteeing universal access to water (SDG 6) is a priority for the Ecuadorian government and the “Safe Water and Sanitation for All” strategy is being implemented; and various programmes have contributed to maintain more than 16% of the national territory under conservation or environmental management (SDG 15). The messages also note that the VNR’s preparation was based on contributions from the government, private sector, academia, civil society and local governments.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Andorra reports that each “action” submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval must be associated with the SDGs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aligned its annual master plan for international cooperation with the goals. Its VNR summary notes that the Andorran private and financial sectors have integrated the 2030 Agenda into their social responsibility strategies, and education for sustainable development is a key concept of the Andorran education system, which it says, also integrates in a transversal way, education for human rights and democratic citizenship. It stresses the need to strengthen the production of statistical data, adding that the government has approved it statistical plan 2018-2021.

On SDGs examined in the VNR, Andorra says that in addition to the six goals reviewed in depth at the 2018 HLPF, it has also included Goals 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action), which are of particular importance for the country. On the VNR preparation, the Andorra’s summary states that an inter-ministerial team was set up to draft the report, national bodies representing civil society were asked to participate in the drafting process, and an emphasis was placed on the collection of statistical data. It also reports on the launch of a public consultation on the Internet and on an awareness and information campaign on the VNR.

The UN Secretariat has posted online an unedited version of a compilation of main messages made available by countries that are presenting their 2018 VNRs.

67,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/sdg-11-building-the-worlds-smart-sustainable-cities-together/,"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: SDG 11: Building the World’s Smart Sustainable Cities Together,"The 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), meeting from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, will review in depth SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land). The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.

More than 50% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. By 2050, it will be nearly 70%. This raises huge challenges for municipalities and city planners. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer the solution to many of these challenges. At the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN specialized agency for ICTs, we are working to develop the tremendous potential ICTs have to help build smarter, more sustainable cities.

Indeed, many cities across the world are already utilizing Big Data analytics gathered from smart sensors and connected devices to manage traffic, reduce energy usage – and improve a wide range of urban operations and services.

If we want to reach the targets set out by the UN SDG 11, we need to work together to develop the tools that will help cities become truly smart and sustainable.

To succeed, international organizations, national governments, municipalities and local partners from civil society, academia and the private sector need to join forces.

Taking Action

Thankfully, there are encouraging signs of such collaboration.

ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC) in 2016. U4SSC is now supported by 16 UN bodies, and over 50 cities have now joined ITU’s pilot project.

U4SSC has facilitated the development of internationally recognized key performance indicators (KPIs) which allow cities to set goals and measure progress on becoming smarter and more sustainable. The indicators, developed by international experts in ITU and UN bodies, fall under five overarching categories: the use of ICTs; physical infrastructure; equity and social inclusion; quality of life; and environmental sustainability.

Recently, many cities including Dubai, Singapore, Montevideo, Maldonado, Moscow, Valencia, Pully and Rimini have asked ITU for assistance in the implementation of the U4SSC KPIs. In the past few months ITU has published case studies on the efforts of Dubai and Singapore to apply smart city innovations, providing a valuable reference point to other cities pursuing greater efficiency and sustainability.

The creation of smart cities requires a trusted infrastructure capable of supporting an enormous volume of ICT-based applications and services, which in turn requires coordinated adherence to common standards that ensure openness and interoperability. ITU develops international standards to enable the coordinated development of Internet of Things technologies and their application in smart cities. They also outlined how smart grids can help to build more controllable and efficient energy systems. Work on standards for smart 5G systems, which will help improve the feasibility of smart processes in large urban areas, is underway.

More Efficient Cities, By and For People

Standards can be powerful agents of change. Their application allows cities to reduce energy costs and emissions through more efficient buildings, electricity grids, street lights, transportation systems, and energy and water networks at a time when cities already account for 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

But smart, sustainable cities are about more than just reduced energy costs and emissions – they also aim for the realization of a better quality of urban life for all. New intelligent solutions, underpinned by smart sensors, can improve the safety and well-being of inhabitants.

Here are just a few examples. In Singapore, sensors and cameras build on an existing digital system to enable the government to send signals to drivers to improve traffic flow. In Kolkata, a social enterprise is using geographic information systems to map unplanned settlements, providing addresses and vital services for the inhabitants. In Quito, a mobile platform for women to report sexual harassment on the municipal public transport system is improving the way the city is policed. Digital technologies are also used to enhance citizen engagement and participation.

A Radical Shift for Resilient and Sustainable Societies

The transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies requires the redesign of our cities as well as a radical shift in our patterns of production, consumption, and waste.

Digital technologies give us an opportunity to develop more intelligent and inclusive urban systems where waste, costs, and ecological impacts are minimized, and where urban operations and processes, increasingly cognizant of the multiple stakeholders involved, can enhance quality of life for all. These technologies give us an opportunity to drive success not just on SDG 11, but on several other SDGs, demonstrating the significant impact that ICTs can have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

But the transition towards smart, sustainable cities requires collective intention and increased collaboration between citizens, businesses, and governments. Together, we can design more efficient, ecological and people-centered cities, which drive, rather than hinder, individual well-being and sustainable development.","The 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), meeting from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, will review in depth SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land).
The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.
ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC) in 2016.

But, increasingly, he's trying to lead the way on global sustainability issues, too.

That's because he believes he has a personal role to play in improving the planet, the ""Black Panther"" star told CNBC Make It.

It all started with a phone call from the United Nations in 2006. Whitaker had just wrapped filming ""The Last King of Scotland"" and was helping a friend volunteer with child soldiers in Uganda when the international peace organization got in touch to find out more.

""The UN saw what I was doing and asked if I would come in and talk about what was going on,"" said Whitaker.

The project had not been on the UN's radar, he said, nor on the agenda of local government. So, he decided he had to do more himself.

The actor set about extending his charity work, and, in 2012, set up the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative, a non-governmental organization designed to help communities torn apart by violence in Africa and North America. In 2015, in recognition of his work, Whitaker was named as an advocate for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — 17 targets aimed at tackling global challenges such as poverty and climate change by 2030.

""When the UN Secretary-General appointed me as SDG advocate, it was very clear for me that this agenda was different from previous ones,"" Whitaker told audiences at Temasek Ecosperity 2018, a sustainability conference in Singapore in June.

""It did not presume that governments and international organizations are going to do everything and substitute themselves for people and communities.""","You're used to seeing Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker take the lead on the big screen.

The 2017 annual report is the fourth annual progress report on the implementation of UN-Habitat’s six-year strategic plan (2014-2019). The publication focuses on: ongoing processes related to strengthening UN-Habitat; specific challenges related to urbanization and human settlements and UN-Habitat’s response strategy; and UN-Habitat’s coordination role of monitoring and assessing implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the NUA.

Among the examples of the organization’s work in 2017, the report discusses UN-Habitat’s contribution to conflict resolution through addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus in Iraq, helping to reintegrate Yazidis, who have been victims of ethnic and religious violence. In alignment with SDG 11, other SDGs with urban dimensions and the NUA, UN-Habitat: provided emergency relief supplies such as water; constructed sanitation and health facilities; provided emergency shelter; and built capacities of local and national authorities in urban planning and management.

In an effort to promote the central role of housing in ensuring the sustainable development of cities and human settlements, UN-Habitat helped develop a Global Housing Strategy to assist countries in adopting strategies, policies and legislation for sustainable urbanization that ensures citizen engagement. For example, in Mexico, UN-Habitat helped provide housing by introducing a mechanism for measuring city prosperity, enabling the city of Zapopan to adopt a strategy that ensured the centrality of housing and individuals to all urban planning initiatives.

UN-Habitat coordinates monitoring and assessment of implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the New Urban Agenda.

To advance the SDGs by reaching out to low-income populations, UN-Habitat partnered with Infonavit, a Latin American mortgage lender, to ensure access to affordable mortgage financing. The report also highlights UN-Habitat and Infonavit’s collaboration on establishing an SDG Certification Programme for Housing, which will assess the compatibility of real estate development projects with relevant SDGs, particularly SDG 11, and provide real estate developers with greater incentives to develop projects that comply with the SDGs.

The report also discusses UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index (CPI), which offers tools for cities to formulate policies. The Index has been adapted to respond to SDG and NUA monitoring and reporting, and helps harmonize methodologies with agreed standards and indicators. The report explains that, inter alia: over 400 cities are implementing the CPI; 52 national statistical offices are using UN-Habitat’s tools and guidelines producing urban data and indicators that support SDG monitoring and reporting; 181 national and local authorities and partners have implemented sustainable urbanization plans and strategies; and 374 urban observatories are using UN-Habitat tools, methods and data in monitoring urban trends at national and local levels.

The report notes that mainstreaming UN-Habitat’s four cross-cutting issues (youth, gender, climate change and human rights) requires that every project contribute to the NUA and the SDGs.

According to the report, UN-Habitat’s financial performance on urban land legislation and governance reflects the importance of land in sustainable urbanization, risk reduction and rehabilitation. In addition to urban land issues, the Bank met or exceeded its implementation targets on research and capacity building, and development of methodologies to monitor implementation of the urban dimensions of the SDGs.

72,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/dust-disrespects-political-boundaries-lets-act-together/,"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Guest Article: Dust Disregards Political Boundaries, Let’s Act Together","In March this year, an unusual sand and dust storm nicknamed ‘Mars on Earth or Orange Snow[1]’ transported and deposited dust that transformed European landscapes into a surreal orange-tinted scenery. An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

73,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/unleash-is-a-movement-of-positivism/,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: UNLEASH Is A Movement of Positivism,"The grand finale of the world’s largest Innovation Lab took place a few weeks back in Singapore. The 2018 UNLEASH SDG Innovation Lab brought together 1,000 youth from 108 countries for an 8-day intense programme designed to accelerate innovative solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

74,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-adopts-resolution-on-un-development-system-reform/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Adopts Resolution on UN Development System Reform,"31 May 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a resolution on the repositioning of the UN development system, in order to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By this decision, the functions of the Resident Coordinators (RCs) of the UN system in each country are separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said that, while the resolution is not seen by everyone as “the perfect document,” it represents a legitimate outcome of a multilateral process.

The consultation process on the resolution was co-facilitated by Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, and agreed on 7 May 2018 via silence procedure. The UNGA held a plenary meeting on 31 May 2018 to adopt the final draft text titled, ‘Repositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system’ (A/72/L.52).

The agreed text, inter alia: requests the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with the UN development system entities, to present an implementation plan for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system, including on the operationalization of its funding arrangements, to the UNGA before the end of the 72nd session; and endorses the transformation of the Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to assume managerial and oversight functions of the RC system under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary-General and under the ownership of the members of the ‘UN Sustainable Development Group,’ as a stand-alone coordination office within the Secretariat, reporting to the Chair of the Group (the Deputy-Secretary-General).

The funding arrangements for the new RC system are set out in a “hybrid solution” negotiated through the intergovernmental consultation process. UN Member States would provide the RC system with up to US$255 million annually, beginning in January 2019, through three sources: a 1% coordination levy on strictly earmarked, third-party, non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source; doubling the current UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Assembly following the adoption of the text. He announced that he will move immediately to put in place a transition team, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General, to implement Member States’ decisions. He noted that the reforms will enable the UN’s teams on the ground to better tailor their presence, skill sets and overall response to Member States’ priorities. In particular, the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) will better reflect country priorities and country needs, and the RCs will be impartial and empowered, with “development as their DNA.”

The Secretary-General emphasized that his preference would have been to fund the RC system through the regular UN budget, in order to ensure predictability, sustainability and ownership from all Member States. However, he noted, the hybrid funding solution put forward by the co-facilitators “is the best possible alternative.” He appealed to Member States for their immediate support so that the reforms starts to be implemented on 1 January 2019. Guterres added that the resolution represents the foundations to place sustainable development at the heart of the UN, and to advance the SDGs with poverty as the first goal.

A representative of the UN Secretariat explained that, in order to implement the provisions of the resolution, requirements amounting to approximately US$255 million would be needed on an annual basis, with the major portion of the requirements necessitating extrabudgetary resources. She expressed hope that front-loaded voluntary contributions will be received in 2018 to expedite the inception of the reinvigorated RC system as of 1 January 2019. She further added that the UN Secretariat’s share of the UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement pertaining to 2019 will be US$13-US$16 million.

In the ensuing discussion, India said the modalities for funding the proposals in the adopted text are “significantly different” than those contained in the Secretary-General’s initial funding proposals, ignoring the views and consensus of a large part of the UN membership on the need for predictable and sufficient resources for the proposed reforms. He added that the availability of resources remains unclear, and the proposed cost sharing for the RC system increases uncertainty. The US expressed the expectation that the reforms will reduce bureaucracy, improve performance, and increase flexibility for agencies to quickly respond to challenges.

The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Ethiopia for the African Group, stressed that the resolution “explicitly states” that the UNDAF should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national governments, through an open and inclusive dialogue between the host government and the UN development system, and in accordance with national development policies, tailored to priorities and the country needs. He cautioned that if the resolution is poorly implemented, the Group’s member states will bear the brunt of the costs, and this poses particular risks for the smallest and most vulnerable countries.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said the LDCs prefer no reductions in the country presence of the UN development system. The proposal of 50% common premises by 2021 should not incur any additional financial burden for LDCs, he added. He requested the UN Secretariat to ensure that the annual report on system-wide support to the UN development system provides disaggregated data and information on LDCs in every chapter, and has a separate section on LDCs highlighting the progress and challenges in these countries.

The EU noted that the agencies of the UN development system will be “in the driver’s seat.” Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), said the RC function is moving from being dependent on the infrastructure of a US$5 billion organization to that of an office that currently has a staff of 30. In this context, careful handling and maintenance of relationships is paramount, particularly during the transition period. CANZ added that the upcoming funding dialogue should be seized as an opportunity to explore how different types of partnerships can support the work of the UN development system and ensure an expanded funding base that moves beyond a small group of traditional donors.

Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) called for the reform to address multi-country offices (MCOs), and highlighted the need for dependable funding for small island states to implement it. CANZ welcomed the MCOs review.

Lajcak said the actions to be undertaken in the reforms to the UN development system cannot be considered in a vacuum, but the momentum needs to be brought forward into: the ECOSOC review and alignment process; the discussions on UN management reform and the UN’s peace and security pillar; as well as in Member States’ daily work.

The “repositioning” process began with an ECOSOC dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption, in December 2016, of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. The UN Secretary-General then delivered two mandated reports outlining proposals for reforms to the UN development system, in June and December 2017. These proposals were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings led by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, in January and February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” addressing questions raised by Member States during the briefings.

The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during ECOSOC’s Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), in February and March 2018. Petersen and Boukadoum then guided Member States in a six-week consultation process to agree on the resolution.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever. WHO announced that the number of new cases fell in April and May, meaning that the outbreak is no longer a national health emergency. [UN Press Release on Lassa Fever]

On 17 May, the UN marked the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) with a message urging an end to discrimination against LGBTI people. In conjunction with the Day, UNAIDS noted that men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the communities most affected by HIV. However, UN agencies report that more than 40% of countries criminalize same-sex relationships, effectively blocking gay and lesbian people from accessing healthcare and social services.

Photo by: Cia Pak / U.N. / CC BY-NC-ND

CANBERRA — For much of the past year, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been carrying out a rigorous assessment into how businesses, government departments, civil society organizations, and more have been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. That voluntary national review, the nation’s first, looks at how SDGs are woven into all sectors — as well as the challenges faced in assessing them.

In the report launched in Sydney on June 15, Australia chose a case-study style of reporting with snapshots into activities across the 17 goals. The aim is to demonstrate both that the SDGs are a core part of government policy and services delivery, and that there is wide external support to help make the goals a success.

Australia’s SDG implementation strategy

The SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

According to the review, Australia’s approach to SDG implementation is to identify key areas of activity appropriate to Australia’s “national circumstances.” At the federal level, policy requirements will be determined by priorities delegated to government agencies or other levels of government.

Progressing the SDGs: What are the barriers and solutions to national implementation? At Australia's second Sustainable Development Goals Summit, held in Melbourne on March 13, participants highlighted a number of barriers to implementing the SDGs on a national scale, in a country that considers the goals more linked to the Millennium Development Goals than to domestic politics.

It is nearing three years since the SDGs were adopted in September 2015, yet the review finds that Australia is still engaging domestically to identify policies and programs that are contributing to the outcome of the goals.

During the report launch, Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop identified four goals of particular importance to Australia: Gender equality; inclusive and sustainable economic growth; ocean conservation; and peace and governance — goals 5, 8, 14, and 16 respectively.

“There is a very strong alignment between the SDGs and Australia,” Bishop said. “What is important, though, is that we all work in partnership, government, business, civil society, private sector, the public sector. This is an effort for us all.”

Three hundred and twelve government and nongovernment agencies were consulted for the review. Key stakeholders engaged to provide feedback for the VNR included the Australian Council for International Development, Global Compact Network Australia, United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, U.N. Association of Australia, People with Disability Australia, National Congress of Australia’s First People and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Nongovernment sectors including universities, businesses, and civil society are expected to contribute to the goals in building public awareness, as well as progressing the implementation of the SDGs “beyond ‘business as usual’ to make a real impact.”

Australia’s strengths, the report suggests, lie in innovation, technical capability, and its willingness to share knowledge with the world. Building upon this, DFAT hopes they can reduce inequality within Australia and globally.

Investigating interlinkages

Due to the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, it is important to look at how the goals connect and where associations can be made for greater impact. Through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s work, Australia is applying this approach in their SDG implementation.

“CSIRO’s work has shown that taking such an approach, identifying both positive and negative interactions, could help us achieve global outcomes at a significantly lower cost through thoughtful coordination of otherwise fragmented action,” the report reads. “Likewise, identifying trade-offs ahead of time could enable conflicts among objectives to be managed before they become institutionalised.”

Through this work, Australia is hoping to demonstrate that the SDGs can act as a “tool” for organizations to identify and mitigate risk and opportunities outside of their core business or functions. This will allow the SDGs to move from government-supported action to whole-of-Australia supported action.

Equally, by encouraging collaboration between organizations, Australia hopes to create stronger interlinkages between the goals.

“For example, the South Australian Government’s Health in All Policies initiative takes a ‘joined-up’ policy development approach to achieve better public policy outcomes and simultaneously improve population health and wellbeing,” the report says. “Such an approach is based on the understanding that health is not just the product of health care activities, but is influenced by a wide range of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants of health.”

What about data?

SDGs show slow progress, not on track to reach 2030 targets, UN reports Conflict and climate change drove at some of the most significant setbacks documented in the 2018 SDGs report, such as a rise in global hunger rates.

Clearly missing from the report is data demonstrating where Australia lies in relation to progress against each goal, with targets that would determine what demonstrates success domestically as well as through its foreign aid program. But the report does lay out Australia’s data strategy for the SDGs.

According to the report, Australia will need “relevant, quality and timely statistics” that provide evidence for national decision-making and policy.

“We have made concerted efforts to identify relevant, pre-existing data sets that match or closely align to the SDG Indicators,” the report says. “In line with the UN Statistical Commission guidance, Australia has approached the issue of data analysis, identification and reporting from the perspective that countries will approach the indicator framework in line with their own national priorities and capabilities.”

In identifying relevant indicators for the SDG, the Australian Bureau of Statistics undertook a data mapping exercise to identify government-held data sources that could be used as an SDG indicator. But this is not a straightforward process.

“Like other countries, Australia has challenges in identifying datasets,” the report says.

Identifying data custodians and developing a single point of truth where there are multiple custodians are important. Australia is still trying to determine data collection and analysis methodology for a number of SDG indicators that have no current accepted methodology for collection.

Domestically, Australia is working to develop an SDG data platform to make relevant government datasets on SDG indicators available and will indicate the status of Australian data collection against all 232 SDG indicators — a portal expected to be updated based on available data and information, and not a static snapshot from a point in time.

Across time, it is expected this platform will help to identify progress, becoming an SDG reporting platform to support future VNRs.

Australia’s data strategy also takes into account support for neighboring countries through the foreign aid program to enhance their ability to collect, interpret, and analyze data that will help them in determining in-country needs and progress.

Case studies to illustrate Australia’s implementation approach

For many of the case studies used in the report, SDG linkage occurs as an afterthought.

To highlight Australia’s work to support goal 15 on forest management, the report uses the Australian Business and Biodiversity Initiative, an cross-sectoral alliance of organizations promoting the mainstreaming of biodiversity into business practices and decision-making.

But the initiative was established in 2014, before the adoption of the SDGs, and therefore the linkage to the goals tenuous.

Yet the format does help to demonstrate how the SDGs are at the core of “business-as-usual” operations in Australia, as well as the diverse role individuals and organizations outside government can play in their implementation.

Highlighting the work of Plan Australia in developing Free to Be, an interactive online map to help girls and women identify safe spaces in large cities, shows that addressing social challenges is important to Australia — and encouraging these ideas and initiatives will lead to greater change that can be seen by 2030.

The response

On the whole, the VNR has been largely applauded by Australia’s NGOs, that see it as a milestone in SDG implementation. But they also see the challenges it poses — both in Australia’s policy and reporting style.

For ACFID Chief Executive Officer Marc Purcell, the report highlights the challenges Australia faces in addressing health, economic, and social issues faced by Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The environmental challenges are also great, with the Great Barrier Reef under threat from climate change and policies enabling maritime pollution. And poverty continues to grow.

Still according to Purcell, the nature of the case study report showed the value of early adopters’ work, but also showed that examples were “few and far between.”

“To have any realistic chance of achieving the goals by 2030, Australia needs to rapidly transform the way it’s working and put sustainability at its heart,” he said. “We should not be imposing the burden of our failure to act on the next generation. The time for talking has passed, now is the time for action on the SDGs.”

Australia’s VNR will officially be presented to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development at the U.N. in New York, on July 17, by Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific.","Australia’s SDG implementation strategyThe SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

P. Nadda on Monday said India will achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target in maternal mortality by 2022 while the government's Ayushman Bharat, popularly known as Modicare, is aimed at changing the face of the country.

""India has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 139 per lakh (100,000) live births by achieving 130 by 2015. At this rate, we shall achieve SDG target of 70 by 2022, ahead of target timeline of 2030,"" Nadda said as he highlighted the achievements of his ministry in the last four years.

He said annual maternal deaths have fallen from 44,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2015, a reduction of 12,000, which is saving of 30 mothers per day. The country reduced its MMR by 37 points from 167 in 2011-2013 to 130 in 2014-16 due to strategic changes including focus on life cycle approach and multi-sectoral approach, he said.

Nadda said India's vision of universal health coverage is based on assured range of comprehensive primary care, linked to robust secondary and tertiary care being translated through Ayushman Bharat.

""Modicare is the world's largest healthcare programme. Its objective is not political. It is for changing the face of the country. Obamacare may be something else but Modicare is about the need to change the face of the country. We will solve all problems that will come our way,"" he said.

Ayushman Bharat programme has two components -- the PMRSSM promising medical cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for 10 crore poor and vulnerable families, which is about 50 crore individuals or 40 per cent of the country's population. The second component, Prime Minister Health and Wellness Centres (PMHWC), aims to convert 1.5 lakh primary health centres and sub-centres to Health and Wellness Centres.

""This will change the healthcare landscape in the country. We are moving as per the set timelines for implementing Ayushman Bharat. We shall be signing MoUs with 14 states on June 14. Under PMHWC, approval for transformation has been given to 19,000 this year.

""By second-third week of July, we will be ready with the IT platform. Identification of beneficiaries in rural areas is done 80 per cent. We want to provide a glitch-free system from the start. So, once the IT testing is done, the Prime Minister will launch the programme,"" he said.

Nadda further said that the government has given total flexibility to the states to choose their health system and how it suits them the best and further government is ready to provide the financial support also.

""Under free Drugs and Diagnostics Service Initiative medicine worth Rs 14,000 crore have been disbursed in last two and a half years. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis program, more than 2.38 lakh patients have been benefited. Amrit outlets provide drugs for cancer and cardiovascular diseases at 60-90 per cent discount. These outlets have helped patients save Rs 346.59 crore so far,"" he said.

Further, the minister said work has begun on the new AIIMS at Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Nagpur, Kalyani (West Bengal), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Bathinda (Punjab), Guwahati and Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh).

Pakistan is scheduled to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report titled, ‘Where Pakistan Stands on the Implementation of the SDGs 2018,’ was produced by AwazCDS-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Development Alliance, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Pakistan and UK Aid, and first circulated in March 2018. The report documents the findings of an SDG assessment carried out by stakeholders at the provincial and federal levels. Per the authors, the assessment has been shared with government bodies, parliamentarians and other stakeholders to “generate a dialogue.”

The assessment of Pakistan’s SDG implementation is based on a framework comprising the following components: alignment of national, provincial and local SDG priorities; defining institutional coordination mechanisms; prioritizing SDG accelerators; integrating SDGs into budgets and financing the SDG agenda; data, monitoring and reporting; advocacy, resources and partnerships; private sector and local government engagement; SDG 16 indicators and related initiatives; and civil society organizations (CSOs) engagement with the government.

The report notes that SDGs 1 (no poverty), 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) are a priority for the country, and that the government has approved a national SDG framework that includes national SDG targets and indicators. It says Pakistan has established SDG units under its SDG task forces at the central and provincial levels, and has notified parliamentary task forces on SDGs to oversee implementation of the national framework. It also indicates that governments at the federal and sub-national levels partnered with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to undertake a “comprehensive” consultative process across all provinces and regions of the country.

On challenges, the authors express disappointment when it comes to the implementation of policies related to the SDGs. They note “extremely weak” institutional coordination at “every level” of government, and among SDG task forces and units on SDG implementation progress and challenges. They indicate that the federal government has a Prime Minister SDG Support Fund but most members of the SDG task forces are unaware of this mechanism, and they outline a lack of data availability at the central level to track SDG progress. They find that SDGs are still unknown for “many,” adding that most CSOs, NGOs, media organizations, and others are unaware of the efforts being made by the government to implement the SDGs. They also call on the government and NGOs to “approach” the private sector for financial and technical support.

Ahead of the 2018 HLPF, CSOs from Canada and Switzerland, among others, also have issued independent reports discussing their country’s progress and challenges on the SDGs.

81,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/where-are-we-in-achieving-sdg-15/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?,"Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.

The Global Councils on SDGs consist of interdisciplinary networks of decisionmakers from different areas, that seek to find innovative solutions for SDG implementation. Council members are invited to participate for a two-year term, with the aim to provide actionable insights, propose policies, develop technological solutions, and mobilize resources to drive progress towards the goals. The Councils were launched in February 2018 at the World Government Summit in Dubai, UAE.

The event titled, ‘The Future of Government and Implications for Agenda 2030: Introducing the Global Councils on SDGs,’ took place on the sidelines of the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF), on 17 July 2018.

Opening the meeting, Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative of UAE, noted that nine Councils have been established so far, and that eight other councils will be launched during the “second phase” of the initiative. The existing Councils target nine SDGs and are headed by the following officials: SDG 1 (no poverty) is chaired Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank; SDG 2 (zero hunger) is chaired by Christopher Fearne, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Malta; SDG 4 (quality education) is chaired by Irina Bokova, former Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) is chaired by Adnan Amin, Director-General, IRENA; SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) is chaired by Imad Fakhoury, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Jordan; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) is chaired by Aisha Bin Bishr, Director General, Smart Dubai Office, UAE; SDG 13 (climate action) is chaired by Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, UAE; SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) is chaired by Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and former Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) is chaired by Mari Kiviniemi, Deputy Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Radheya Alhashmi, Prime Minister’s Office, UAE, noted that the Councils are not limited to “VIPs” but should involve “all different actors of the community,” and called on them to come up with innovative ideas. She explained that during their first year of work, Councils should define initiatives that are impactful, while in their second year, they should collaborate and promote integration across their initiatives.

Yasir Al Naqbi, also from the UAE Prime Minister’s Office, announced that the 2019 World Government Summit will take place from 10-12 February 2019 in Dubai. The World Government Summit is a knowledge exchange platform at the intersection of government, technology, and innovation that functions as a thought leadership platform and networking hub for policymakers, experts and pioneers in human development. The Summit was commissioned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE, in 2013, and takes place annually.

Mohieldin said sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

In a session featuring Council chairs and members, Mahmoud Mohieldin said the SDG 1 Council, composed of 22 members, plans to produce global knowledge products, and will organize a competition to tackle poverty that will engage “many people” from academia and the private sector, among other areas. He announced that specific deliverables would be shared during the 2019 World Government Summit, and noted that sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

Adnan Amin, said there is a “huge interest” in being a member of the SDG 7 Council, with 150 applications having been received. He remarked that there is no enabling framework to take forward energy efficiency, and the SDG 7 Council could create momentum around this issue.

Meera Al Shaikh, Smart Dubai, on behalf of Aisha Bin Bishr, reported that the SDG 11 Council is composed of 11 members from various horizons, among others, from the World Council on City Data (WCCD) and IISD Reporting Services. She said the Council will use science, technology and innovation (STI) approaches as part of its framework, and will have a second meeting during the week of 23 July.

Eric Dawson, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peace First, and member of the SDG 16 Council, indicated that the Council will leverage the power of young people to create more peaceful and inclusive societies at all levels. He said the Council will: organize a global youth challenge for peaceful and inclusive societies; identify problems young people want to solve; and connect them to mentors and funding to support solution-oriented projects.

Masamichi Kono, Deputy Secretary-General, OECD, on behalf of Mari Kiviniemi, remarked that the SDG 17 Council is overarching and horizontal, and will operationalize partnerships in coherence with the other SDGs. Among its activities, he said the Council will define a clear roadmap on how partnership can lead to more effective SDG implementation, and is considering the establishment of a knowledge facility related to SDG governance. He reported that the Council had its first meeting on 2 July, and that it is composed of officials from, inter alia, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), UNDP, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), Slovenia and Finland.

During the meeting, participants also shared information on SDG implementation in countries. Juwang Zhu, Director, Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said that compared to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs are characterized by: a greater commitment from the top; stronger ownership and buy-in by Parliaments; better coordination; more emphasis on evidence-based analysis; and some “shift away” from the work in silo approach. He remarked that leaving no one behind (LNOB) is becoming the “yardstick” to measure real progress, and noted the various bottom-up initiatives carried out by stakeholders, including by business and civil society organizations (CSOs). He said the UAE is a small country with a strong commitment to global partnership, as it devotes more than one percent of its gross development product (GDP) to development cooperation.

Inge Herman Rydland, Special Envoy Agenda 2030, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway, outlined the importance of integrating the SDGs in national budgets, since this contributes to greater policy coherence and a better acceptance of the policy agenda. Timotej Šooš, National Development Strategy Lead, Slovenia, reported that his country is “doing quite well” on many areas of the SDGs, and noted the need to work more horizontally, across sectors. He also underscored the “very important role” of Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) for SDG implementation.

Al Naqbi said the UAE presented its voluntary national review (VNR) at the HLPF on 16 July 2018. He reported that: the UAE Minister of Youth is 22 years old, which makes her the youngest minister in the world; 33% of UAE Ministers are female; and the Head of Parliament is a woman.

The HLPF is taking place from 9-18 July 2018. [World Government Summit Website] [IISD RS Coverage of HLPF 2018]","The Global Councils on SDGs consist of interdisciplinary networks of decisionmakers from different areas, that seek to find innovative solutions for SDG implementation.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

The Portal’s launch fulfills UNESCO’s voluntary commitment made at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, as well as progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

The Ocean Literacy Portal will provide a “one-stop shop for ocean literacy” through sharing resources, information on ocean projects and events based on scientific knowledge. It covers a broad range of ocean topics, from marine litter to marine policy, and its users can search for resources organized by: students; educators; scientists; media; policymakers; and private sector. Portal users can also register for the ‘Ocean Literacy Collaborative Workspace (UNESTEAMS),’ an online collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform that enables users to collaborate with fellow members to co-create and develop joint projects or co-work on topics and share resources.

UNESCO and partners submitted the voluntary commitment titled ‘Ocean Literacy for All: A Global Strategy to Raise the Awareness for the Conservation, Restoration, and Sustainable Use of Our Ocean’ to support implementation of SDG 14, which was the focus of the UN Ocean Conference. According to UNESCO, the ocean literacy encourages more informed and responsible behavior towards the ocean and its resources among all citizens and stakeholders. It encompasses understanding the state of the ocean as well as more in-depth understanding of individual and collective responsibilities towards the seas.

The ocean literacy commitment aims to: encourage cooperation and exchange on ocean education to improve ocean literacy; raise awareness of the two-way interaction between the oceans and peoples’ everyday lives and empower citizens to adjust their everyday behavior; and seek and apply innovative ways to make current and future citizens ocean literate so that they recognize environmental challenges and make informed and responsible decisions related to use of the ocean resources and ocean stewardship.

Also in support of this commitment, UNESCO held an ‘International Workshop on Ocean Literacy’ in December 2017 and plans to release a publication on ocean literacy.

Three panels consisting of speakers from civil society, the private sector and the UN system described the context for the evening’s event, articulated the links between sustainability, oceans and climate, and offered examples of public-private partnerships to help deliver the SDGs.

Organized in Partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) and the UN Global Compact, the event provided new perspectives, including from youth, on how to make the world more peaceful and inclusive. Genevieve Jiva, Fiji, one of the Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassadors, described the process of a Talanoa dialogue, noting that it seeks to answer three questions: Where are we? Where do we need to go? How do we get there? These are the questions, she described, that the Youth Ambassadors address as they travel with Peace Boat to raise awareness and inspire action on the Goals.

Challenges and Opportunities

Speakers discussed current challenges, raising issues of ocean plastic, elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poverty, food insecurity and food waste, but also identified areas of hope. Cora Weiss, Hague Appeal for Peace, noted that peace makes it possible for sustainable development to happen, highlighting the recent peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea as setting the stage for progress. Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, in remarks delivered by video, flagged that more people need to know why the ocean and environment matter.

Echoing Earle, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that humanity has not been sufficiently taught about the need for action. Thomson cautioned that the world is still on a path to three degrees warming, a “dangerous uncertainty.” He emphasized the need for multilateralism, “now more than ever,” to teach humanity how to implement the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

We are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.

Former Astronaut Col. Ron J. Garan described an example of a man on a horse, who, when asked where he was going, responded, “I don’t know, ask the horse!” Drawing comparisons to Thomson’s remarks, he noted that “we are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.” He underscored the need for a new perspective, articulating how his experience in space shifted his worldview. We as a global society, he noted, need to move from a model of fragmented nation-states that consume as if there are unlimited natural resources, to one where we are common occupants of a single planet, recognizing our finite supplies.

Going Forward

Andrew Friedman, AJF Financial Services, Inc., expressed his desire to one day live in a world where we don’t have to use the word sustainable, because sustainability is already ingrained into everyday life. To get there, he offered perspective on action being taken outside of the UN system. Friedman emphasized the role of organizations like US SIF (the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as key to making progress in the private sector, and highlighted the need for shareholder activism.

Robert Skinner, UNOP, highlighted how the Office acts as a gateway and platform to connect and convene actors, including those from the private sector, noting similarities to Peace Boat as a means of sharing information to create a better world. Dan Thomas, delivering remarks on behalf of Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact, also recognized that Peace Boat provides a means for decision-makers and civil society alike to connect informally, outside a more formal UN setting.

Yoshioka Tatsuya, Peace Boat Founder and Marie Chatardová, President of ECOSOC, each highlighted that without peace, we cannot achieve the SDGs. International frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement on climate change, they noted, are both a vision and a means of achieving a sustainable, peaceful world.

Peace Boat is docked in the Hudson River, across town from UN Headquarters where the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is currently underway. Event participants pointed out that it offers an opportunity for networking and idea exchange outside of UN Headquarters. Peace Boat has featured the circular SDGs logo on its hull since 2016, and visits more than 100 countries per year to raise awareness on the 2030 Agenda.

In their discussions, delegates noted some “positive momentum” as the global financial system strengthened, but warned that the threat of international trade barriers could undermine global economic growth.

Mahmadamin Mahmadaminov, Vice-President, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), chaired the session, and Gillian Tett, US Managing Editor, Financial Times, moderated discussions.

Speakers addressed issues related to aid, trade, taxation and technology, drawing on an HLPF background note on SDG 17. The session aimed to build on the outcomes of the ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development (FfD Forum) that took place in April 2018 (E/FFDF/2018/3), and recommendations from related processes, including the Development Cooperation Forum (DCF), the World Investment Forum, the UN World Data Forum, and the the Multistakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for the SDGs.

On foreign aid (SDG target 17.2), Yongyi Min, Statistics Division, UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), reported that official development assistance (ODA) declined between 2016 and 2017, and aid to the least developed countries (LDCs) grew just 1% in real terms during the same period. Viet Nam and the Asia Pacific Regional civil society organization (CSO) Engagement Mechanism lamented the decline in ODA, and Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the UN, called on ODA providers to fulfill their commitments. France announced plans to increase its contribution to support the SDGs. Belarus called for support for middle-income countries.

On mobilizing additional financial resources (SDG target 17.3), panelist Steven Waygood, Aviva, pointed to US$300 million invested in capital markets that could be leveraged for the SDGs. He called on the UN and civil society to support the development of rules and standards to make capital markets more sustainable and transparent. Finland welcomed diversification of financing for development, including leveraging private sector funds. The Dominican Republic also called for alternative sources of finance.

In 2017, only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK met or exceeded the UN benchmark for ODA contributions.

On debt sustainability (SDG target 17.4), Rattray further called for better debt management monitoring by national and international actors. South Africa cautioned that turning to innovative sources of finance could result in further indebtedness.

On the multilateral trade system (SDG target 17.10), Masud Bin Momen, Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the UN, commented that economic globalization has suffered a setback with the rise of inward-looking and protectionist tendencies. Lead discussant Kavaljit Singh, Madhyam, warned that poor countries could become “collateral damage” in a global trade war, and the EU emphasized that an open, rules-based trade system can strengthen SDG implementation.

Several panelists commented on the role of technology in development (SDG targets 17.6, 17.7 and 17.8). Bin Momen pointed to its transformative potential. Panelist Robin Ogilvy, Special Representative, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), stressed the importance of researching how digitalization is influencing policy choices. Panelist Alfred Watkins, Global Solutions Summit, stated that, while cost-effective technological solutions to sustainable development exist, technology deployment measures are missing.

The HLPF Background Note further elaborates on the threat of trade barriers, noting these could have potentially large repercussions, especially for developing economies, and that persistently high levels of inequality also pose challenges for sustainable development. The background note reports a renewed increase in global carbon emissions in 2017, which, it argues, shows that the global system continues to be unable to align investment with long-term sustainable development objectives.

In 2017, ODA as a share of donors’ gross national income (GNI) was nowhere near the UN benchmark of at least 0.7% of GNI, with overall levels remaining low at 0.31%. Only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK met or exceeded the UN benchmark.

On improving domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection (SDG 17.1), the background note reports that the rate of taxation has declined in LDCs and sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. Foreign direct investment (FDI) to LDCs declined by 11% between 2016 and 2017. Global remittances by international migrants to their countries of origin also declined somewhat, due to stricter immigration policies adopted by destination countries.

On the final day, 11 countries presented their VNRs, bringing the total number of participating countries to 46.



The HLPF convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) from 9-18 July 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with the Ministerial Meeting taking place from 16-18 July, and held jointly with ECOSOC’s High-level Segment. The meeting focused on the theme of ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’

The Bahamas’ VNR presentation noted the vulnerability of The Bahamas given its location in a volatile hurricane zone, and outlined challenges, including in sectors related to poverty, youth unemployment, education, health, energy efficiency, and coastal resilience. He outlined SDG-related plans to promote land reform, empowerment, and backyard farming. Romania’s VNR presentation described work across national and local governments to advance the SDGs, and highlighted: breaking down silos to address a complex agenda; the need for stability to support human rights; and the importance of SDG implementation, commencing with individual lifestyles.

Lebanon’s VNR presentation emphasized the country adopted a bottom-up and “whole of government” approach to SDG implementation. The presentation highlighted good progress in education, heath, women, poverty reduction and development of small and medium enterprises and recognized the need for more work in areas improving statistical capabilities. Hungary’s VNR presentation focused on: water management; a sustainable energy strategy, which includes a programme to promote the use of electric cars; a focus on sustainable cities, which includes housing, climate change and air quality-related components; and a national strategy on sustainable consumption and production (SCP).

Malta’s VNR presentation highlighted: a high and steady economic growth rate; investments in skills development and health and education, especially on life-long opportunities for education and training; a high employment rate; and efforts to ensure gender equality and social inclusion, including of persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. Poland’s VNR presentation described social, economic and environmental initiatives, including ones to: help families with children through cash transfers; assist the elderly; promote innovation, research, and development through tax relief; help start-ups; and deal with air pollution. In response to questions, Poland noted measures to implement a circular economy; address water management; and tackle air pollution as part of efforts to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Singapore’s VNR presentation highlighted: the implementation of integrated closed-loop systems for recycling water and waste materials; an integrated long-term planning for sustainable cities, including an emphasis on urban greenery; and a long-lasting commitment to combine environmentalism and development, particularly in the area of water management. On SDG 13 (climate action), Singapore said it is one of the first Asian nations to implement a national carbon tax and described a Climate Action Package, which aims to develop climate resilience capacity in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Spain’s VNR presentation focused on: high levels of inequality and youth unemployment; high levels of gender violence; large pay gaps between men and women; high levels of women’s participation in politics (11 out of the 16 ministers are women); and high vulnerability to climate change.

Saudi Arabia’s VNR presentation highlighted: a national water strategy to achieve universal clean water access; the involvement of women and youth in urban planning; and local partnerships for SDG implementation. Responding to questions, Saudi Arabia noted close collaboration between ministers and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund plans to increase investments in renewables. Paraguay’s VNR presentation addressed institutional processes such as the establishment of audits and indicators for monitoring progress on the SDGs; programmes fighting violence against children and adolescents; and ongoing efforts to improve the well-being and living standards of indigenous peoples and rural communities, among other actions. Paraguay identified the need for greater statistical capacities as a future challenge.

Qatar’s VNR presentation showcased: plans to increase economic growth; improvements in the literacy rate; reduced youth unemployment; and the country’s universal access to clean drinking water. Qatar said it leads the Middle East and North Africa peace index.

On stakeholder participation, The Bahamas said it does not have a strong culture of engagement with civic organizations. Romania acknowledged the importance of involving universities in the VNRs. Lebanon highlighted the inclusion of CSOs in the VNR drafting process and elaborated on private sector involvement in the 2030 Agenda, which took place primarily through the UN Global Compact network for Lebanon. Hungary described youth participation in the SDGs and efforts to promote inclusivity of disadvantaged people, such as Roma communities. Singapore and Spain both shared their countries’ multi-stakeholder approaches to SDG implementation, with Spain explaining it has 50 organizing platforms for civil society participation and decentralization in SDG implementation. Saudi Arabia highlighted coordinated support of the private sector and civil society. Qatar emphasized the contributions of civil society to SDG implementation and the drafting of the VNR.

Several countries highlighted alignment of national development plans and strategies with the 2030 Agenda, including Poland and Paraguay. Malta elaborated on a national law mandating mainstreaming of sustainable development in all policies. Saudi Arabia described the alignment between Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’ and the SDGs. Spain said it has a national committee for SDG implementation and a research and development strategy for the SDGs.

According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), the 46 VNRs presented during the 2018 session provided a “good snapshot of action on the ground, but also of the numerous challenges faced by national and local actors.” The ENB noted that the challenge of capacity and financial resources, notably in a number of developing countries, was a recurring issue among the VNRs, and reflected that the level of participation of non-state actors in the preparation of the VNRs varied among countries in scale and depth. The ENB underscored some frustration among participants at the lack of follow-up to and feedback on the VNRs, and suggestions for more clear and consistent reporting methodologies.

89,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/synthesis-report-highlights-challenges-in-meeting-global-water-goals/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Synthesis Report Highlights Challenges in Meeting Global Water Goals,"5 July 2018: The world is not on track to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), according to an UN-Water Report based on the latest data available for the 11 SDG 6 global indicators. The report titled, ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation,’ offers the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) a “joint position from the UN family on the global status on SDG 6 and other water-related targets.”



SDG 6 has eight targets, addressing: drinking water; sanitation and hygiene; water quality; water-use efficiency; integrated water resources management; water-related ecosystems; and means of implementation. The Synthesis Report outlines the challenges faced under each of these targets, provides charts depicting country and regional performance, discusses accelerating progress on the Goal, and provides summaries of ‘key messages’ on each target. The report concludes with general recommendations, including adopting “smart technologies” and engaging in multi-stakeholder partnerships, among other measures.

On drinking water (SDG target 6.1), coverage increased from 81% to 89% between 2000 and 2015, but progress among the lowest-performing countries has been insufficient to achieve universal coverage by 2030. On sanitation (SDG target 6.2), access to basic sanitation services increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period, but rural areas lag behind, and managing fecal sludge has become a challenge. The report highlights that substantial investment will be required, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, to install sewerage networks and sanitation systems, as well as strengthen the capacity of local and national authorities to manage them.

While progress monitoring on water and sanitation drew on data from at least the year 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, Synthesis Report authors observe that there has been a shorter history of collecting data on the other SDG 6 targets.

On water quality and wastewater treatment (SDG target 6.3), the report notes challenges for both developed and developing countries, especially with regard to monitoring industrial pollution. Preliminary estimates suggest that, in high to middle-income countries, 59% of household wastewater flows are safely treated, while the extent of industrial pollution is unknown.

On water-use efficiency (SDG target 6.4), the report finds a wide range of efficiency levels across the globe, and calls for additional indicators and data that can reflect improvements in agricultural use of water, and reduced losses in municipal distribution networks.

On integrated water resources management (IWRM) (SDG target 6.5), the report finds that most progress towards implementation has been in the areas of cross-sectoral coordination and public participation at the national level, but levels of financing, action on gender issues and aquifer management still remain low.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG target 6.6), the authors report that the world lost 70% of its natural wetlands over the last 100 years. Artificial water bodies such as reservoirs and rice paddies have increased; however data collection systems do not differentiate between artificial and natural wetlands. They call for further detailed data on water-related ecosystems and their benefits, and for complementing local data with earth observation data.

On means of implementation (SDG targets 6 a. and b.), the report cites research findings that the capital investments necessary to reach SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are around three times the current levels of investment, and that investments in achieving other targets will also require a significant increase.

The authors argue that achieving SDG 6 is crucial for achieving the rest of the 2030 Agenda. They also emphasize the interdependence among SDG 6 targets, noting, for example, the energy sector’s role in water withdrawals, and the possibility of reducing water pollution to increase access to freshwater.

To help develop key messages to be conveyed to the HLPF, an online multi-stakeholder dialogue on the report was launched on 2 May with a briefing for UN Member States. The dialogue, which will continue through September, will seek input according to the following guidelines: overall feedback (2-16 May); main messages for the HLPF (25 June to 9 July); and looking forward and next steps (31 August to 14 September).

At the HLPF, further discussions on achieving SDG 6 will take place in the context of several water-related events. They include, inter alia: a half-day review of SDG 6 implementation hosted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); a UN-Water side event on global progress on water and sanitation; a ‘Water and Faith Communities’ side event organized by the Ecumenical Water Network; and a side event on ‘Ensuring Intergenerational Policy Dialogues for the Achievement of SDG 6,’ which will explore opportunities for greater youth engagement, organized by the Water Youth Network, UN-Water, the International Hydrological Programme of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IHP) and the World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW).

Achievers? Influencers? Leaders?



It’s an incredible list, of incredible women. And they have something in common: members of the G7’s first ever Gender Equality Advisory Council, established by Canada as part of their 2018 G7 presidency, to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment across all areas of the G7’s work.

The Council’s report Make Gender Inequality History is resolute and persuasive. It calls on G7 leaders to take concrete actions to ensure that girls and women are safe, healthy, educated, heard and visible. The recommendations reinforce the SDG goals and targets. One of the priority areas is to deliver comprehensive, women-centered and culturally appropriate health care for all girls, women and gender diverse people. The Council sets out 8 recommendations to achieve ‘gender-responsive health systems [that will] uphold girls’ and women’s essential rights to health, and promote safe, healthy, and functioning societies and strong economic growth and development’. These include Universal Health Coverage (UHC), sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), access to quality maternal and newborn health, food security and nutrition, the health needs of girls and women in conflict and humanitarian settings and the meaningful engagement of adolescent girls and young people.

The G7 has recognised the Council’s work and its focus on comprehensive health services for girls and women. In its Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique of 9 June 2018 the G7 has committed ‘to promote and protect women’s and adolescents’ health and well-being’, ‘to supporting strong, sustainable health systems that promote access to quality and affordable healthcare’ and that ‘gender equality is fundamental for the fulfilment of human rights and is a social and economic imperative’. The G7 commitment is welcomed.



Converting commitments into action will depend on one key issue: the role of women as providers of care. Their role as health workers. Women represent the majority of the human resources we have to expand and transform the world’s health systems and fulfill the goals of universal health coverage and sexual reproductive health and rights. In 2016, the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth drew on compelling new evidence that 67% of all health workers are women; nearly seven out of every ten jobs in the health sector. The average in all other labour sectors is 41%. These women, be they managers, midwives, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, therapists and numerous other health occupations, are the foundation of health systems and a critical factor in whether we attain comprehensive health services for girls and women. It is these women who are Working for Health. Indeed, the ambition of Universal Health Coverage will be won or lost on how governments and health systems manage people. People need health care. People govern health care. And its people, the health workers – mostly women – that deliver it.","Their role as health workers.

One major goal of the HLPF is to review the qualitative status of the targets so as to improve water quality by 2030.

One important indicator for reviewing targets is indicator 6.3.2: ‘Proportion of bodies of waters with good ambient water quality’.

Governments face here one major challenge: the water quality data gap. Whereas there are common indicators to measure water quality such as pH, temperature, or the total amount of nitrogen, such indicators are not measured thoroughly for a comprehensive understanding of water quality. As the 6.3.2 indicator report highlights, many custodian agencies lack institutional structures and coordination to collate data and mobilize necessary personnel (United Nations, 2018).

In hopes of tackling the problem, there are signs for a shift from traditional data gathering – government authorities monitoring water quality through extensive networks – to additionally gathering data through citizen-led water quality monitoring activities. The thematic review paper for HLPF focusing on volunteer groups specifically refers to SDG 6, pinpointing the importance of citizens testing water samples in ensuring safe water and sanitation for all (HLPF, 2018).

‘Citizen Science’: Is it really useful to address the water quality data gap?

A relatively new concept, citizen-led monitoring is also referred to as ‘Citizen Science.’ It is one of the avenues suggested by the custodian agencies of SDG 6.3.2. But is the involvement of citizens really useful to address the water quality data gap?

According to Oxford Dictionary (2018), citizen science is “the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.” In other words, it refers to the involvement of citizens in scientific projects.

Such involvement can have important advantages, particularly in data collection. Because any citizen can go out to collect data, data samples are potentially large. Such data can also be collected in a cost-effective manner, and it can speed up and improve environmental detection. In other words, the more people are collecting good quality data, the higher the chances of detecting environmental changes early on.

Citizen science thus makes projects possible to operate at larger geographic scales and over longer periods of time, depending on available human and capital resources. For instance, the National Water Quality Monitoring Council points out that there are more than 1,720 citizen science groups just across the US, carrying out volunteer water quality monitoring (National Water Quality Monitoring Council n.d.). Earthwatch supported approximately 1,400 field research projects in more than 120 countries, as well as over 100,000 people joining Earthwatch projects to contribute 10 million hours of data collection (FreshWaterWatch n.d.).

However, literature points out that citizen science also has shortcomings. Collected data by volunteers may be skewed or biased because the volunteers may not have appropriate scientific knowledge and training to gather accurate data. Also, motivating volunteers to participate in water quality monitoring scientific projects can be quite difficult since volunteers may also lack necessary laboratory equipment and funding for proper data collection. Lastly, people tend to be selective about which citizen science project they participate in because interests vary. Particular public attention and funding, for example, are given to biodiversity monitoring of attractive species such as wolves, bears, and certain birds (McKinley et al., 2017).

The way forward for citizen science in water quality monitoring

Vigorous discussion is ongoing on how to overcome these obstacles in citizen science. The motivation of non-scientists to participate in citizen science can be increased by providing recognition and attribution for the work they have done, and when they gain feedback from the scientists on how their data were put to use. Analyses also point to increased motivation when the volunteers felt involved within the community. Furthermore, citizen science data can also have high statistical power if data samples are large, which has potential for correcting flawed and biased data.

So, is citizen science an effective method for tackling the water quality data gap? Literature reviews and a quick review of citizen science projects suggest that involving citizens in water quality monitoring has strong potential, that’s for sure. But to fully benefit from the involvement of citizens, possible bottlenecks have to be overcome.

At the United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we thus argue for well-designed citizen science projects in the field of water quality monitoring, considering lessons learnt from existing projects and other fields of practice. The custodian agencies could consider providing guidelines for good citizen science projects and encourage Member States to implement well-designed citizen science projects for resolving the water quality data gap.

The report examines challenges facing youth-led innovation for the SDGs and proposes recommendations to create more integrated ecosystems of support for youth change makers.

The second edition of the ‘Youth Solutions Report’ features SDG solution projects led by youth innovators in academia, business, charity and research, with the aim of showcasing their work and highlighting opportunities for potential investors to support the projects. Projects are classified in three categories: design, pilot and prototyping phase; implementation phase (less than 18 months); and implementation phase (more than 18 months). Projects must take into consideration synergies and trade-offs to the SDGs and have potential impacts that are measureable within the SDG indicator framework.

The report’s solutions, which come from 61 countries, deal with crucial sustainable development issues, including clean energy, education, digitalization, e-participation, healthcare, ecosystem restoration, sustainable agriculture and waste. As an illustration, NatureCoin in South Korea aims to stop the discharge of plastics into the seas using disruptive technology in environmental protection that rewards users of a cryptocurrency when they recycle disposable waste. The initiative addresses SDG 9 (industry, innovation, infrastructure); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report analyzes barriers young people face in accessing financing, mentoring opportunities and generating visibility for their solutions. On financing, the report recommends developing a robust investment pipeline and designing youth-focused funding vehicles for the SDGs. For instance, SDSN Youth is supporting a pipeline of high-quality solutions to fund. To address the lack of visibility on youth-led solutions, the report highlights the potential of social media to level the playing field by enabling youth to connect and interact with the world. The report suggests that governments and other stakeholders can support such interactions by improving internet infrastructure and access and adjusting attitudes towards young entrepreneurs, among other actions.

On monitoring and review, the report stresses the importance of aligning youth solutions within the SDG indicator framework and considers opportunities for young innovators to support SDG follow-up and review. The report argues that aligning youth-led solutions with SDG targets and metrics can position youth to enhance the impact and efficiency of their solutions and connect youth initiatives with SDG-oriented funders.

SDSN will host a series of digital activations to raise awareness on the report’s solutions, including a Twitter chat on 10 August.

On the first day, governments began an “in-depth review” of selected SDGs, with a session on global progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Delegates heard that “the world is not on track” to meet the SDG 6 targets by 2030, in view of increasing freshwater pollution, water stress, and a declining share of official development assistance (ODA) for water-related activities.



The review of SDG 6 featured several high-level speakers, including Danilo Turk, Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace and former President of Slovenia, and Leo Heller, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation. The review of SDG 6 was aided by the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report,’ which was prepared under UN-Water coordination and presented by Stefan Uhlenbrook, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The discussion was moderated by Joakim Harlin, UN-Water.

Delegates discussed their national efforts to achieve SDG 6 and highlighted the need for good governance and partnerships. Several speakers underscored the links between water, peace and security, and Turk proposed holding an international conference on water management to discuss infrastructure and financing. Many speakers lamented the fact that the HLPF would only devote three hours to a review of SDG 6 during its four-year cycle.

IWMI said cities can be water producers, not only water consumers.

Non-governmental speakers also presented their perspectives on SDG 6. Claudia Sadoff, International Water Management Institute (IWMI), stated that cities can be water producers, not only water consumers. The Major Group for Workers and Trade Unions cautioned against privatization, and called for water utilities to be “re-municipalized” to improve equity in service delivery. Other speakers noted the need to promote efficiency of water use in the agriculture and energy sectors.

Among other issues discussed during the opening day of the 2018 HLPF was the US$200 billion shortfall in SDG financing. Keynote speaker Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University, proposed ways to cover this shortfall, including by closing tax havens, taxing the five big technology companies, and establishing a global carbon tax.

In addition, the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) anticipated the launch of a financing framework for SDG data, in October 2018. Also on the use of data for monitoring progress, participants raised the need for disaggregated data to reveal inequalities and lack of inclusion, for example, of people with disabilities.

UNESCO and the Permanent Missions of Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic (CAR) to the UN organized the event.

Titled ‘Making the SDGs Work for the Lake Chad Basin,’ the event was organized in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Lake Chad Basin Commission.

Flavia Schlegel, UNESCO, recalled the UN Security Council’s recognition of security challenges in the region, and noted that BIOPALT, which is being implemented in five countries, has proven its relevance for turning transboundary conflict into cooperation.

Ibrahim Thiaw, UN Secretary-General’s Special Advisor for the Sahel, referred to BIOPALT as a “wonderful natural resource planning and management tool” that aims to address the deeper causes of the crisis in the region.

BIOPALT aims to ensure access to clean water and sanitation, including through restoring ponds and preserving oases.

Maman Nuhu, Lake Chad Basin Commission, said BIOPALT aims to, inter alia: ensure access to clean water and sanitation, including through restoring ponds and preserving oases; and develop policy briefs for decision makers and action plans to support communities in monitoring and managing resources.

Countries also shared their perspectives on regional challenges and the value of BIOPALT. Nigeria emphasized the devastating impacts on the socioeconomic wellbeing caused by Boko Haram. Chad pointed to collaboration and synergy between different scientific centers created by BIOPALT. Cameroon noted the project’s sustainable development approach to managing the basin’s hydrological and cultural resources.

Speakers also stressed that any solution to the Lake Chad crisis must include engagement of women, and that the project’s success can be attributed, in part, to UNESCO’s multi-disciplinary approach, with cultural expertise complementing on-the-ground work. They also highlighted the project’s inclusion of biodiversity restoration and green economy approaches.

SDG 15 is one of the six Goals under review at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) 2018.

On the sidelines of the HLPF Ministerial Segment, Permanent Representatives of the member countries of the ‘Group of Friends of Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought’ organized a high-level consultation on how to address the challenges of drought in the context of achieving LDN. The event was co-hosted by Canada, Iceland, Germany and Namibia.

Taking note of projections that future droughts will increase in frequency, intensity and duration, the discussions explored the potential impact of LDN in alleviating these trends and accelerating the achievement of many other SDGs. The event built on discussions on this topic at the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13) to the UNCCD, held in September 2017 in Ordos, China, which led to the adoption of a decision on policy advocacy on drought. The COP 13 decision called for specific action to enhance: drought preparedness systems; regional efforts to reduce drought vulnerability and risk; and a toolbox to boost the resilience of people and ecosystems to drought.

Parallel to the HLPF discussions, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) convened the High-Level Dialogue on Sand and Dust Storms (SDS) on 16 July 2018, during its 72nd session. The dialogue focused on action-oriented recommendations to address the economic, social and environmental challenges faced by affected countries, including ways to improve policy coordination at the global level in the context of the SDGs. In a concept note for the event, the UNGA highlights the relevance of this topic for the HLPF’s review of SDG 15 and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). UNCCD COP 13 adopted the first ever decision on SDS, which encourages countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms to explore this threat when considering their voluntary LDN targets.

In the lead up to HLPF 2018, the first-ever Global LDN Forum, co-organized by the Republic of Korea and the UNCCD in Seoul, Korea, took stock of voluntary initiatives to strengthen the implementation of LDN programmes. Among initiatives highlighted in the discussions were: the Changwon and Ankara Initiatives; One Belt One Road; the Sustainability, Stability, Security (3S) Initiative; the Drought Initiative, and the Great Green Wall for the Sahel and the Sahara. The discussions explored strategies to leverage these efforts by capturing, disseminating and scaling up best practices in sustainable land management (SLM) that span multiple countries. The role of regional knowledge platforms in facilitating people-to-people exchanges and disseminating simple SLM techniques was highlighted, as was the importance of innovative financial mechanisms – such as the blending of public and private financing and low interest loans for land stewards – in mitigating risks for investors in LDN projects.

Chaired by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Forum paid particular attention to how to promote peace and security through solutions to challenges in LDN implementation that span several countries. A ‘Peace Forest Initiative’ was proposed as one possible approach for simultaneously contributing to LDN, while also fostering post-conflict recovery in countries affected by drought, land degradation and desertification. Reflecting on this issue, Ban Ki-moon suggested that “it would be worthwhile to explore potential partnerships among government agencies, international organizations, academic and research institutions, and even private firms to begin to identify projects that will simultaneously contribute to SDGs, LDN and post-conflict recovery.” [UNCCD Press Release on the High-Level Event on Drought and LDN] [Concept Note for the High-Level Event on Drought and LDN] [UNCCD Press Release on First Global LDN Forum] [SDG Knowledge Hub Guest Article on SDS] [SDG Knowledge Hub Policy Brief on Links Between SDS, Land and Climate Agendas] [Concept Note for the UNGA High-Level Dialogue on SDS]","SDG 15 is one of the six Goals under review at the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) 2018.

Drawing on experiences from 16 predominantly megadiverse countries, the report highlights examples of good practices and remaining challenges in four key areas related to biodiversity mainstreaming. These include: at the national level, including national development plans and national budgets; in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors; in development co-operation; and the monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity mainstreaming. The analysis examines countries that span all income groups, from high-income economies such as Australia and France to lower-income economies such as Ethiopia and Madagascar.

The report notes that, for biodiversity mainstreaming to be effective, it should occur across all levels of government and include all relevant stakeholders, as entry points interact and are located at different levels of governance. To support implementation, the publication points out that mainstreaming initiatives need to be accompanied by budgetary allocations.

The report recommends, inter alia, that governments prioritize actions that underwrite a strong business case for biodiversity. These include: conducting a national assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services outlining the key pressures on biodiversity and incorporating, where possible, the full social benefits that ecosystems and ecosystem services provide, including monetary values where feasible. These also include integrating biodiversity-related considerations into sector-level resource assessments – for instance, agriculture, forestry, fisheries – and identifying key pressures in each case. Other actions to be prioritized include: investing in statistical and/or data systems to establish an evidence base on the drivers, pressures and state of biodiversity; and developing targeted messages that support collaborative solutions.

The Forum, organized in collaboration with the European Commission, Mexico, Egypt, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, was held at the margins of the second meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation SBI 2 under the CBD.

The five winning enterprises focus on eco-inclusive waste management, energy and green technology in Colombia, India, Tanzania and Uganda.

SEED will support the winners with tailored advisory services that help with business and financial plan development, as well as marketing and promotional activities to scale up operations and provide replicable business cases. The winners join a network of more than 230 enterprises from 38 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America who have also received SEED Awards.

Promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development.

The five winning enterprises, selected from a pool of nearly 250 applications, are:

Amazóniko, which focuses on green technologies in Colombia, offers a collaborative recycling web application that motivates users to recycle through a door-to-door collection service and rewards scheme. The programme helps formalize recyclables collection in collaboration with workers, and provides sustainable employment to the waste management sector. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production).

Corporación Acción Semilla, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Colombia, collects organic waste from the food service industry and landscaping services, and converts it into fertilizer for the agricultural activities of local smallholder farms. The enterprise charges clients a fee, and earns profits from the sale of crops and compost. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8, 12 and 13 (climate action).

Daily Dump, which focuses on waste and sanitation in India, enables urban households, communities and businesses to segregate and compost their waste, and increases awareness and responsibility for decentralized resource consumption and disposal. It contributes to implementation of SDGs 11, 12 and 13.

EcoAct Tanzania, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Tanzania, uses environmentally friendly, energy-efficient plastic extrusion to upcycle plastic waste into durable, affordable plastic timbers for construction. The enterprise mitigates climate change by reducing plastic pollution, wood dependence and deforestation, and contributes to SDGs 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 and 13.

Khainza Energy, which addresses energy in Uganda, produces methane from organic waste secured from farms and households, and distributes it in affordable, recyclable cylinders along with cooking appliances. Khainza Energy incorporates local women, farmers and youth along distribution channels, creating value for consumers and local communities. This project contributes to implementation of SDGs 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 12.

The 2018 SEED Low Carbon Awards are supported by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU). SEED is based on the premise that promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development. The initiative recognizes innovative, inclusive and environmentally friendly start-ups in developing countries, provides them with business know-how support, and profiles them to encourage growth and sharing of experiences.

Featuring four panels consisting primarily of chief sustainability officers, the event titled, ‘Business and the SDGs – Accelerating Transformation: Insights from Chief Sustainability Officers & Sustainability Champions,’ addressed how companies are integrating the SDGs into operations, human rights, partnerships and investment towards the Goals.

Opening remarks by Liu Zhenmin, Head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), noted that businesses today operate in a geopolitical context that leaves much to be desired. Filippo Veglio, WBCSD, articulated the role of businesses in achieving the SDGs as: an engine of employment; a developer of technology and innovation; and a source of finance. Veglio described the implications of the SDGs for businesses, recalling the CEO Guide to the SDGs and SDG Compass, and highlighted the results of a joint survey of WBCSD members conducted with DNV GL.

In a panel on strategic integration of the SDGs into business practices, panelists highlighted challenges and solutions regarding the complexity of the SDGs and opportunities for impact. Approaches their companies have taken include “retrofitting” existing strategies to fit the SDGs, changing corporate governance structures and launching new sustainability initiatives. One difficulty, they noted, has been balancing the possible tension between generating short-term returns and creating long-term shared value. Doing so demands winning buy-in both internally and externally. Participants reported that they have had to engage buyers and other stakeholders as well as senior management teams and CEOs. Panelists also emphasized the importance of robust measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs), which, they noted, can not only demonstrate a company’s impact, but also align multiple levels of internal management.

Businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing they need to go further on freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing.

Another panel addressed corporate respect for human rights as a key vehicle through which business can contribute to sustainable development. Moderated by Caroline Rees, President and Co-founder of Shift, the discussion articulated how large companies work to uphold human rights throughout their operations and supply chains. Rees outlined the current state of play, noting that businesses are comfortable with labor rights, but are realizing the need to go further on others such as freedom of expression, privacy, nutrition and housing. Describing the three pillars of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights, she noted a recent mapping of human rights to the SDGs, and flagged a new Shift report that features 15 case studies on the human rights opportunity for business, linked to the SDGs.

Participants took the discussion further, noting that human rights go beyond SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Andrew Petersen, Sustainable Business Australia (SBA), flagged that SDGs 5 (gender equality) and 10 (reduced inequalities) hit closest to home for SBA’s membership. Tony Henshaw, Aditya Birla Group, said that after the Group signed the WASH Pledge, it realized they needed to do more in the area of water, sanitation and hygiene: “we were 600 bathrooms short.” Tim Fleming, AT&T, noted the enabling power of technology in improving outcomes towards the SDGs, flagging a new Digital Access Index. Panelists also lamented that working across supply chains is difficult, but noted the importance of strict supplier programmes and WBCSD’s Reporting Matters work.

A third panel, on ‘Business as Unusual,’ described how companies can utilize the SDGs to pioneer new forms of collaboration, both at sector- and system-level. Moderator Andrew Wilson, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), argued that the notion of partnerships is overused, and that the private sector partners “for impact.” Unpacking key factors that enable success, participants identified similar characteristics, topics and skills as those which emerged from the HLPF’s Partnership Exchange, including: embracing diversity and differences; simplifying language for communicating between private sector, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the media; the ability to build trust; ensuring all stakeholders are present; and the benefits of complementary skill sets to be gained from having partners. Arne Cartridge, Yara International, offered lessons around local ownership aligned with country goals, openness and inclusivity, and a market-driven approach. Michelle Grogg, Cargill, stressed the need for clarity on what partners aim to do together, scalability of projects, a long-term approach, and the need to be innovative, taking risks that go beyond business as usual.

Dominique Debecker, Solvay, described how industries can come together, including through the use of sector roadmaps. These can enhance companies’ license to operate, help them manage risk, and open up new growth markets while setting a common vision, mapping impact on the SDGs, and identifying actions that can be taken in partnership with wider stakeholder groups. Debecker highlighted the release of WBCSD’s Chemical Sector SDG Roadmap, which resulted from multiple workshops involving numerous companies and stakeholders from the industry.

The final panel addressed investor engagement, and how to effectively measure and communicate SDG performance in the face of increasing investor scrutiny. Steve Waygood, Aviva Plc, indicated that failing to deal with SDGs collectively would mean the folding of his business, including because current climate change scenarios represent an existential crisis for the insurance industry. He argued that the “SDGs exist because the market fails”; in other words, if it were already possible to earn money delivering the Goals, governments would not have had to establish the Goals. Bearing this in mind, Waygood stressed that investors do not currently look at how corporates perform on the SDGs because they are externalities, affecting neither companies’ costs nor their revenues. He articulated the need for government-led fiscal measures, market mechanisms, and standards to restructure markets, and noted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance in addition to recent toolkits. The good news, he added, is that investor interest is rapidly increasing.

Timothy Mohin, Chief Executive, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), built on Waygood’s remarks, noting that reporting has been growing, and there is increasing interest from Wall Street in their data. He highlighted a new report titled, ‘In Focus: Addressing Investor Needs in Business Reporting on the SDGs.’ Launched with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and UN Global Compact, the report, he noted, articulates the relevance of the SDGs and the need for a methodology that allows investors to differentiate companies based on their systems for approaching the Goals.

Libby Bernick, Trucost (part of S&P Global), rounded out the panel by underscoring the need for quantitative data. She noted that Trucost is developing a quantitative approach to overlay the SDGs and economic models, and that the rate of change on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments is increasing.

The paper, which was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), examines the ways in which the alignment of the two processes can be increased, despite their distinct histories, communities of actors and political dynamics.

The paper titled, ‘Connecting the Dots: Elements for a Joined-Up Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement,’ explains that the SDGs and climate actions embedded in NDCs are still largely implemented under distinct tracks, despite growing recognition of the strong connections between the two agendas, the opportunities they present for synergies, and the “short window of opportunity” for addressing the interlinked challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, poverty, rising inequality and fragile governance.

Drawing on examples and lessons learned from 11 countries and the EU, the publication outlines efforts to bridge the two implementation tracks, and explains that a growing number of countries have began taking concrete steps to advance both agendas as one. More specifically, the report provides options and examples for linking institutional, policy, financial, and monitoring and reporting frameworks that support joint implementation, which can reduce transaction costs and enhance policy coherence.

The paper describes five areas where countries are taking action to jointly implement the agenda: 1) ensuring institutional coordination; 2) ensuring alignment of and synergies between nationally relevant SDG targets and climate actions; 3) mainstreaming the SDGs and NDCs jointly into national planning and budgets; 4) optimizing financial resources; and 5) designing mutually supportive monitoring and reporting frameworks.

Cross-fertilization between SDG and NDC targets can lead to greater ambition.

On coordinating institutions, the paper explains that SDG and NDC lead institutions can build on their different strengths and authorities to more effectively engage governments and other stakeholders, and calls for consistent leadership and bringing the climate and development communities together.

On alignment of and synergies between SDG and NDC targets, the paper notes that climate policymakers have acknowledged limited understanding of the ways in which the SDGs can support climate policymaking, while sector ministries often view NDCs as technical documents that are difficult for use in policy planning. It explains that cross-fertilization and alignment can lead to greater ambition, and calls for designing single long-term carbon-neutral, sustainable development strategies.

The paper states that while few countries have sought greater alignment, Mexico released a study identifying NDC actions with the greatest SDG benefits as priority “development accelerators.” In addition, Kenya undertook an SDG impact assessment for its National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022. Both studies, it notes, call for, inter alia, measures to maximize climate action benefits on inequality reduction and gender equality.

On jointly mainstreaming both agendas into policy planning and budgeting, the paper recommends: sector-specific guidelines; consistent use of performance frameworks and budget-tagging systems that consider the objectives of both agendas; a comprehensive gap analysis of both agendas; monitoring; and involving SDG and NDC lead institutions in planning processes. The paper discusses Colombia’s use of consistent guidelines and support for building the SDGs and NDCs into local development plans, and explains that several countries have also started reviewing and enforcing SDG-NDC mainstreaming.

On optimizing budgetary and financial resources, the paper recommends, inter alia, mobilizing and tracking SDG-related and climate finance, and integrated fiscal and regulatory reforms to help scale up finance for both agendas.

On mutually reinforcing monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks, the paper states that: consistent sets of SDG, climate and other development indicators and common data strategies support integrated monitoring of outcomes, and national progress reports can more systematically address SDG-climate linkages. It outlines the ways in which the Philippines, Finland and Kenya have assessed the relevance of global SDG indicators in monitoring climate actions, especially adaptation, noting that several countries have included SDG and NDC reporting in annual growth reviews and budget processes.

In addition, the report describes the ways in which international development can better support national efforts to link the two agendas, and urges development partners to support national efforts to link implementation efforts through an integrated approach to capacity building and project planning.

The report suggests that global reporting frameworks under the Paris Agreement and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) could better support national efforts to merge SDG and NDC implementation, and contends that the HLPF and Talanoa Dialogue offer near-term opportunities for countries to develop synergies to ramp up national ambitions.

Many speakers called for justice, dignity and a human rights-based approach to affordable housing in cities. Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, argued that housing (SDG target 11.1) is the most significant issue facing cities today, and highlighted the injustice of development that destroys urban neighborhoods and displaces residents.

Marc Pecsteen, Permanent Representative of Belgium and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), chaired the session reviewing SDG 11. Discussions drew on the joint report by UN-Habitat and partner agencies, released on 9 July, which outlined global progress and challenges for sustainable cities. The report titled, ‘SDG 11 Synthesis Report: Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ presents UN agencies’ joint position.

Benjamin Rae, Statistics Division, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), stressed that, if States continue to rely on the private sector for housing, then they are obliged to ensure markets provide affordable housing.

Rohit Aggarwala, Columbia University, noted there is no “one size fits all” formula for achieving the various SDG 11 targets, and called for thoughtful and comprehensive management of urban issues and appropriate distribution of powers.

Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, New York City, highlighted that New York is the first city in the world to submit a voluntary local review to the UN, and has declared 11 July to be Global Goals Day in honor of the SDGs. She highlighted commonalities between the SDGs and the OneNYC campaign, including: principles of growth, equity, sustainability and resilience; consultative processes with local agencies, residents and businesses; commitment to leave no one behind; and measurement of progress. Noting that “progress is in fact possible,” she highlighted the city has achieved cleaner air and water, record wage growth, and tripled the number of children accessing quality early childhood education.

Jean Todt, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, observed that urbanization is strongly correlated with the use of motor vehicles. He highlighted the economic and social cost of road accidents, and argued that road safety (SDG target 11.2) should be considered part and parcel of sustainable mobility and transport, citing a combination of necessary policy elements, including affordable public transport and infrastructure for motorized and non-motorized transport.

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, noted that, while the percentage of slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing has decreased, their absolute numbers nevertheless has increased. She defined three key challenges for implementing SDG 11: housing affordability (SDG target 11.1), accessibility and adequacy of housing; management of urban sprawl (SDG target 11.3 on sustainable human settlement planning); and access to public spaces (SDG target 11.7). She added that monitoring progress will depend on having common definitions and units of analysis, and drew attention to UN-Habitat’s National Sample of Cities as a model for aggregating data from different cities within a country so as to discern dominant patterns.

Meera AlShaikh, Project Manager, Smart Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighted the high ecological footprint of urban areas and presented Dubai’s strategies for providing solar energy, increased use of recycled water, and various technologies including blockchain, AI and ICT services to enable Dubai’s transformation as a smart city.

Other speakers emphasized the need for finding new approaches to citizen participation, participatory governance by the urban poor, cities’ connections with rural ecosystems, post-disaster management to “build back better,” and the need to stop gender-based violence.

Many UN Member States, major groups, UN agencies and international organizations made interventions from the floor, highlighting country and programme experiences. Delegates linked improvements in urban spaces to poverty alleviation, and some countries, including Brazil and Sierra Leone, stressed the right to housing as an integral part of sustainable cities. They noted the particular needs of women, persons with disabilities, youth, and elderly persons, and drew attention to conflict as a driver for migrants and refugees moving to cities. Several delegates gave examples of “smart city” approaches that not only promote the use of digital technologies but also increase social inclusion, environmental sustainability and quality of life for urban residents.

Many also cited air quality as an important element of sustainable cities, noting the benefits of electric vehicles for reducing air pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) noted that only 12% of cities meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.

Concluding the session, Abeywardena highlighted that “this is not just about SDG 11,” but about the roles that cities will play in achieving all the SDGs.

101,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholder-report-measures-up-uk-performance-on-sdgs/,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholder Report 'Measures up' UK Performance on SDGs,"17 July 2018: An event convened in the margins of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) celebrated the launch of the report titled, ‘Measuring Up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’ Organized by UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and hosted by PwC, the discussion reviewed the report’s key findings and methodology.

Bringing together experts from over 100 organizations across the UK, the report offers the first comprehensive review of SDG delivery in the country, covering all 17 Goals and 143 of the 169 targets. Emily Auckland, UKSSD Co-Chair, emphasized that the scope primarily focuses on domestic delivery of the SDGs within the UK, and that the report does not compare the UK to other countries. On the authoring process, she explained that each chapter of ‘Measuring Up’ —the first section of which reviews progress on a Goal-by-Goal basis—was led by one or two UKSSD members, based on their strengths and area of expertise. The report’s second section examines procedural aspects of SDG delivery in the UK, including governance arrangements and the roles of stakeholders.

The report finds that the UK performs well on 24% of the targets, has performance gaps on 57%, and shows little to no policy change or otherwise poor performance on 15%. For 3% of targets, there were not enough data available to make an informed assessment. The report utilized publicly available data from international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank, as well as from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). UKSSD also notes that in authoring the report, they identified data gaps on the UK’s impacts abroad, including through supply chains and on marine pollution. Although accounting for the country’s global reach is embedded in the thinking, UKSSD noted, additional measures are needed take stock to take stock.

Areas of high performance include SDGs 3, 4 and 17. The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15.

Areas of high performance by the UK include SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15 (life on land), and on several Goals (2, 5, 9 and 13) not a single target is marked as green (“good”). In terms of efficiently accelerating progress, the report notes that although the UK’s implementation framework of Single Departmental Plans (SDPs) are a practical way of delegating authority, there is a risk that doing so will reduce recognitions of interlinkages across the Goals and targets, thereby siloing efforts or reduce their effectiveness. Thus, the report calls for cross-departmental action to ensure policy coherence.

Dominic White, Co-Chair, UKSSD, highlighted that the report is put forth in the spirit of collaboration, offered in lieu of government capacity, to recognize what a performance review looks like from a stakeholder perspective. He emphasized synergies between the UK and global contexts, noting that this is “where sustainable development comes home.” On methodology, he underscored the stringency of the review, noting that UKSSD applied the “leave no one behind” principle when analyzing targets: if a person or group is not getting the full benefits of a target, the target is not scored as green.

Looking ahead, White described the ‘Measuring Up’ report and the UK’s intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 HLPF as opening a “policy window” where experiences can be built on and taken further, and gaps identified by the report can be addressed. The discussion also raised the broader importance of “voluntary stakeholder reviews” (VSRs), which can serve as a baseline for, or to complement, inform, strengthen—or in some cases refute—countries’ official VNRs on progress towards the SDGs.

The event follows the report’s initial launch, held at the UK House of Commons on 3 July 2018. The ‘Measuring Up’ project has been supported by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Pearson, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Sodexo, DNV GL, PwC, Stakeholder Forum and Thai Union.

102,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-analyzes-countries-readiness-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Analyzes Countries’ Readiness to Leave No One Behind,"18 July 2018: A briefing note and index launched in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) reviews the readiness of 86 countries to “leave no one behind.” With the SDGs in effect for nearly 1,000 days, the Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI) ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018’ explores the extent to which countries have the required data, policies and financing in place.

Elizabeth Stuart, ODI, emphasized during the launch event in New York, US, on 18 July 2018, that “we know what it takes” to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda, as articulated by the Index:

data to identify who is left behind and take stock of progress;

a reprioritization of policies to ensure that affected communities receive the resources they need;

finance, particularly in the areas of education, health and social protection; and

a rethinking of donors’ “risk appetites” to go beyond a poverty reduction agenda.

The 2018 Index builds on an inaugural Index released in 2017, adding a policy indicator on resilience, in line with the theme of the 2018 HLPF. Data collected on the additional indicator show that, of the 86 countries reviewed, more than half (46) are “not ready” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective. Stuart said a new indicator will be added annually, in line with the theme of each year’s HLPF.

The updated Index includes all countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018. On progress, the briefing note highlights that much of the progress made since last year has been in the realm of data, and 11 countries have improved their index score since 2017. Overall, ODI finds that 55 countries are “ready” to meet their commitment, 24 are “partially ready,” five are “not ready,” and two have insufficient data to make an informed assessment. The briefing note concludes that “many countries are insufficiently prepared” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective, with a quarter failing to enact appropriate policy frameworks. Further, the briefing note flags as a concern the finding that, despite the theme of the 2018 HLPF, most countries fail to identify, let alone prioritize, those most at risk of being left behind in the preparation of their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and other adaptation projects. A search of 57 countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change found that almost half did not contain a single mention of ODI’s keywords relating to a leave no one behind agenda.

ODI’s Index considers four indicators of outcomes: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment.

During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, highlighted that the leave no one behind terminology can “mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people,” and can be viewed from a variety of lenses, including income, geography, gender or location. On this, he noted a UNDP discussion paper to be released in the coming weeks titled, ‘What does it mean to leave no one behind?’ that will present a framework for implementation. Steiner also flagged that the SDGs are not a starting point, but rather a reminder of what we have left to do, following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. He and Stuart acknowledged, however, that the SDGs were agreed during a “high water mark for multilateralism,” and that in today’s very different political environment it is important to “keep driving through” and continue a positive narrative.

Isidoro Santana, Minister of Economy, Planning and Development, Dominican Republic, outlined challenges his country is facing, especially on tax capacity and domestic resource mobilization. He lamented that although a significant amount of public funding goes towards education, this leaves other social issues unattended. He noted that the Dominican Republic and many other middle-income countries (MICs) face a decline in official development assistance (ODA) at a time when domestic resources are not yet able to fill the finance gap, and addressing this could help to deliver the leave no one behind agenda.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, Canada, described measures that her government has taken to achieve leaving no one behind domestically, highlighting indigenous communities, affordable housing, and safe, clean drinking water as areas needing more action. She noted policy reforms that aim to lift children out of poverty, enhance workers’ benefits, and introduce a rights framework for indigenous communities, calling the SDGs an opportunity to link the “usual and unusual suspects together.” Caesar-Chavannes also emphasized Canada’s “feminist foreign policy,” saying it provides a gateway to being able to name and talk about those who are left behind. She noted investments in Canada’s national statistics office to add capacity on disaggregation and better tracking of outcomes.

While ODI’s Index primarily focuses on countries’ readiness to leave no one behind, it also considers four indicators of outcomes in order to demonstrate actual progress: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment. It aggregates data on these outcomes to assess whether countries are on track to leave no one behind, scoring them as on track, off track or making partial progress.

ODI’s analysis finds “a clear correlation” between countries’ readiness and outcome scores.

103,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholders-share-views-on-hlpf-effectiveness-ahead-of-2019-review/,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholders Share Views on HLPF Effectiveness Ahead of 2019 Review,"9 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants exchanged views on the value, role and future of the HLPF, including an upcoming process to review its format and organizational aspects. The side event titled, ‘Stakeholder Engagement in the HLPF and its Review in 2019,’ was organized by the Major Groups and Other Stakeholder (MGOS), and took place on the first day of the HLPF.

Opening the event, Jeffery Huffines, CIVICUS, noted that in 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and another one at the level of the UNGA. In addition, beginning in September 2019, he said governments will begin a process of reviewing the HLPF’s format and organizational aspects.

The HLPF was established in 2013, through UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 67/290, in accordance with paragraph 84 of ‘The Future We Want,’ the outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Resolution 67/290 was followed by the adoption of UNGA resolution 70/299 in July 2016 that clarifies various elements related to the follow-up and review functions of the HLPF, including the specific themes of the Forum for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as the set of SDGs to be reviewed in depth in those years. Resolution 70/299 also notes that progress in its implementation and in the implementation of UNGA resolution 67/290 will be reviewed by the UNGA at its 74th session (2019-2020) “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.

In the context of this upcoming review process, panelists at the side event highlighted concerns and suggestions with regard to MGOS participation in the HLPF. Stefano Prato, Society for International Development, noted that despite a “significant shrinking” of space for civic engagement, there is capacity to “bridge democratic and bureaucratic deficit.” He called on MGOS to take concrete steps to ensure the participation of “right-holders” (such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, migrants and refugees), in the Forum. He also called on MGOS to “connect the dots” by linking engagement mechanisms between various thematic platforms, such as financing for development (FfD) or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). He underlined the need to better organize, engage more closely with the regional level, and change the nature of the HLPF in a way that allows taking “collective” decisions on issues that need to be addressed.

Mohammed Ali Loutfy, Disabled Peoples International (DPI), said: coalitions composed of civil society and stakeholders should be better supported and recognized as part of SDG reviews; more stakeholders should be involved in SDG implementation at the national level; and there should be increased engagement with local authorities and grassroot groups, and improved coordination between UN agencies and civil society. He called for bringing different participatory processes together, and suggested to have stakeholders represented in the office(s) in charge of SDG implementation at the national level.

Beisheim noted that the thematic reviews lack guidelines, have difficult-to-follow preparatory processes, and lack actionable results.

Marianne Beisheim, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, characterized the HLPF as “the institutional home” of the SDGs, recalling that one of its roles is to follow up on and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. She said there are complementary components of the follow-up and review process, such as the thematic reviews, regional reviews, voluntary national reviews (VNRs), the SDG progress report issued by the UN Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). On issues with the thematic reviews, she noted, inter alia, the absence of guidelines, the difficulty to follow preparatory processes, and the lack of actionable results. On VNRs, she remarked that quality of national preparatory processes and reports vary, national reviews often lack analysis of good practices and challenges, and there is limited room for critical questions from MGOS. She underlined the limited time for in-depth discussions at the HLPF, and the need to secure actionable results for both the thematic reviews and the VNRs.

Among other suggestions, Beisheim called for guidelines and for including policy recommendations from thematic reviews and VNRs in HLPF outcome documents. She also proposed that designated custodian institutions publish a roadmap on preparatory and follow-up process for thematic reviews “in good time,” and that the HLPF makes more room for debates related to VNRs.

Rebecca Malay, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, GCAP, noted that most thematic reviews and VNRs do not frame the SDGs based on a human rights approach. She remarked that the SDG indicators are often “confined” to technocrats, without civil society involvement. She also observed that the many independent reports prepared by civil society organizations on SDG national implementation (“shadow reports”) are not available on the HLPF’s VNR website.

On lessons learned regarding the HLPF so far, Sachini Perera, International Women’s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW), RESURJ, said the review of the HLPF in 2019 should take into account the ongoing UN reform, and should examine how human rights can be incorporated in the Forum, adding that human rights processes are currently overlooked when assessing SDG progress.

Discussing stakeholder engagement in the HLPF and its review in 2019, Jan-Gustav Strandenaes, Stakeholder Forum, said paragraph 15 of resolution 67/290 defines civil society’s rights and privileges at the HLPF. This paragraph allows MGOS to: attend all official meetings of the forum; have access to all official information and documents; intervene in official meetings; submit documents and present written and oral contributions; make recommendations; and organize side events and round tables, in cooperation with UN Member States and the UN Secretariat. Compared to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that preceded the establishment of the HLPF, however, Strandenaes noted that some privileges have been lost, including the access and participation to all negotiations, access to all rooms and participation in all meetings, and access to all delegates on the floor. He also underscored the “enormous” mandate of the HLPF, as defined in resolution 67/290 and the 2030 Agenda, and identified elements that should be improved, including on emerging issues, the science-policy interface, stakeholder engagement, and on developing and negotiating the Ministerial Declaration.

104,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/the-climate-group-c40-cities-launch-zero-emission-vehicle-challenge/,"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"The Climate Group, C40 Cities Launch Zero Emission Vehicle Challenge","12 July 2018: States, regions, cities, international business groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are calling for broader adoption of electric vehicles in order to decarbonize the transport sector through the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Challenge.

The challenge was launched by The Climate Group and C40 Cities on 10 July 2018 in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene in San Francisco, US, from 12-14 September 2018. It urges the global auto industry to accelerate the manufacture of electric vehicles and increase production to fulfill growing demand, bringing together the collective purchasing power and influence on the market of stakeholders and existing programmes, which have until now been focused on separate sectors. In this way, the challenge provides an opportunity for the auto sector to take the lead in the large-scale transition to electric vehicles and help deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The ZEV Challenge calls on:

automakers to signal their willingness to work towards an endgame for combustion engine vehicles running on fossil fuels, and in the meantime, commit to a ZEV percentage of sales by 2025;

more multinational businesses to join EV100, which brings together forward-looking companies committed to fleet electrification and making electric transport the ‘new normal’ by 2030; and

states and regions to join a new Under2 Coalition ZEV initiative that focuses on procurement, infrastructure and policy.

The challenge is currently being supported by the State of California, EDF Energy, LeasePlan, Unilever, New York City, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Rome, Mexico City, Medellín, Copenhagen, Pittsburgh, and the regions of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Navarra, Spain.

The Navarra region of Spain has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them.

Several countries like France and the UK have already announced end dates for the sale of fossil fuel-run vehicles, and the State of California has committed to putting five million zero-emission vehicles on roads and highways by 2030.

Speaking about the challenge, Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto said governments have the purchasing power to force manufacturers to provide off-the-shelf electric vehicle technologies. Mexico City Mayor José Ramón Amieva said his city is already working on the country’s first electric bus corridor.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan noted the city’s introduction of the world’s first Ultra Low Emission Zone beginning in April 2019, which will provide the opportunity for industry and government to work together to create more sustainable cities. Shane Rattenbury, ACT Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, noted the ACT government’s commitment to a zero emissions passenger vehicle fleet from 2019-2020 and a 100% renewable electricity supply from 2020.

Manu Ayerdi, Vice-President for Economic Development, Navarra, Spain, said his region has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them. Medellín Mayor Federico Gutierrez Zuluaga said buses in the city’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system will be equipped with electric buses.

The report covers developments from 2015-2017 on migration and sustainable development in the region, and identifies SDG targets that are directly and indirectly related to human mobility. Titled ‘Situation Report on International Migration: Migration in the Arab Region and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ the report is published in the lead-up to the anticipated adoption of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018.

The three-part report addresses: trends in international migration in the Arab region; changes in migration governance in 2016 and 2017; and linkages between international migration and the SDGs.

Approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region.

The report finds that approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region, and numbers of women migrants have increased, due to recent conflicts and violence. Various sub-regions have different migration patterns, with the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) hosting a larger concentration of migrants than anywhere else in the world, and the Mashreq region serving as a source of labor migration and displacement due to conflict.

In terms of migration governance, Arab countries maintain restrictive and gender-based policies on access to nationality. However, the report notes some improvements in upholding the rights of migrant workers and in combating human trafficking.

The authors identify four types of relationships between migration and the SDGs: the level of development in an area as a driver for mobility; migration as an opportunity for development; migrants as contributors to development in their countries of origin and also in their countries of destination; and mobile populations as vulnerable populations whose specific needs should be considered.

They highlight SDG target 10.7 on facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, as well as other relevant targets: protecting migrant workers’ labor rights and providing a safe and secure working environment, especially for women (SDG 8.8); reducing the transaction costs of remittances (SDG 10.c); expanding scholarships for students from developing countries (SDG 4.b); eliminating trafficking in persons, especially of women and girls, and forced labor and exploitation (SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2); and ensuring meaningful data collection (SDG 17.18).

The report refers to several international frameworks that can help governments assess their own policies: the Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration; the Migration Governance Framework; the Migration Governance Index; and a dashboard of indicators of measuring policy and institutional coherence for migration and development.

106,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation’,"Reviewing the original Hotel Transylvania back in 2012, I remarked that, by the time Adam Sandler’s Dracula started rapping at the denouement, “I was dying for a Van Helsing to come in and clean house.”

That didn’t happen, of course, so in due course we got Hotel Transylvania 2, in which Dracula’s pixieish undead daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) married her bohemian human boyfriend Johnny (Andy Samberg) and gave birth to a half-undead son named Dennis (the improbably named Asher Blinkoff).

But now, at last, there’s a Van Helsing in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. Two, in fact.

Jim Gaffigan voices the obsessive monster-hunter Abraham Van Helsing, who, in a prologue starting on a train in 1897 and proceeding to a montage of crashing and burning, pursues his chosen vocation of would-be vampire slayer with all the tenacity — and all the success, if not the slapstick logic — of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner.

Then there’s Abraham’s great-granddaughter, Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn), who has more or less inherited the family trade and is out to succeed where her great-grandfather failed.

At this point, though, it’s clear that the Van Helsings are fighting a lost cause.

The original Hotel Transylvania took place in the shadow of centuries of alienation between monsters and humans, at least insofar as the latter were even aware of the existence of the former. Historically, it seems humans had persecuted monsters rather than the reverse; Drac, who never drinks human blood, lost his wife in an attack by an angry human mob and was bitterly anti-human as a result.

But Mavis’ open-minded curiosity about humans was clearly a harbinger of a more tolerant future — and in time, Drac realized that human society was evolving beyond its past prejudices.

In the first sequel, the monster community came out of the shadows and found the human world generally ready to welcome them. There were holdouts, of course, like Drac’s traditionally human-hating father, Vlad, voiced by Mel Brooks. In general, though, both sides were ready to let go of the hate.

Van Helsing is an old-school hater on the human side who will, of course, learn by the end to let go of the hate, too. This is such a foregone conclusion that as early as that 1897 prologue Drac is already mocking Van Helsing for his hopeless crusade and urging him to “let go of the hate,” which seems more progressive and less bitter than the Drac we met in the original movie. (Drac’s monster resort was founded a year later, in 1898. No, I have not seen any of these films more than once and don’t know the franchise that well. I’m looking at transcripts on the internet.)

Like Mavis in the first film, Ericka has been brought up to hate the other side, and, while she has been effectively brainwashed in a way Mavis never was, Ericka may not quite be the true believer grandfather is.

Somehow the Van Helsings lay a trap for Drac, whom Mavis believes is overworked and needs a vacation. The truth is that Drac is lonely after centuries of widowerhood and doesn’t believe he can connect with someone new, since the “Zing” — magical monster love at first sight — comes only once in a lifetime, or so we’ve been told since the first film.

Then Mavis books a monster cruise for them and all their family and friends, including Kevin James’ Frankenstein, David Spade’s Invisible Man and Keegan-Michael Key’s Mummy. The moment Drac lays eyes on the cruise ship’s female captain, he knows it’s possible to “zing” again. (“Zing” started out as a noun but was quickly verbified, as “Mavis and Johnny zinged.”)

The catch is that the captain is Ericka Van Helsing, and the ship belongs to her and her great-grandfather (or what’s left of him, after all that opening crashing and burning). See, this is the trap, though why the Van Helsings happen to own an ocean liner and then their archenemy goes on a cruise … sorry, I overthought that one.

Overthinking the plot, I’ll apologize for. Themes are another matter.

I found the first film’s “humans are the real monsters” theme tiresome, although in fairness the movie was really about overcoming mutual prejudice, and the premise was that neither humans nor monsters were truly the monsters the other side thought.

The monsters could be understood allegorically as a misunderstood invisible minority, although in that case the movie would seem to be saying that the minority needed to let go of their suspicions and recognize that the majority was ready to accept them, which I’m not sure is a message the filmmakers would have intended.

The target audience, of course, won’t be paying much attention to these themes of prejudice and tolerance. They’ll be laughing at gags like Drac trying to talk to a smartphone that mishears everything he says or little Dennis and his young werewolf gal pal Winnie (Sadie Sandler) trying to disguise Dennis’ elephant-sized puppy Tinkles with a trenchcoat and a tiny hat.

Adults may chuckle at a few gags, including a chupacabra joke and the weariness of Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon’s werewolf couple who are overwhelmed with their large litter.

Still, just because it’s a dumb kiddie film doesn’t mean the ideas don’t matter. Hotel Transylvania told us that the “Zing” comes once in a lifetime, and when it hits it’s for life (whatever “life” means for vampires and mummies and walking skeletons). This is the kind of “Someday my prince will come” romanticism for which Disney has been doing penance in updated fairy tales like Frozen and Moana.

I’m not thrilled about the lack of worthy romantic leading men in recent Hollywood animation, but I prefer the theme in Frozen, about needing to get to know someone before deciding to get married, to this series’ magical, inexorable “Zing” moment.

In Hotel Transylvania, Mavis worried that maybe the “Zing” between her and Jonathan was only on her side, not his. (Internet transcript, I promise.)

This threequel makes it clear that “zinging” is destiny, and even if it strikes one person before the other, it’s still meant to be. So if Drac “zinged” when he saw Ericka, but Ericka didn’t “zing” back, Drac must still pursue her, even if she told him in so many words that she could never be with a monster. In the real world this translates to harassment and stalking. (Are male vampires who love human women ever not stalkerish?)

All three Hotel Transylvania movies were directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, most celebrated for small-screen fare like Samurai Jack and Dexter’s Laboratory. His often frenetic style and one-dimensional characters work well in short bursts on the small screen, but pall at feature length. Drac remains a dull protagonist, too lacking in self-awareness or substance for his father-daughter relationship with Mavis to have the appeal it should.

The animation is energetic and character design remains a strength. A race of fish-men, including a cruise host named Stan (Chris Parnell), are so visually striking they look like they belong in another movie, such as Rango. (Disappointingly, Stan gives the final destination, Atlantis, such a buildup that it’s a disappointment to arrive at what is more like Atlantic City, complete with a crooner Kraken who looks like a cheap knockoff of Jermaine Clement’s magnificent giant crab Tamatoa in Moana.)

The best sequence is Drac and Ericka’s dance of death in an ancient Indiana Jones-style deathtrap temple, with Ericka flinging herself at one booby trap after another and Drac either whisking her out of harm’s way with split-second timing or using himself as an inhuman shield. If the whole film were this memorable, you would be reading the last sentence of a very different review.

107,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/why-nigeria-requires-5bn-water-sector-investments-to-meet-sdg-targets/,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vanguard,Why Nigeria requires $5bn water sector investments to meet SDG targets,"Kindly Share This Story:

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

108,https://www.thecairoreview.com/global-forum/sdg-16-and-the-lessons-for-egypt/,"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Cairo Review of Global Affairs,SDG 16 and the Lessons for Egypt,"The countdown to the full implementation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has already begun. Started in 2015, the SDGs are a set of 17 goals which aim to address social and economic development issues around the world by 2030. With only twelve years remaining before full implementation of the SDGs, speculations are on the rise regarding the ability to fully realize all the aspired aims of the SDGs. Many argue that while the SDGs are much improved as compared to the World Health Organization’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), they are still not good enough. Special focus has been directed toward SDG 16, looking into how governments will be able to realize “peace, justice and strong institutions” and fulfill their commitments to building effective, accountable and inclusive organizations. SDG 16 was described as being the most ambitious and yet the most challenging goal of the 17 total SDGs.

The United Nations’ organizations are working hard to incentivize countries around the globe to keep the SDGs in mind and work toward their implementation. Within that context, the United Nations Public Service Forum and Awards Ceremony was held in Marrakech, Morocco from June 21 to June 23, 2018. The Forum was titled: “Transforming Governance for Realizing the Sustainable Development Goals” and was organized jointly by the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the Kingdom of Morocco. Over the duration of the conference, more than 750 international participants discussed good practices, strategies and challenges to achieve the SDGs.

What inspired me the most was that on the June 23, in celebration of the UN Public Service Day, awards were given out to eight programs and initiatives from eight different countries in recognition of their excellence and innovation in realizing the SDGs and fulfilling the principle of leaving no one behind. These awards are basically one significant way of highlighting successful initiatives and pilot projects that lead the way toward the partial realization of SDG 16. I thought it is useful here to share a glimpse of what those winning initiatives are and to try to figure out lessons Egypt can learn from the awardees. The awards were divided into three main categories.

Category One focused on “reaching the poorest and most vulnerable through inclusive services and partnerships” and in that category the two winners were from Indonesia and Austria. In Indonesia, the award was given to the “Initiative for Reducing Malaria” whereby—through collaboration between local government, nonprofits and the private sector—a program was implemented to raise awareness about malaria, educate villagers, and repack malaria medicine in a more-friendly format and thus significantly reduce malaria morbidity rates in twelve piloted villages.

In Austria, the award was bestowed on the “Initiative for Talents Development Among Migrants.” In this program, the city of Trofaicach, together with a private company, established a boarding school for under-age migrants to provide them with skills training, in addition to regular schooling and orientation about Austrian culture, so as to be able to find jobs easily upon graduation and fill a real need in the Austrian market for skilled labor.

Category Two called for “making institutions inclusive and ensuring participation in decision making” and in this category there were three winners from South Korea, Colombia and Spain. In South Korea, the award was given to the “Initiative for Transparent Tax Administration,” where in one South Korean province an online fiscal information system was established that disclosed all budgetary revenues and expenditures to the public in real time. This enabled citizens to check government-based financial operations via the website, resulting in improved efficiency and was the reason the Finance law was changed to require all local governments do the same and disclose their expenditures and revenues on a daily basis.

Meanwhile in Colombia, the award was given to the “Initiative for Building Peace Among Rivals” where, in the city of Manizales, a number of public and private entities cooperated and managed to improve the city’s security situation through implementing an initiative targeting youth in conflict prone districts. Once the youth had been targeted, the project worked to engaging them in dialogue with members of rival gangs and helped them with education and job opportunities.

Finally, in Spain, the award was given to the “Initiative for Citizen Participation” where in Madrid, an online platform was established to receive citizens’ views, proposals and suggestions for the improvement of public services. The aim has reportedly succeeded in making the city more transparent and inclusive for its citizenry.

Category Three of the awards recognized the promotion of, “gender responsive public services to achieve the SDGs” and in that category the winners came from Kenya, Thailand, and Switzerland. In Kenya, the “Initiative for Promoting Gender Responsive Public Service” was awarded because of the country’s success in integrating women and youth issues in the agricultural value chain of 47 counties across Kenya.

In Thailand, the winning initiative was for low cost “Visual Inspection and treatment of Cancer Patients in Remote Areas.” Through collaboration between the Thai Health Ministry and technical experts, a pilot project was implemented that succeeded in controlling and treating cervical cancer at low cost in rural and remote areas where originally services were lacking.

Finally, in Switzerland, there was recognition for the “Initiative for Advancing Gender Equal Pay (SAGE).” This is a nationwide initiative by the Swiss public sector to ensure conformance with gender equal pay that has changed public discourse nationwide about the issue. Despite the high level of development in Switzerland, there has continued to be cases of inequitable pay to women across sectors.

Learnables for Egypt

Rewarding excellence and innovation in public service is in itself an important message. The practice was implemented several years ago in Egypt by Former Minister of Administrative Reform Ahmed Darwish, following the Emirati model of having secret assessors visit public organizations and rate the public organizations’ services. The best organizations studied by Darwish’s assessors used to be feted at the Cairo Opera House in a jovial ceremony. Just this week, it was announced that the excellence awards in public service will be resumed, and a conference was jointly organized by the Egyptian Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Administrative Reform and the Emirati government. Hopefully, we are witnessing a celebration of excellence in public service once more.

Using the term ‘public service’ is also an important message and reminder to all employees that they are there to serve the public and not to control the populace or antagonize them.

Employing innovative methods to solve problems and provide improved service to citizens were key features in all the winning initiatives at the 2018 United Nations Public Service Awards. Information technology was vital in Madrid and in South Korea through the online platforms used, whether to receive citizens’ feedback in the former or to relay information about expenditures and revenues in the latter. Both initiatives led to reduced corruption and enhanced efficiency. However, innovation is not limited to using new technology. In the case of Colombia, the innovative solution focused on engaging rivals in a dialogue through providing jobs and education as incentives, and thus managed to solve deeply entrenched problems.

Cooperation between government, civil society and the private sector was also a repeated feature in most of the initiatives. The private sector sometimes is more adept in using updated technology—or has different technical solutions—such as in Austria or in Indonesia. Meanwhile, nonprofits and civil society organizations have greater outreach powers and more enhanced communication skills with citizens especially in marginalized communities, such as was the case in the cancer treatment program in Thailand.

Coming up with win-win solutions was also a key feature at the 2018 United Nations Public Service Awards. In Austria, both migrants and the Austrian nation benefited from the initiative, whereby trained migrants managed to find decent jobs and at the same time filled a vacancy in the Austrian job market.

Adopting a true willingness to improve on the quality of life of citizens means to engage them in the decision-making process, provide them with better services, and ensure that equity, transparency and inclusiveness are what matters. These are the attributes which distinguish these eight success stories and provide us with multiple lessons for the Egyptian experience.

Commentators note that the SDG Index, a global ranking, shows Australia is performing well on health, education and well-being, but is doing poorly on environmental goals, and ranks lowest in the world on climate action. Australia is currently holding a Senate inquiry into actions for promoting SDG implementation domestically and through its aid programme.

At the domestic launch of Australia’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) in Sydney on 15 June, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, highlighted SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) as being of particular importance to Australia. She drew attention to Australia’s contribution to establishing SDG 5 as a stand-alone goal in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, its role as custodian of the Great Barrier Reef, and its status as an island continent and part of the Pacific Ocean. She launched the Australian SDGs Website developed by the Global Compact Network Australia (GCNA), which showcases sustainable development initiatives by government and allows for stakeholders to upload case studies of their SDG-related work.

The Australian Government maintains a reporting platform on the SDGs, which provides official government data on the SDG indicators. The data platform, the Australian SDGs website and the VNR report together make up the reporting package on Australia’s action on the SDGs.

The Australian SDGs Hub for Business suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

Besides the Australian SDGs website, the GCNA has also established an online Australian SDGs Hub for Business. This website explains the relevance of each of the 17 SDGs to business, and suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

In the lead-up to the presentation of Australia’s VNR to the HLPF, Monash University academics John Thwaites and Tahl Kestin published an article on the online portal The Conversation. Their 11 July article highlights data from the global SDG Index showing that Australia has done well on measures of health and well-being (SDG 3), and is providing good quality education (SDG 4); however, performance on the environmental goals, such as SDG 14 (life on land) is low in comparison to other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and ranks lowest in the world on climate action (SDG 13). They call for more deliberate action by Australia, such as developing a national implementation plan and allocating specific funds for SDG implementation.

The SDG Index lists Australia in 37th place overall, a fall from its 26th place the previous year. Thwaites and Kestin explain that Australia’s performance on climate is measured not only by its domestic emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but also by the emissions accounted for in the goods it consumes, its vulnerability to climate change, and its exports of fossil fuels. The SDG Index takes into account the “spillover” effect – the extent to which countries are promoting or impeding the ability of other countries to meet the SDGs. Based on its fossil fuel exports, Australia’s carbon emissions are estimated at 44 tonnes per person each year, more than those of Saudi Arabia (35.5 tonnes per person) or the US (710 kg per person). [Article on The Conversation]

The SDG Index is published by Bertelsmann Stiftung, a private German foundation, and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a network commissioned by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2012 to mobilize expertise from academia, civil society and the private sector.

Australia is currently holding a Senate inquiry on the SDGs, which is inviting contributions from all concerned. The inquiry is seeking input regarding: general understanding and awareness of the SDGs across the Australian Government and in the wider Australian community; costs, benefits and opportunities for implementing the SDGs; governance and accountability measures in implementation; monitoring and communicating performance; and promoting action on the SDGs through Australia’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme. There are 155 submissions listed on the inquiry website to date from government ministries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, indigenous peoples, student organizations, and individuals. The inquiry opened on 4 December 2017, and is due to report its findings on 29 November 2018.

110,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/political-challenges-in-monitoring-sdg-6/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Political Challenges in Monitoring SDG 6,"Last month, at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, US, a central part of the discussions on achieving and monitoring SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) was the importance of looking at water quality in a broader context. One example is looking at the quality of freshwater in the context of other sectors, in relationship to food security, or the impact on other resources such as soil. This topic will once again be high on the agenda at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden, later this month.

Seeing freshwater quality in a broader context is no doubt important, but what we often forget is that implementing this broader view comes along with significant measurement challenges. At the forefront of these challenges is the difficulty of identifying relevant data and information needs in view of multiple goals, meeting these data and information needs, and interpreting data and information. These challenges involve various interests and require negotiations. In other words, addressing them is a political matter. To meet such challenges, water quality measurement must move beyond being a technical issue addressed by natural scientists alone, and become a topic for inter- and transdisciplinary research teams.

Changing the Scope Means Redefining Measurements, Process, and Use

Let us first have a look at what has to be measured. If we consider multiple goals when measuring water quality, this complicates the process of identifying data and information needs. Before measurement programmes can be set up, the management goal needs to be clear, for example using water in agriculture for energy and/or food production. This is often not the case due to a lack of regulations specifying integrated measurement goals (such as for soil and water management). Developing such regulations requires negotiation processes laden with transaction costs for all relevant actors. Further, even if the goals are clarified, it often remains unclear what types of indicators, data and standards are best suited to efficiently monitor progress in achieving a goal (for instance standards for health-related water quality or lower standards). This leads to the question of whether existing indicators can be used or combined indicators are needed.

Let us assume now we know what has to be measured. The next question would be how we can obtain the relevant data and information. We see here a couple of challenges for meeting these needs. First, one needs many different types of data and information, such as data on the quality of waters, soils, agricultural yields, and human health. Second, such data needs are particularly challenging to meet from the technical point of view, given the high complexity of the social-ecological system. Take, for instance, the impact of fertilizers on the amount of nitrogen in groundwater. This impact depends on various factors such as weather conditions, the cultivated plants or soil characteristics. Such complexity can lead to unforeseen or delayed effects, which complicate measurement programmes even further. Third, even if data are available, information transfer has particularly high requirements, since data are typically dispersed across research groups (e.g. soil and water scientists) and public authorities (e.g. water and agricultural authorities). Sharing data between these entities can be challenging as there is often a lack of communication or trust, or asymmetric power and interests are involved. All this ultimately hinders the establishment of sufficient and inclusive databases.

Let us assume for a moment we can overcome these challenges and have our data at hand. A third challenge then regards their use for a truly integrated assessment of solutions. We assume here that it will be particularly challenging to interpret data and information given multiple baselines of partly conflicting goals. Take, for instance, measuring the amount of nitrogen in soils and water. High amounts of nitrogen can be interpreted in various ways. From a water quality perspective, high amounts are problematic since they lead to the eutrophication of waters; from an agricultural perspective, however, it may also indicate a high production level, leading to economic growth and food security. Understanding such relations requires thinking in new, broader systems that may go beyond traditional check lists of good practices.

Addressing New Challenges in Measurement

While seeing freshwater quality in a broader context seems to be good idea for achieving truly sustainable development, we have to be prepared for increased challenges in the measurement process. These challenges are not only technical, but also political, meaning that they involve political discourses among various stakeholders, reflecting various interests and power asymmetries. New tools based on rigorous research need to be developed to help practitioners overcome such political challenges.

At the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we believe that measurement-related activities should be conducted in a participatory manner from the very start. First, an interdisciplinary research agenda on water quality measurement is the way forward. Measuring water quality has mainly been understood as a natural science endeavor. However, addressing the politics in defining targets, gathering data, and interpreting data calls for the involvement of social scientists. Take, for instance, the question of data sharing. Extensive and successful research conducted by political scientists on the conditions of information sharing in conflict-laden environments can help design water measurement programmes in the face of complex societal goals.

The second step is to deepen existing stakeholder engagement by opening the natural science-dominated field of measurement to the broad range of stakeholders in resource management. Practitioners can be involved here in setting the frame for measurement. (Natural) scientists have to refer to these societal needs when setting up measurement programmes within their research programmes. This can be done, for instance, by discussing measurement challenges together with stakeholders of different ministries in joint workshops.

The platform titled, Information System of Sustainable Development Goals (SIODS), reports on 66 indicators corresponding to 16 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).



The comparison function helps identify areas that are making progress towards the 2030 Agenda, and areas where more effort is needed.

The portal was released on the occasion of Mexico’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) during the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). It provides a centralized location to house data from various departments and agencies, and provides tools to analyze and visualize this information. For example, it includes a geographic search function, which allows users to view SDG data for each province in Mexico. Once the geography is selected, the platform returns a table displaying all the Goal, target and indicator information for that province and compares it to national level statistics. This comparison function helps the user to identify areas that are making progress towards the 2030 Agenda, and areas where further efforts are required.

SIODS also allows users to customize bulk downloads of data from a download page. The download page allows users to specify which Goal, target or indicator they want to download, for which geographies and in which output format. This functionality enables users to easily tailor data requests for their needs.

Mexico’s portal was developed in collaboration with Esri – a private-sector company specializing in data and spatial analytics. Mexico’s portal is one of five portals to emerge from the partnership with Esri. The other portals were developed by Ireland, the Philippines, the State of Palestine and the UN Statistics Division for its SDG open data hub.

The report highlights a number of issues relevant to implementing the SDGs in South Africa, from partnerships and tools to the role of science, technology and innovation (STI).



The South African SDG Hub, housed at University of Pretoria, aims to connect South African policy makers with research and innovations for implementing the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Implementing the SDGs in South Africa: Challenges and Opportunities,’ presents in graphs the country’s progress against the indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report describes South Africa’s national planning, monitoring and evaluation system for the SDGs, which it says “is coherent and allows for alignment between planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation.” The report explains that Statistics South Africa monitors the SDGs prioritized by the national government, while the remaining Goals “will require social partners to assess relevance, provide data and agree on progress made.” The chapter also addresses promotion of citizen and multi-stakeholder engagements, expansion of youth involvement and knowledge infrastructure.

The report outlines the UN’s engagements with the Government of South Africa on the SDGs. The UN and the Government are discussing a Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) mission that will assess SDG alignment with South Africa’s Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF 2014-2019) and identify SDG Indicators Accelerators. The UN is supporting harmonization of interventions and civil society organization (CSO) accountability through convening 36 CSO alliances under an umbrella agenda, among other actions.

In addition, the UN Global Compact (UNGC) South Africa network has identified strategic action projects aligned with the SDGs, and is working to establish a national SDG institutional coordination mechanism at the provincial and local levels to drive SDG implementation throughout the country.

The report also considers the role of development partners and the role of researchers. It highlights “a large volume of research” relevant to SDG implementation, and identifies the coordination and dissemination of research on SDG implementation as a primary challenge. On STI, the report asserts that, despite considerable investments and advancement, equitable access to knowledge infrastructure remains a challenge, and South Africa is working to promote more equitable access in line with the principle of leave no one behind (LNOB).

These include engaging businesses to align their operations and investments with the SDGs as well as using tools to ensure good governance and policy coherence, both in-country and through development cooperation.

A high-level meeting on the theme, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ is scheduled for 24 September 2018, where UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to unveil a new private investment strategy. As outlined by Global Policy Watch, the meeting format will include three “Davos-style” panels with CEOs from the private sector, heads of state and technological innovators. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted, during a 27 July briefing on the meeting, that the world is seeing a “waning commitment” to international trade, climate, economic and financial cooperation, and that we need to not only step up engagement with the private sector, but also take advantage of financial and technological innovations to bridge gaps.

On private sector action, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN Global Compact (UNGC) have released a publication titled, ‘A Practical Guide,’ which addresses integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting. The publication follows two previous guidance documents for enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs, and outlines a three-step process to define priority SDG targets, measure and analyze objectives, and “report, integrate and implement change,” while also considering data users’ needs. The publication, developed in collaboration with Shift and PwC, warns against selecting SDGs that are easiest to report on, and instead encourages companies to focus on what is most important—or material—to their business. A more detailed write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub is forthcoming.

Also on business-SDG engagement, an edie article summarizes a webinar featuring experts from BT, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and DNV GL. Held 26 July 2018, the discussion builds on recent reports that find that, although many businesses have made pledges on SDG uptake and implementation, few feature measurable targets related to—or that measure progress against—the Goals. Panelists recognized the need for transparency on businesses’ negative impacts and the importance of identifying them in order to tackle them first. They further noted that the SDGs present an opportunity to move beyond reactive or isolated sustainability actions, and that engaging external actors that are likely to apply pressure has become “business as usual” for them.

A blog on the UN Development Programme (UNDP) website describes how companies are beginning to move beyond a business-as-usual approach. The post describes a “fourth sector” of for-profit entities “whose main purpose is to solve social and environmental problems, but generate their income mainly through commercial activities.” The author, Heerad Sabeti, is CEO of the Fourth Sector Group, which was launched in collaboration with the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress and UNDP, among other partners. Sabeti also highlights progress in South America, offering Natura as an example of a business that is contributing to “virtually every SDG in Brazil.”

On governance, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released a report titled, ‘Governance for Integrated Solutions to Sustainable Development and Climate Change: From linking issues to aligning interests.’ The report’s chapters focus primarily on the Asia-Pacific region, looking at the co-benefits of an integrated approach derived from the alignment of disparate agencies and other stakeholders. The study develops a conceptual model to illustrate which actors should be involved, and looks at horizontal, vertical and multi-stakeholder coordination in the transportation and solid waste management sectors, as well as across the water-energy-food nexus. The authors conclude that in some cases, more engagement is not needed, as the necessary relationships may already exist. However, they note the increasingly important trend of “governance beyond governments,” signaling a need for flexibility in engagement strategies. IGES also recently launched a web tool that enables users to visualize SDG targets’ interactions with others, to help assess synergies and trade-offs and inform decision-making in both the public and private sectors.

Patrick Curran, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, underscores the importance of policy coherence, called for in SDG target 17.14. Curran notes that countries’ development pathways—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa—are highly dependent on the water-energy-food nexus, noting that policies in these sectors are not currently “joined-up.” He emphasizes that reliance on donor support can sometimes undermine coherent policy, as aid has the potential to look at sectors or issues in isolation. To mitigate a siloed approach, Curran calls for the review and update of national development plans, conducted with the support of inter-ministerial and multi-stakeholder committees.

Breaking out of a siloed approach means building multi-actor partnerships (MAPs), as outlined in a German Development Institute (DIE) discussion paper titled, ‘Incentivizing and Regulating Multi-actor Partnerships and Private Sector Engagement in Development Cooperation.’ Authored by Dorothea Wehrmann, the paper describes challenges to engaging private sector actors in development cooperation towards long-term agendas such as the SDGs. Wehrmann looks at the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) to examine how such networks and partnerships can enhance MAPs’ engagement and effectiveness. She finds that these arrangements must: 1) strengthen institutional oversight; 2) support case-specific incentivizing and regulating strategies; and 3) lend further credence to context-specificity, for example, in South-South cooperation. All types of engagement will be critical in the context of reduced UN funding, as highlighted by Devex.

A Brookings report on options for filling the financing void for the SDGs focuses on increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries by increasing engagement with development finance institutions and MDBs.

On development finance more broadly, the Brookings Institution’s George Ingram and Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr. examine ways to raise the US$2.4 trillion needed annually in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030. They outline four options for filling the void, focusing primarily on the fourth: 1) eliminating trade barriers; 2) increasing official development assistance (ODA); 3) mobilizing domestic resources by creating an enabling environment for private investment; and 4) increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by increasing engagement with development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). They compare DFIs in the US, Europe and Asia to offer recommendations that can mobilize additional private capital.

A significant portion of the finance needed is for infrastructure, as discussed in a DIE paper looking primarily at the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS Bank. The paper titled, ‘Mobilizing Capital for Sustainable Infrastructure: The cases of AIIB and NDB,’ reviews instruments to mobilize private capital, building in experiences of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and others to identify lessons for “low-cost” finance providers. Given the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure, the authors note the importance of these DFIs in the sector, especially in the context of long-term sustainable development, as the social and environmental impacts of infrastructure investments are “locked in” for the duration of the projects’ lifetimes. The paper notes a need to increase the attractiveness of more sustainable projects, including by boosting returns through blended finance, de-risking through co-finance or other guarantees, and through specialized instruments used by the EIB and International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Regardless of whether they focus on public or private sectors, the above papers cut across the 5 P’s of sustainable development: people, planet, prosperity, partnerships and peace. A blog post by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that, by articulating objectives in this manner, the SDGs “represent the basic requirements of human decency.” Recognizing the linkages between these principles and their work, the IMF piece identifies how their projects and initiatives map to each pillar.

The publication titled, ‘The SDGs and Cities: International Human Mobility,’ provides an overview of cities’ various strategies, initiatives and efforts. It includes a practical tool with 13 possible lines of action to be implemented by local governments to deal with international human mobility from a human rights perspective, and emphasizes social participation and the systematic production of information.

The 13-part practical tool focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations.

The tool aims to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by facilitating, promoting and replicating implementation of local public policies aimed at helping migrants and refugees. It focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations, and aims to enhance and promote the exchange of experiences and best practices regarding international human mobility in LAC cities.

According to the report, almost 80% of Latin American population lives in cities. The study notes that the proportion of the immigrant population is higher in cities as migrants tend to settle in large urban areas. This causes difficulties for local authorities to implement policies for integrating new inhabitants, related to the lack of resources, services and technical capacity.

The Handbook describes 13 actions, relevant implementation strategies, reasons such actions are needed, indicators and targets associated with SDGs 10 (reduced inequalities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), 4 (quality education), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 5 (gender equality) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The actions include:

Guarantee access of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees to public policy-making processes (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.7);

Create a specific institution for caring for, receiving and integrating them (SDG targets 10.7, 16.6 and 16.b);

Provide training for local governments, focusing on rights (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7 and 16.b);

Develop anti-discriminatory campaigns that underscore “interculturality” for human and sustainable development (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.b);

Implement programmes that grant local identification and improve access to housing, health and education (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7, 11.1 and 16.9);

Complement curricula in schools and teacher training colleges with intercultural and bilingual education (SDG targets 4.1 and 10.7);

Develop skills improvement programmes (SDG targets 8.7, 8.8 and 10.7);

Implement programmes to care for women migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees that are victims of gender violence, and design strategies to raise awareness about this problem (SDG targets 5.1, 5.2, 10.7 and 16.1); and

Provide cultural mediators and interpreters for health and healthcare services (SDG targets 3.8 and 10.7).

Between 2000 and 2015, the number of international migrants worldwide increased from 173 million to 244 million. Around nine million international migrants live in LAC countries. International and regional organizations are advancing an agenda to promote safe migration and respect for migrants’ rights through the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which will be adopted in December 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco.

The Handbook was prepared in response to the global phenomenon of human mobility in urban areas.

In doing so, Switzerland created MONET 2030, an indicator system designed to statistically monitor implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a Swiss context. The expanded portal tracks 85 indicators across all 17 SDGs.



Of the 85 indicators monitored, MONET 2030 finds that 39 show a positive trend, 12 show no significant evolution, and 14 identify a reverse trend. These results were highlighted in Switzerland’s Voluntary National Review, which was presented to the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLFP).

MONET 2030 measures progress towards the 85 indicators by comparing observed trends to targeted trends. Targeted trends represent the desired direction of change, while observed trends reflect actual experience. Progress is assessed as positive if observed and targeted trends correspond, as negative if the observed and target trend differ, or as unchanged if the difference is greater than or less than 3%. The MONET 2030 system denotes these trends for each indicator on the front page of the site with symbolic arrows.

Users can explore each indicator in English, French or German by viewing descriptions, methodologies, reports, and graphs, which provide recent and historic data in downloadable formats. Each indicator also compares the Switzerland-defined target to its related international target, highlighting the fact that to achieve the 2030 Agenda, global goals must be assessed within a local context and addressed at the local level.

MONET 2030 is unique among countries’ online SDG portals in that it adapts an existing platform to the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to the Federal Statistical Office.

In a prior effort in SDG tracking, following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, Switzerland’s Federal Council established a commission to conduct a baseline assessment and gap analysis for the implementation of all 169 global SDG targets.

In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

Since 2015, BIP, supported by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), the European Commission, and Switzerland’s Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN), has been working to fill gaps in the available indicators for both the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity targets. Since the debut of the project, 30 more indicators have been added. Thirteen of these are official SDG indicators, including the Red List Index of trends in the conservation status of species, protected area coverage of important areas for biodiversity, and the Wetland Extent Trends Index. Many of the other indicators are also relevant to one or more of the SDGs and associated targets, including SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 10 (reduced inequalities), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The BIP website has a dedicated web page for each indicator.

BIP has also created a mapping table that helps users identify synergies between indicators for the SDGs and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The table aims to support users in identifying indicators that are suitable for national use, which can also help countries in reporting processes such as their sixth national reports under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The Summer Island Maldives resort is using the artificial reef made from hundreds of ceramic and concrete modules to build a new coral reef ecosystem.

An Australian industrial engineer with the Reef Design Lab began the project, using computer modeling to build a reef that resembled those found in the Maldives region. The 3D printing process took 24 hours. The molds were then cast in ceramic, which is similar to limestone rock, shipped to Maldives, filled with marine concrete, and assembled and submerged seven meters deep. The coral is now an integral part of the lagoon where the new coral reef ecosystem will be assembled.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits.

In total, 220 ceramic molds were filled with concrete and put together to create a larger reef. As the ceramic and concrete modules are white and therefore do not resemble the surrounding coral, the projects aims to encourage growth and provide a home for marine life, rather than replicate the reef’s natural aesthetic. Real coral fragments were transplanted onto the 3D printed reef, with the expectation that these corals will soon colonize the ceramic molds.

Over the coming years, marine biologists will study the 3D printed reef and its benefits. The 3D designs are open source for use by other researchers free of charge.

The Summer Island Maldives resort has also taken other environmentally-friendly actions, such as banning plastic straws, using solar energy and not importing drinking water.

120,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-the-belt-and-road-initiative-and-chinas-investment-in-africa/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: The Belt and Road Initiative and China’s Investment in Africa,"With tensions high in the global community around trade policies and international relations, this week’s brief reviews some of the differences in countries’ approaches to investment abroad. Following recent headlines, it examines China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in tandem with cooperation in Africa, highlighting the implications for sustainable development on the continent.

Announced in 2013 with the promise of providing a “silk road for the 21st century,” the BRI consists primarily of state- and privately-financed infrastructure projects in developing countries. The Initiative has been met with both praise and skepticism.

In the Financial Times, Beijing Foreign Studies University’s Gu Bin says, the “spirit of the BRI reinforces the value of building a shared future,” highlighting key differences that distinguish it from the post-World War II Marshall Plan led by the US. However, Sean Kenji Starrs, City University of Hong Kong, responds by noting the BRI is “no selfless venture.” He cites debt, other aspects of neocolonialism and increasing homogeneity of Chinese academia as causes for concern (though these points are also contested).

The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development’s (ICTSD) July publication of Bridges Africa zooms in on China-Africa economic relations. The introductory article flags that some have questioned the “balance and quality” of the relationship from an African perspective, given China’s high and immediate demand for natural resources. It also notes recent data that show decreases since 2013-2014 in Chinese investment in Africa, China-Africa trade, and Chinese loans to Africa. However, Yunnan Chen identifies opportunities for promoting sustainable development, emphasizing not only renewable energy and transportation projects, but also the scope for technology transfer and diversification of sourcing.

The International Institute for Environment and Development’s (IIED) James Mayers examines the complex impact of Chinese investment in Africa, linking particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), in a “long read” titled, ‘Finding a Green Path for China and Africa?’. Some investments, Mayers says, “gobble up forest and woodland. Some bring huge benefits to African economies. Some do both.” The article offers an overview of the BRI and provides insight to a topic that often features perceptions that have been “assumed rather than really known.” Mayers identifies context-specific constraints to more sustainable timber production and processing, particularly in small-scale operations that “have traditionally worked under the radar of policy and legality.” A key gap, he notes, is connecting businesses to the remote areas and people where their investments often materialize, and breaking down stereotypes or prejudices across stakeholder groups.

IIED also produced a short film on the linkages between Chinese investment in Africa and the continent’s forests, which it emphasizes are increasingly being converted to agriculture or sent to China – the world’s “only reliable market” in the eyes of one interviewee. Darlindo Pechisso, National Directorate of Forests, Mozambique, notes that 90% of the country’s timber is exported to China. The article and film are part of a wider project supported by the UK on China-Africa Forest Governance.

Looking at trade more broadly through an agricultural lens, the fourth in a series of articles on Impakter asks whether achieving the SDGs is a “grassroots-up” or “global trade-down” endeavor. The article notes that at the local level, 45 million small farms in Africa produce the bulk of countries’ agricultural exports, and that trade links these smallholders to global food value chains. The authors, from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAO), also highlight large agribusinesses and multinationals, which they indicate as having a leading role, but will have to “substantially change” their business to contribute to the SDGs and minimize the negative impacts of their operations. A Devex Q&A on support to African entrepreneurs also notes the potential for agriculture and trade in Africa.

Following the recent BRICS Summit in South Africa, China’s President Xi Jinping signed a number of cooperation documents on the continent. An opinion piece on China Global Television Network (CGTN) by China’s ambassador to Somalia, Qin Jian, calls the BRI “win-win cooperation,” noting that the BRI “reaffirms China’s commitment to building an open economy, ensures free and inclusive trade, opposes all forms of protectionism.” Qin also says the BRI stands for enhancing international cooperation through strategies that feature the SDGs and African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The Brookings Institution’s Yun Sun compares China’s state-led approach in Africa to that of the US, which is “more willing to let companies and the market” lead commercial development. She notes that while US-China cooperation around Africa’s development has been “scarce,” there is increasing collaboration between Chinese and American companies, the latter of which appear to be beneficiaries of the BRI. General Electric (GE), she highlights, has worked in partnership with the state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) on an expanded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project model. Under such a model, partners work together on joint market development, fundraising and operation. However, the article closes by cautioning that BRI projects are “designed to absorb Chinese overcapacity,” noting that most foreign firms remain at a disadvantage in competing for them. Whether these projects are aligned with the ambitions of the SDGs is yet to be seen.

Implementing the SDGs requires financial flows to, at a minimum, remain consistent. The BRI represents a significant source of funding that can begin to bridge the well-documented finance gap. However, in the broader context of a trade war and retaliatory measures or increasing national self-interest, reductions in investment or the continuation of a business-as-usual approach risks leaving the environmental and social pillars of international development unaccounted for.

Prior to 1991, the USSR and Iran shared control of the sea.

The five countries reached the deal, known as the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, on 12 August 2018 during the Caspian Sea Summit in Akta, Kazakhstan. One major point of contention leading up to the Summit was whether to define the Caspian Sea as a lake, meaning it would be divided equally between all five countries, or as a sea, which would then be governed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The agreement divides the seabed into territorial zones (as is the norm with a lake) and the surface as international water (as is the norm for an officially designated sea).

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the agreement will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

In a statement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the signing of the agreement, noting that it demonstrates the importance of regional cooperation and multilateralism for maintaining international peace and security. He highlighted the convention as a “significant step” towards easing regional tensions, and said it will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

124,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-water-unep-report-details-progress-on-iwrm-implementation/,"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UN-Water, UNEP Report Details Progress on IWRM Implementation","26 August 2018: UN-Water and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) have published a report detailing progress made on implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM), as measured by SDG indicator 6.5.1 (degree of IWRM implementation). Launched at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden, the report finds that IWRM provides a critical framework for achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), as well as all other SDGs.

The report, serving as a “global baseline” for the indicator, presents a snapshot of the current state of affairs on water management, and emphasizes the need to accelerate progress. The report is the result of a participatory approach in which representatives from different sectors and regions responded to a questionnaire. It describes the efforts of 172 countries to implement IWRM, including successes and challenges, as well as coordination and collaboration beyond monitoring. According to the report, IWRM provides multiple benefits, including sustainable and efficient agriculture, economic stability, ecosystem protection, and peace and security. However, the publication concludes, without accelerating progress, 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve SDG target 6.5 on implementing IWRM at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation, by 2030.

As 80% of countries have already laid the foundations for IWRM, the report calls for focusing on implementation, accelerating its implementation, and taking collective action that builds on multi-stakeholder monitoring and reporting processes to accelerate implementation.

The report cites the challenges of developing a network of policies and laws that create an enabling environment, coordinating diverse players with different and often competing interests, generating data to make effective decisions, and securing the financing to implement plans. It highlights that while subnational, basin, aquifer and local levels tend to lag behind national-level implementation, multi-level coordination is critical, and many countries have arrangements and organizational frameworks for cooperation in most of their transboundary basins and aquifers.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress and achieve SDG 6.

Regarding wider implementation across sectors, the report calls for: adopting integrated approaches to water supply and wastewater treatment measures; identifying opportunities to integrate water into sectoral programmes and planning processes; and finding and adopting innovative, blended and multi-sector financing approaches to achieve sustainable water resources management under the 2030 Agenda. The report underscores that IWRM is an ongoing process with incremental impacts, and each country can identify pathways to make progress, as no “one-size-fits-all” approach exists for IWRM implementation.

The publication provides an overview of areas requiring action to advance sustainable management of water resources as identified by countries, including improving basin and aquifer management, financial arrangements and capacity development. The report also mentions specific actions highlighted by countries, including increasing monitoring stations, improving enforcement mechanisms and increasing cost recovery for water-related services.

Reporting from countries on SDG 6 core indicators provides a platform for dialogue on strengthening water resources management across sectors and stakeholders, and on identifying specific needs for capacity development, technology transfer and investments.

The report is one in a seven-report series launched by UN-Water that tracks progress towards SDG 6 targets using the SDG global indicators under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together the: World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP); Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI); and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS). The collaboration supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.

The report titled, ‘Bonn Challenge and India: Progress on Restoration Efforts across States and Landscapes,’ is co-published by the India Country Office of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Based on a survey of secondary data on interventions by government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOS) and the private sector, the report states that India restored approximately 9.8 million hectares of degraded land between 2011 and 2017, with nearly 95% of the restoration activities reported being led by government agencies. Despite the limited data on private sector and NGO restoration efforts, the report emphasizes the vital role that all stakeholders play in the planning and implementation of restoration programmes, highlighting NGOs’ technical expertise and knowledge of local conditions and private companies’ financing capacity.

Among “transformational changes” brought about by public restoration programmes, the report notes increased biodiversity and forest productivity linked to the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) approach. Some of the benefits listed include the creation of livelihood opportunities in remote areas by linking villages to markets for sale of non-timber forest products, better irrigation facilities for crop production, and improved transport and health care facilities. Moreover, the report notes that by providing villagers with opportunities to participate in micro-plans, the JFMC model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by successfully involving communities in the protection and sustainable harvesting of natural resources and bringing in expertise and aligned interests of multiple stakeholders in forest restoration, “thereby making it socially more inclusive.”

The Joint Forest Management Committee model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by making forest restoration “socially more inclusive.”

On the role of the private sector, the report analyzes submissions by 11 private companies, noting that many afforestation and restoration activities undertaken by private companies are often a result of legal compliance, or form part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations. The report finds that out of the total 193,290.3 hectares of land restored and afforested by the surveyed private companies, around 97% was under mixed plantations containing fast-growing exotic tree species as well as cash crops. It calls for “a more bio-centric approach” to motivate private companies to adopt more sustainable and ecological models of restoration based on native species that are adapted to local conditions and better suited to the recovery of faunal diversity.

Drawing on 14 submitted contributions by NGOs, the report notes that this sector plays a “small but active role” in the restoration of degraded lands, including unique and threatened ecosystems such as grasslands and mangroves. Of the total 352,677.9 hectares restored by the surveyed NGOs, the report notes that a total of 322,610.9 hectares (91.5%) was restored using mixed plantation model, while 8.5% of restoration activities were based on using a mono plantation model, mainly in coastal areas planted with mangrove.

The report draws on five case studies across seven states “that have all the indicators of a good restoration model” with a view to promoting broader learning and upscaling of restoration efforts. The case studies highlight different approaches and partnership arrangements, including from a government-funded joint forest management committee in Nagaland, NGO-led grassland and rainforest projects in Gujarat and Valparai respectively, and efforts by Tata Power to reverse environmental degradation in Lonavala region caused by the construction of the Valvan Dam.

While concluding that India is appropriately positioned to meet its restoration commitments under the Bonn Challenge, the report notes that additional efforts are needed to comprehensively capture the restoration efforts being undertaken by all actors in future stocktaking reports. The report further emphasizes the importance of verifying the quality of reported restoration efforts through the adoption of a robust monitoring, evaluation and learning system, and recommends that better use be made of NGOs’ technical knowledge and use of scientifically robust monitoring protocols to support such efforts.

Noting overall progress towards forest landscape restoration goals across the region, IUCN observes that at the first Bonn Challenge roundtable in Asia, held in May 2017 in Palembang, Indonesia, restoration pledges crossed the 150 million hectare milestone.

The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030.

127,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

The projects were based on the Global Compact’s Tenth Principle (anti-corruption) and on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), with a focus on SDG target 16.5 to “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.”Through the projects, which were supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative Second Funding Round, businesses, governments and civil society worked to increase compliance standards across Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria.

In Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria, the project connected various stakeholders to discuss challenges and opportunities, as well as to identify collective efforts to combat corruption, increase transparency, and create an enabling environment for businesses and flourishing societies. The UNGC’s four Local Networks organized workshops that engaged 900 participants, helping them develop resources to improve anti-corruption compliance among business participants and establish a strategy to ensure ongoing commitment towards anti-corruption.

In Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Junior Business Association, UNGC created the Integrity Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder, business-led group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) committed to tackling corruption. SMEs that joined the Initiative signed a ten-step Integrity Pledge and were trained on various aspects of anti-corruption compliance. The project trained personnel from over 400 SMEs and developed guidance materials for SMEs on topics including transparency in customs, public procurement, code of conduct, and internal controls, along with an online support desk.

To mark the completion of the projects, UNGC released the second edition of its publication titled, ‘Promoting Anti-Corruption Collective Action through Global Compact Local Networks.’

Also to increase government transparency, improve accountability, and strengthen citizen engagement as well as government responsiveness, on 19 July 2018 the World Bank and development partners launched the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The US$12 million Fund was created with Agence Française de Développement, the Department for International Development UK, and Global Affairs Canada.

This edition of “the magazine of the United Nations” focuses on the SDGs, and examines actions the UN has taken in its “lead role in advancing the 2030 Agenda.”

The articles cover topics that do not always feature prominently when discussing SDG implementation, such as disarmament and sexual violence. Pramila Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, highlights gender-based violence, which she describes as the “missing dimension” of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Patten links sexual violence to a human rights-based approach and the “leave no one behind” principle. She notes that “when war erupts, and the threat of rape at gunpoint becomes a pervasive terror,” women are unable to access fields, marketplaces and water points, and that girls are unable to attend school. Patten further highlights the disproportionate economic and health impacts of war on women, connecting to the majority of the SDGs. She also flags the importance of time: whereas men can invest hours in work, education or civic engagement, women—especially in developing countries—are often burdened with unpaid labor such as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Patten closes by calling on countries to legislate gender equality not only as a moral and social justice imperative, but also a smart economic choice.

Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, discusses the nexus between disarmament, arms control and development, outlining the linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and noting that the issue and its connection to development are not new. She references Article 26 of the UN Charter and points readers to the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament launched on 24 May 2018, which aims to take the issue out of its “narrow, isolated security lens.” Nakamitsu stresses the importance of disarmament to achieving SDG targets 16.1 (reduce all forms of violence and related death rates) and 16.a (develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions), and flags that disarmament is explicitly recognized in SDG target 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows). She also draws linkages to Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), (5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed follows by arguing that success on the SDGs will be “measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind.” Doing so, she notes, entails providing a voice and platform for meaningful participation and engagement, particularly by the most marginalized and vulnerable. To make this a reality, Mohammed calls for six elements to be put in place, including: making the SDGs better known in society; investing in more transparent and accountable institutions; creating appropriate spaces for young people and fostering their ideas and leadership potential; and connecting overlapping agendas.

The event took place on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting focused on three priorities for scaling up financing for the SDGs: aligning global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda; enhancing sustainable financing strategies; and seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

Opening the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that while efforts to achieve peace require a surge in diplomacy, efforts to achieve the SDGs require a surge in financing and investments. He stressed the need for women to have equal access, be equally represented in decision making, and be equally considered in how investments are made. The Secretary-General proposed focusing on the following objectives:

All developed countries must meet the commitments they made in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development;

We must continue to support developing countries in creating conditions for mobilizing domestic resources, including tax reform and other good governance measures; and

We need to step up efforts in developing innovative financing and in mobilizing private investment.

Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, announced that the IMF has done analytical work to see what it will take for low-income developing countries to meet the SDGs, looking at five areas that are critical for sustainable and inclusive growth: education, health, water and sanitation, roads, and electricity. She said countries investing in these sectors will address deficits in human capital and physical infrastructure, which represent a drag on their income and future prosperity. Lagarde cautioned that debt burdens are rising, with 40% of low-income developing countries being now at high risk of debt distress or in debt distress. She also emphasized that foreign aid remains crucial, and preferably takes the form of grants. She said advanced economies can do more, and can better target their aid budgets to support countries most in need. She highlighted that while budget conditions are tight in many advanced economies, returns on well-targeted aid—in terms of poverty reduction, job creation, and improving security and stability—are very high.

Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, underscored that investments should focus on the best return in the long term, rather than the best return in the short term. He called for securing more solid flows of capital to the most vulnerable countries and sectors, such as infrastructure, which will bring key long-term returns.

Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, said small island developing States (SIDS) should be at the frontline of fighting climate change instead of being the victims of climate change, but they do not have the resources. She called for a hospitable and equitable international environment, supportive of SIDS’ needs and priorities. Jusuf Kalla, Vice President of Indonesia, invited a focus on enhancing the performance of national economy.

Laurence D. Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted that 35% of today’s workforce is comprised of millennials, who have made it clear that they want to work for purpose-driven companies, and the SDGs provide the companies with an opportunity to respond to that demand. Emphasizing the need for better data on sustainability, Fink said that as more companies report on sustainability, data will improve and more capital will flow into sustainability.

Robin Shanahan, CEO of PIMCO, said the SDGs provide capital markets with the objectives they need to align themselves with sustainable development. She emphasized the importance of sustainable development bonds.

Mark Wilson, CEO of Aviva Group, underscored the need for transparent, consistent, free, and simple benchmarks that actually measure the SDGs. He highlighted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance to that end. The World Benchmarking Alliance was launched on the evening of 25 September 2018. It is funded by Aviva, the Index Initiative, and the UN Foundation.

Philippe Le Houérou, International Finance Corporation (IFC) CEO, called for being more proactive in approaching investors rather than waiting to be approached by investors. He recommended using ODA to leverage private investment and strengthen domestic markets to attract investors, explaining that if we “don’t create but destroy markets,” we will not go from billions to trillions but from billions to millions, and fail in SDG implementation.

Bill Gates, Founder, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, emphasized that the financial system needs to evolve to support developing countries, with foreign aid being a fundamental pillar. While they are not a substitute for public investment, he said private sector and foundations can help as well. He explained that philanthropic foundation can: use challenge grants to seek innovate approaches to deep-seated challenges; de-risk investments; partner with others (such as development banks) to scale up successful projects; and increase the impact of innovative collaborations, an example of which is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Financial inclusion for women is imperative, as women choose to invest in exactly the issues the SDGs are about.

Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank Group, said the Bank is working on the launch of a youth bond to connect financial markets with the purpose embedded in the SDGs. Mary Ellen Iskenderian, CEO of Women’s World Banking, emphasized that financial inclusion for women is imperative, as studies show that women choose to invest exactly in the issues the SDGs are about.

Ashish Thakkar, Founder, Mara Group, noted that digitalization will be key to formalizing the informal sector. He also highlighted the need to give access to finance to women and youth entrepreneurs, to that end. He announced that the Mara Group will produce the first quality, affordable, African-made smart phones to enable this.

In the ensuing discussion, participants raised issues related to: the need for regional integration, especially in Africa; strengthening governance institutions to improve the business environment; the potential of pension funds to provide needed investments in the SDGs; the need to support fragile states; the need for a global corporate tax reform that makes companies pay their fair contributions; the increase of public risks from private investments; and the need to invest in women.

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

The authors note that ensuring that no one will be left behind entails “taking explicit action to end extreme poverty, curb inequalities, confront discrimination,” as well as fast-tracking progress for those who are most marginalized.

The UNDP paper titled, ‘What Does It Mean to Leave No One Behind?,’ aims to stimulate dialogue and help generate consensus on delivering the leave no one behind agenda. The authors distinguish absolute deprivation from relative disadvantage, but note that both hinder peoples’ choices and capabilities to participate in or benefit from human development. The paper asserts that the disadvantages people face can be understood through a framework of five factors:

the discrimination they face;

where they live (geography);

socio-economic status;

how they are governed; and

vulnerability to shocks.

The paper also highlights the importance of intersectionality, as multiple factors often lead to a combination of disadvantages. Given the complex, multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the paper makes the case for a “holistic response” that “considers the severity and overlaps between different types of deprivation.” The authors also assert that all countries – even while data sets may be incomplete – have “some degree of evidence” of each of the five types of disadvantages.

By looking at these factors and three “mutually reinforcing levers,” the paper outlines how UNDP can support countries to: examine why people are left behind; empower those people; and enact change through policies, reforms and other interventions. Given the urgency of SDG achievement and leaving no one behind, the authors call for acting simultaneously on all three levers of change.

Within these workstreams, UNDP is undertaking assessments to gather evidence and strengthen national capacities, expanding opportunities for civil society, and building local governance systems that reduce inequality and exclusion. The framework is intended to inform both UN Country Teams’ public-facing work and that of national partners, as well as “the manner in which UNDP designs, implements, monitors and evaluates” projects.

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner previewed some of the framework’s learnings during a side event at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including the notion that “averages hide a lot of very brutal truth.” Convened by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the event reviewed 86 countries’ readiness to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda. Steiner also underscored that “we are not starting from zero,” as the development community has years of understanding on the issue, which has informed related UNDP initiatives such as the agency’s Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) work, which supports partner countries in their efforts to implement the SDGs.

The HLPF also featured a set of eight Voluntary National Review (VNR) Labs convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), with Lab 2 focusing on leaving no one behind. Feeding into the Labs, the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) released publications related to the concept of leave no one behind.

The report responds to the main theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies – and reviews Taiwan’s implementation of the six SDGs reviewed by the HLPF in 2018.



Taiwan launched a Voluntary National Review on the SDGs on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, US, in September 2017. During the launch, EPA Minister Lee Ying-yuan said Taiwan will promote sustainable development, implement the SDGs in a timely manner, and share the results of global partnership with the international community. He also urged other countries to work with Taiwan in pursuit of sustainable development for the world and all humankind.

The 2018 Report on SDG Implementation addresses issues and concerns raised by the participants of seven public fora held in Taiwan by the National Council for Sustainable Development in 2017 and 2018, focusing on six issues identified as priorities: smart water resources management; sustainable energy transformation; clean air; sustainable materials management and the circular economy; ecological conservation and green networks; and international partnerships for the SDGs. The report’s analysis sets out Taiwan’s vision for these issues, exploring their current status and describing measures to be taken.

In addition, the report indicates that the National Council for Sustainable Development, which is chaired by the Premier, is formulating Taiwan’s own sustainable development goals, with the SDGs as its reference. To implement Taiwan’s SDGs, the report says the government will work with other countries to realize the official SDGs and will set down more ambitious targets for Taiwan’s sustainable development than those enshrined in the SDGs.

Taiwan’s SDGs comprise 18 goals, 143 targets, and 342 indicators. The 18 goals are:

Strengthen social care services and economic security for the disadvantaged

End hunger, ensure food safety, and promote sustainable agriculture

Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages

Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Ensure environmental quality and sustainable management of environmental resources

Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

Build an affordable, safe, environmentally friendly, resilient, and sustainable transportation structure

Reduce inequality within Taiwan, and between Taiwan and other countries

Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Improve adaptive actions to combat climate change and its impacts

Conserve and sustainably use the marine ecosystems, and prevent the degradation of marine environment

Conserve and sustainably use terrestrial ecosystems to ensure the persistence of biodiversity and prevent land degradation

Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable inclusive institutions

Establish diversified partnerships and work together to advance a sustainable vision

Build a nuclear-free homeland by 2025

During an interview on 18 September 2018, Chan highlighted Taiwan’s achievements against these goals, including the reduction of both household and industrial waste by 80% and biodiversity conservation, with eight of Taiwan’s species previously on the endangered list no longer endangered. He also noted Taiwan’s Electricity Act that states that, by 2025, nuclear power generation equipment should be completely shut down and the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix should reach 20%.

135,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/kofi-annan-and-the-transition-to-sustainable-development-goals/,"Thu, 06 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Kofi Annan and the Transition to Sustainable Development Goals,"As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006. His achievements helped set the stage for the set of 17 universal sustainable development goals and 169 targets we have today. This brief looks at the SDG era that Annan helped usher in vis-à-vis his efforts to set and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as his vision for exceeding their ambition.

A proponent of people pushing their governments to act, Annan established the UN Millennium Campaign with an aim “to mobilize the world around the MDGs” and “rally all people” to make poverty history. Having founded the precursor to the SDG Action Campaign and collective efforts such as the upcoming Global Goals Week, Annan’s memory and work continue to live on.

A “committed internationalist,” Annan’s self-described greatest achievement was the MDGs, the first set of global targets to improve human development and ensure social well-being. Although the Millennium Declaration was signed by all 189 UN Member States in 2000, Annan convened a group of experts to ensure the Declaration led to action, tasking them with crafting what became the eight MDGs. The effort received criticism for being non-inclusive and yet another attempt by developed countries to decide “what was best for the rest of the world.” It reflects the opinion that Annan’s leadership style was “all general and no secretary.” But the MDGs offered a focus for development efforts and provided proof of concept that, when financial institutions, government aid agencies and other donors use a single framework to channel their efforts and guide action on shared objectives, targeted progress can be achieved.

Skeptics and globalists alike have questioned whether accelerating global progress on goal areas such as poverty reduction, health and education can be attributed to the MDGs. For example, China’s rapid economic growth is often credited with helping the world achieve the first MDG target on halving extreme poverty, but China is said to have paid “no attention” to the framework. Conversely, Africa’s increased growth rates, although uneven within and between countries, is often attributed to donor efforts and other MDG-aligned investments. Regardless of shortcomings on the goal-setting process, the Secretary-General’s personal style, or difficulties attributing improved well-being to the MDGs, Annan’s work helped set a guiding vision that articulated a world for which society should strive.

Always Forward-thinking

Drafted in 2000, the MDGs as we know them today effectively came into prominence during the 2002 UN International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD), called for by Kofi Annan and held in Monterrey, Mexico. In part due to Annan’s collaborating with an “unusually wide” set of actors, the summit resulted in the setting of a target whereby developed countries would contribute 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries. At the summit, Annan highlighted an increasing interdependence between rich and poor, stating, “we live in one world, not two… no one in this world can be comfortable or safe while so many are suffering and deprived.”

But Annan was not merely satisfied with commitments to increase aid. Prior to the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland he emphasized that “responsibility flows both ways” and “rich and poor alike must do their part.” This thinking has helped to shift discussions towards overcoming the North-South divide, and towards bringing high-income countries into the development agenda as more than just providers of finance. This convergence of countries working together towards a “shared destiny” is a key pillar of the 2030 Agenda adopted in 2015.

Ever forward-looking, a 2002 address by Annan framed sustainable development not as a burden or lifestyle reduction for developed nations, but as an opportunity that could “build markets and create jobs” – an opportunity that was quantified nearly 15 years later at more than US$12 trillion. Annan’s understanding of this opportunity, and that it would require collaborative efforts by diverse actors, is reflected in his 1999 proposal for and the subsequent launch of the UN Global Compact.

Looking Back to Look Ahead

Comprehending the scope and complexity of the SDGs can be aided by taking a look into the past. Returning to China’s experiences, development experts know which sectors in China grew fastest, who in the country benefitted, and what the consequences for the planet have been. We understand the gaps left by the MDGs and remaining challenges, such as on integrating environmental targets, ensuring action by all, and including good governance. We recognize that these issues, similar to economic growth and other standalone SDGs, can serve as launchpads for the others, and that progress in some areas may be pursued in ways that negate gains elsewhere.

Like the MDGs, the SDGs do not have an implementation guide, a project budget or an organizational chart that maps out responsibilities. The framework does, however, provide a common language for actors from every sector of society and region of the world to come together on shared challenges. In 2013, Brookings’ John McArthur penned an article on what the MDGs had accomplished, noting that previously, “there was no common framework for promoting global development.” The need to fill such a gap also speaks to the impetus behind the SDGs. At the turn of the millennium, rich countries were looking inward amidst a civil society backlash against globalization, with major multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund facing protests in the streets.

Society’s Next Steps and Annan’s Mark on the Transition to SDGs

A Financial Times article acknowledges that Annan’s “trademark optimism does sometimes seem misplaced in our turbulent times.” However, such optimism, as on display in his 2010 Der Spiegel Q&A, is a prerequisite to tackling the ambitious sustainable development agenda toward which global society has agreed to strive. Even if laggards remain, Annan noted in March 2017 that “the rest of the world will continue.” As demonstrated by the global response to the US announcing its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, Kofi was right.

Annan also noted in Der Spiegel that building on lessons from the MDG era requires addressing root causes of key problems such as poverty, energy supply and climate change. With the SDGs’ ambition to “get to zero” on poverty and hunger, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the AAAA, the 2015 agreements represent a “triumph for multilateralism” that still guides Member State actions, even if some are retreating. Complemented by initiatives such as Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), which launched in 2011 and fed into the 2015 agreements, processes that Annan helped convene will continue to support the tackling of root causes. It is these root causes—ranging from gender and socioeconomic inequality to economic instability or marginalization to policy incoherence and siloed decision-making—that threaten the achievement of shared societal objectives.

Annan highlights a key lesson of the MDG era in the foreword of a 2015 paper: that the world’s challenges “cannot be achieved in isolation.” At a side event during the 2015 UN Summit to adopt the SDGs, Carlos Lopes described the need to move away from a “cappuccino approach” to development in which economic growth serves as the espresso base. Indeed, moving from MDGs to universal SDGs requires an integrated approach by all countries that cuts across economic, social and environmental pillars.

It is well-known that the SDGs demand action across the whole-of-society, supported by a wide range of means of implementation, including trade, technology transfer, data, capacity building and finance. Highlighting the importance of data to ending malnutrition in Africa, Annan continued to foster and promote the development of new tools that facilitate integrated SDG implementation and shift development paradigms. Similarly, on finance, mobilizing the private sector and “shifting the trillions” requires actors to be aligned with the spirit and principles of the 2030 Agenda. The UN Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI), launched in 2006 with Annan’s backing, offer a ready-made system to align institutional investors with the SDGs.

As one article reflected after Annan’s passing in August, if you care about the SDGs, then Kofi Annan “has played an important role in your work.” As members of the global community convene in New York for the 73rd UN General Assembly and largest-ever Global Goals Week, Annan’s legacy will be present in the ideals, spirit and foundational tools that are driving us towards the world we need.","As many tributes have noted, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan leaves behind a legacy of quiet, behind the scenes diplomacy from his tenure from 1997-2006.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will convene the meeting on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 73rd general debate.

The synopsis document outlines the Strategy’s background, objectives and way forward. According to the synopsis, the Strategy focuses on leveraging the convening power of the UN to bring together the relevant actors to accelerate mobilization of finance for the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy is built on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and on the Paris Agreement on climate change. It also draws on the work of the UN’s Inter-Agency Task Force on FFD, as well as ongoing work on financing within the UN and with its key partners.

The Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021.

The Strategy aims to accelerate progress in key areas where the leadership of the Secretary-General can galvanize action from the global to the local arena. Guterres sets out the key elements of the role that the UN can play in supporting the mobilization of finance for sustainable development, as well as actions that the UN will take to help accelerate and deepen the transformation of financial systems to provide development finance efficiently. The three key areas – or objectives – are:

Aligning global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda;

Enhancing sustainable financing strategies and investments at the regional and country levels; and

Exploiting the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

As for the way forward, the Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021, building on current and future activities of key stakeholders, to mobilize investments and support for funding the 2030 Agenda. The UN Deputy Secretary-General will lead its implementation.

The high-level meeting on 24 September 2018 will serve to: launch the Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda; take stock of and accelerate eﬀorts by diﬀerent stakeholders to operationalize the AAAA; and build momentum around key actions and initiatives by national governments, business and the international community that have high potential to accelerate implementation of the AAAA and the 2030 Agenda, and call on actors to report back on progress at the 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. Following the meeting, a Secretary-General’s summary will highlight key action points, as a guide to follow-up discussions on sustainable financing at relevant fora over the next three years.

The UN system heads’ conclusions are reflected in a report of the UN Secretary-General to the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

In 2017, the JIU issued a report titled, ‘The United Nations System: Private Sector Partnerships Arrangements in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ (JIU/REP/2017/8), authored by Petru Dumitriu, Inspector. According to the author, the need for this review came from: a “new wave of creating silos”; a need to shift from “ad hoc, short-term partnerships, focused primarily on resource mobilization” to longer-term, strategic and more stable forms of collaboration with the private sector; and the private sector’s need for information on engaging with the SDGs. The inspector adds that “these educational efforts are a major responsibility of the United Nations system as the orchestrator and facilitator of partnerships at regional, national and global levels.”

The 43-page document outlines the “normative basis” for private sector partnerships, including legal forms and operational frameworks, and discusses operational and administrative aspects of partnerships. The report builds on previous reports on protecting the image, reputation and values of the UN, including through safeguards for due diligence and risk management, and focuses on making the UN system “more effective in its cooperation with the private sector to support the 2030 Agenda” and fostering sustainability in the private sector’s business models. The report notes a shift in the approach to due diligence from “do not harm” to “do good.”

A chart outlines 12 recommended actions to be taken by various parts of the UN, its funds and programmes, and specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The recommendations address, inter alia: revising the current guidelines on cooperation between the UN and the business sector; proposing a set of rules and guidelines for partnerships with the private sector, to allow for greater flexibility, simplification of procedures and speed in reaction; reviewing the mandate of the UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) with regard to responsibilities for providing advice and facilitating partnerships in support of the SDGs; enhancing the role of the Private Sector Focal Points Network; creating a common database for vetting businesses; revising the mandate of the UN Global Compact to clarify its role in engaging business to support the 2030 Agenda and enhance UN Member States’ role in governance of the Global Compact; enhancing ownership and partnership at the regional and country levels; and support engagement by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The report notes a shift in the approach to due diligence from “do not harm” to “do good.”

High-level UN officials met in the context of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) to discuss the JIU report on private sector partnerships, and their views are captured in a report to the UNGA from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The CEB organizations welcome the report and “generally support its findings and recommendations.” They also:

note that their specific needs and objectives vary in terms of private sector engagement, inviting the JIU to be specific in formulating its recommendations;

support the idea of updating frameworks for collaboration and shifting towards stimulating partnerships, rather than focusing on protection from risk;

note capacity needs at regional and country levels;

suggest clarifying the definitions of “business sector” (for-profit) and “private sector” (including not-for-profit foundations); and

note the establishment of a dedicated Results Group for Strategic Partnerships, within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Group. The Results Group’s members include the Global Compact Office and UNOP. The Results Group is tasked with: developing a UN-coordinated approach to strategic partnerships with the private sector, aligning tools and due diligence processes, and supporting countries and regions in their development of collaborations with the private sector; and simplifying processes to facilitate an increase in partnerships and effective communication between the UN and the private sector.

The CEB organizations also offer specific comments on each of the 12 recommendations. The report is expected to be considered by the UNGA during its 73rd session.

In another report to the UNGA, the Secretary-General discusses UNOP, which provides partnership advisory and outreach services in response to demand from the UN system, governments and non-State actors. The report indicates that in 2017, numerous companies, foundations and civil society organizations approached UNOP to seek advice and explore paths of engagement with the UN, with most enquiries related to mapping specific collaborative opportunities and identifying relevant partners within the UN system towards the advancement of the SDGs.

In December 2017, Guterres announced that UNOP will be “firmly established as the Organization’s global gateway for partnerships” (A/72/684-E/2018/7). In 2018, the Executive Office of the Secretary-General initiated a review of the operations of UNOP to inform a “reinvigorated platform for more effective partner engagement of public and private sector stakeholders.” [JIU report: United Nations System: Private Sector Partnership Arrangements in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/73/186)] [CEB Report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on UNEP report]","30 August 2018: The heads of UN system entities discussed the UN’s approach to private sector partnerships for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in response to a report from the UN’s Joint Inspection Unit (JIU).

Since world leaders signed onto the 17 Global Goals in September 2015, the UN system has been trying to align itself with the new Agenda. This policy brief provides a snapshot of recent developments in the parallel but inter-related reform processes underway within the UN system.



Development System Repositioning

Following on a mandate developed through a series of consultations for what is known as the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR), and resulting proposals from the UN Secretary-General, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted a resolution (72/279) aimed at aligning UN development system with the 2030 Agenda through a “repositioning” process.

By the resolution adopted on 31 May 2018, the UNGA sets out decisions, requests and calls related to:

a “new generation” of UN country teams;

“reinvigorating” the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC) system;

revamping the regional approach;

strategic direction, oversight and accountability for system-wide results;

funding the UN development system; and

following up on the repositioning efforts at the global, regional and country levels.

In addition, the UNGA “looks forward to the update by the Secretary-General” on efforts to align the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) with the 2030 Agenda.

On 14 June, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres informed Member States that he was setting up a “lean” transition team that would work for 18 to 24 months, relying heavily on inputs from UN development system entities, including through dedicated working groups and overall steering by the UN Sustainable Development Group. Elaborating on these plans, Guterres announced on 26 June that the transition team will: operate under a “broader reform coordination structure” to ensure coherence with ongoing reforms in the area of UN management and peace and security; work under the oversight of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed; and be headed by Robert Piper, who was leading the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Bureau of External Relations (BERA). On 31 July, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Adviser on Reforms to lead the broader coordination structure, Jens Wandel, currently UNDP Assistant Administrator.

On reinvigorating the RC system, Mohammed presented the preliminary outline of a 24-month implementation plan and launched a series of informal discussions with Member States in July 2018.

According to an update from the UN Secretariat in late August, Guterres’ plan will be issued in mid-September 2018. It is expected to:

specify the transition of staff and operational support;

clarify UNDP’s new role in the UN Country Teams (UNCTs) on a fee-for-service basis;

elaborate on the regional architecture and multi-country offices (MCOs), as well as on new models of physical presence; and

identify risks and contingency measures.

On funding the UN development system, Guterres is expected to soon launch a Funding Dialogue to operationalize the Funding Compact, as mandated in resolution 72/279.

On DESA reform, DESA was expected to report to the UN Secretary-General in the first quarter of 2018 on the outcome of its internal review, after which he intended to update Member States. Information on this process is still to be made public.

However, on 21 June, DESA announced the appointment of members of the UN High-Level Advisory Board (HLAB) on Economic and Social Affairs, which was established following a request from the UN Secretary-General as part of reforms to the UN development system. DESA explained that the HLAB’s establishment is part of efforts to enhance the UN’s support to Member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. The Board will aim to help DESA in its work to strengthen the UN’s “thought leadership on sustainable development” as outlined in the December 2017 report containing the Secretary-General’s proposals for UN development system reform.

The 16 members of the HLAB include former heads of state (Mexico, Chile), former ministers (Cabo Verde, Brazil), an expert in public health, and experts in economics. The members are appointed for a two-year term. The Board held its first meeting from 9-10 July 2018.

Peacebuilding Reforms

A second major track of reforms addresses the UN’s peace and security architecture. The Secretary-General proposed creating a Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a Department of Peace Operations in his 2017 report on ‘Restructuring of the United Nations peace and security pillar’ (A/72/525), and this was then taken up by the UNGA’s Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).

On 5 July 2018, at the conclusion of the Committee’s resumed session, governments endorsed the establishment of these two bodies (UNGA resolution https://undocs.org/A/RES/72/262c).

Management Reform

Also via Fifth Committee negotiations concluding in July, the UNGA approved the reorganization of the current Department of Management and Department of Field Support into a new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and Department of Operational Support, as envisioned by Guterres in his management reform proposals. Management reforms comprise the third major reform track launched by the Secretary-General.

According to the Secretariat in presenting its report on this topic, the new management paradigm will increase the delegation of authority, accompanied by a simplification and streamlining of the rules, policies and procedures, and by the development and dissemination of administrative guidance along with training, support, monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

Aligning UN Bodies with 2030 Agenda

On the intergovernmental side, discussions are underway on aligning UN intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda. This process began in 2015 and proceeded gradually, with efforts including a “mapping assessment” for reducing overlap between the UNGA agenda, the agenda of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the 2030 Agenda, and enhancing their synergy and coherence (UNGA 70), and a report containing recommendations for doing so (UNGA 71).

Most recently, intergovernmental consultations took place in the context of UNGA resolution 71/323 on ‘Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly’ of September 2017, in which the Assembly requests the President of UNGA 72 to identify proposals aimed at addressing gaps and duplication in the agenda of the UNGA as they relate to the 2030 Agenda. On 6 June 2018, the co-facilitators appointed by UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Belgium) proposed continuing the consultation process in the UNGA’s 73rd session. They underscored that the process should ensure that intergovernmental bodies adequately cover the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Goals and targets.

ECOSOC Strengthening

ECOSOC, for its part, has undergone multiple waves of reform in the past several years. A “strengthening” process in 2006 resulted in UNGA resolution 61/16, and in 2013, Member States agreed to an additional round of reforms (resolution 68/1). These were up for review, in turn, during the UNGA’s 72nd session (2017-2018).

On 23 July 2018, through a consultation process led by Iceland and Qatar, the UNGA adopted a resolution setting out a restructuring of ECOSOC’s segments and forums. On themes, the resolution mandates the UNGA to adopt one main theme for each year’s session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. For the segments and subsidiary bodies, the themes should focus on a particular aspect of the main theme.

Further on the HLPF, the resolution calls for improvements to the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) on SDG implementation. The ECOSOC Bureau will consider ways of optimizing the time for countries to present their VNRs, in order to improve the exchange of experiences.

Following the HLPF’s ministerial segment, the final day of the ECOSOC High-level Segment will focus on future trends and scenarios related to the ECOSOC main theme, and the long-term impact of current trends on the realization of the SDGs. The outcome of the HLPF and the high-level segment will continue to be a negotiated ministerial declaration.

This text provides the basis for the coming year. After that, ECOSOC arrangements will be reviewed in tandem with periodic reviews of the HLPF.

Coming up Next

Numerous reforms are underway at once, which can overwhelm calendars and attract criticism of “process proliferation.” A few concrete next steps to look out for include:

The Secretary-General to issue a plan for realizing the reinvigorated RC system by mid-September 2018;

The Secretary-General to launch the Funding Dialogue on a Funding Compact for the “repositioned” UN development system;

The Secretary-General to inform the UNGA, in the context of changes to the peace and security pillar, regarding the creation of the Standing Principals’ Group and four stand-alone divisions for Africa, during the main part of the 73rd session; and

The ECOSOC calendar to reflect changes during its 2018-2019 session, including that the July 2019 session of the HLPF is expected to: Feature improved VNR sessions; and Be preceded immediately by the Integration Segment in order to consolidate a range of inputs on promoting “the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development” and bring together key messages on the main theme, along with action-oriented recommendations to feed into the HLPF.

Children are most at risk in their first year, with the highest risk being among newborns in their first month of life. Based on current trends, the authors anticipate that about half the countries in the world will not achieve SDG targets on child mortality by 2030, but only after 2050.



The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Population Division of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the World Bank collaborated on the child mortality report, which shows uneven progress, although child survival has improved among all age groups since the year 2000. Children in the poorest households are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from the richest. Rural children are more at risk than urban children, and the children of mothers without any education are 2.6 times more likely to die before reaching the age of five, compared to the children of mothers with high school or tertiary-level education.

Environmental factors also influence child mortality. For example, exposure to air pollution is a factor in higher mortality levels among children under the age of one, the Group reports.

The agencies note that child mortality has declined in recent years, especially in children between one and four years old, where it declined by 60% between the years 2000 and 2017. Deaths of children under one year declined by 51% during the same period, while the rate for children aged 5-14 declined by 37%. However, in many places improvements are insufficient for meeting the 2030 deadline.

The report contains charts detailing progress by region and subregion, and calls for concerted efforts, investments and innovative approaches to accelerate progress, particularly in countries and communities that are falling behind.

Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

145,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-surveys-e-government-practices-worldwide-for-sdg-achievement/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Surveys E-Government Practices Worldwide for SDG Achievement,"19 July 2018: The tenth edition of the UN E-Government Survey, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), concludes that while e-government began with bringing services online, the future will be about the power of digital government to leverage societal innovation and resilience, and to transform governance to better achieve the SDGs.



The survey is the “only global report” that assesses e-government development status of all UN Member States, according to the authors. It measures e-government effectiveness in the delivery of public services, and aims to enable countries to learn from each other, identify areas of strength and challenges in e-government and shape their policies and strategies in this area.

The 2018 edition of the survey titled, ‘Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies,’ seeks to provide analysis and evidence to “further utilize the potential of e-government” to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The survey examines: the preconditions and the enabling environment for mobilizing e-government to build resilient societies; e-resilience and building the resilience of e-government; global trends in e-government; regional development and country groupings performance; improving cities resilience and sustainability through e-government assessment; and fast-evolving technologies in e-government.

Among its conclusions, the survey notes that since 2014, all 193 UN Member States have been delivering some form of online presence. According to the 2018 E-Government Development Index (EGDI) − a composite index which assesses e-government development at the national level, including the provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human capacity − Denmark, Australia and the Republic of Korea lead the world in providing government services and information through the internet, followed by the UK, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France and Japan. The survey also presents the findings of a pilot study on applying e-governance to local governments in 40 municipalities around the world. It lists as the top cities: Moscow, Russian Federation; Cape Town, South Africa; Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rome, Italy; and Warsaw, Poland. The EGDI is presented bi-annually by DESA.

Per the survey, since 2012, there is a “steady increase” in the number of country websites with information about specific programmes benefiting women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous people, and people living in poverty. The report indicates that a growing number of countries provides targeted online services to vulnerable groups: 86% in the Americas; 79% in Asia; 57% in Africa; and 15% in Oceania. However, despite some development gains and major investments in several countries, e-government and digital divides persist, it says. For instance, 14 countries in the Low EGDI group are African and belong to the least developed countries (LDCs). The survey also finds that insufficient training and accessibility and “e-illiteracy” are the most common barriers to e-government resilience.

The publication stresses that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as an enabler of all phases of disaster risk management, from prevention, reduction, and preparedness to respond and recover, and emphasizes the need to protect critical ICT infrastructure from disaster impacts. In addition, it states that inter-regional and global data sharing and coordination among concerned countries and regions are crucial, considering that some disasters such as floods, cyclones and typhoons, and droughts are transboundary in nature.

The survey was produced by the DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) in collaboration with UN regional commissions, UN agencies, and several international experts, researchers and related organizations. The E-Government Survey was first issued in 2001, and further editions were released in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

The aquadrone aims to stop plastic pollution at the source, eliminating floating debris before it drifts into the world’s oceans.

Preventing and reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, is the aim of SDG target 14.1. SDG 14 (life below water) focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

The aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

RanMarine Technology modeled the WasteShark after the whale shark, a filter feeder that consumes plankton and small crustaceans by sucking them through its long, flat mouth. The WasteShark has “an enormous mouth” that is designed to skim the water and track down trash, operating based on the same principles as the whale shark. The aquadron is best suited to collect trash in areas known as “waste chokeholds” such as canals, harbors, ponds and rivers.

The WasteShark can swim for up to 16 hours and collect up to 200 liters of trash in one trip. It is capable of sending information back to a central command, including data on pH levels, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and other water quality parameters. The aquadron is steered through a plotted iPad map or manually, using a remote control. According to RanMarine Technology, the aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

The awards event took place at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, with the ceremony hosted by Loyiso Madinga, a South African comedian from The Daily Show. Madinga and other speakers emphasized the uniquely important role of young people in solving problems and bringing people together, and of reaching across generations.

Johar’s poem was featured in a film, ‘We the Goalkeepers,’ screened at the start of the awards night. The poem concludes, “Because when you’re too tired of waiting on others/ to save the day/ You stand tall, and show that saving the world/ is child’s play.”

Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Progress Award to Dysmus Kusilu, founder of Solar Freeze. Kusilu said that growing up in Kenya, he was taught that to work in agriculture is to be a failure. Gaining inspiration from his “sweet grandmother and her sacrifices,” he decided to turn failure into success by inventing a pay-as-you-go service using mobile phones to help smallholder farmers store their produce more efficiently and increase their yields.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the audience of the UN’s launch of two youth initiatives earlier in the day: the Youth 2030 strategy and Generation Unlimited. She said the initiatives will put youth at the forefront of the UN’s work “in a more earnest way” than ever before. Among the areas of leadership shown by young people recently, she said the march towards gender equality and ending sexual harassment is “one of the loudest cries I’ve heard.”

Mohammed presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Changemaker Award to Nadia Murad, an advocate for the Yazidi community and genocide survivors. Murad said that following the 2014 attacks by ISIS to “ethnically cleanse” Iraq of Yazidis – during which Murad was abducted and enslaved – the majority of Yazidi people remain in IDP camps “in the same tents given to them in 2014.” Having lost her six brothers in the genocide and seen countless fellow Yazidi girls and women kidnapped, bought and sold, and disappeared, Murad said her survival “came with purpose, responsibility and hope.” However, hope “has an expiration date; it requires action to survive.” She said working together is the only way to heal after a genocidal campaign.

Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said the Generation Unlimited initiative aims to ensure that by 2030 every young person is in school or age-appropriate training. She presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Campaign Award to Amika George, a student who founded the #FreePeriods campaign and has built support for the idea of period poverty.

When George accepted the award, she told the audience that girls around the world her age and younger miss up to 20% of their school curriculum each year because they cannot afford menstrual products, and she campaigns to provide the products for free. She urged, “enough with the shame” and euphemisms that belittle menstruation, and cause social isolation and educational lags for girls in poverty.

Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, noted that the average age of the leaders, innovators and activists featured during the ceremony was 24 years old. He welcomed Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, praising her dedication to action for SDG 4 (quality education). Solberg spoke in her capacity as the co-chair of the UN Advocates for the SDGs to stress that “we need business with us” to reach the Goals.

The evening event also featured performances by Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter from the UK who performed against a backdrop of footage of himself and other Goalkeepers as babies and children, and Fatoumata Diawara, a singer-songwriter from Mali who was joined by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.

149,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/convention-on-biological-diversity-overcoming-research-impediments/,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Convention on Biological Diversity: Overcoming Research Impediments,"Success of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) depends on our understanding of biodiversity. Hence, CBD and the subsequent Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (NP) urge signatory nations to promote and encourage research on biodiversity. However, imposition of sovereign rights of nations on their biological resources and the emphasis on the CBD third objective of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources (GR) through access and benefit-sharing (ABS) are coming in the way of achieving the primary objectives of the CBD relating to conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use.

In the meantime, examples of financially significant ABS agreements are scarce even after a quarter century of existence of the CBD. A survey of megadiverse countries having functional ABS legislation showed that very few commercial ABS agreements (2.05 per year per country) have been concluded, suggesting a lack of demand for GR by potential users. Instead, the regulations to harness perceived benefits by individual countries have made much needed biodiversity exploration and research difficult and in some cases even impossible. The global research community has been complaining about the challenges they face in accessing and exchanging biological material for research as well as international collaborations that are crucial for the global food security and conservation of biodiversity.

No Substitute for Sharing of Biological Resources

Biological resources being truly renewable, their use promotes further improvement and ex situ conservation as in the case of crop plants. Use of any biological resource in a given area does not limit its use elsewhere. However, throughout the negotiations in the run up to the CBD and NP, biological resources were treated akin to non-renewable resources such as oil and coal.

The principles underlying the CBD and NP are laudable, and both underscore that access to GR should also address the issues of equity. However, with the third CBD objective of ABS making a slip, it is becoming evident that the CBD and NP may not be able to address the issues of equity raised by developing countries at the Earth Summit in 1992, which ultimately culminated in nationalization of genetic resources. As governments began to enact national legislation to regulate access to biological resources within their borders for benefit-sharing from the derived products, consequences of such actions on biodiversity research and food security are being overlooked. The principal victim of these legislative actions is biodiversity research that includes inventories and international collaborations as its core. Such restrictions, apart from curtailing research and development, run counter to the objectives of the CBD. Enormous amounts of biological data, including Digital Sequence Information (DSI), are increasingly being published via the database portals of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). The unlimited and open access DSI encourages collaboration among researchers besides enabling conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. As access to DSI is coming to the center stage of negotiations in the forthcoming 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, the global research community is increasingly concerned about the free flow of information, which is essential for the advancement of science.

New Treaty for Non-profit Research and Development

Not-for-profit research, such as inventories and taxonomic studies, intended for the public domain, should be differentiated from commercial research leading to proprietary rights. On the one hand, access has to be open when the benefits are in the public domain, and the providers of the biological resource are free to make use of the benefits just as anybody else. On the other hand, if the benefits are confined to the private realm through intellectual property rights, the provider may secure a share bilaterally.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), popularly known as the “Seed Treaty,” provides a promising model for international collaboration on biodiversity research. The treaty ensures worldwide public accessibility to GR of essential food and fodder crops. While the CBD and NP necessitate access to GR on a bilateral basis through case-by-case negotiations, the Seed Treaty adopts a multilateral system for ABS (MLS) through a Standard Material Transfer Agreement, averting the need for bilateral negotiations. The MLS established under the Seed Treaty has been viewed as a very successful model in terms of volume of material exchanged (8,500 transfers every week) in contrast to the very limited performance of the bilateral system of the CBD and NP. Exchange of genetic material under the Seed Treaty is exempted from the NP requirements, and the benefit sharing requirement arises only when access for further research and breeding is restricted through intellectual property rights. One possible course of action for the CBD COP might be to add a legally binding treaty to promote and facilitate biodiversity research, conservation and international collaboration. Such a treaty could address legal uncertainties in the governance of global research commons such as microbial culture collections held by the World Federation of Culture Collections as well as DSI published through the portals of INSDC or taxonomic type materials held in various museums all over the world.

Intrinsically, GR is a public resource – truly renewable, non-rivalrous and non-exclusive – much similar to the knowledge resources. Its dissemination across national boundaries further enriches their diversity, value and conservation. For example, cultivation of a crop variety in a region does not limit its use elsewhere. Thus, it is imperative that GR are retained as common heritage. Man, as a biological species, depends more or less on the same GR for survival, irrespective of the national boundaries. Open access to GR addresses the issues of equity by ensuring access to biological resources for all. This advocates the universal freedom to study, distribute, modify and utilize GR by any one and for any purpose. As in the case of open source software licenses, many forms of free and open access licenses can be conceived for GR too. The open access model offers people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of GR with stipulation that the same rights should be preserved in derivative works in the future.

Biodiversity forms the basis of global food and livelihood security, and the nations of the world are linked in a complex web of genetic interdependence that ensures global food security. Countries have gained much more than their individual contributions through the exchange and sharing of a myriad kinds of crops and domestic animals from all over the world. Similarly, international collaboration is inevitable for understanding life on earth, its conservation and sustainable use. The objectives of the CBD are interlinked with the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and three SDGs in particular: SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). It is time that the forthcoming CBD COP take stock of the impacts of parochial restrictions on open access and free exchange of biological resources due to the NP and national ABS regimes, and adopt the necessary course correction to help achieve sustainable development for all.

For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing."" Every day our scientists are working to discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives. And for us goal number three allowed us to have a dialogue and an engagement with the United Nations and with governments globally to ensure that we're partnering with them to provide access to quality healthcare.

When we think about access to medicines we think about a comprehensive strategy that includes both donation and philanthropic support as well as creative commercial strategies designed to drive access to the most vulnerable and underserved populations globally.

So for Pfizer we have a number of initiatives that we're very proud of. One which I like to say is our oldie but goodie was launched in 1998. The International Trachoma Initiative was launched to address a blinding disease called trachoma. At the time it was launched, we had a product that treated active infection that causes this disease. And if the infection goes untreated over time people do go blind. And what we discovered was that our medicine could treat this infection, but our medicine was not sufficient: Alone that medicine would not do the work that needed to be done at a public health level.

For our work to address a blinding disease called trachoma we've used a public health strategy called SAFE. SAFE stands for surgery – S, for advanced cases of the disease. A – the distribution of the antibiotic that Pfizer makes to treat the active infection. F which is face washing and E which is environmental development. Together that comprehensive initiative working now with more than a hundred partners has achieved elimination of this disease in six countries. That's profound. And it's one of our greatest accomplishments as a company. It did not happen overnight. It has taken more than two decades to achieve that progress, but we have our eyes on the prize which is full elimination of this disease by the year 2020.

Another example where Pfizer is working to meet the evolving global health needs is in the area of oncology. We have chemotherapy agents that are very important for patients globally. And we worked with our partners, the American Cancer Society, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and CIPLA to make 11 prioritized chemotherapy agents available in East Africa where there is a disproportionate burden of cancer. We're really proud of that initiative because we're taking some of our very important core essential medicines and making them available to reach more patients in areas of the world that several years ago did not have this need.

So the business case for corporate responsibility has been debated for years and there are different perspectives on this. I think for Pfizer and for the pharmaceutical companies we can't deliver our business unless we deliver for society.Keeping that patient that we serve front and center to how we make the decisions that the company takes every single day.

When we discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives our communities are healthier, society is healthier, and we deliver both for our business and our shareholders, but also for society.","For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing.""

The United Counties of SDG will not be involved in owning the Cornwall Regional Airport.

CAO Tim Simpson told SDG council on Monday it would serve no purpose for the counties to get involved in the airport at this time.

“This has been a challenge for us to look at,” said Simpson.

An ad-hoc committee had been formed to see if it would make sense for the counties to become involved with the airport along with the Township of South Glengarry and the City of Cornwall.

The group came together after the city and township received a report in 2017 recommending SDG become an owner of the airport. The report based its recommendation on the benefits the airport could bring to the entire region if it were owned by the city and SDG. The airport is based just north of Summerstown in South Glengarry.

“Essentially we just came to the conclusion that based on the current configuration of the airport and for reasons we talk about in the report, it would be difficult to become involved at this point,” he said.","Article contentThe United Counties of SDG will not be involved in owning the Cornwall Regional Airport.

This clear correlation between sustainable development and societal stability has long been recognized by scholars and sustainability professionals, yet overlooked by most of the global indicators for sustainable development, such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the United Nations Global Compact.

However, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) attempt to address this issue through SDG 16: “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” SDG 16 is also considered to be a crucial means to other sustainable development achievements.

There are three dimensions to SDG 16: Strong Institutions, Justice and Peace. Each of these dimensions reinforces one another:

The Strong Institution dimension sets out to establish effective, accountable and transparent institutions, which secure fundamental legal human rights.

The Justice dimension tackles issues of corruption and bribery that would threaten such institutions, and ensures equal access to justice.

The Peace dimension then aims to eliminate all forms of violence against vulnerable groups and promote resolution of any arising conflicts through dialogue, negotiation and diplomacy.

At first glance, the role of the private sector in delivering SDG 16 might seem imperceptible. In practice, however, companies can create profound contributions to SDG 16 through their sustainable procurement programs. One of the industries we see most likely to positively contribute to the achievement of SDG 16 is the Financial Services sector. Here’s why.

Unveiling supply chain risks

The Financial Services sector is not one many would immediately imagine having significant environmental or social risks within its supply chain. Yet, with its global presence now firmly established, its supply chain impact is quite considerable. According to the BSR report, ***Supply Chain Sustainability in the Financial Sector***, IT, employment and professional services are the top spend categories for the Financial Services sector. These spend categories can be translated into two main supply chain risks related to SDG 16: conflict and human rights issues, and institution issues.

Institution Issues

According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion cost developing countries US$1.26 trillion annually. In addition to the economic deficit, corruption is also detrimental to institutional robustness, which is necessary to maintain societal stability. When institutional support is eroded, organized crime, market inefficiency and human rights violations spread. Corruption can take the form of bribery, fraud, insider trading or even value manipulation in transactions and loan collateral. Financial Services companies need to build transparency along the supply chain by conducting risk and impact assessments to identify the weak links that may contribute to corruption and impair the rule of law.

Taking action

All in all, delivering SDG 16 through sustainable procurement in the Financial Services sector is not only relevant, it turns out to be crucial as well. So, where can we start?

Prioritizing spend categories and suppliers

To utilize resources in the most efficient way and aim for optimal improvement on their own impacts, companies should recognize which spend categories and/or suppliers pose the greatest and/or most urgent risks in their supply chain towards the achievement of SDG 16, and focus on those first. Financial Services companies can take advantage of preliminary risk assessments of their supply chain and assign risk ratings to each of the spend categories to prioritize necessary efforts.

Integrating into procurement and supplier selection processes

Implementing sustainability criteria into procurement and supplier selection processes is a grounding and essential step towards supply chain transformation. Financial Services companies that aspire to have their supply chain free of conflict, corruption and human rights violations should embed these principles into service contract clauses and requests for proposals (RFPs). For instance, BNP Paribas has demanded its suppliers to commit to a CSR charter since 2012; and in 2014, integrated criteria regarding child labor into its call for tenders for promotional items. Moreover, the results of CSR assessment of suppliers have been given considerable weight in supplier selection. An additional step forward could take the form of integrating suppliers’ social responsibility performance into the company buyers’ appraisal. This would create more incentives for buyers to look beyond the traditional time and money factors when considering a supplier and help suppliers advance on their corporate social responsibility performances (learn more in this briefing on the intertwining of corruption and human rights, and its rising importance on the corporate risk agenda).

Looking beyond tier-one suppliers

To establish supply chain transparency, Financial Services companies have to be willing to go to great lengths to map their supply chains beyond first-tier suppliers. Putting sustainable procurement programs into practice throughout the supply chain with second and third-tier suppliers can foster accountability in key players involved in the process and create truly impactful momentum to eliminate human rights violations, conflicts and corruption.

Total System Services, with its commitment to ethical sourcing of components and materials that might contain conflict minerals originated in the DRC, has conducted reasonable country-of-origin inquiry (RCOI) supply chain due diligence since 2016. The RCOI process aims to determine critical information such as presence and origin of conflict minerals contained in the products from its suppliers, and in turn achieve transparency in the product supply chain and engage further with suppliers on conflict mineral issues.

Know your customer: Responsible finance expands to business lending and beyond

Besides investing effort in sustainable procurement, positive impact can be made through what Financial Services companies deal with on a daily basis: provision of financial services/products. It is crucial that Financial Services companies understand the potential negative impact their services/products can have, and that a great part of the responsibility to minimize that impact rests on their shoulders.

Financial Services companies can conduct due diligence on potential customers to guarantee that the money flow is not used to undermine fundamental human rights or institutional robustness, and on investment projects to determine the scale of human rights impacts. A report released by Singapore-based Asian Venture Philanthropy Network found that less than 1 percent of funds in Asia leverage ESG investing. According to research from MSCI, companies in the bottom ESG quintile have been twice as likely to suffer a catastrophic loss (over 95 percent cumulative loss) within three years.

The ING Sustainability Improvement Loan, launched in May, aims to reward sustainability performance through the use of sustainability ratings. This exciting new use of sustainability ratings helps business customers who engage in measuring and improving their sustainability to also benefit from better loan rates.

Achieving SDG 16 through a ripple effect

The private sector, particularly Financial Services, has a critical role to play in the achievement of SDG 16. Sustainable procurement is definitely one, if not the most powerful catalyst to push forward the necessary progress. A well-rounded and effective sustainable procurement program is an indispensable tool that will steer the companies in the right direction. By deliberately integrating the achievement of SDG 16 as a priority of their sustainable procurement program, Financial Services companies can set the example and influence other sectors to follow suit, thereby creating a ripple effect to both sectors towards the realization of this challenging Sustainable Development Goal.

The portal tracks 51 African countries’ progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and displays the data in either an index or a dashboard format.



The index provides an aggregate measure of a country’s progress across all 17 SDGs. Progress towards an indicator is standardized on a scale of 0 (poor progress) and 100 (strong progress), relative to the objective of that indicator. For example, SDG indicator 4.1.1 measures proficiency in school subjects. The closer a country’s students are to achieving proficiency in these subjects, the closer their index ranking is to 100. Each standardized indicator score is then aggregated to determine a single value between 0 (poor) and 100 (strong) to a country.

Only seven countries in Africa have scores over 60 out of 100: Egypt, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Algeria, Mauritius, Tunisia and Morocco.

Of the 51 Africa countries that had substantial data to develop an index score, only seven countries had scores over 60; Egypt (60.70), Ghana (62.45), Cabo Verde (63.36), Algeria (63.95), Mauritius (64.04), Tunisia (65.88) and Morocco, who had the highest score with 66.08. Conversely, 16 countries had scores below 50, with the two lowest scores recorded for Somalia (36.15) and the Central African Republic (35.70).

Aside from displaying data in an index format, users can also view countries’ progress towards each SDG in an interactive dashboard. In the dashboard, users can view countries index scores on an SDG-by-SDG basis, or view a countries’ overall progress towards the SDGs in a trend-based dashboard.

The trend-based dashboard presents countries’ progress by using red, orange, yellow or green arrows to represent decreasing, stagnating, moderately increasing or on track trends, respectively. For countries with no available data on an SDG, white is used. Users can decide to view all 52 countries data, or filter searches based on five geographic areas: North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and or West Africa.

According to the portal, progress towards the SDGs varies widely by country and region. In North Africa, four out of five countries with data are on track to achieving SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and half of the countries in Eastern Africa are on track to achieving SDG 15 (life on land). In Central, Southern and Western Africa, 30 of 35 countries with data are on track to meeting SDG 13 (climate action). Although progress towards the SDGs is being made throughout Africa, no country is on track to meet SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) or 14 (life below water).

The Africa SDG Index and Dashboard is built on the Global SDG Index and Dashboard, which SDSN launched in 2016. The release of the Africa focused platform was accompanied by a publication of the same name, which further details findings and the methods used to develop index rankings.

The guide titled, ‘Migration and the 2030 Agenda: A Guide for Practitioners,’ discusses the interlinkages between migration and the SDGs and suggests a process for integrating migration and the SDGs into legislation, policies, programmes, projects and other initiatives.



The publication was developed with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). It notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development marks the first time that “migration is integrated explicitly into the global development agenda.” Within the 2030 Agenda, the central reference to migration is made in SDG target 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people). Other targets are also related to migration.

The guide highlights the SDGs’ direct references to “migration-related issues,” as well as cross-cutting connections where SDG areas “may affect or be affected by migration.” On the SDG targets that directly reference migration (direct connections), the guide identifies: student mobility (SDG target 4.b); human trafficking and exploitation (targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2); labor migration and employment (targets 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8); migration governance (target 10.7); remittances (target 10.c); and migration data (target 17.18).

The publication identifies cross-cutting connections between migration and the following areas and targets:

Poverty and growth (SDG targets 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 10.1);

Social protection (SDG targets 1.3, 5.4 and 10.4);

Health (SDG targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 5.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7 and 10.c);

Education (SDG targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 10.7 and 10.c);

Gender (SDG targets 5.2; 5.3, 5.4, 5.a and 5.c);

Children (SDG targets 1.2, 4.2, 4.5, 4.a, 5.1, 5.2, 8.7, 10.7, 16.2 and 16.3);

Cities (SDG targets 11.1, 11.3, 11.b and 11.c);

Climate change (SDG targets 1.5, 10.7, 11.5, 13.1 and 13.3);

Citizenship, rule of law and inclusion (SDG targets 10.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.7, 16.9 and 16.b); and

Diaspora and partnerships for development (SDG targets 8.9, 9.2, 12.b, 17.3, 17.5, 17.13, 17.16, 17.17 and 17.18).

The authors note that the implementation of migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda should be integrated with other sustainable development initiatives, and should engage all levels of government and across sectors. It encourages users to adapt the process to fit their unique context, and outlines four steps of implementation, namely: kick-off; prioritization; implementation; and monitoring and reporting. The guide also highlights: tools designed to help organize and inform actors as they work through the implementation process; suggestions for stakeholder participation; and relevant case study examples.

Among the case studies, the publication documents the experience of Armenia, which initiated a process of nationalizing migration-related SDGs. The process involved: examining migration and development issues in the context of the SDGs; prioritizing relevant targets; and developing a set of proxy indicators. It also comprised efforts on data, including an exercise to map migration data, and the improvement of national migration data collection and usage.

Another example discussed in the guide concerns the implementation of an IOM project in Ghana to support the government in mainstreaming migration into national development policies and achieving policy coherence, in line with the SDGs.

In December 2018, governments will gather in Marrakech, Morocco, to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Compact is the first intergovernmentally negotiated agreement prepared under the auspices of the UN aiming to address all dimensions of migration in a comprehensive manner.

Organized by the permanent missions of Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste and the g7+ Secretariat, the event focused on ways for g7+ member countries to exchange with non-members on lessons in building resilience.

Moderated by journalist Prue Clark, panelists outlined how peaceful economies have transitioned in post-conflict environments. Nabeela F. Tunis, Sierra Leone, highlighted the importance of maintaining resolve in sustaining a peace agenda, particularly in the face of adversity. She outlined Sierra Leone’s struggles with the Ebola outbreak and crash in iron ore prices, which left the economy “shattered overnight.” To overcome such challenges, she noted the role of strong institutions and context-specific interventions that can bolster state-led partnerships in line with national development plans.

Milena Pirez, Timor-Leste, emphasized that economic resilience is at the core of achieving sustained peace. Pirez noted that in her country, stability undermined by crisis in 2006 was restored through social inclusion and addressing inequalities, as well as through strengthening institutions. Looking ahead to 2030, Timor-Leste has harmonized its strategic development plan with the SDGs and is taking measures to diversify its economy away from the oil industry. As a least developed country (LDC), Pirez pointed to finance as crucial, noting that proceeds from the country’s petroleum fund are invested in infrastructure and used to attract foreign investment.

Delivering remarks behalf of the UN Secretary-General, Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, cautioned that countries remain fragile even after conflicts are resolved. In these situations, he noted, a balance must be struck between achieving quick gains, restoring the state, and spurring sustainable development. Harris also outlined challenges such as low national budgets, narrow fiscal space, low revenue mobilization capacity and extensive debt, all of which can lead to a “heavily constrained” decision-making space.

Additional constraints to development, noted by Pierre Somse, Central African Republic, include destroyed road networks and poor security, which he lamented make it difficult to provide health services in the country, and contribute to the country featuring among the highest child and maternal mortality rates in the world. Somse cited Gavi as a successful health initiative, noting the broader importance of co-investing.

A significant portion of the world’s inadequate SDG progress lies in fragile states, and resources are not being directed there.

Mi-kyung Lee, Republic of Korea, described the country’s investment strategy as built upon three pillars: people, peace and prosperity. She said the country’s successful development was due to these investments in human and social capital and democracy, backed by a predictable policy framework.

Marie-Claude Bibeau, Canada, described aid’s catalytic role in fostering economic resilience. She cited the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States that was endorsed at the 4th High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, in Busan, Republic of Korea, in 2011. This New Deal, she stressed, provides a framework for donors to sustain peace through job creation and women’s economic empowerment. Bibeau flagged that gender is a key issue in post-conflict nations, where 40% of households are headed by women.

Alex Thier, Overseas Development Institute (ODI), raised a stern alarm from the floor, describing the week as “a wake-up call for the broader community on whether we’re making progress on the SDGs.” He said a significant portion of the world’s inadequate progress lies in fragile states, and resources are not being directed to the areas that need them most. Thier called for a renewed commitment to the New Deal to refresh political momentum, alongside joined-up support and innovative and risk-taking finance.

Floor interventions by Portugal and Sweden flagged that fragility can have spillover effects, and highlighted linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On finance, Sweden also noted challenges around taxation in fragile states.

Guatemala will stop plastics from entering the ocean by installing bio-fences in its rivers to recover plastic debris.

Guatemala’s Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Alfonso Alonzo announced his government’s commitment at the 21st Meeting of the Forum of Ministers of Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), which took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 9-12 October 2018. He said Guatemala is “actively fighting plastic pollution through innovation and community participation” as part of an effort to preserve healthy oceans for future generations.

Guatemala pledged to increase waste collection in its rivers through deploying artisanal bio-fences that are made from recovered plastic debris and installed in rivers across the country to trap and collect plastic waste. The fence nets catch the plastic waste, making it easier for communities to recycle or dispose of it properly. The El Quetzalito community, located near the mouth of Guatemala’s Motagua river, which flows to the Caribbean Sea, was a pioneer in using bio-fences. Through the deployment of bio-fences, community residents have generated additional income through recycling and upcycling.

LAC countries’ bold legislative initiatives and innovative technologies help curb the use of single-use plastics.

Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Panama also have adopted the Guatemalan bio-fences to capture plastic pollution in their rivers before it reaches the region’s oceans and seas. Although the bio-fences are helping the region respond to pollution, countries have also stressed the importance of tackling plastic pollution at the source, by increasing wastewater treatment facilities and reducing individual consumption of plastics through awareness raising and education.

More than 50 countries around the world have signed up to the Clean Seas campaign. Guatemala’s announcement brings the number of countries in the LAC region participating in the campaign to 16. UN Environment Regional Director for LAC, Leo Heileman, praised the region’s countries for promoting “bold legislative initiatives and innovative technologies to curb the use of single-use plastics.”

a high-level discussion on financing climate futures and rethinking infrastructure, which addressed the scaling up of financial flows to low-emission and resilient infrastructure investments and was hosted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the World Bank;

the second One Planet Summit, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action Michael Bloomberg; and

the 2018 Momentum for Change award, which recognizes climate action and is co-organized by the UNFCCC and The Climate Group.

In a statement during the opening ceremony, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa called for increased urgency in combating climate action, leadership and a strong multilateral response. Transmitting the results of the September 2018 Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which outlined the ways in which States, regions, cities, businesses, investors and communities are increasing climate action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, she stressed efforts that empower bottom-up action, in the form of “inclusive multilateralism,” which recognizes the need for “more voices at the table.”

Climate Week NYC is run by The Climate Group in coordination with the UN and the City of New York, US, and takes place alongside the annual meetings of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The graph below, which contrasts media coverage of Climate Change (CC) with that of Biodiversity (BD) over the past 30 years, lays out at a glance one of the central paradoxes of sustainable development. Climate change has captured the public imagination. There can be few people who are not exposed to the daily stream of messages of fear and of hope; most have a settled opinion about the threat that it represents or tactics for addressing it. Yet biodiversity conservation, representing an equal (and, indeed, closely linked) threat to life on the planet, flies mostly well below the radar. Despite the rapidly developing base of knowledge on the threat that loss of biodiversity represents, despite the stream of reports that track the bleak trends, public debate has flat-lined over the past three decades as the situation continues to accelerate towards the abyss.

Graph Source: Legagneux , P., N. Casajus, K. Cazelles, C. Chevallier, M. Chevrinais, L. Guéry, C. Jacquet, M. Jaffré, M. Naud, F. Noisette, P. Ropars, S. Vissault, P. Archambault, J. Bêty, D. Berteaux, and D. Gravel. 2018. Our House Is Burning: Discrepancy in Climate Change vs. Biodiversity Coverage in the Media as Compared to Scientific Literature . Front. Ecol. Evol. https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175

Some factors help to explain this situation. The impacts of climate change are palpable and widespread – the occurrence of ever more frequent extreme climate events, the shrinking of glaciers, the recurring droughts and heat-waves – all provide evidence that climate patterns are changing. Whether or not a single event can be traced to the changing climate, most people are increasingly inclined to believe that the climate is changing and that the impact of this change is beginning to bite. By contrast, most biodiversity loss is invisible, or detectable only to those specifically looking for it. It is well known in ornithological circles that the first appearance of a new species is big news, whereas the disappearance of the last specimen of a species, even if it was once common, will escape notice for a long time. We know that tropical forests are disappearing, that coral reefs are dying, but what we tend to see out our windows is still much like it was when we were children.

Also, if a significant part of the climate challenge can be addressed through technology – cleaner production, energy efficiency, renewables, electric cars, etc. – there is no such obvious fix to ensure maintenance of ecosystem resilience or the continued availability of ecological services. Though the most technologically optimistic will claim that we can create – or recreate – the species we need through genetic engineering, natural systems are so complex and interconnected that it would be foolish to place one’s faith in technology alone.

Sadly, intergovernmental effort to stem biodiversity loss mirrors the above graph when compared with what has been achieved in the climate negotiations. Since the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted in 1992, endless strategies, action plans, roadmaps, goals and targets have been adopted, but action to deliver on what has been promised has consistently fallen short. We are again approaching a watershed – the end of the period in which the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were to be implemented, and a global summit to map out a strategy for the coming ten years and beyond. While many earnestly hope that this will be a new “Paris moment” when the stakeholder communities came together and a global climate agreement was adopted, it increasingly looks as if this could be wishful thinking. None of the signs of what created the magic formula in Paris in December 2015 appear to be present.

On 20 September 2018, in Paris, the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI from its title in French) held a public meeting to consider this dilemma, seeking to identify some of the features that could lead to a serious shift in the political attention towards genuine action for biodiversity conservation. I was invited to present ideas on what it would take to break out of the depressing cycle of hope and disappointment and genuinely begin turning the ship around. My advice was as follows:

Only a genuine and large-scale mobilization of stakeholders will create the conditions under which the more courageous politicians will feel they can take the risk of genuine leadership. The somewhat specialized community backing biodiversity conservation cannot, on its own, generate this mobilization. It is simply too small. The trick is to mobilize a wide range of key stakeholders concerned with the future of nature and natural resources, but not currently connected to conservation action. They are in the technology community, in the finance community, in the social movements, in the universities and in religious groups. They care but so far don’t see how they can connect.

This mobilization must necessarily build around a new narrative for conservation – a narrative that, against the sober background of our present predicament, is up-beat, inspiring, and shows how to connect concern with action. It must build on stories that inspire. The dominant narrative is too dismal – focused on the Sixth Great Extinction, on what we are losing, on how close we are to the precipice. It transmits an aura of hopelessness and drives potential conservation practitioners to denial as much as it does to action. Fear is an engine for mobilization up to a point, but not when every way forward appears to be a dead end.

The overall focus of conservation cannot be nature as an end in itself. It must focus on how a perspective from nature and natural resources can best be contributed to the wider process of rethinking human development and how it might best be advanced. While the setting aside of key landscapes and the protection of attractive species will always be a part of conservation, we will not reverse the rip-tide of biodiversity loss if it is the principal or single argument from the conservation movement.

And, finally, we must systematically scan positive developments in other fields – technology, social mobilization, financial instrument design, behavioural science, etc. – to identify and harness to conservation the best innovations, so that conservation genuinely remains on the cutting edge of innovation and is not left fighting a rear-guard battle against an advancing tide.

None of this is to suggest that we abandon our efforts through mechanisms like the CBD or Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). On the contrary, they are necessary and merit strong support. Instead, it seeks ways to generate the political will that is too often missing in those processes and to give nature a chance of winning for a change.

Convened by the Governments of New Zealand and Marshall Islands, the event welcomed new members, highlighted the Coalition’s goals and described countries’ initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Coalition members aim to “achieve a triple win:” reaping the socioeconomic benefits of the transition to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; building climate-resilient economies; and accelerating global climate action at the necessary speed and scale.

Moderating the discussion, Christiana Figueres emphasized the need co-create a carbon-neutral world by 2050. Her words were echoed by participants who underscored the importance of building solidarity and a collective narrative that allows leaders to point to other countries’ initiatives as a means of building political will among constituencies at home.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called for “a strong wind of change,” saying that we are pushing forward on an agenda “that should not be voluntary.” She underscored the value of creating a club that can share examples and advocate together for stronger climate policies and actions. Describing New Zealand’s actions, Ardern reiterated that climate change recognizes neither borders nor wealth.

Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine outlined her country’s policies and actions on climate change. She called on all to increase the ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change by 2020 to deliver a carbon-neutral world by 2050.

While the Coalition may be distinguished, it is not exclusive.

Vice President of Costa Rica Epsy Campbell Barr outlined how decarbonization can take place in tandem with economic growth, highlighting that her country was run on renewable energy for 334 days last year. Her remarks were followed by statements from Iceland, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Finland, Norway and Mexico, as well as new members: the UK, Denmark, Spain and Canada.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa urged members to lead work that cuts across all actors and sectors of society. She recognized the difficulties of moving “from negotiations to reality,” but noted the relevance of the Coalition in increasing the awareness and relevance of carbon neutrality in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 Climate Summit.

Sweden’s State Secretary Eva Svedling summarized the Carbon Neutrality Coalition’s Plan of Action, which focuses on four areas:

demonstrating and showcasing the benefits of long-term, low-emissions, climate-resilient development strategies;

providing leadership through the exchange of experiences, information, tools and case studies towards carbon neutrality;

advocating for increased global ambition on mitigation; and

encouraging further membership from countries and the alignment of subnational and non-state actors with the objectives of the Coalition.

Figueres closed by reviewing the key themes raised by participants: equal responsibility and equal duty of care; the importance of carbon neutrality in guiding both policy and investment; making economies modern, inclusive and green; and triggering a race to the top. Emission reductions, she highlighted, are the basis for – and not a threat to – economic growth and prosperity. She noted that, while the Coalition may be distinguished, it is not exclusive.

The Carbon Neutrality Coalition’s current members include Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK, as well as 32 cities.

As the Committee commenced its meeting, which took place from 17-21 September 2018, in Rome, Italy, Rolph Payet, Executive Secretary of the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions, reminded delegates of the Committee’s past successes: 16 of the 28 chemicals listed in the Stockholm Convention were reviewed by the POPRC, and concentrations of many of the POPs listed in the Convention are decreasing.

POPRC-14 considered: the draft risk profile on perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), its salts, and related compounds; a recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) on pentadecafluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts, and related compounds; and the process for the evaluation of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts, and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF) pursuant to Part III of Annex B to the Convention, which requires Parties to review the continued need for listed substances for various acceptable purposes and specific exemptions on the basis of available scientific, technical, environmental, and economic information.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the meeting notes that, although only three chemicals were considered, the “technical complexity of these closely-related substances, and their widespread past and current use, created substantial work for the Committee.” The summary also highlights that POPRC-14 “marked the completion of a long-foreseen transition from ‘dead’ to ‘live’ chemicals, illustrating the challenges of recommending policy responses to protect human health and the environment for chemicals used in applications such as fire-fighting foams, which are important for human safety.”

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary highlights that POPRC-14 adopted three decisions:

a risk profile on PFHxS, its salts, and related compounds, which concludes that these substances are likely, as a result of long-range environmental transport (LRET), to lead to significant adverse effects on human health and the environment such that global action is warranted;

a decision to recommend listing PFOA, its salts, and related compounds in Annex A of the Convention (elimination), with specific exemptions for some uses, including fire-fighting foams; and

a decision on PFOS, its salts, and PFOSF that, inter alia, recommends to the COP that some uses permitted under the Convention should be eliminated, due to the availability of safer alternatives for these uses.

The Agreement, which was signed by 14 countries on 27 September, is the first to feature specific, binding provisions for the protection of human rights defenders in environmental matters.

Convened by the Governments of Costa Rica and Chile and the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and hosted at Open Society Foundations, the event was co-sponsored by The Access Initiative, Amnesty International, CIVICUS, Derecho, Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (DAR), Namati and World Resources Institute (WRI). It aimed to enable dialogue and inspire countries to sign and ratify the Agreement. As noted in the event materials, the Agreement is the only treaty stemming from the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and the first regional environmental treaty concluded under the auspices of UN ECLAC.

In their welcome remarks, opening speakers noted that it was refreshing to celebrate a positive event in an otherwise “dark and depressing era,” as noted by Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, CIVICUS. Carole Excell, WRI and The Access Initiative, outlined the history of the Agreement, from idea to declaration to roadmap to vision to negotiation to legally binding agreement to adoption, emphasizing the leading role of women throughout the process. Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International, pointed to the fact that the LAC region has the largest number of environmental and human rights defenders that have been assassinated, recognizing rural communities that are “in the line of fire.”

Rounding out the welcome panel, Stacey Cram, Namati and Aída Gamboa, DAR, flagged that the problems addressed by the Escazú Agreement are not limited to LAC countries, and that the agreement is not just a landmark for the region, but for the world. Noting that ratification is just the first step, Cram cautioned that good laws can still be poorly implemented, but expressed hope that the Agreement can trigger a wider discussion on how governments can broaden access to justice beyond the environmental realm.

Chaired by Andrew Steer, President and CEO, WRI, a panel on the importance of the Agreement for the region and environmental defenders highlighted the increased likelihood of transparency around decision-making. Peruvian indigenous activist and environmental defender Lizardo Cauper emphasized that there is now a new legal mechanism to rely on when demanding that technical documents such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs) be made accessible to non-expert audiences, and in languages other than just Spanish or English.

The following panel, led by Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Climate and Energy Leader, Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), discussed how to move from ratification to implementation. He noted the Agreement features that are already present in some countries’ constitutions, and said key questions must now be addressed on implementation mechanisms. Panelists agreed that ratification is not necessarily a prerequisite to implementation, which can begin right away. Andrea Sanhueza, a civil society representative, noted that there is no legal change needed to assess current practices on information, participation and justice to identify where the gaps lie. Describing what is needed, panelists acknowledged the importance of trust among actors, noting that engaging members of the public in government decision making increases the legitimacy of those decisions.

Panelists noted that engaging members of the public in government decision making increases the legitimacy of those decisions.

Viviana Krsticevic, Centro por la Justicia y el Derecho International (CEJIL), flagged that the Agreement’s text strikes the right tone on creating an enabling environment for the protection of rights, for example around not allowing intimidation of community members. Such aspects of the Agreement, she noted, are critical to the issue of “breaking cycles of impunity,” where those with power continue to disregard international norms, human rights and the environment.

Concluding remarks by Epsy Campbell Barr, Vice President and Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship, Costa Rica, José Antônio Marcondes de Carvalho, Undersecretary General for the Environment, Energy and Science and Technology, Brazil, Alicia Bárcena, Executive Secretary, UN ECLAC, and Patrick Gaspard, President, Open Society Foundations, recognized the hard work and leadership by civil society organizations, called for ownership of the Agreement by citizens, reiterated the need for countries to take the next step and ratify the Agreement, and noted that multilateralism in the LAC region remains strong in the face of cynicism and retreats from cross-border cooperation elsewhere.

167,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unisdr-report-finds-dramatic-rise-in-climate-related-disasters/,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNISDR Report Finds “Dramatic Rise” in Climate-related Disasters,"10 October 2018: The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) released a report that finds economic losses from climate-related disasters have increased by 151 percent. The report recommends integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) into investment decisions to ensure sustainable development in a changing climate.

The report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters 1998-2017,’ examines key trends over the last 40 years on the effect of disasters on economic losses and human lives. The report finds that disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of US$2,908 billion. Out of these disasters, climate-related disasters accounted for 77 percent of the total. The report concludes that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and cautions that disasters will continue to impede sustainable development as long as the economic incentives to develop in hazardous-prone locations outweigh perceived disaster risk.

The report further cautions that economic losses suffered by low and lower-middle income countries are likely to have “crippling consequences” on their future development and their ability to achieve the SDGs, particularly SDG 1 (no poverty). Within this context, the report underscores the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and move towards a more sustainable world.

Economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.

Earthquakes and related tsunamis contributed to the largest number of lives lost, accounting for 56 percent of the total or 747,234 lives lost. In total, 1.3 million people lost their lives between 1998-2017 and an additional 4.4 billion people were rendered homeless, displaced, injured or in need of emergency assistance as a result of disasters. Although earthquakes caused the majority of fatalities, 91 percent of all disasters were attributed to storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather events.

The report profiles economic losses by country, with the largest losses in the US, at US$944.8 billion, followed by China, at US$492.2 billion, and Japan, at US$376.3 billion. Other countries among the top ten for economic losses include India, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Thailand and Mexico. Although high-income countries experience the majority of absolute economic losses, the report emphasizes that disaster events have a disproportionate impact on low and middle-income countries (MICs).

The report also raises concerns on the limited economic data found in disaster reports. The Sendai Framework for DRR includes Target c, which seeks to “reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.’ However, 63 percent of disaster reports do not contain economic data on losses from disasters. Low-income countries, for example, recorded losses for only 13 percent of reported disasters between 1998 and 2017; in other words, there are no loss data for 87 percent of disasters in low-income countries. These limited data hinder countries’ ability to measure progress towards this goal.

UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori, said the report’s analysis shows “economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.” She called for doing a better job of capturing economic data to better understand what works in reducing economic losses, saving lives and livelihoods and managing economic risk.

UNISDR released the report in advance of the International Day for Disaster Reduction, which takes place on 13 October, and this year focuses on Sendai Target c. [Publication: Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters 1998-2017] [UNISDR Press Release] [UNFCCC Press Release]","10 October 2018: The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) released a report that finds economic losses from climate-related disasters have increased by 151 percent.
The report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters 1998-2017,’ examines key trends over the last 40 years on the effect of disasters on economic losses and human lives.
The report finds that disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of US$2,908 billion.
Out of these disasters, climate-related disasters accounted for 77 percent of the total.
Other countries among the top ten for economic losses include India, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Thailand and Mexico."

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

Participants underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063, and recognized the importance of collaborative efforts between the UN and the AU to strengthen multilateralism.



The ADS was launched by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA), and took place from 17-18 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, alongside the UNGA’s debate on the development of Africa, on 19 October. The two-day series replaces the UN’s annual Africa Week, which had taken place since 2010.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored inclusive, sustainable development in Africa as both “a goal unto itself” and “also a leading tool to prevent conflict and crises.” He observed the region’s progress towards improved governance, stability and resilience. At the same time, Guterres recognized that parts of Africa remain fragile, and expressed concern about high levels of debt in some countries, volatile financial markets and looming trade conflicts. He noted that climate change impacts will “create additional strains” in the future.

Speakers also underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda and the AU’s Agenda 2063. Guterres observed that the approaches and policies of the UN and the AU “are more closely aligned than ever before” and both call for a prosperous, peaceful and secure continent based on good governance, human rights and the rule of law and aim to leave no one behind.

On gender equality, participants welcomed Ethiopia’s new government cabinet, which has achieved full gender parity among its ministers. The UN Secretary-General identified the AU as a crucial partner in the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to end violence against women and girls by 2030.

On climate change, the UN Secretary-General called for a “huge leap in investment” to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change in Africa, and called on developed countries to deliver on both finance and technology commitments.

On SDG follow-up and review, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Inga Rhonda King said the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will focus on the SDGs related to climate change (Goal 13), education (Goal 4), inequality (Goal 10), justice (Goal 16), jobs (Goal 8) and partnerships (Goal 17). She called on African countries to share their lessons learned to ensure progress on the 2030 Agenda.

Speakers underscored linkages between peace, security and development, with several recognizing Africa’s contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. The UN Special Adviser on Africa, Bience Gawanas, said the region seeks to “achieve peace, prosperity and socio-economic transformation,” and urged all actors to respond to Africa’s challenges in a coherent, coordinated manner. UN Security Council President Sacha Sergio Llorenty (Bolivia) highlighted the role of young people and women in peace and development efforts in Africa. He called for high-level political support to ensure their meaningful participation.

Speakers also welcomed the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and recognized the importance of financing for Africa to achieve the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 and the Paris Agreement. The dialogue also reflected on reform processes within both the UN and the AU.

The bag has the potential to contribute to reducing marine plastic pollution.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), over 60,000 microplastic particles are contained in every square kilometer of the sea, although this figure is even higher for some parts of the world. These microplastic particles come from plastic waste that ends up in the ocean and then breaks down into smaller pieces as a result of wave erosion, bacteria and other environmental effects. Marine life may consume these microplastic particles, which then enter the global food chain.

Roberto Astete and Cristian Olivares, who designed the soluble bag, were working on experiments related to biodegradable detergents. During their experiments, they discovered that using a derivative of limestone, rather than oil byproducts, changes the structure of plastic from indestructible to soluble. This discovery led to the creation of the SoluBag.

A traditional plastic bag takes more than 150 years to degrade. The SoluBag can be disposed of in water in a few minutes.

Chile became the first country in South America to join other countries in banning the use of plastic bags as a step towards tackling plastic pollution. More than 50 countries have taken similar steps as part of the UN Clean Seas campaign.

The Day focused on the theme, ‘Municipal Solid Waste.’



According to the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 99 percent of purchased items are discarded within six months, and the world produces two billion tonnes of waste annually. On World Habitat Day, UN-Habitat called for society to “make small adjustments to our consumption styles,” such as by making a conscious effort to fix broken items rather than throw them away, recycle correctly and identify and use alternatives to disposable plastic items, including bottles, cups, cutlery and plates.

The SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the New Urban Agenda (NUA) all address solid waste management. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) includes target 11.6, which focuses on reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management issues. SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) includes targets focused on environmentally sound management of all waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (targets 12.4 and 12.5) and reduction of food waste (target 12.3). Under the Paris Agreement, countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) can include action on waste management as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the NUA commits to “environmentally sound management and minimization of all waste.” UN-Habitat is working to support countries to translate these commitments into practical and sustainable actions at the local level.

The call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ asks communities, cities and towns around the world to rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.

In a statement for the Day, UN-Habitat Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, stressed that tackling waste management challenges “requires imagination and innovation,” and demands that people “rethink” waste. She observed that effective waste management “starts with us as individuals,” and stressed that, through collective action, the world can become “cleaner, greener, safer, healthier and happier.”

UN-Habitat supports cities to improve their waste management practices through implementing community-based waste management collection and recycling and supporting cities to design cost-effective systems to collect and dispose of garbage. The agency also created the ‘Trash to Art’ project, which invited local artists to “make a statement on sustainability” by creating art using discarded materials.

The global observance of World Habitat Day took place at UN-Habitat headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. In a statement at the event, the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, described solid waste management as “one of the greatest challenges of our time in a rapidly urbanizing world.” He urged every single person to take personal responsibility for managing waste, and called for developing innovative and sustainable solutions to tackle the global solid waste problem.

Also on the Day, UN-Habitat and its partners discussed a call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ that aims to recognize cities’ efforts to lead effective waste management initiatives. The call for action asks communities, cities and towns around the world to “rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.” Communities, cities or towns that improve their solid waste management and reduce their waste management expenditure will be publicly recognized as ‘Waste-Wise Cities.’

World Habitat Day is celebrated annually on the first Monday of October to reflect on the state of cities and towns and on the right of all to adequate shelter.

The project seeks to serve as communication and educational tool to engage the global public in the SDGs.



The Good Life Goals is a joint initiative, and the 10-YFP Sustainable Lifestyles and Education programme, co-led by the governments of Sweden and Japan, is represented in the project by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES). Launching the goals at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, Solitaire Townsend, Co-founder of Futerra, remarked that sharing a set of clear Good Life Goals and meaningful actions for each SDG can help build confidence that everyone is important, needed, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

For each SDG, the Good Life Goals propose five actions that people can take to have tangible impact on the SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the project outlines the five following actions to “help end poverty”: i) learn the causes of poverty at home and abroad; ii) share and donate what you can; iii) buy from companies that pay people fairly; iv) save, borrow and invest responsibly; and v) demand decent wages and opportunities for all.

On SDG 13 (climate action), the project suggests to “act on climate” by: i) learning about climate solutions; ii) calling “for more renewable energy in your country;” iii) eating more plants and cutting down on meat; iv) walking and cycling rather than driving; and v) demanding leaders to take bold action “today.” A video on the Good Life Goals provides an overview of the actions that can be taken for each of the SDGs.

A WBCSD press release notes that, from a business perspective, the Good Life Goals can provide companies with valuable insight into the ways the SDGs link to the actions, activities and lifestyles of their customers, and this understanding can help brands more effectively engage with people around the behaviors that are connected to their products and services. WBCSD also remarks that exploring the linkages between people’s day-to-day lives and the SDGs can help businesses identify innovation opportunities capable of offering better and more sustainable lifestyles. Finally, the Good Life Goals can be used by brands, NGOs and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing sustainable development, and can provide companies with a simple tool that they can use to enhance awareness of the SDGs among their own staff and promote a corporate culture that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, WBCSD says.

An accompanying symposium offered countries the opportunity to share national progress on statistics for implementing the SDGs and Agenda 2063 and to discuss regional indicators for the two agendas.



Heads of national statistics offices (NSOs) from 51 African countries, representatives from international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, academia and research institutions and the private sector attended StatCom-Africa VI, which took place on the theme, ‘Enhancing the Capacity of National Statistical Systems to support policies for Africa’s economic diversification and industrialization.’ Participants identified the importance of national ownership, adequate resources and adequate resources for the region to support statistical transformation initiatives. They called for States to support the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the 2020 round of housing and population censuses.

In a keynote address, Vincent Hendricks, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reflected that scientists do not typically like to sell themselves or their products, believing that their value is “self-evident,” but he said “it doesn’t work that way” in reality. He urged statisticians to realize that they “are the experts and not the politicians” and they should use their data “for the good of their communities.” He called for taking ownership of their data and using it to change their communities, advance democracy and help African governments promote evidence-based policymaking.

The meeting also reflected on key challenges faced by NSOs, including enhancing the capacity of statistical systems and aligning statistics with global, regional and national development agendas. Participants underscored the role of creative and innovative approaches to overcome challenges, and called for all stakeholders to collaborate to meet the growing demand for data to inform and implement development agendas. Participants also supported disaggregating indicators for monitoring basic human rights as a way to address inequalities, and investing in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system.

The Director of the African Centre for Statistics (ACS), Oliver Chinganya, presented the ACS’ proposed strategic framework for the 2018-2019 biennium. The framework aims to “improve the production, dissemination and use of quality data and statistics” within the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. He said the Centre is working to support the design of national strategies on statistics, dissemination of information and best practices and production of harmonized statistics.

Participants took note of the statistical programme and urged UNECA to continue supporting States in building their statistical capacity in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ABCF).

Also within the StatCom-Africa VI meeting, the 13th session of the African Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 3-4 October 2018. The symposium focused on the theme, ‘Application of economic statistics and national accounts in support of sustainable development.’ Countries shared progress and challenges in statistical development in line with the SDGs, with some reporting on how their countries have aligned national development plans with the SDGs.

Others highlighted a lack of data to support SDG indicators. A representative for South Africa said that his country lacks data to compile economic indicators to support monitoring of targets under SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

Goalkeepers 2018 took place as part of the annual Global Goals Week on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s high-level debate.

Goalkeepers participants gathered on 26 September 2018 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, following an evening ceremony on 25 September to present awards to three young advocates.

The Heads of State of France and Sierra Leone participated in interactive sessions with participants, as did experts in technology, data journalism and humanitarian relief. Performances by artists from around the world highlighted urgent issues, and activists, advocates and community leaders emphasized that “change starts young” and discussed ways to make more progress towards the Global Goals.

France will increase its development aid from US$10 to US$50 billion by 2022, announced President Emmanuel Macron, beginning the day’s programme. He said France’s G7 presidency will focus on inequalities, and that the three root challenges of climate, education and health must be at the core of the Group’s agenda. He called for shifting one-third of global financial assets from “day-to-day business to climate business,” and said France’s development aid will be Paris-compliant. Highlighting the importance of education for young girls in Africa, he emphasized the need for “chosen fertility.” On health, Macron noted that France will organize the 2019 global replenishment for the Global Fund. Finally, he said youth should be able to dream of being an African of the 21st century, rather than a European of the 1980s.

David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s first-ever Chief Innovation Officer, spoke with Julius Maada Bio, President of Sierra Leone, and Bill Gates to address whether poverty is inevitable. Gates shared the findings of the 2018 Goalkeepers Data Report highlighting that while the global population has peaked, its geographical concentration is changing, with more babies being born in the poorest, most difficult circumstances. This means that, at least at the beginning of their lives, they and their families will spend their time seeking out food for survival, therefore unable to invest in education, health or building assets. Gates said the next wave of poverty reduction can come through investments in young innovators and other human capital.

Sengeh said Sierra Leone can be the blueprint for growth through technology and environmental resilience. To realize this, President Bio said the priority is free, quality and competitive education for “the last boy or girl in the village.” He noted the need for technology infrastructure to make this possible. Gates added that innovation can drive progress when it focuses on a big gap.

Stephen Fry, actor and director, and Richard Curtis, director, screenwriter and campaigner, who founded Project Everyone, recounted what made the MDG era “15 of the greatest years in human history:” they showed that “when the world focused on alleviating poverty and suffering, it worked;” and they encouraged a shift from addressing poverty as charity to seeing poverty as political. However, they said, there is no point in going only half way, and the SDGs serve as the MDGs’ sequel. They noted that many countries have taken concrete action to implement the Goals, businesses have identified a US$12 trillion opportunity, and 250,000 charity organizations have aligned themselves with the SDGs. But the momentum of the first few years of the 2030 Agenda can falter “without new energy,” they said, and they called on campaigners to push governments further in 2019. Moreover, in 2020, the world must “work out the big sea changes and the big funding solutions” to support the remaining ten years of SDG implementation.

Steve Waygood, Aviva, highlighted the World Benchmarking Alliance launched on 24 September. He said the WBA will rank the world’s largest 2,000 companies by their impact on the SDGs, in an effort to “reconnect people to their money” and its impacts in the world. Waygood said large-scale change will come not from regulation but from people with money ensuring that their assets are invested with integrity. Curtis added that Aviva aims to become plastic-free, has been carbon neutral since 2004, and invests heavily in renewable energy sources; by changing its own behavior, Aviva has gained the credibility to call on others to change.

Graca Machel urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

As part of a tribute to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel, advocate and member of The Elders, said the lessons of the past show the need to build movements and broad coalitions: transformation is “not going to happen in small groups.” She noted that “there is apartheid” in each of the 17 SDGs. Machel said Nelson Mandela had been “an ordinary young man who simply embraced one cause.” She urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

David Miliband, International Rescue Committee (IRC) President, echoed the reflections on getting “half way there” on extreme poverty. He said that new tools are needed for the second half of that journey, in order to fight poverty in places in conflict. He also said the current humanitarian system is “building future generations of poverty” by not directing enough resources towards education.

A panel of young experts, advocates and community leaders moderated by Melinda Gates highlighted that young people must be enlisted as “true partners” in delivering on the SDGs. Joannie Bewa, a physician in Benin, said young people are not just needy, but bring talent and innovation, and need to be involved in designing and implementing solutions.

Trisha Shetty, founder of SheSays, suggested tapping into leaders’ interest in public opinion, and shared her success in involving comedians in a social media campaign to get finance ministers to drop taxes on sanitary napkins. Shetty also highlighted the complicity of people who remain silent in the face of sexual abuse of young people. Addressing those in older generations who have not faced accountability, she said, “give up your seat. We will leave you behind, because we don’t want to leave others behind.”

Another conversation focused on protecting and supporting girls, featuring Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and child rights activist, and Jaha Dukureh, founder and CEO of Safe Hands for Girls. Satyarthi discussed the need for “child-friendly” education, and said social taboos block the provision of appropriate sex education. Dukureh encouraged the use of technology and media, noting that her Change.org petition to then-president Barack Obama led to an investigation on FGM in the US. Her work also contributed to the banning of FGM in Gambia.

Mona Chalabi, data journalist and illustrator, said she aims to “create joy” while providing data in her work for major newspapers. She stressed that readers should feel something while looking at data, since it can communicate injustice. She also uses her illustrations to disaggregate findings, showing the rates that apply to specific readers rather than broad generalizations.

The Goalkeepers event launched three “accelerators” to direct resources and make progress on specific issues. The 2018 accelerators are focused on: early literacy in Africa and Asia (managed by Room to Read); supporting youth to use data to hold leaders accountable (managed by CIVICUS); and community-based solutions for ending child marriage (managed by Girls Not Brides). Accelerator Stations were situated around the event to enable participants to invest in the initiatives.

Jayathma Wickramanayake, UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, elaborated on the data accelerator, which is called the Goalkeepers Youth Action Fund.

UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey urged other countries to designate 30 percent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (MPAs) to address challenges posed by climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Target 11 and SDG target 14.5 aim to protect at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The UK is advocating for increasing this target to 30 percent by 2030. Currently, only seven percent of oceans are formally protected. Further, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), more effective governance and management of these protected areas is critical to ensure that these MPAs are not “paper parks.”

Coffey is expected to encourage other countries to support increased coastal and marine ocean protection during the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) high-level General Debate. The Government of the UK has also announced it will encourage adoption of the 30 percent target at the 14th meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties in November 2018.

Marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.

In a statement in New York, US, UK Environment Secretary, Michael Grove, also emphasized the importance of global action to protect the world’s oceans. He said the UK has already protected marine habitats,“but we must go further.” He called for working together to ensure the health of the world’s oceans for future generations. The UK has classified more than 200,000 square miles of coastal waters as MPAs and has pledged to protect four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim welcomed the UK’s call to enhance global marine protection. He stressed that “marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.” UNEP Patron of Oceans, Lewis Pugh, described the Government of the UK’s action as a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation. He stressed, however, the importance of focusing “not only on the number but the nature of the protection,” explaining that fully protected MPAs are necessary for the ocean to recover. If other countries join the UK and follow through on their commitment, he said, such a decision will be “the most important moment for ocean conservation in history.” [UNEP Press Release] [CBD Aichi Targets] [Lewis Pugh Website on Ocean Protection Press Release] [Climate Action Press Release]","25 September 2018: The Government of the UK has called for protecting 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.

The report titled, ‘Progress on Transboundary Water Cooperation under the Water Convention,’ is based on self-assessments submitted by 38 of the 40 countries that were Parties at the time of the reporting exercise in 2017.

In her introduction to the report, Olga Algayerova, UNECE Executive Secretary, hailed the report as a major “milestone,” highlighting that it also contributes to understanding the status of action on SDG target 6.5 on integrated water resources management (IWRM) and transboundary cooperation.

Countries that are not Parties to the Convention could use the reporting template to gain insight into what they would need to do to implement the treaty.

The self-reporting exercise was the first of its kind to be undertaken through the UNECE Water Convention, known in full as the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. Using a common template, countries reported on the existence of agreements, joint bodies, strategies and activities for cooperation. The exercise showed that most transboundary waters shared by signatories to the Convention already have agreements and arrangements in place; however, at least 15 transboundary river and lake basins do not have an agreement or arrangement in place for the whole basin, and at least 29 do not have agreements or arrangements covering transboundary aquifers. The report highlights several challenges for Parties to the Convention, including the need to harmonize governance systems, better engage with stakeholders, address climate variability, meet financing needs, and build technical capacity in the countries.

UNECE and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are co-custodians of SDG target 6.5. UNECE suggests that even countries that are not Parties to the Convention could benefit from using the reporting template, as it will give insight into what they would need to do to implement the Convention, and can also help them report progress against SDG indicator 6.5.2 on the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation.

The report was released in the lead-up the eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Water Convention (MOP-8), which takes place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 10-12 October 2018. Parties to the Convention meet every three years.

Originally a European agreement, the Convention opened for global signature in 2016 and now has 41 Parties, with Chad acceding to the Convention in February 2018, and Senegal in September 2018.

The funding will support countries in Africa and Asia to prevent wildlife poaching and illegal wildlife trade and help countries to reduce consumer demand for species and their products.

According to the GEF, there is an urgent need to tackle wildlife crime. Leopards are extinct in 23 out of the 89 African and Asian countries where they originally lived, and only four percent of tigers remain in the wild. In Africa, the numbers of African elephant and black rhino are “plummeting.” Birds, pangolins, primates, sharks, turtles and other species are all facing severe pressure from wildlife trade.

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the “most lucrative illegal businesses in the world,” generating between US$7 billion to 23 billion per year. This crime contributes to corruption and conflicts and deprives local communities of natural capital and opportunities to benefit from nature-based tourism. The GEF estimates that crimes affecting natural resources “cost societies more than US$70 billion a year.”

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the most lucrative illegal businesses in the world.

The GEF is working to tackle wildlife crime through its Global Wildlife Programme (GWP), which works in 19 African and Asian countries. The partnership focuses on wildlife conservation and crime prevention for sustainable development and is funded by the GEF and led by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). The increased funding will broaden the partnership’s reach and impact and help countries to take their own measures to tackle illegal wildlife trade.

The GEF has allocated a total of US$168 million to combat wildlife trafficking during its GEF-7 funding cycle, which runs from 2018-2022. The GEF announced this increased funding in advance of the ‘Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference,’ an event hosted by the Government of the UK. The event aims to combat wildlife trade as a serious organized crime, close markets for wildlife species and products and build coalitions to deliver change.

Agriculture contributes to about one third of Nepal’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs about two-thirds of the population directly or indirectly. Agriculture being highly vulnerable to climate change, experiences far-reaching impacts with implications on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: Food security, Nutrition and Hunger and other SDGs. Since these impacts directly affect the livelihoods of a large number of people depending upon agriculture, it is important to integrate climate change in agriculture plans at all levels of government—local, provincial and federal.

The Government of Nepal (GoN) has recently made various efforts to integrate climate change in planning and budgeting across the sectors in order to make development programs climate responsive. Several guidelines have been formulated and policy reforms introduced to help the ministries in prioritization, budget allocation and expenditure tracking to support their climate goals.

To this end the GoN has recently endorsed a Climate Change Financing Framework1 (CCFF) and prepared a roadmap to guide mainstreaming climate actions into development plans and budgets and improve accountability and reporting on the effectiveness of climate investments.

The roadmap further provides guidance to the sectoral ministries in SDG implementation and localization by ensuring that climate actions are well integrated into SDGbased plans and monitoring frameworks at all levels.

This policy brief examines impacts of climate change on agriculture productivity and opportunities to improve agriculture sector planning and budgeting based on CCFF recommendations and its implementation at sub-national levels under federal governance structure. This note also discusses the interlinkages between CCFF and SDG implementation, puts forward why policy reforms are critical to national interest.","Agriculture being highly vulnerable to climate change, experiences far-reaching impacts with implications on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: Food security, Nutrition and Hunger and other SDGs.

12.C.1 Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels.

Progress to date

The breadth and ambition of SDG12, coupled with the relatively immature nature of some of the metrics used to assess levels of sustainable consumption and production, makes analysing progress more difficult than is the case for most of the SDGs.

However, what metrics are available point to a worrying picture. The UN's most recent progress report starts with the blunt assessment: ""Decoupling economic growth from resource use has been challenging.""

The report cites overarching figures for domestic material consumption (DMC) which gives an indication of materials used in production processes within an economy. Globally DMC per unit of GDP rose from 1.29kg to 1.41kg per dollar of GDP between 2000 and 2015, indicating more materials are required to produce a unit of output than was the case at the turn of the century. Total DMC also rose between 2000 and 2010, climbing from 48.7 billion tons to 71.0 billion tons, driven in large part by the rapid expansion of manufacturing-reliant emerging economies. The UN warned these trends will have ""consequences in terms of both resource pressures and associated environmental impacts"".

National governments are taking steps to tackle air, water and soil pollution, enhance resource efficiency, reduce food waste, boost recycling rates, and encourage corporate sustainability reporting. But progress remains extremely varied and even in some countries where recycling infrastructure is well established, such as the UK, efforts to improve recycling rates and reduce food waste have stalled in recent years.

Moreover, many countries are yet to enact any effective production and consumption policies. The UN progress report reveals that as of 2018 71 countries and the EU have formally reported on macro-policies, regulatory, voluntary or economic instruments that support the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In total 109 countries are thought to have or had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. But that still leaves just under half the world's nations with no such policies.

Further evidence of the patchwork nature of global efforts to encourage more sustainable consumption and production are found in the levels of compliance with international environmental agreements.

The Paris Agreement may have been backed by every country (even if the US is now planning to quit the accord) and the Montreal Protocol covering ozone damaging gases has a 100 per cent compliance rate. But the Rotterdam Convention covering the use of hazardous chemicals and pesticides only has a 71 per cent compliance rate, despite being enacted in 2004. Again, the US has refused to ratify the agreement.

Backing for the Basel Convention on the movement of hazardous waste and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is worse still, with 57 per cent and 51 per cent compliance, respectively.

Relatively few governments have moved beyond lip service towards sustainable consumption and production and many are yet to engage with the issue at all at any meaningful level.

""Achieving Goal 12 requires a strong national framework for sustainable consumption and production that is integrated into national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour, together with adherence to international norms on the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes,"" the UN states. The problem is even those countries and businesses with the most advanced environmental governance systems and strategies are struggling to develop truly sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Business implications

The potential implications for businesses of SDG12 are both enormous in their scale and reach, and extremely difficult to track.

Take the overarching goal and its pledge to ""ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"". That implies an end to unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Followed through to its logical extreme, that's a huge commitment. It suggests policies to actively pursue an end to the consumption of a whole raft of products and industries that are to all intents and purposes unsustainable in their current form, alongside the radical reform of unsustainable production techniques that have dominated some sectors for centuries. It raises huge questions about the very nature of consumer-led economies and the long term viability of profits generated from endlessly increased consumption.

It is easy to dismiss the possibility of sustainable consumption policies. After all, progress to date against SDG12 has been limited and there are few, if any, governments that have secured and retained power on a platform of 'consume less'.

But at the same time it would be wrong to reject the possibility out of hand. Savvy businesses are already responding to the trend towards dematerialised products, services, and experiences, beloved of millennial consumers. Meanwhile, the global push to slash the use of plastic straws and curb the market for disposable coffee cups has shown how once it gains traction interest in sustainable consumption can destroy entire markets. Speculation continues to mount over whether or not some martkets have reached 'peak car', as car-sharing and other transport services become mainstream.

At the same time, sustainable production patterns are on the agenda of many governments and businesses, as a growing number of leaders recognise how the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resource security necessitates more circular material flows and efficient production practices. If governments really do implement ambitious 10 year frameworks for delivering sustainable consumption and production then businesses are likely to be impacted at all levels. The achievement of ""sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources"" implies a genuine revolution in resource use and business models globally.

More specifically, SDG12 may at times feel like a holding pen for a raft of targets that could not be fitted in under the other goals, but many of those targets have still have huge direct business implications.

For example, the target to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030 is bracingly specific and suggests much more ambitious food waste policies will have to be enacted that will affect the entire global food industry.

Similarly, the pledge to renew efforts to bring more countries under the auspices of hazardous chemicals conventions and ""substantially"" reduce waste levels and boost recycling rates implies significantly more ambitious waste policies will be introduced in the coming years.

More broadly the promise to encourage more companies to report on their sustainability performance will provide yet more momentum behind the calls for more mandatory reporting rules, while the pledge to boost education around sustainability issues should further increase public interest in corporate responsibility. Promoting more sustainable public procurement practices should create major new markets for green businesses.

Finally, the target to rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies may be a sub-target and may echo largely ignored G20 promises to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but if enacted such a move would represent one of the simplest and most effective measures for curtailing pollution and boosting clean energy investment.

Business risks

The business risks associated with SDG12 are considerable. The continuation of unsustainable consumption and production patterns is, by definition, unsustainable. Inefficient resource flows will make meeting other SDGs covering poverty eradication and climate change, to give just two examples, much harder if not impossible to meet. At the same time investors and business leaders are already concerned about resource insecurity, commodity price volatility, and various industries that could be approaching environmental limits. A failure to accelerate the development of more sustainable consumption and production models will only amplify these concerns.

On the flip side, enacting sustainable consumption and production policies will create losers and winners, with some industries potentially facing an existential crisis. Large parts of industries such as 'fast fashion', plastics and packaging, consumer technology, food, and chemicals are yet to wrestle with products and business models that are based on linear resource flows and arguably damaging levels of highly inefficient consumption.

Some countries are beginning to consider bolder action in these areas, with material taxes, re-use and recycling incentive schemes, and outright bans on certain products all firmly under discussion. Businesses that fail to adapt to this reality will face major pressure on revenues, as well as continued reputational risks.

Chemicals regulations will inevitably tighten over the coming decade, along with public acceptance of products that are perceived to be environmentally damaging - a trend that could lead to major disruption to global supply chains.

A concerted global effort to promote better corporate sustainability strategies and more standardised reporting will create new regulatory and reputational risks, as well as increased pressure, for those businesses that are yet to develop credible sustainability strategies. The trend is also likely to start to extend down the business supply chain to take in small and medium sized enterprises.

Any phase out of fossil fuel subsidies would introduce significant risks for the energy and transport sectors, especially as the cost of clean tech alternatives continues to fall.

Business opportunities

As the UN's progress report makes clear, the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns remains at a fledgling stage. However, there are businesses and governments that are starting to engage with the concept and recognise the commercial and economic opportunities it can offer.

For example, a growing number of progressive businesses, especially in the retail and technology space, are pioneering new service-based or circular economy-style products, extending product life, encouraging re-use, and ensuring recycling occurs. From car sharing and leasing models to repairable and upgradable gadgets or clothes that are designed for years, not months, some businesses are opening up new revenue streams through more sustainable consumption models.

At the same time, many businesses are starting to recognise that higher levels of resource efficiency may require investment in improved design and better materials, but they can also deliver lower costs and improved resource security in the long run. Again, whole new industries are opening up for businesses that can deliver more efficient and durable materials or ensure materials are reused at the end of their original life.

Similarly, efforts to tackle food waste promise massive cost and greenhouse gas emissions savings and as such a new international business-led coalition has already been launched to advance best practices around the world under the banner Champions 12.3.

Similarly, the pledge to advance sustainable tourism strategies can only benefit an industry that is set to face significant environmental and policy challenges in the coming decades.

More generally, research has repeatedly shown that the adoption of effective corporate sustainability strategies and reporting can often lead to improved financial performance, reputational gains, better productivity, and lower risk profiles for investors. For those businesses already embracing such strategies the creation of a more level playing field where rivals are also required to disclose their sustainability performance can only help both them and their investors.

More public awareness amongst citizens of sustainable development and ""lifestyles in harmony with nature"" can only help drive the growth of green business and clean tech markets. Meanwhile, improved chemicals and hazardous waste regulations will serve to reduce environmental risks for all businesses. Any rebalancing of global energy markets caused by the removal of fossil fuel subsidies would boost clean energy markets and mobilise increased investment in energy efficiency.

In summary, sustainable consumption and production patterns can create massive new opportunities for businesses, but many of them will have to embrace new technologies and fundamentally change their business models to exploit them.","12.2.2 Domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per GDP.

Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

184,https://www.businessgreen.com/analysis/3065712/how-sdg-business-strategies-are-already-generating-usd233bn-in-revenue,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",www.businessgreen.com,How SDG business strategies are already generating $233bn in revenue,"The business case for driving pursuing globally agreed sustainability goals is often laid out in terms of estimates and projections of future earnings. And on paper, at least, the case is certainly hard to argue with.

According to the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, achieving the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could open up $12tr of market opportunities in food and agriculture, cities, energy and materials, and health and well-being alone, creating 380 million new jobs by 2030 in the process. Meanwhile, the theory goes, we should all find ourselves living on a far cleaner, greener, fairer, more secure, and more prosperous planet once the goals are met.

ADVERTISEMENT

All that, you would think, goes quite some way towards justifying and incentivising the $5-7tr of investment the UN expects will be needed to meet the SDGs through to 2030.

Yet, projections aside, there have to date been few attempts to actually quantify the impact the SDGs are already having on the global economy, despite the fact 193 countries, 9,000 companies, and investors worth more than $4tr in assets have so far pledged their support for the goals. However, a new tool developed by ESG analyst Trucost looks to do just that.

Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

The startling findings are the result of a new SDG Evaluation Tool developed by Trucost which provides quantitative analysis of company performance against the SDGs across the value chain, from raw material inputs to product use and disposal, within the context of a firm's geographical location.

Trucost, which is part of S&P Global, began working alongside multiple companies, investors, and academics earlier this year to develop the set of metrics, which are aimed at providing market participants with the data transparency needed to accelerate progress on the UN goals.

Among the 13 companies which agreed to take part in the inaugural application of the Tool were renewables firms Iberdrola and Ørsted, as well as a variety of major corporates such as Rockwool, the Walgreens Boots Alliance, HP and, of course, S&P Global. The advisory panel for the research, meanwhile, included the London School of Economics, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

Overall it found the 13 companies generated almost $233bn of 'SDG-aligned' business revenues in 2017, equivalent to as much as 87 per cent of their entire revenues that year. If the SDGs represent the world's biggest to do list, then the work is certainly very well paid.

Libby Bernick, managing director and global head of corporate business at Trucost, welcomed the findings. ""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions,"" she added. ""We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

Breaking down the findings, most of the companies' revenues - 79 per cent - derived from products and services which contribute to the SDGs. The results also found companies created ""positive contributions"" across all 17 SDGs, but most significantly in relation to green economy priorities such as Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8).

But revenues weren't the only business benefits uncovered by the SDG Tool. Trucost said the analysis shows how working towards the SDGs can help catalyse new ways for companies to think about social and environmental issues - and to guard against risk. After all, the Tool is designed to help companies identify SDG-aligned business value, prioritise risks and opportunities, and inform sustainable growth strategies, not just generate raw revenues.

The companies taking part in the Tool were found to be most active in managing SDG risks associated with responsible consumption and production, including waste and resource efficiency, as set out in SDG 12, as well as issues arising from SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 16 on governance. But while some activity was targeted at addressing supply chain risks, especially with regards to worker conditions, governance, and climate change, the analysis highlighted a need to better manage ESG risks right across the value chain. Moreover, a lack of consistency of action was found across the SDGs, the Tool found, with work on ocean health, hunger and malnutrition largely missing from the 13 companies' sustainability strategies.

As Trucost points out, the analysis shows how such tools and modelling can help screen value chains for SDG risks that companies might otherwise not have been aware of, thereby encouraging better environmental and climate risk disclosure. And given the relative lack of awareness - despite growing take up - of the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), any work to boost understanding of the financial impact of climate change and wider environmental challenges on business is surely welcome.

""The SDGs can encourage companies to consider SDG-related issues that are not commonly monitored and reported in the corporate community, but are still important to the achievement of the SDGs,"" the analysis states.

Given so many firms remain off-track with just 12 years to go to meet the SDGs, there understandably remain significant concerns about the world's ability to deliver on the 17 goals it has set itself by 2030. Far more finance is clearly needed to accelerate action, alongside technological innovation and drastic improvements in the policy environment. But with evidence now emerging that the SDGs are already helping to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue and identify risks at little over a dozen firms, the hope remains that more companies will start to recognise that the huge opportunities that come from embracing sustainable business models are not just a future projection, they are also an existing reality.","Released yesterday, the analysis of 13 major corporates makes for pretty positive reading, demonstrating that business strategies aligned with the SDGs delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone.

Ms. Durant used her opening remarks to make a pitch of her own to the 12 entrepreneur finalists, who were readying to present their SDG-orientated business ideas to a panel of impact investors.

“You are the generation which can change your countries, the economy, and development strategy,” she said.

“We have to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. For that we need you. We need your energy and your creativity Business for businesses’ sake is not the message of the SDGs.”

“Meaningful and fair businesses, which are close to the people and planet, are the businesses we need – and that is what you will start.”

“You have already captured the essence of the SDGs by incorporating climate and the environment, social and economic factors into your business models.”

“Global Entrepreneurs Week is a wonderful tool to mobilize not only you but one million people from 100 countries on six continents. UNCTAD is proud of have been at the roots of this initiative.”

An energetic connection

The winning scale-up was born with a meeting between indigenous Guayusa leaf producers in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and Mr. Santander and his business partner Juan David Gomez, who wanted to harness the energy properties of the leaf, but with community involvement.

Now, 150 small-scale Amazonian growers are making the first natural, organic energy tea, Waykana, from ancestral Guayusa leaves.

The project generates income and boosts development in the community.

Mr. Santander said he would share his prize money with the growers to help them establish a grower’s association and protect them as Waykana expands.

“It feels amazing to have won. We have been working on the project at a crazy speed, non-stop for three years. We can feel how it is now taking off,” he said.

“The grant means the world, not only to our company, and Ecuador, but to our growers and the Guayusa tea industry. With the support of the international community we aim to make Guayusa famous all over the world.”

“We plan to allocate this money wisely into better organizing and strengthening the relationship with the small-scale growers.”

Mum’s the word

The Second Committee’s sustainable development debate began on 15 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) presented seven reports. The first report concerned mainstreaming economic, social, and environmental impacts throughout the UN System. The second report highlighted unfinished business for Agenda 21, indicating that environmental and developmental progress has been mixed and uneven. The third report identified mandates in order to ensure monitoring of SIDS’ and their mainstreaming of the SAMOA Pathway into national development frameworks. These mandates concern resource gaps and research, policy development, and technical analysis. The fourth report addressed remaining challenges with mainstreaming the SAMOA Pathway, enhancing coherence of issues facing SIDS, and matching mandates to resources. The fifth report focused on biodiversity and economic growth in the Caribbean Sea. The sixth report emphasized harmony with nature. The report analyzed implementation trends of law, policy, education, and public engagement. The report also addressed sustainable consumption and production patterns. The seventh report focused on affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) provided updates on responses to address impacts of the El Niño phenomenon. UNISDR said that the clear effects of climate change, which undermine progress made in sustainable and inclusive development, are taking a larger human and economic toll. UNISDR’s report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters,’ found that “20 years have seen a dramatic rise of 151% in direct economic losses from climate change related disasters…1.3 million people lost their lives…4.4 billion people were injured, displaced, or in need of emergency assistance due to disasters.” According to the report, earthquakes and tsunamis accounted for 56% of total deaths due to natural disaster. UNISDR recalled that only two years remain to achieve target (e) of the Sendai Framework, “to substantially increase the number of states with national and local disaster risk reduction targets by 2020.” UNISDR urged States to go beyond establishing targets by gathering data for disaster risk reduction, disaster risk assessments, and the disclosure of disaster risks. UNISDR noted that gaps of the Sendai Framework require attention as States begin their data uploads.

The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) secretariat discussed efforts related to land degradation neutrality (LDN). UNCCD highlighted the creation of the LDN Fund, and noted that more than 120 States have established LDN targets. UNCCD highlighted that LDN efforts offer a way to accelerate progress in addressing forced migration, poverty, conflict from instability and loss of biodiversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) secretariat noted the role of biodiversity in infrastructure provision for human development and life on the planet. CBD announced that 107 of its 196 member States have ratified the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, and 171 of its member States have ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. She also drew attention to the preparations for the 14th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the CBD, and to the need to increase action to achieve biodiversity targets by 2020 as well as to look beyond that deadline.

The UN Environment Programme (UN Environment) discussed its global campaign to beat plastic pollution, and highlighted the need for a focus on sound management of chemicals and waste, marine litter and microplastics, exposure to lead paint, and mainstreaming of biodiversity. He also noted the role for regional strategies and agreements.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) discussed the importance of entrepreneurship for sustainable development by creating jobs and spurring economic growth. UNCTAD stressed the need for long term and cross-sectorial strategies for sustainable development. UNCTAD presented six pillars of entrepreneurship for sustainable development: national entrepreneurship strategies, optimizing the regulatory framework, enhancing skills and education development, improving access to finance, facilitating technology innovation and exchange, promoting awareness and networking.

In the Committee’s debate on sustainable development, delegates touched on finance, disasters, gaps, partnerships, and the importance of a sustainable environment. Maldives speaking on behalf for SIDS, presented struggles they currently face due to lack of access to finance. El Salvador called for public, private, domestic, and international mobilization of finances in the pursuit of 2030 Agenda. Bangladesh announced investments to make its agriculture sector resilient to climate change. Cuba expressed concern about large financial resources allocated to arms or speculation while unsustainable consumption and production practices rise. Qatar reported that it is making significant investments in educational programs. Afghanistan stressed technical and financial assistance specifically in reliable and sustainable energy. Jamaica said that risk-informed investments are key to action in DRR. Ethiopia said financial provisions are imperative for energy infrastructure development in LDCs. Mauritius stated that lack of access to concessional financing prevents resilience in its state. Sierra Leone urged the provision of financial resources to enable environmental energy investment. The Maldives and Nauru said financing can provide the answer for filling gaps in required resource allocation. Syria discussed the challenges it faces in implementing the SDGs, including terrorism and economic sanctions.

Malawi, Maldives, India, Singapore, Qatar, Nepal, the Republic of Moldova, and Armenia highlighted the vital role of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. India discussed its partnership with France and other countries to create an international solar alliance, in which 70 states already participate. The Maldives said partnerships have been instrumental for its lighthouse initiative.

Speaking on disasters, Malawi expressed how easily natural disasters can reduce progress made by LDCs. Armenia highlighted the role of information sharing in climate change disaster risk reduction. Mozambique discussed its master plan for disaster risk reduction that began in 2017 and ends in 2030. Mexico, Egypt, Malawi, Syria, Nepal, Brazil, Namibia, and Sierra Leone discussed environmental sustainability through biodiversity and renewable energy.

It briefly introduces sustainability and the SDGs, and poses questions to determine: sustainability awareness; which SDGs are of immediate concern to the survey’s respondents and their family; and an assessment of the situation related to chosen SDGs within the “past 12 months.” It also includes questions regarding: actions through which sustainability is taken into consideration, such as buying goods and services, child rearing and education, voting, food and nutrition, leisure activities, transportation and mobility; and actors that should take greater account of sustainability and that should push forward for SDG implementation at the country level.

The online survey was launched in September 2018, and will be accessible until March 2019. Results are expected to be publicly disclosed and discussed with representatives of all sectors.

We are one-fifth of our way towards 2030, but miles behind on achieving the lofty goals to reduce poverty, increase prosperity, protect the planet and advance peace.

There are worrying signs that the number of extremely poor people in the world – which has long been dropping – may stop falling and might even start rising. And after years of decline, hunger is increasing – with observers linking this to regional conflicts and climate change. Of most concern: the world’s development agenda, based around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is not fit for purpose.

The development agenda is flawed because it is the inevitable result of trying to be all things to all people. The highly successful Millennium Development Goals which preceded SDGs were short and sharp – and made a huge difference to global progress – yet were criticised for having been non-inclusive.

In response, the UN laudably invited a long list of players to create SDGs – but then failed to prioritise the Agenda to make it manageable and implementable.

Thus, vitally important targets – such as the eradication of all forms of malnutrition, and getting more boys and girls into school – are devalued by being placed on an equal footing with targets as peripheral and vague as promoting “sustainable tourism”, ensuring that people are informed about how to have “lifestyles in harmony with nature”, and creating more green spaces for “women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities”.

Faced with the impossibly long list, in three years only two countries – India and Germany – have made even a partial assessment of how much investment is required for the goals. The Agenda is woefully underfunded – one estimate shows $2.5 trillion more needed each year. Even if we spent all of the world’s development funding it would only get us 5% of the way. We really have to prioritise what we want first.

This was clear even when SDGs were being created. My thinktank, Copenhagen Consensus Center, analysed SDG targets in real time as they were drafted, and enlisted a panel of Nobel laureate economists to identify the most and least effective. Their findings make it clear what needs to be done. If we want to get out in front of increasing hunger, then we need to tackle the problem effectively.

Climate and peacekeeping policies are expensive and complex, and at best do very little to solve problems like hunger, even in relatively long time frames. Yet, cheap investments can be made in fixing micronutrient deficiencies in children, helping immensely and right now.

Investing an extra $8 billion annually in agricultural R&D would increase yields globally, generating more food at lower cost. It could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent 5 million cases of child malnourishment, with each dollar producing $35 of social benefits.

This has the added effect of helping the world’s poorest: the World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors.

Poverty has a simple solution: As in China, free trade can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Although Trump makes it harder, we have been dithering for much longer. We must revive the WTO’s Doha Round, which would lift 145 million people out of poverty by 2030. It could make the average person in the developing world $1,000 better off every year – allowing them to not only better feed themselves and their children, but also afford better health care, more education and lead more prosperous lives.

Improved agricultural yields and freer trade are two of 19 concrete, specific development targets that the Nobels identified to do the most, for every dollar invested, to help the world’s poorest, protect the environment, and improve billions of lives. Others include achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs. Focussing on these top 19 targets would achieve about four times more benefits than just thinly spreading funds among all 169 targets.

Because the UN didn’t prioritise when it created the SDGs, nations are making those choices themselves. The biggest risk is that their selection will not be based on which targets could do the most good, but on far more capricious measures such as which targets have more media-friendly images or the most NGO attention. There are some worrying signs.

A preliminary analysis by the OECD shows that rich nations are closest to reaching targets related to ‘Planet and Partnership’ – in other words, issues like climate, biodiversity and oceans. These are issues that fill a lot of column inches in newspapers, and are focussed on by the chattering classes. But global polls consistently show that people care much more about the areas where these countries are lagging behind: the economy, jobs and education, and peace. Three years into the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda, it is clear that we are trying to do too much – and failing to do enough that matters.

The document was signed by more than 120 scientists, and represents the most complete survey on the theme ever carried out in Brazil.

The press release notes that the Summary for Policymakers of the ‘First Brazilian Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Assessment’ was launched on 8 November 2018, nine days before the start of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in Egypt from 17-29 November, and two months before the new Brazilian president and State governors take office. The press release emphasizes that the launch marks “a moment as critical as appropriate for the sustainable development agenda in the international and domestic conjuncture,” given that Brazil is the holder of the greatest biodiversity on the planet and the country’s decline of biological wealth has a large impact beyond its borders.

The Summary for Policymakers aims to support decision making in the public and private spheres by outlining the main results consolidated in the First Assessment prepared by a group of more than 120 researchers gathered in the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BPBES).

The document mentions that the Brazilian territory hosts about 42,000 plant species and 9,000 vertebrate species, including high rates of endemism, and almost 130,000 invertebrate species known to science. Of these, 1,173 animal species and more than 2,118 plant species are endangered. According to the assessment, the country is home to 305 indigenous peoples, totaling almost 900,000 people speaking 274 languages. Five million Brazilians belong to traditional knowledge communities that occupy one fourth of the national territory. “Family agriculture” produces 70% of the food consumed by the Brazilian population, and 85 out of 141 economically important cultivated species depend on pollinators.

Contrary to the principles established in the Aichi Targets, Paris Agreement and SDGs, Brazil is systematically dismantling its environmental policy.

According to the authors of the ‘Diagnosis’ of the Assessment, governance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Brazil is “bipolar”: on the one hand, the country has strong and capable institutions; on the other, there are problems of infrastructure, slow processes, legal, social and ecological conflicts and inefficiency in actions. With regard to international agreements, the authors highlight that Brazil is a “protagonist abroad,” as was the case in Nagoya, when the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were agreed, and in the negotiations of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs. However, they stress, internally the country does exactly the contrary to the principles established in those agreements by “systematically dismantling its environmental policy.”

The Summary for Policymakers points out that the window of opportunity to consolidate the basis for a sustainable future in Brazil is limited. The text explains that this would require placing biodiversity and ecosystem services immediately at the center of the economic discussions, in a cross-cutting way, together with a discussion on how to mitigate the threatening drivers.

The Assessment comprises five chapters: introduction of the assessment, its conceptual framework and definitions; nature and quality of life; trends and impacts of drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem services degradation and restoration; current and future interactions between nature and society; and governance and decision-making options across scales and sectors. The assessment was developed in close consultations with representatives of the federal government, civil society, the private sector, and indigenous peoples.

Inspired by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), BPBES was created in 2015. It comprises an independent group of about 120 authors, including university professors, researchers, environmental managers, and decision makers. BPBES aims to produce periodic syntheses of the best available knowledge, generated by academic science and traditional knowledge, on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their relationship with human welfare. In doing so, the Platform is considering six continental biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, Campos Sulinos), as well as coastal and marine areas.

The agenda aims to support achievement of the CBD’s Vision of Living in Harmony with Nature by 2050.

Egypt, as the President of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, and China, as the future host of COP 15, launched, on 15 November, the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’ in collaboration with the CBD at the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is convening from 14-29 November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

The action agenda has three main objectives: to raise public awareness about the urgent need to stem biodiversity loss and restore biodiversity health for both humanity and the global ecosystem; to inspire and implement nature-based solutions to meet key global challenges; and to catalyze cooperative initiatives in support of global biodiversity goals. The action agenda will be hosted on an online platform that will receive and showcase commitments and contributions to biodiversity from stakeholders across all sectors in advance of COP 15, which will convene in Beijing, China, in 2020. This platform will enable the mapping of global biodiversity efforts, and help to identify key gaps and estimate impact.

The action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.

In explaining the rationale for the action agenda, the CBD states that humans have modified 77 percent of land on Earth, excluding Antarctica, an increase from 15 percent a century ago. Vertebrate populations have declined by 60 percent from 1970 levels, and the oceans have absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought, posing additional challenges to efforts to limit global warming. The CBD states that “we are rapidly destroying nature” but stresses that society has the knowledge and skills to change the current path and trajectory. Within this context, the action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship “from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.”

The action agenda will place special emphasis on the nature-climate-oceans-water-land nexus and action areas related to the SDGs. The initiative welcomes the announcements of additional initiatives to raise ambition in conservation, sustainable use and access and benefit sharing (ABS) and in mainstreaming conservation measures and biodiversity solutions across all sectors.

In March 2017, the Second International Conference on Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning adopted the ‘Joint Roadmap to Accelerate Maritime/Marine Spatial Planning Processes Worldwide.’ In the roadmap, the EC and IOC-UNESCO state their commitment to achieve SDG 14 (life below water) and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and stress the importance of promoting MSP at a global level as part of these efforts. The Roadmap defines five priority areas and strategic objectives and ten actions for mutual cooperation on MSP in support of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The initiative will disseminate lessons learned and best practices to inform current and future MSP.

The initiative contributes to priority five on building mutual understanding and communicating MSP as part of efforts to better understand MSP practices around the world and learn from exchange of views and best practices. Action ten focuses on creation of an international forum for MSP to “empower a new generation of planners, sectors, businesses and civil society to identify solutions and commit to cross-sectoral actions” to conserve oceans and use ocean resources in a sustainable way.

In support of this action, the three-year MSP initiative will develop guidance on international cross-border marine planning and conduct two pilot projects. One pilot project will be from the West Mediterranean (Algeria, France, Italy, Malta, Morocco, Spain and Tunisia) and the second pilot will focus on the Southeast Pacific, at the historical Bay of Guayaquil (Ecuador and Peru). Training activities in the Southeast Pacific pilot will also benefit Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru. The initiative will disseminate lessons learned and best practices to inform current and future MSP.

That is the main conclusion of a new analysis from consultancy giant PwC based on a survey of more than 700 companies across 21 countries and six sectors.

The poll found almost three quarters - 72 per cent - now mention the SDGs in their annual corporate or sustainability reports, marking a 10 percentage point increase compared to last year.

But the annual SDG survey found that while a significant number of companies have made SDG-related commitments since the goals were adopted in 2015, there remains a gap between firms' expressed intentions and their ability to embed the Goals into business strategies and then report on progress. This failure comes despite widely acknowledged estimates that building business strategies around the SDGs can unlock trillions of dollars in revenue opportunities and cost savings, PwC said.

The poll found just 28 per cent of companies disclosed meaningful key performance indicators related to the SDGs, 27 per cent mentioned SDGs as part of their business strategy, and only 19 per cent of CEO or Chair statements in annual reports mentioned the Goals.

And while 50 per cent of companies had identified priority SDGs for their business, PwC's average score for reporting quality for those companies stood at just 2.71 out of five.

Alan McGill, PwC's global sustainability reporting and assurance leader, said that whether or not companies are mentioning the SDGs in their business strategies and reporting on progress is a key indicator of whether change is being made at the level and scale necessary to achieve the Goals.

""Success with the SDGs depends on making them a central part of business strategy,"" he said. ""What is planned for, measured and reported in public filing is a good indicator of what is embedded in a businesses' strategy and priorities. Invariably that strategy is shaped at the very top of the organisation by CEOs and embedded with key performance indicators and reporting.

The Roadmap seeks to protect key jaguar corridors while also contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

The jaguar ranges across 18 countries in Latin America. As a result of habitat loss and fragmentation, human-jaguar conflict and illegal poaching, 50 percent of the jaguar’s original range has been lost, and the jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), successful jaguar conservation requires landscape planning and management in development and economic sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and infrastructure, to maintain biodiversity and connectivity. By conserving jaguars, conservation initiatives also maintain biodiversity, forests, carbon, watersheds and cultural and national heritage, and support achievement of the SDGs, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap for the Americas aims to strengthen the Jaguar Corridor, which ranges from Argentina to Mexico, by securing 30 priority jaguar conservation landscapes by 2030. The regional initiative will strengthen international cooperation and raise awareness on jaguar protection initiatives, such as connecting and promoting jaguar habitats, mitigating human-jaguar conflict and promoting sustainable development opportunities that support the well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities. The initiative also seeks to raise awareness on the jaguar’s role as a keystone species whose presence is indicative of a healthy ecosystem. The Roadmap outlines four strategic conservation pathways: coordinating at a range level to support protection and connectivity; developing and implementing range countries’ strategies and improving contributions to transboundary efforts; scaling up conservation-compatible sustainable development models in jaguar corridors; and enhancing the financial sustainability of systems and actions to conserve jaguars and their ecosystems.

UNDP Head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Midori Paxton, said the Jaguar Conservation Roadmap “represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs” and will help protect key jaguar corridors in ways that strengthen sustainable livelihoods for local communities and open up business opportunities for sustainable agriculture and ecotourism.

Also in support of jaguar conservation, the UNDP, Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and government representatives announced the creation of the first-ever Jaguar Day to raise awareness about threats facing the jaguar and conservation efforts in support of the species. The Day will be celebrated annually on 29 November.

The Roadmap’s release comes after a UN high-level forum that resulted in the launch of the ‘Jaguar 2030 New York Statement’ by 14 jaguar range countries and international conservation organizations.

The action plan is in line with IMO’s commitment to support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water).

The ‘IMO Action Plan to Address Marine Plastic Litter from Ships’ recognizes the wide range of land- and sea-based activities through which marine plastic litter enters the marine environment. The plan highlights the negative effects of large plastic items, small plastic particles and microplastics on biodiversity, marine life and human health. In addition, the plan states that marine plastic litter can negatively impact activities like fishing, shipping and tourism.

The plan recommends specific measures to: reduce marine plastic litter generated from, and retrieved by, fishing vessels; reduce shipping’s contribution to marine plastic litter; improve the effectiveness of port reception and facilities and treatment in reducing marine plastic litter; enhance public awareness, education and seafarer training; improve understanding of the contribution of ships to marine plastic litter; improve understanding of the regulatory framework associated with marine plastic litter from ships; strengthen international cooperation; and target technical cooperation and capacity building.

The action plan recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and UNEP.

The action plan identifies a number of specific measures to tackle marine litter and waste, such as promoting reporting the loss of fishing gear and facilitating the delivery of retrieved fishing gear to shore facilities. Other measures suggest: consideration of actions, such as making marking of fishing gear mandatory, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the establishment of a compulsory mechanism to declare loss of containers at sea and identify the number of losses; and reviewing provisions related to the training of fishing vessel personnel and seafarers to ensure awareness of the impact of marine litter.

In addition, the plan proposes: measures to increase awareness and understanding, including a proposed study on marine plastic litter from ships; looking into the availability and adequacy of port reception facilities; and enhancing public awareness on marine plastic litter. The action plan also recommends strengthening international cooperation, especially with FAO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), such as by making information available to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

The action plan will build on and complement existing mechanisms and legislation that address the discharge of waste and plastic in the sea. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) aims to prevent pollution from ships by prohibiting ships from discharging plastic into the sea and requiring governments to ensure adequate port reception facilities to receive ship waste. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention and Protocol) regulates what materials can be dumped at sea and what materials are not permitted. The Action Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The MEPC adopted the action plan at its 73rd session that convened in London, UK, from 22-26 October 2018.

The initiative will strengthen wildlife law enforcement at ports, and increase cooperation between ports and maritime stakeholders.

According to UNDP, illegal wildlife trafficking from Africa “has surged over the last ten years.” The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) reports that 403 tons of ivory were seized between 2007 and 2017, an amount equivalent to 54,460 killed elephants. The overwhelming majority of ivory is trafficked via the sea, where there is less risk of interception and arrest. Between 2007 and 2017, only one-third of wildlife seizures were made at exit ports in Africa and only 19 percent of all seizures have resulted in convictions. These statistics underscore the importance of targeting transit points and strengthening law enforcement to end incentives for wildlife poaching and stop the illegal trade in wildlife.

The initiative will build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The GEF-financed, World Bank-led Global Wildlife Program (GWP) will target two key African exit ports: Mombasa, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Traffickers regularly use these ports for illegal transportation of poached African wildlife to Asia, including elephant ivory, rhino horns and pangolins. The initiative will strengthen cooperation between key ports in Africa and Asia to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking. In partnership with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), the Royal Foundation, the Global Wildlife Program and others, it will raise awareness among port stakeholders on wildlife crime, and build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The initiative will also contribute to reaching SDG 15 (life on land) and target 15.7 in particular, which calls for taking urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and addressing both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products.

The US$2 million initiative will run for 36 months. The GEF launched the seven-year Global Wildlife Program in 2015. The Program brings together funding from a wide range of partners and works in a number of participating countries to counter wildlife poaching and trafficking.

203,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-indicator-group-sets-methodologies-for-all-but-44-indicators/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,SDG Indicator Group Sets Methodologies for All but 44 Indicators,"27 November 2018: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) reached agreement on measurement methodologies on several indicators. This agreement will allow for fuller measurement of several aspects of SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), as well as targets on sustainable food production, food waste, access to medicine, free primary and secondary education, market regulation, migration, sustainable urbanization, marine acidity, and organized crime, among others.

IAEG-SDGs 8 convened from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden, with one of the four days held in a closed format for IAEG members, and the other three days open to observers.

The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The framework was agreed on by the UN Statistical Commission and adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2017. The framework contains 232 indicators for measuring the 169 SDG targets.

Many of the indicators are still under development, and they are classified into three “tiers” to show their status: Tier I denotes that an indicator is both conceptually clear and available data exists for its measurement. A Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. If an indicator is classified as Tier III, it requires methodological development. Tier III indicators are not reflected in the annual SDG reports presented to the HLPF.

By the end of November 2018, following the meeting in Stockholm and subsequent discussions, the Group had agreed to reclassify the following indicators from Tier III to Tier II, reflecting agreement on the methodology for their measurement:

SDG 2 (zero hunger): Indicator 2.4.1 – Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (for Target 2.4 – Sustainable Food Production and Resilient Agricultural Practices) (target abbreviations per the Global Goals project);

SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing): Indicator 3.b.3 – Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (for Target 3.b – Support Research, Development and Universal Access to Affordable Vaccines and Medicines);

SDG 4 (quality education): Indicator 4.1.1 (a) – Proportion of children and young people in grades 2/3 (for Target 4.1 – Free Primary and Secondary Education);

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): Indicator 10.2.1 – Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 10.2 -Promote Universal Social, Economic and Political Inclusion); Indicator 10.5.1 – Financial Soundness Indicators (for Target 10.5 – Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions); Indicator 10.7.1 – Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination (for Target 10.7 – Responsible and Well-Managed Migration Policies); and Indicator 10.7.2 – Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (also for Target 10.7)

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): Indicator 11.3.2 – Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically (for Target 11.3 – Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization); and Indicator 11.7.1 – Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 11.7 – Provide Access to Safe and Inclusive Green and Public Spaces)

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): Indicator 12.3.1 (a) – Food loss index (for Target 12.3 – Halve Global Per Capita Food Waste)

SDG 14 (life below water): Indicator 14.3.1 – Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling station (for Target 14.3 – Reduce Ocean Acidification) (see SDG Knowledge Hub story on this indicator reclassification);

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): Indicator 16.4.2 – Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments (for Target 16.4 – Combat Organized Crime and Illicit Financial and Arms Flows); and Indicator 16.7.1 (a) Proportions of positions in national and local public institutions, including the legislature (for Target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making)



In addition, the Group reclassified six indicators from Tier II to Tier I, due to regular data production for these indicators. They correspond to SDG targets 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases); 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage) (2 indicators); 3.b (Support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines); 6.5 (Implement integrated water resources management) and 6.6 (Protect and restore water-related ecosystems).

For SDGs 12, 13 and 14, several indicators remain in Tier III. But for SDG 10, the reclassifications mean that only one indicator is Tier III.

As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:

Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);

Tier II: 82 indicators; and

Tier III: 44 indicators.

Six other indicators have components in different tiers.

Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III. Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;

SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; and

SDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III.

Among the remaining Tier III indicators, the following correspond to targets with a 2020 deadline:

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): Indicator 8.b.1 – Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy (for Target 8.b – By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization)

SDG 12: Indicator 12.2.1 – Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP (for Target 12.2 – By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources) Indicator 12.4.2 – Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment (for Target 12.4 – By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

SDG 13: Indicator 13.a.1 – Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment (for Target 13.a – Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible)

SDG 14: Indicator 14.2.1 – Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches (for Target 14.2 – By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans) Indicator 14.7.1 – Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries (for Target 14.7 – By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism)

SDG 15 (life on land): Indicator 15.9.1 – Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (for Target 15.9 – By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts)

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): Indicator 17.18.1 – Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (for Target 17.18 – By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts)



The Group plans to continue to reclassify indicators as requirements are met, considering them during semi-annual in-person meetings and bi-monthly teleconference meetings in between. The next tier reclassification web meetings will take place on 17 January and in early February 2019.

The next in-person IAEG meeting (March or April 2019) is expected to include the final progress review of Tier III indicators to determine whether any should be deleted. These will be included in a “preliminary list of possible deletions, replacements, adjustments and additions” for open consultation between May and July 2019 as part of the first “comprehensive review” of the global indicator framework. A list of 37 indicators under consideration for addition has been prepared.

The consultation results will be reviewed by September 2019, and a final proposal will be prepared for consideration by the UN Statistical Commission at its 51st meeting in March 2020. More details on the timeline of the comprehensive review are available here.

IAEG members stressed during the Stockholm meeting that the review should not lead to an additional burden on national statistical work, nor undermine the investments already made in national statistical systems.

The meeting also discussed: a minimum level of data disaggregation for each target and indicator; two proposed proxy indicators (for 11.a.1 and 12.b.1); and the draft guidelines on data flows and global data reporting.

The brief recommends that States with high levels of internal displacement address the needs of IDPs in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that countries include information on IDPs in their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

Authored by Alice Debarre, Archibald Henry and Masooma Rahmaty, IPI, the brief explores links between internal displacement and the SDGs, highlights ongoing efforts to address the longer-term needs of IDPs, looks at the specific cases of Nigeria and Iraq, and provides recommendations for ways forward. The brief titled, ‘Reaching Internally Displaced Persons to Achieve the 2030 Agenda,’ notes the need to understand international displacement as a long-term challenge that requires coordinated and complementary approaches by humanitarian and development actors.

The authors define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence… and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border,” in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 1998 by the UN Special Representative on IDPs and represent an international framework that “authoritatively restates the rights” of IDPs, as enshrined in international human rights and humanitarian law. The 30 principles cover IDPs’ needs during displacement, return, resettlement and reintegration, and have gained broad international acceptance and authority, although they were never officially adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The brief recalls that the 2030 Agenda pledges to “leave no one behind” and highlights IDPs as a vulnerable group that must be empowered through efforts to implement the SDGs. While there are no SDG targets or indicators specifically related to internal displacement, the brief notes, the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity to build on existing efforts and ensure that the plight of IDPs is addressed in both the short and long terms. It states that many of the SDGs are directly related to IDPs, and including IDPs in policies to implement the SDGs could help reduce the occurrence and impact of displacement and ensure that IDPs contribute to local economies and economic growth. In this regard, the authors report that Nigeria has included IDPs in its VNR, and linked the issue particularly with SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

The authors also remark that neither the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration nor the Global Compact for Refugees address the issue of internal displacement. They explain that some States perceive international attention to IDP issues as an infringement on their sovereignty and have therefore been reluctant to address it in multilateral fora.

The brief reports that, as of May 2018, there are over 40 million IDPs due to conflict and violence in the world, which is nearly twice the number of refugees worldwide. Also, since they are displaced within national borders, IDPs do not benefit from the legal status of refugees and its associated protections, and fall outside of the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Among other challenges to addressing IDPs’ needs, the authors note that the different funding streams of humanitarian and development actors and the existing field architecture for UN agencies inhibit efforts to operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus, while being not conducive to joint action or collective outcomes. The authors also cite inadequate collection, processing, and sharing of data on IDPs, and the fact that supporting IDPs is not traditionally perceived as a development issue and is insufficiently included in development strategy and planning.

On initiatives that have been taken at the international level regarding IDPs, the authors outline: the April 2018 launch of the multistakeholder ‘GP20 Plan of Action for Advancing Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People 2018– 2020;’ the development, by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), of a framework for addressing internal displacement; and the establishment, in 2018, of a UN Joint Steering Committee in charge of advancing humanitarian and development collaboration and assessing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, following the UN Secretary-General’s proposal to reform the UN development system.

The brief also notes that 37 States sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General in July 2018 asking him to appoint a high-level panel on IDPs in order to bring attention to existing efforts and galvanize continuing action.

205,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

206,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/indigenous-knowledge-and-epistemic-injustice-in-national-climate-planning/,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Indigenous Knowledge and Epistemic Injustice in National Climate Planning,"This week, global leaders assemble for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in the light of a groundbreaking report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In this report titled, ‘Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C’ (SR15), the IPCC identifies several synergies between addressing global climate change and limiting global warming, on the one hand, and the realization of sustainable development in general and the SDGs in particular, on the other hand. By pursuing sustainable development it will be possible, in other words, to address global climate change, itself one of the SGDs (Goal 13).

Indigenous knowledge and indigenous peoples have been explicitly recognized as essential to achieving the SGDs. Indigenous communities often hold knowledge about the local socioeconomic circumstances and traditional adaptation practices that are essential for the successful adaptation to climate change. For example, while increased rainfall contributes to soil degradation by washing out essential minerals, indigenous Bolivian farmers, having faced this issue for generations, address it by planting their crops on raised farms, which protects them from seasonal flooding. Conversely, where indigenous knowledge has been disregarded, problems have commonly arisen. In the Andes, for example, the introduction of genetically modified potatoes threatens the diversity of crops that holds a significant cultural importance for the indigenous population.

Yet, as the influential ‘State of the World’s Indigenous Peoples’ report shows, while some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have made great strides to include indigenous peoples in national climate deliberations, indigenous communities have too often been excluded from or underrepresented within efforts to translate international climate policies at a national level in many other places where governments are less open to dissent from their populations.

We believe that this exclusion and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples from national climate strategy deliberations is epistemic injustice. Someone is subject to epistemic injustice when they are being unfairly excluded, silenced or not taken seriously within a decision-making process. Living in fragile areas that are likely to be impacted the most by climatic changes, such as mountain regions, rainforests, coastal regions, and small island developing States (SIDS), many indigenous communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change. Hence, they have a special interest in implementing sustainable and responsive climate strategies that take their knowledge and interests into account. Excluding or underrepresenting indigenous communities within national climate deliberation unfairly disadvantages them in that regard.

Labeling the exclusion, silencing, and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples in these climate strategy deliberations “epistemic injustice” indicates that one of the main challenges to achieving SDG 13 (climate action) in indigenous communities, in particular, is one of representation and inclusion. How can this challenge be overcome?

First of all, it is important to recognize that many indigenous communities suffer from additional social, economic, and democratic inequalities and injustices that negatively influence their epistemic power to influence the agenda on climate change and climate adaptation. Hence, one way to enable and empower indigenous communities to be part of national climate strategy negotiations is indirectly through addressing structural and socioeconomic inequalities (SDG 10). In this way, epistemic power and socioeconomic equality are mutually reinforcing.

Second, it is important for indigenous peoples to organize in order to increase their voice. At the international level, this has been achieved through the establishment of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), which aims “to enhance the engagement of local communities and indigenous peoples in the UNFCCC process” through the exchange of knowledge and best practices on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Indigenous communities could use this example to create similar platforms and partnerships at the national and regional levels, which, in turn, could contribute to the achievement of SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

However, many governments actively seek to suppress indigenous peoples from protesting national policies that run counter to sustainable climate action. Consider, for example, the legal actions taken against the Ardoch Alonquin First Nation of Canada protesting against uranium mining on their lands or, more recently, the arrests of Native American and Native Canadian protesters of the Keystone XL oil pipeline that will run through indigenous lands and threaten contamination of essential and culturally important sources of water, putting the health of indigenous communities at risk. The third recommendation is therefore for the international community to put pressure on governments and businesses to end exploitation and oppression of indigenous communities through the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies through the strengthening of a rule of law (SDG 16).

Most fundamentally, fourth, it is necessary to recognize the equal rights and voices of indigenous peoples as equal stakeholders in addressing climate change and to resist stereotypes of indigenous peoples and their knowledge as “primitive.” One of the greatest challenges to harness indigenous knowledge for climate action is still the perception that indigenous peoples are less knowledgeable than, say, scientific experts. More effort through the means identified above must be put into breaking this misconception to show that indigenous peoples, while some of the most vulnerable to climate change, possess valuable knowledge about sustainable and responsive climate strategies, which can and should be utilized in the development of national climate adaptation strategies.

207,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-administrator-updates-member-states-on-resident-coordinator-system-reforms/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Administrator Updates Member States on Resident Coordinator System Reforms,"14 November 2018: Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, briefed UN Member States on the reforms to the UN development system at a meeting of UNDP’s executive board. He described UNDP’s work with the UN Secretary-General’s transition team to ensure that the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019.



Among Steiner’s updates was the announcement that the transition of the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) was completed on 1 November 2018, and DOCO is now part of the Secretariat, with funding from UNDP and its current configuration until June 2019 in order to ensure a smooth transition.

Steiner said the system went through an exercise to determine how many of the current 129 Resident Coordinators (RC) want to remain RCs, and how many want to return to UNDP or their originating agencies. The exercise was completed at the end of September 2018, with 117 of them choosing to remain RCs. Thus the “lift and shift” operation will consist of moving 90% of the current RCs from UNDP to the Secretariat. He said this implies developing a service level agreement that will cover a second request by the Secretary-General, comprised of: putting in place an infrastructure to allow the RCs to operate on 1 January 2019; helping staff their offices in 129 countries; and setting the payroll for the 129 RCs and 1,200 RC offices and DOCO staff that form the new RC system.

Steiner reported that this operation will cost UNDP US$2.6 million, and emphasized the need to ensure sufficient funding for the Secretariat to support the new structure moving forward. He said the cost of the contribution to the RC system by UNDP will be US$10.3 million.

“Everything is happening as we speak,” Steiner noted, with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) currently developing new job descriptions for the RCs, as well as the mutual accountability framework between RCs and the UN country teams. This exercise is being conducted as a collaboration between UNDP, the UN Secretariat, and the transition team, Steiner said. He added that interim protocols and internal control frameworks are also needed for the process to delink the RCs from UNDP.

Steiner also flagged the required “unprecedented exercise” of replacing the 117 UNDP country resident representatives, since the current RCs have been playing that role. He said that UNDP has had four months to identify and appoint the new resident representatives by the end of 2018. He reported that in one month of advertising the openings, UNDP received 3,500 applications, and 195 candidates are currently shortlisted. He saluted the fact that 22% of the candidates are from Africa.

Steiner noted that UNDP is coming from “an extremely contractive period,” in which it was in deficit while Member States’ contributions were at a historical low, and hundreds of posts were frozen or eliminated; the total staff decreased by 1,000 of its total of 8,000 between 2012 and 2017. Currently, UNDP is increasing at a rate of 6-9% per annum, and replacing its pyramidal structure with a “21st century” global policy expertise network, which will be rolled out starting 1 January 2019. Steiner said more resources are going to Africa and the Arab states in conflict, UNDP is reducing operational costs while delivering more, and it is “delivering on the promises for the UN development system reform.”

Steiner added that UNDP is exceeding delivery on all its six of its “signature solutions” in 2018, and anticipated having one of the highest rates of delivery in the history of the UN.

In the ensuing discussion, Member States asked whether UNDP or the RC will play the integrative role for the UN presence in countries (Albania), inquired about the timeline for new appointments to be discussed with host governments (El Salvador), asked about an internal communication strategy for UNDP’s new relationship with other UN agencies on the ground (Switzerland), asked what the impact will be on multi-country offices (Antigua and Barbuda), and requested information on plans for private sector partnerships (Netherlands, Sweden and US).

Steiner said UNDP will move away from coordinating UN agencies’ activity on the ground. He emphasized that the role of the RC is not to implement the SDGs, but to coordinate SDG implementation on the ground, and UNDP will support the RCs when requested. He explained that UNDP’s integrative platform is an offer, with the agencies on the ground and the RCs to decide if or when to use it. He clarified that UNDP’s principal role is not to serve as the integrative platform for the UN system but provide the development support.

The UNDP Administrator said the appointment letters for the RCs were to be sent to countries in November 2018. He also added that no major changes will be made to the current composition of the UNDP country teams.

The “new vision for the Resident Coordinator” is outlined on the UN’s reform website, which also provides other information on the repositioning of the UN development system, overall. An update on the status of the reforms can be found in this policy brief from September 2018, and a summary of the Secretary-General’s September briefing on RC system reform is available here.

208,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

209,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/bangladesh-un-consider-expected-ldc-graduation-in-2024/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Bangladesh, UN Consider Expected LDC Graduation in 2024","14 December 2018: The challenges and benefits related to graduating from the least developed countries (LDCs) category were the focus of an event organized by the UN Office of the UN High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) and the Secretariat of the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP). The event also highlighted a recently published book on Bangladesh’s expected graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

LDCs are characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures are needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries. Currently 47 countries are part of the LDC category.

If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria again in 2021, it will be recommended for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

Decisions on inclusion into, and graduation from, the list of LDCs are made by the UNGA based on recommendations by the CDP that are endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The CDP, a subsidiary advisory body of ECOSOC and composed of 24 members, analyzes the list of LDCs every three years during triennial reviews to identify any countries that may qualify for inclusion into or graduation from the LDC category. In March 2018, the CDP found that Bangladesh met the criteria for graduation for the first time. If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria for a second time, at the next triennial review in 2021, the CDP will recommend it for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

The book titled, ‘Bangladesh’s Graduation from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Group: Pitfalls and Promises,’ explores, inter alia: the issues of moving out of the LDC category; the structural transformation of Bangladesh’s economy and smooth transition after graduation; prospects, challenges and strategies related to Bangladesh’s “sustainable graduation”; and whether Bangladesh’s pursuit of the 2030 Agenda will facilitate a smooth transition after LDC graduation. The book was authored by several experts and edited by Debapriya Bhattacharya, Centre for Policy Dialogue, who will serve as a CDP member starting in January 2019. It was published in October 2018.

During the event, Bhattacharya said that if Bangladesh graduates, it will be one of the first large LDCs to do so, and it is the first country to meet all three graduation thresholds of the LDC criteria, namely gross national income (GNI) per capita, human assets index (HAI) and economic vulnerability index (EVI). He noted that Bangladesh is characterized by a “double transition” since, in addition to its expected graduation from the LDC category in 2024, it transitioned from a low-income country to a lower-middle-income country in 2015.

Bhattacharya said advancing towards the SDGs will contribute to a smoother and more sustainable transition from the LDC category, and that 16 out of the 17 Goals are linked to graduation criteria. He called for a universal regime that will support graduating countries towards a smooth transition, especially in the areas of: access to concessional finance; trade, including access to markets; access to climate finance and climate facility; and flexibility of implementation of intellectual protection regimes under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

Roland Mollerus, CDP Secretariat, reported that since 1971, five LDCs have graduated from the LDC category, namely: Botswana, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, the Maldives, and Samoa. He said five additional LDCs should graduate by 2024. Those are: Vanuatu (graduation in 2020); Angola (graduation in 2021); Bhutan (graduation in 2023), São Tomé and Príncipe (graduation in 2024); and Solomon Islands (graduation in 2024).

Masud Bin Momen, Permanent Representative of Bangladesh, said graduation from the LDC category is an important milestone for Bangladesh’s pursuit of development. He noted that the graduation process is happening at a time when the world is witnessing fundamental changes, including in terms of rising nationalism, and that protectionist measures could create strong disincentives for graduating countries. He remarked that the book is “very timely,” considering that his government has commissioned a study to assess the impact of graduation for Bangladesh and to suggest practical solutions for a smooth transition.

Perks Master Ligoya, Permanent Representative of Malawi, which is assuming the chairmanship of the LDC group from 2018-2021, underlined Bangladesh’s high degree of vulnerability due climate change impacts, natural disasters, and the Rohingya refugee crisis, among other factors. He said the period following graduation will be challenging for Bangladesh as the country will lose specific support measures. Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, The New School and CDP, welcomed the book’s analysis of the costs of graduation, and underlined the importance of climate finance and technology access for graduating and other countries.

A draft UNGA resolution on following up on the UN’s LDC conference held in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011, was approved by the UNGA’s Second Committee in December 2018. Ligoya remarked that the resolution invites all development partners to strengthen their support for graduation and smooth transition toward graduating and recently graduated countries.

Heidi Schroderus-Fox, OHRLLS, noted the creation of the UN Task Force on Graduation and Smooth Transition, which brings together representatives from various UN entities. The Task Force discusses graduation issues as well as concrete ways in which in the UN System can provide support to the graduating countries.

On 27 November, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the ‘Handbook on the Least Developed Country Category: Inclusion, Graduation and Special Support Measures’ examining, among other issues, criteria and procedures for inclusion and graduation, and international support measures for the LDCs. [Publication: ‘Bangladesh’s Graduation from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Group: Pitfalls and Promises’] [CDP Website] [OHRLLS Website] [SDG Knowledge Hub sources]","The event also highlighted a recently published book on Bangladesh’s expected graduation from the LDC category in 2024.
If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria again in 2021, it will be recommended for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.
If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria for a second time, at the next triennial review in 2021, the CDP will recommend it for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

The conference, hosted by the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), also considered the 2018 Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Italy’s SDG Cities Index report.

The Conference on local leadership for sustainability (‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: la leadership locale come motore dello sviluppo’) took place on 29 November 2019, at FEEM, SDSN Italy’s host institution, in Milan, Italy.

Italy’s SDG Cities Index report seeks to guide local policymakers in further aligning municipal initiatives with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Presenting the report, Laura Cavalli, FEEM and SDSN Italy, remarked that about 75% of Italy’s population lives in urban areas, and that the Index could serve as an analytical planning tool for cities to encourage reflection on ways to address population growth and achieve the SDGs, according to the summary of the event.

The report titled, ‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: l’SDSN Italia SDGs City Index 2018,’ currently available in Italian, examines SDG implementation in Italy’s municipalities. It features indicators specific to the Italian context, which can be used to monitor and measure SDG progress at the sub-national level. It examines 101 municipalities on 16 of the 17 SDGs, using 39 statistical indicators. The Index excludes SDG 14 (life below water) for comparability reasons.

Per the summary of the conference, the report finds that Italian cities have achieved approximately 53% of the SDG targets. Out of the 101 cities analyzed, none has “reached more than 80 per cent of overall achievement” on the SDGs.

The Italian SDG City Index was initially presented during a two-week festival on sustainable development organized by the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile – ASviS) and other stakeholders, from 25 May to 7 June 2018, which took place across Italy.

211,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-spotlight-on-green-growth-and-investment-in-africa/,"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Spotlight on Green Growth and Investment in Africa,"As Isaiah Esipisu laments in an article on IPS News, African media was “poorly represented” at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, which closed in the wee hours of Sunday, 16 December. As a contribution to correcting this shortcoming, this issue of SDG Knowledge Weekly focuses on the newsworthy, Africa-related events that took place and knowledge products that were released around the COP.

The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) previewed findings from a joint assessment of Africa’s “Green Growth Readiness” at a COP 24 side event on 10 December 2018. Through case studies from Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia, the assessment covers: the current state of green growth in Africa; readiness to promote green growth in the context of SDG implementation; and roles of development partners (including AfDB and GGGI) in promoting green growth in the context of implementing the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. An IPS News article reports that the study found urgent needs around finance, as well as the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth.

Also on green growth, the Government of Rwanda hosted the inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum, which took place in Kigali, from 26-30 November 2018, under the theme: ‘For a green and climate resilient Africa.’ The agenda highlights the timing of the Forum just prior to COP 24, noting that the discussions will serve as an input to the discussions in Poland. Among the many speeches and presentations available, Anthony Nyong, AfDB, highlights investing in green growth in Africa. Among other topics, he describes AfDB tools and investment opportunities in the agriculture and energy sectors, barriers to adoption of green growth technologies, and lessons learned at country level.

A regional NDC hub for African countries was launched “to engage national, sub-national, non-state actors and private sector representatives on appropriate policies, strategies and actions tailored to suit individual needs of African countries to enable them deliver their climate change commitments.” The Hub, which AfDB established in November 2017, focuses on three main areas: long-term climate action; mobilizing means of implementation; and coordination, advocacy and partnerships.

An AfDB brochure summarizes the Hub’s purposes, goals and intended outcomes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities, barriers to success and financial needs for fully realizing countries’ NDC targets, laying out a roadmap for achievement. In support of these objectives, AfDB and partners held discussions at COP 24 on encouraging cooperation across regional NDC hubs and operationalizing NDCs in Africa. A compilation of AfDB publications released prior to and in the margins of COP 24 is available here.

Many African countries “already live the future” of a two degrees warmer planet.

Despite progress on NDC implementation, a second article by Isaiah Esipisu on IPS News notes that many African countries “already live the future” of a scenario where the planet has warmed by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Responding to questions by Esipisu, Gernot Laganda, World Food Programme (WFP), stresses that climate change is already affecting food security, noting that the number of hungry people is increasing and extreme weather events continually drag people back into poverty. Agriculture-based economies, such as those in Africa, feel the effects of climate change most acutely, he explains, adding that one consequence of climate change is migration, which “is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism.”

Echoing Laganda’s point on migration, Gilbert Houngbo, President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasizes the need to “invest in Africa’s youth before migration to Europe doubles,” as reported by Hannah Summers in The Guardian. Houngbo flags the importance of investment in sustainable farming on the continent, but acknowledges that more is needed: “priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare.” He also describes access to modern technology as being essential for young people and outlines the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment in rural areas. All are key to ensuring food security and profitability of smallholder farms, which can stem migration flows.

The key, as highlighted by Houngbo above, is investment. The Brookings Institution’s Landry Signé and Witney Schneidman reflect on the inaugural Africa Investment Forum, held from 7-9 November 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Forum, they note, was convened with the aim of “unlocking Africa’s investment potential by facilitating onsite transactions.” While the Forum previewed over 230 projects across 15 sectors and announced investment interest in 49 projects worth US$38.7 billion, Signé and Schneidman note that lower business costs through better business regulations and special economic zones are needed, lest the deals face challenges to implementation and long-term sustainability.

The African Economic Conference was held from 3-5 December 2018, in Kigali, Rwanda. Convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the conference took place on the theme ‘regional and continental integration for Africa’s development,’ building on the March 2018 commitment of 44 African countries to a common market for Africa, known as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the earlier launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016. Supporting papers cover information and communications technology (ICT), economic integration’s impacts on the environment, regional integration versus bilateral diplomacy, food security, gender equality and energy, among other topics. Numerous UNECA press releases on these subjects are also available.

During the conference, UNECA launched the 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report, which tracks the continent’s progress towards both the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063. The report aligns with the theme of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)— “transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies”—focusing on the five SDGs reviewed: 6 (clean water and sanitation); 7 (affordable and clean energy); 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 15 (life on land). A detailed write-up on the report’s findings against each Goal is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Finally, the Intra-African Trade Fair 2018 was held 11-17 December 2018, in Cairo, Egypt. Hosted by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the Fair aimed to bring African businesses together to share information and explore opportunities on the continent. The Afreximbank convened the Fair in part due to low rates of trade within Africa, attributed in part to lack of access to trade and market information.

212,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

213,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-promotes-technological-developments-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Promotes Technological Developments for SDGs,"7 December 2018: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution asking key UN bodies for updated findings on the impact of key technological changes vis-a-vis the 2030 Agenda, for discussion at the fourth annual UN Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum). The UN also recently announced that over half the world is using the internet, held a high-level briefing on frontier technologies for sustainable development, and convened a forum on internet governance.

In June 2018, the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), presented initial findings on ways in which technology can support the SDGs, during the third STI Forum. The UNGA resolution adopted on 22 November 2018 (A/RES/73/17) requests the two bodies to update their findings, invites them to strengthen their synergies and mutually reinforce their work on STI, and requests the Secretariat to avoid overlapping meeting dates to further increase coherence. The fourth STI Forum will take place from 14-15 May 2019. Looking ahead to the UNGA’s 74th session, the resolution also invites the UNGA President to convene a high-level thematic debate to take stock of progress on the topic.

Presenting the draft resolution, Juan José Gómez Camacho, Mexico, said new technologies “can change the destinies of nations.” He called for the consideration of technological change in the next follow-up and review cycle on SDG implementation, given the opportunities presented by new technologies, as well as the fact that their impacts will depend on governments’ ability “to come together and cooperate on realizing a global vision.”

On 7 December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) announced that more than half of the world’s population will be using the internet at 2018’s end. ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao noted that the milestone “represents an important step towards a more inclusive global information society.” Despite ITU highlighting that 96% of global society now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, Zhao underscored that many are still waiting to experience the gains associated with internet access or a digital economy. With near-global coverage and the fastest rates of growth taking place in Africa, the impact of the internet on society is only expected to increase.

AI algorithms must shed human biases, participants stressed at the 2018 Internet Governance Forum.

In November, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brought together more than 3,000 participants at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on the theme ‘Internet of Trust.’ Key messages are available on the Forum’s eight major topics:

Cybersecurity, Trust & Privacy;

Development, Innovation & Economic Issues;

Digital Inclusion & Accessibility;

Emerging Technologies;

Evolution of Internet Governance;

Human Rights, Gender & Youth;

Media & Content; and

Technical & Operational Topics.

The Chair’s Summary underscores the cross-cutting nature of new technologies, noting that governance of the internet must be both multistakeholder and multidisciplinary to ensure that systems do not discriminate and that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms shed human biases. [UN Press Release] [IGF Homepage]

The IGF is convened annually by the UN Secretary-General, and this year, was hosted by the Government of France. In his remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron launched the ‘Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described opportunities afforded by the digital world, but also advised vigilance. Recognizing that traditional forms of regulation do not necessarily apply to the new challenges that have accompanied the digital era, Guterres noted the emergence of potential issues around cybersecurity, data and instances of “the Internet being used as a platform for hate speech, for repression, censorship, and control.” Guterres emphasized the need to create a shared language, calling for a dedicated effort to include and amplify weak or missing voices.

Next year’s IGF will be hosted by the Government of Germany. An advisory group containing 52 members has been appointed to lead preparations. [UN News Release]

Also in November, the World Web Summit 2018 took place in Lisbon, Portugal, bringing together approximately 70,000 attendees. The 24 discussion tracks ranged from autonomous vehicles to cryptocurrencies to health. Guterres described the web as having the potential to turbocharge the world’s progress towards the SDGs, saying the UN itself is utilizing technologies to enhance impacts and achieve its goals. He also raised concerns on uneven social impacts, the spread of hate speech as noted at the IGF, and the weaponization of artificial intelligence.

An event titled ‘High-level Briefing on Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development: Findings from the World Economic and Social Survey 2018’ took place on 1 November 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Moderated by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, the event reviewed findings from the 2018 survey, a common message of which is that “technology is neither exogenous nor neutral,” meaning that societal needs and policy prerogatives must guide the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies. The survey and event highlighted national-level policy measures that can maximize technologies’ potential while mitigating risks, taking economic efficiency, equity and ethical considerations into account.

214,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/gentle-rain-from-heaven/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Gentle Rain from Heaven,"Do you recall Shakespeare’s masterpiece, ‘The Merchant of Venice?’ The story is set in the 16th century “Floating City.” Although past its heyday, it is still teeming with wealthy merchants making huge gains from silk or spice trade. Antonio, one of those wealthy merchants, has defaulted on his loan because he lost his ships at sea. His moneylender, Shylock, is pursuing his debts, asking for a pound of flesh.

It was around this time that insurance as we know it was invented, developed as a mechanism particularly in response to the needs of merchants – not necessarily to protect their flesh, but to protect their wealth, in case ships were lost to pirates or storms.

From the 16th to the 21st Century

Fast forward more than 400 years, the insurance industry has expanded and evolved.

Insurance is now available to us in many forms. We are all acquainted with life, health and home insurance. Those making a living from agriculture are also familiar with crop insurance, available to safeguard against the unexpected arrival (or not) of rain.

Yet while it is more widespread, it not yet universal. Just as many people in developed countries cannot imagine life without it, it continues to be out of reach for many, including farmers in developing countries.

Take the Philippines, one of the countries I have worked closely with over the last five years. Here, only 6 and 3 percent of rice and corn farmers, respectively, are protected by insurance. Probably the Venetian merchants of yore were more protected than Filipino farmers today.

Pursuing Protection for the Most Vulnerable

The question is how do we extend coverage to those who need it most? Essentially, we need to innovate.

In the Philippines, the Government and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) are doing just this: between 2014 and 2017, we tested a form of crop insurance accessible and affordable specifically for poor farmers: weather index-based insurance, or ‘WIBI’.

Under the project, financed by the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) established under the UNFCCC, WIBI was delivered to more than 2,000 farmers. Put simply, instead of payments contingent on damage verification by insurance agents (often months after an event), payments were automatically made within five days of rainfall being registered as too much or too little.

This short animation explains why crop insurance has traditionally been inaccessible for such farmers, why WIBI is considered a promising alternative and what we achieved.

Not There Yet

What were the results? Some 2,413 farmers signed up for a WIBI policy. Over the course of three years, 178 of those received payouts, totaling nearly US$30,000. Importantly, the recipients received payouts within five days, proving the advantage of WIBI over traditional insurance. The fast payouts enabled them to re-start planting activities in the same cropping cycle. This is critical as most farmers take out loans to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and a bad harvest immediately puts them in debt.

Does this mean that WIBI will replace traditional insurance? I don’t think so. During implementation, we also learned about the inherent shortcomings of WIBI, the biggest of which is the fact it only covers damage related to rainfall. It does not cover pests and diseases, which rice farmers report as an equally big risks for production.

In addition, the concept of WIBI is extremely difficult for farmers to understand. While traditional insurance is pretty intuitive – any damages on a farm, once verified by an insurance agent, will be compensated, whether they are due to pests, diseases or rainfall – compensation under WIBI is determined by whether the right amount of rain falls in the various stages of a crop’s growth. Yet farmers often don’t know how many millimeters of rain are required in different stages for good harvests, creating confusion as to eligibility.

Many of us can probably empathize. I certainly cannot explain what kind of coverage I have under my health insurance.

Where to Now?

Our work with the Government of the Philippines yielded some important findings: neither WIBI nor traditional insurance has the kind of versatility to make it attractive for poor farmers; and we need to be prepared to evolve different models and means of delivering insurance.

Efforts are underway. Recent technological advancements are reducing the time-consuming payout process of traditional insurance. For example, some are testing the use of photos taken by farmers themselves with their mobile phones for verifying damages. Meanwhile, satellite images, which are becoming cheaper and more precise, are also being used to verify damages on the ground.

Our work also highlighted fundamental questions about how best to protect poor farmers. Should countries invest their finite resources in developing better insurance products as we tried to do with the Government of the Philippines? Or should the same resources be used in educating farmers for pests and disease management, or in irrigation development so that insurance is not needed in the first place? Although the concept of crop insurance is gaining currency in developing countries, these questions are hardly asked, and the conundrums remain unresolved.

Gentle Rain No Longer Drops from Heaven

Returning to ‘The Merchant of Venice.’ The finale nears when Portia makes a plea to the moneylender Shylock to show mercy:

The quality of mercy is not strained;

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven;

Upon the place beneath…

(Act 4, Scene 1)

In the end, Antonio is saved. He also learns that his ships returned safely.

Farmers are not so lucky. If they have to default on their loans because of bad harvests, their lives must go on. There is no Portia to make a plea for them.

World leaders meet again in Katowice, Poland, this month to agree on the rulebook for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as promised in the landmark Paris Agreement three years ago but effective climate action does not appear to be in sight yet. As another year goes by with GHG emissions unabated, the quality of mercy seems to be strained as the gentle rain no longer drops from heaven.

LPL teams RNG, WE, LGD Gaming, Snake, and OMG have built their home venues in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Xi’an, Hangzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu

The LPL uses a franchise system similar to the NBA—teams can bid for franchises, and the team uniforms are standardized across the league. Multiple brands signed sponsorship deals for the LPL 2018 season, including Mercedes-Benz, Doritos, Intel, HP, and L’Oreal Men Expert. The Esports Observer recently reported that sportswear brand Nike is currently negotiating an apparel sponsorship deal with the LPL.

2018 has seen multiple competitive achievements for China’s League of Legends scene. The national Chinese League of Legends team won the golden medal at the Jakarta Asian Games exhibition event. Chinese esports organization Invictus Gaming (IG) became the first team from the region to win a League of Legends World Championship, while RNG won the mid-season invitational.","Tencent announced that two esports organizations, SinoDragon Gaming (SDG) and Victory Five (V5), will join China’s League of Legends Pro League (LPL) 2019 season.

216,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/behavioral-and-cognitive-approaches-to-biodiversity-conservation/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches to Biodiversity Conservation,"It was quite intriguing to read an article that explains how a sign that sought to promote awareness in conservation, had in fact worked against conservation. A sign was put up in a peatland forest in Arizona, US, to deter people from stealing from the forest. It read as follows: “Many past visitors have removed petrified wood from this park, destroying the natural state of the petrified forest.” Months later, when a review was done on the impact of this sign and pilferage from the forest, researchers were astonished to find that stealing had tripled.

A behavioral science perspective on how people perceived the sign suggests that people must have thought that “since others have done it, it is alright to continue doing so.” This is a startling finding for a conservation expert who never thought of this angle in conservation.

Let me give you another example. A recent World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report cites a 60 percent loss of biodiversity globally since 1970 in spite of billions of dollars spent on conservation and dozens of global political commitments. For the common man on the street, the message is simple: we have lost 60 percent of biodiversity but I am not feeling any immediate impacts. My needs are still met, I am wealthier, consume better and invest in issues of my choice. There is no great famine, no large death toll, no economic downturn that I can see in front of my eyes.

I know this is a provocative statement to make but this is more or less what is happening in our conversations about conservation. In a book titled, ‘The Death of Environmentalism,’ the author states that the word “warming” in “global warming” “feels good” for some people. Similarly, in conservation, declining biodiversity is still not seen as a threat to our survival by non-conservationists, including the general public.

My recent research into cognitive and behavioral thinking led to me to look for uncommon answers to the way we are communicating about conservation and its importance. A few thousand delegates who convene once every two years to have heated discussions on why we are losing in our actions to protect biodiversity and what we can do to improve the situation has not helped us in the recent decades.

Looking at cognitive science, I came across an interesting set of experiences from the advertising industry on how the industry captures people’s attention and imagination to push their agenda. Two specific examples are of relevance to how we advance the biodiversity agenda using cognition: social proofing; and communicating impacts of our actions.

Social Proofing Our Message

In an article published in the Wall Street Journal on turning consumers green, the author notes that there was more response to the sign that said neighbors are actively using the options to go green than to those that mention how much money one can save, how responsible one could be towards the environment or to what extent this is a moral obligation.

Reported progress on biodiversity conservation and climate change suggests that few are aware of this. Having reviewed all the national reports to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted by States until 2018, it is clear that almost all of them address what governments are doing for conservation but there is very little information on what others, including civil society, business community, UN agencies and academic institutions, are contributing. This is a major disconnect, which disincentivizes people from partnering in conservation. Few environment ministries’ web portals, united in the network of national Clearing-House Mechanisms, highlight successes of these stakeholders.

For the post-2020 biodiversity framework, we need to social proof the strategic plan and targets. Merely reporting that these are developed in a participatory manner through a few workshops and consultations will not do.

Communicating Impacts of Our Actions

We all know that in spite of all our efforts the environment is getting from bad to worse. All the investments are yet to give us impactful results, and we are struggling to make the “big breakthrough.” In this context, it is important to be cautious with our messages about challenges and failures.

It is alright to admit to failures, but environmental managers need to ensure that the message is communicated in a manner that clarifies the reasons for failure better. Additionally, the more the common man feels the guilt for their own actions, the better the chances for behavioral change. This, however, would require workable solutions.

Take the example of a 1962 advertisement by David & Goliath for the car rental company Avis that was far behind Hertz in brand popularity. It stated: “When you’re only number two you try harder. Or Else.” The advertisement increased Avis’s annual profit by US$1.2 million in a decade, and the company ran it for 50 years.

Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches in the Post-2020 Framework and 2030 Agenda

The 2010 Biodiversity Target was met only partially, and there are indications that the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be achieved in their entirety. At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Beijing, China, governments will face the challenging task of upholding people’s confidence in multilateral approaches to and national actions on saving biodiversity.

Conservation could benefit from cognitive and behavioral approaches now more than ever before. These approaches could help achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as well as SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 14 (life below water). This is the main message from a side event FLEDGE organized during the CBD COP 14 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The examples and approaches outlined in this article resonated with many countries who suggested actions towards behavioral change. It is our hope that countries will explore these options further as we develop the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

217,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-votes-to-endorse-marrakech-compact-on-migration/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Votes to Endorse Marrakech Compact on Migration,"19 December 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has endorsed the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, also known as the Marrakech Compact on Migration, by a vote. Noting that there are more than 250 million migrants around the world, UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés stressed the need to take action, and clarified that the Compact does not affect the sovereignty of any State but, on the contrary, reinforces it since no State, “no matter how powerful,” can solve by its own means the challenges of international migration.

The Marrakech Compact on Migration was adopted during the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration that took place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 10-11 December 2018. The adoption of the Compact followed intergovernmental consultations led by the delegations of Mexico and Switzerland, which culminated in informal agreement on the text among Member States in July 2018. At the Marrakech conference, 164 UN Member States joined the Compact’s adoption.

After this adoption, the Compact was submitted for UNGA endorsement through draft resolution A/73/L.66 titled ‘Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.’ In the draft resolution, the UNGA: recalls resolution A/71/1 of 19 September 2016 in which it decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact as well as other related resolutions; expresses its gratitude to Morocco for hosting the Marrakech conference; and endorses the Global Compact on Migration adopted by the intergovernmental conference.

The endorsement of the Compact took place during a plenary meeting of the UNGA on 19 December 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Voting in favor of the resolution were 152 Member States, while five voted against it (Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Poland and US) and 12 abstained (Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Romania, Singapore and Switzerland). In addition, 24 Member States were not present to take part in the vote.

Addressing the UNGA before Member States took action, Espinosa remarked that the content of the Compact is the result of a broad and intense process of intergovernmental negotiations, and reflects the will of States to address, in a joint manner and with a balanced and integral vision, a complex challenge which is both cross-border and global. She also said the UNGA’s endorsement will allow to: reduce vulnerabilities in migration; address the needs of the communities of origin, transit and destination; fight discrimination and the negative rhetoric against migrants; foster the empowerment of migrants and the communities that take them in; facilitate migrants’ access to decent labor; and contribute to a safe and dignified return and readmission. During the plenary meeting, 43 countries took the floor during the plenary meeting to make statements on their respective votes.

In a statement issued on the day of the endorsement, the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, noted the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. He said the agreement: calls for greater solidarity with migrants in situations of “appalling vulnerability and abuse;” underscores the need to anticipate future trends, from labour markets to the impacts of climate change; and highlights the imperative of devising more legal pathways for migration, which would also help to crack down on trafficking and exploitation.

The UN Network on Migration also issued a statement to welcome the formal endorsement of the Compact. The statement notes that the UN system is committed to support the implementation of the Global Compact, and, through the Network, will help strengthen the benefits of migration and address its “many challenges.” The UN Network on Migration was established at the request of the UN Secretary-General, and currently comprises 38 entities from the UN system. The Network is coordinated by the Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with strategic oversight provided by an Executive Committee composed of eight UN entities.

In addition to the endorsement of the Marrakech Compact on Migration, the UNGA adopted, on 17 December, the Global Compact on Refugees. Both Compacts were called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants adopted by the UNGA in 2016.

218,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/afforestation-increases-water-supply-but-only-with-these-considerations/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Afforestation Increases Water Supply – But Only with These Considerations,"With increasing needs for water and food security and rapid urbanisation resulting from a booming global population, forests maintenance and development face great competition with other priorities. While we are losing forest resources at a high rate globally, afforestation efforts are made in some regions to offset this adverse effect.

Afforestation is the preferred measure for policymakers to solve a range of ecological problems, as it is generally believed that forests help to improve soil health and quality, reverse land degradation, halt land desertification, and provide clean water through an intensified water cycle. Especially within the context of SDG 15 (life on land), does afforestation always have a positive effect? The answer is ‘no,’ at least not always for water provision. A study of the relationship between afforestation and water supply in several regions under different climate conditions shows afforestation resulted in a decline in water supply in all climates (see Table 1).

These outcomes contradict the common belief that afforestation increases water supply. A critical driving process of these results is evapotranspiration, which is a key hydrological process in the water cycle. When lands are converted from other land uses to forests, the partitioning of precipitation into green (part of water available for plant use) and blue (part of water available for human use) water fluxes changes.

Evapotranspiration is a major green water flux, while river discharge and groundwater are typical blue water fluxes. Tree growth can consume more water than other shorter vegetation. According to the mass balance principle, if more water is used by trees, less water will flow into rivers and lakes or recharge the groundwater that people can directly use. The direct impact on water supply is becoming an increasingly urgent issue for water resource managers and planners as demands for water continue to rise.

How then can a positive effect of afforestation on water supply be achieved? We need to consider three central aspects.

First, scale matters: afforestation can accelerate the water cycle and movement at the global level. For example, more than 2 square kilometers of forest expansion can increase the possibility of rainfall. Trees transport water to the air, and water vapour moves to another place which can be geographically far from the afforested location, such as to another country or even continent through wind-driven circulation. This increases the possibility of precipitation in another location and thus contributes to the water supply in that other region. This indicates that, at a global scale, afforestation can indeed bring benefits to the water cycle.

Second, species matters: we must choose suitable tree species for afforestation to have a positive effect on the local water supply. Depending on the species, plantation forests may have different structure and amounts of water consumption (Schwärzel et al. 2018). Tree water use also declines with age. Over time, runoff reduction trends can be reversed, and water supply can be improved. Evidence shows, for example, that water supply may start to improve after 30 years in the case of pines and 15 years in the case of eucalypts (Scott and Prinsloo 2008).

Third, site matters: we need to establish forests in the right place. In dryland, less water is available from precipitation. As tree cover increases, the amount of water available is likely to become less and less, which is critical for areas that already suffer from water shortage and have high demand and competition for water (Zhang and Schwärzel 2017). Compared to dry-prone climates, water is not a limiting factor in tropical climate due to high precipitation. The decline in water supply resulting from afforestation is likely less critical and might even be negligible.

At the global level, many afforestation efforts are ongoing. There are, among others, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) in China, National Afforestation and Reforestation Plan (PNFR) in Ecuador, and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) in India. In Nigeria, afforestation is considered as a promising solution to achieve climate change mitigation and to solve water supply issues (Olorunfemi et al. 2016).

Nigeria recognises the importance of keeping their forests. The Nigerian savannah has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 16°C to 37°C and an annual rainfall about 1,220 milimeters. Afforestation in this region could induce more precipitation, and water availability could potentially increase in the long term. However, we should also recognise that there are risks for water supply in the short term.

Forests – when managed properly – can increase resilience of water supply to enable adaptation to global change. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) recently published a global assessment report highlighting that all of the SDGs are either directly or indirectly related to water and the forest-water nexus. Scientific insights on the forest-water nexus are particularly important to manage and optimize the trade-offs. Afforestation does not always have positive effects on the water supply. The seasonal and annual water yield from forested areas largely depends on forest management, covering selection of tree species, forest structure, and density.

Understanding the interlinkages and feedback loops – as advocated by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) via the Nexus Approach – will support more effective and integrated policymaking, and represents an important contribution towards achieving the SDGs.

UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés noted that the adoption of the Compact marks the beginning, not the end, of the international community’s work to respond comprehensively “to the challenges that face refugees and their hosts.”

The Global Compact on Refugees was called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which also called for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The latter was adopted by 164 governments in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10 December 2018, and is scheduled to be formally endorsed on 19 December 2018, in the UNGA Hall in New York, US.

The refugee compact, while not legally binding, seeks to strengthen the international response to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations, and to better define cooperation to share responsibilities. It builds on existing international law and standards, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and human rights treaties. The Compact comprises four parts: i) an introduction setting out the background, guiding principles and objectives of the compact; ii) the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), as agreed to by UN Member States in Annex I of the New York Declaration; iii) a Programme of Action setting out concrete measures to help meet the objectives of the Compact; and iv) arrangements for follow-up and review.

The Compact was presented to the UNGA in September 2018 as part of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ 2018 annual report, and was then discussed during a high-level ministerial event hosted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On 17 December 2018, the UNGA considered the Global Compact on Refugees as part of a resolution on the Office of the UNHCR, which was adopted with 181 votes in favor, two against and three abstentions.

In a media stakeout following the Compact’s adoption, Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, clarified that the US and Hungary had opposed the UNGA resolution containing the Compact. However, he added that in 2018 UNHCR received the highest contribution ever from the US. The three governments abstaining from the vote were Eritrea, Liberia and Libya.

Also on 17 December, following the UNGA meeting to adopt the Compact, UNHCR hosted an event to mark the agreement. Espinosa said that through this agreement, the UNGA demonstrates its efficacy and utility, and cements its role as the ‘Parliament of Humanity.’ She added that low and middle-income countries host over 80% of all refugees.

The refugee compact contains four elements of particular importance for achieving the SDGs, including measures to ease pressures on host countries.

Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General, on behalf of the UN Secretary-General, outlined four elements of the Compact that are particularly important for achieving the SDGs. She noted that the Compact: i) sets out concrete measures to share the responsibility and ease the pressure on the small number of countries that host the majority of refugees; ii) seeks to bring humanitarian and development action closer together, building on the UN Secretary-General’s reform of the UN development system; iii) provides ways to create jobs and livelihoods, and recognizes that refugees and host communities themselves must be at the center of decision-making on refugee issues; and iv) calls on the international community as a whole to take broader initiatives to prevent conflict and build sustained peace.

Grandi noted that it was the first time there was such a concerted effort to reach an agreement on refugees at the UNGA. He reported that 15 countries have rolled out the Compact’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which he said has mobilized US$6.5 billion that would have not been accessible through traditional finances.

On next steps, Grandi highlighted that the Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, to take stock of the Compact’s commitments and achievements. He noted the need to plan for this event.

Via video messages, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Foreign Minister of Turkey, said the international community has not done enough to help refugees, and should also strengthen support to host countries and communities. Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stressed the importance of shared responsibility and partnerships to respond to the refugee crisis, adding that the EU and its member States comprise the largest donor worldwide.

Bertine Bahige, a Congolese refugee resettled in the US, remarked that all refugees are looking for hope, and are victims of circumstances they have not chosen. Talking about his experience spending five years in a refugee camp in Mozambique, he said he had felt safe and was given access to resources, but wished he could have had access to education and given the possibility to start building his life.

The NITI Aayog has released the Baseline Report of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index, which comprehensively documents the progress made by India's States and Union Territories towards implementing the 2030 SDG targets.

The SDG India Index, which was developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Global Green Growth Institute and United Nations in India, was launched by NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Dr Rajiv Kumar, NITI Aayog Members Dr Ramesh Chand, Dr VK Paul and Dr VK Saraswat, CEO Shri Amitabh Kant, UN Resident Coordinator Yuri Afanasiev and MoSPI Secretary & CSI Pravin Srivastava.

NITI Aayog has the twin mandate to oversee the implementation of SDGs in the country, and also promote Competitive and Cooperative Federalism among States and UTs. The SDG India Index acts as a bridge between these mandates, aligning the SDGs with the Prime Minister's clarion call of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, which embodies the five Ps of the global SDG movement - people, planet, prosperity, partnership and peace.

The world is now into the third year of the SDG era. The SDGs are ambitious global development goals that address key aspects of universal wellbeing across different socio-economic, cultural, geographical divisions and integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.

India's National Development Agenda is mirrored in the SDGs. India's progress in SDGs is crucial for the world as the country is home to about 17% of the world population.

The SDG India Index tracks progress of all States and UTs on 62 Priority Indicators selected by NITI Aayog, which in turn is guided by MoSPI's National Indicator Framework comprising 306 indicators and based on multiple-round consultations with Union Ministries/Departments and States/UTs.

The Index spans 13 out of 17 SDGs. Progress on SDGs 12, 13 & 14 could not be measured as relevant State/UT level data were not available and SDG 17 was left out as it focuses on international partnerships.

A composite score was computed between the range of 0-100 for each State and UT based on their aggregate performance across 13 SDGs, which indicates average performance of State/UT towards achieving 13 SDGs & their respective targets.

If a State/UT achieves a score of 100, it signifies that it has achieved the 2030 national targets. The higher the score of a State/UT, the greater the distance to target achieved.

Classification Criteria based on SDG India Index Score is as follows:

Aspirant: 0-49 Performer: 50-64 Front Runner: 65-99 Achiever: 100OVERALL Aspirant Assam, Bihar and Uttar PradeshPerformer

The SDG India Index is available via an interactive dashboard which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. The Index is designed to function as a tool for focussed policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, moving towards development action pegged to globally recognisable metrics of SDG framework.

The Index also supplements NITI Aayog's continuous efforts towards encouraging evidence-based policy making by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and share best practices.

The SDG India Index will also help highlight crucial gaps related to tracking SDGs and the need for India to develop its statistical systems at National & State/UT levels. This shall lead to the index evolving and becoming more comprehensive over the coming years. The indicators shall be further refined and additional indicators will be added with improvement in data collection, reporting processes & methodology. NITI Aayog is also exploring potential for disaggregating data and developing capacity for real time monitoring and measuring incremental progress.

221,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unece-review-finds-mongolia-on-track-on-sdgs/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNECE Review Finds Mongolia on Track on SDGs,"13 December 2018: The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has conducted a review of Mongolia’s environmental performance. The Environmental Performance Review (EPR) finds that Mongolia is on track with implementation and monitoring of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.

The Government of Mongolia requested the UNECE to conduct the EPR. The UNECE produced the EPR, the second conducted outside of the UNECE region, in cooperation with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The EPR takes stock of Mongolia’s progress in managing its environment since 1987, and addresses a number of issues, including air protection, biodiversity conservation and water, waste and land management, as well as national efforts to integrate environmental considerations into the forestry and health sectors.

The EPR finds that Mongolia is “among the frontrunners” in shaping its national targets and setting up policy frameworks and institutional mechanisms for SDG implementation and follow up. Mongolia has integrated the SDGs into its key policy document, the 2016 Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030, and has demonstrated awareness and ownership of the SDGs among its public officials.

Although Mongolia has an “extensive legal framework on environmental protection,” that is consistent and coherent, implementation and enforcement of this legislation is often delayed. The country has a clear green development policy objective but has not applied the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) tool to evaluate environmental impacts of future sectoral policies.

Mongolia is successfully advancing a community-based approach to natural resource management.

On air pollution, the EPR describes air pollution as a major area of concern, with particulate matter the main pollutant in the country and no regular monitoring of emissions of power plants and heat-only boilers that are major polluters. Government policies focus on the capital city and insufficiently address air quality in other regions. The EPR recommends a more efficient air quality monitoring network and efforts to monitor the emissions from major stationary air polluting sources and fine particles. The report also raises concerns related to the impacts on human health of asbestos, chemicals and noise, among other challenges.

On biodiversity protection, Mongolia’s terrestrial protected area system covers 29.9 percent of the country’s territory. The EPR states the country is “successfully advancing” a community-based approach to natural resource management, with 18 percent of the country’s forested areas managed by local communities and three protected areas managed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Challenges to the country’s biodiversity efforts include wildlife migration corridors in the country’s unprotected landscapes; wildlife competition with domestic livestock; and a lack of financial, human, operational and technical capacities.

On disaster risk management (DRM), the Government of Mongolia has developed policies and plans for disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, urbanization-related challenges, such as unplanned expansion of human settlements, have resulted in a lack of access to basic services or location of settlements in flood pathways. The report recommends strengthening disaster resilience and using available resources for DRM.

Among Mongolia’s successes, the report highlights the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the reintroduction of Przewalski’s horse to its homeland and the expansion of eco-schools. On challenges, the EPR highlights increased mining activities, which have impacted the environment and workers’ health. According to the EPR, coal and gold mining have degraded an estimated 100,000 hectares of land, and only a very small part of degraded land has been restored. Artisanal miners still use mercury, even though Mongolia banned its import and use in 2007.

The report makes a number of recommendations related to SDG implementation and monitoring, including to operationalize the National SDG Committee under the Prime Minister and to ensure regular preparation of reports on SDG implementation. Other recommended measures include to: conduct a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for all regional, national and sectoral policies, development programmes and plans; conduct training courses to raise awareness on SEA; develop an action plan on rehabilitation of abandoned and damaged mining areas; develop policies to create opportunities for artisanal miners to transition to other areas of employment; and ensure the independence of environmental inspectors.

The report highlights also outline Mongolia’s progress on SDG target 17.14 (enhance policy coherence for sustainable development) and SDG target 11.4 (strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural

and natural heritage).

Thing is, they added so much flow to a ride that the piss-poor dependability was sorta accepted back then. Riders would fix or replace them, but who went back to a tall posting? No one, I'd guess. These days, a dropper has to not just go up and down, but also do it for a long time without needing any attention.



SDG's new Tellis post needs to do exactly that in order to be considered a contender, which is exactly why I've had the $269.99 USD dropper on a high-mileage bike for the last six months. The cable-actuated, hydraulically-controlled Tellis can be had with 125mm or 150mm of drop, and there will also be a 170mm version available early in 2019.

Can a dropper post be reasonably priced and still be reliable? SDG's Tellis is exactly that.

Inside the Tellis





It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that,

Alignment is done via a key-way system, and the actuator at the bottom of the post, along with the remote itself, is designed to deliver a very light feel at the rider's thumb. Up top, a 3D forged head is home to a twin, opposing bolt system to clamp the seat rails, which is much more reliable than a single bolt running from left to right that'll eventually let the seat rotate backward.It's also worth noting that SDG says there are more than thirty international distributors and service centers who offer support backup, all of them stocked with parts that are also readily available and accessible online. On top of that, SDG has created a bunch of how-to videos that cover everything from a basic installation to a 400-hour service or a full cartridge replacement. That's how it should be done. SDG says that they wanted a dropper that's both reliable and simple to work on. The replacement cartridge goes for $44.99 USD.

The Tellis' lever can mount in just a single orientation: On the left and under the 'bar like a remote should be mounted.

With flawless reliability, simple construction, and a remote that requires next to no thumb pressure, the Tellis is a worthy dropper to consider.

Performance

Pinkbike's Take:

If the Tellis had been released four or five years ago, it would have been one of the only reliable options on the market and probably one of the least expensive. Things have moved on, however, and there are a handful of decent options to choose from these days, including SDG's now proven performer. The Tellis is relatively affordable compared to many other dropper posts, it's easy to install and, most importantly for many of us, it's demonstrated perfect reliability. — Mike Levy

There are loads of different dropper posts to pick from these days, but what isn't widely known is that many of them use the same, or at least very similar, hydraulic cartridge from Wintek to control their stroke. The cartridges are relatively inexpensive - SDG asks $44.99 USD for a new one - but they've also proven themselves to be pretty damn reliable. Sure, they're not serviceable for the most part, but is that a bad thing when they seem to run smoothly for ages? I don't think so, and the rest of the post is easy to service when the time comes.The Tellis' remote isn't one of those that can be mounted every which way to the point of it working on your drop bar-equipped recumbent. Instead, it's a simple thumb paddle that's designed to sit where your front shifter used to be back when dropping your seat meant getting off the bike. The clamp is split, of course, and the paddle sports a braille-like textured section for added traction.The cable is clamped at the lever (the head slots into the actuator at the bottom of the post) via a rather small set screw, and while it isn't the most elegant way to get the job done, it works.Besides slipping the cable's head into the actuator, then pulling it taut and clamping it, there isn't much to do. That first install took fifteen minutes, at most, and the tension hasn't needed any tinkering since.There was essentially no side-to-side play at the post's head when it was first put on the bike, and there still isn't any six months down the road. That bodes well for long-term performance, as does the smooth action and no hiccups at any point in the stroke. SDG says that the Tellis works well in temps as low as -20c, and while it never got that nippy, it does seem to be indifferent to what the weather is up to. The touch of top-out at the top of the stroke is nice, too, as it lets you know that it's back up to full mast.SDG touts a very light feel at the lever and they're not lying - the thumb paddle might depress if you blew on it. The shape of the cam is key here, and it'll be boon on any bike that has terrible cable routing that adds friction into the system from the bends being too tight. It should also help keep the lever moving decently when contamination has gotten into the line, although the real solution there is to do some maintenance.","It wasn't that long ago that you could count on your dropper post to stop going up and down sometime between when it was brand new and an hour into your first lap on it.

Srinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

According to SDG India Index Baseline Report-2018 released by the NITI Aayog on Thursday, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have been ranked on top 3 positions and are on track to achieve the UN SDG.

J&K’s overall SDG index score is 53 and has been ranked 20 performing states and 27th among states as well as union territories in the country.

As per SDG report, the states with cent percent score are enumerated as achievers, states with a score between 65 to 99 are front runners, states with a score ranging between 50 to 64 are performers and states with a score from 0 to 49 are listed as aspirants.

The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 goals with 169 targets by the United Nations. These goals were adopted by India in 2015 and are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all citizens.

The SDG index aims to promote healthy competition among states by evaluating their progress in social, economic and environmental terms that will help India in achieving the UN SDG by 2030.

These goals are aimed to end poverty in all its forms, end hunger, ensure good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth.

NITI Aayog, CEO, Amitabh Kant, said SDG index has been prepared to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its states and UTs.

The report has been jointly prepared by the State Governments, Central Ministries, United Nations in India and NITI Aayog knowledge partners.

The performance of the states and union territories on indicators for SDG is based on percentage of the population living below national poverty line, households with any usual member covered by any health insurance scheme, persons provided employment under MGNREGA, percentage of population receiving social protection under maternity benefit and homeless households.

The agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), were adopted by 193 countries at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. The SDGs, which came into effect from 1 January 2016, have 2030 as their deadline for achieving the targets. SDGs are aimed at addressing key aspects of universal well-being across different socio-economic, cultural, geographical divisions as also the interconnectedness among these social multiple dimensions of improving human welfare.

According to NITI Aayog, State Governments have been taking leading role through Panchayati Raj Institutions, urban local bodies and civil society organizations to take the SDGs forward and to ensure that the most marginalized persons are reached first.

“SDGs can only be met through visionary long-term strategic planning and cooperative federalism, where governments at both the Centre and States work together to bring about transformation. States play a huge role in the implementation of government programmers and in influencing all social and economic parameters necessary to achieve SDGs,” said Amitabh Kant.","Adil AhmadSrinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

THE KIT

Since day one, we have been at the forefront of the MTB saddle game, supporting riders for over 20 years. While many are still onboard and riding today, they are having children of their own, which has shown us the need for quality youth components that were truly designed to fit smaller bodies. The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.

SDG SDG SDG

Mountain bike component manufacturer SDG has a cool new upgrade kit that’s colour-coordinated and could be the perfect Christmas present for young riders.

The JR PRO KIT boxed-set comprises saddle, handlebar, grips and pedals, which are made, says SDG, to a similar standard as its main product lines.

The kit is designed for young riders on 18in- to 24in-wheeled bikes. There are four colour ways on offer: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue.

SDG

SDG Fly Jr saddle

SDG is known for its saddles, having been in the business of producing them for over 20 years. It’s taken that expertise and applied it to developing a saddle specifically for younger, smaller, lighter riders.

The Fly Jr saddle is constructed from synthetic leather with tough cordura sides for wear resistance. It’s shorter and narrower and has been ergonomically designed to fit smaller sit bones, according to SDG.

It’s also got a slight rise at the rear to help get the pelvis in a comfortable position, and to push against when powering off from a standing start. There’s also a small nose platform for climbing.

SDG Slater 90 pedals

These nylon composite pedals have a low profile design of 18mm and a 90x90mm platform for smaller feet. The pedals include six replaceable 2mm steel pins per side for grip.

A cro-mo axle with fully sealed bushing is designed to last a lot longer than many of the cheaper, plastic kids’ pedals on the market, and is also serviceable to keep it running. You’ll also be able to purchase additional parts and pins.

SDG Slater 650 handlebar

The cockpit has had some consideration put into it too. The Slater 650 handlebar is, unsurprisingly, 650mm wide and constructed from 6061 aluminium.

While the mount is 31.8mm, the bars taper to 19mm rather than the standard 22.2mm to suit smaller hands and fit the thinner Slater JR grips.

The bars are also supplied with four 15mm nylon shims, which will allow standard brakes and shifters to be mounted.

Slater Jr grips

To finish the whole set off it comes with colour-matched grips designed specifically for smaller hands. In addition to fitting on the thinner 19mm diameter handlebars, the grips also have a dual-density design that offers vibration damping and have a lock-on system.

Jammu and Kashmir stands at 20th spot in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index of the 29 states of India.

NITI Aayog, with the support of United Nations, has developed SDG India index, a comprehensive index to measure progress of states and union territories, through a single measurable index and the first baseline report for 2018.

The index covers 13 of the 17 UN’s sustainable development goals including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong and accountable institutions.

Four goals, including climate action and sustainable use of marine resources, were left out because of lack of data at the state level.

According to SDG report released by NITI Aayog, Jammu and Kashmir is placed at 20th spot, securing a total of 53 points. In the assigned sustainable development goals in India, J&K has not being able to bag top position in any of sustainable development goals.

The SDG includes no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economy growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequality, sustainable cities and communities, life on land and peace justice and strong institutions.

As per the SDG report, J&K is placed among performer states. States with 100 per cent score are enumerated as achievers, states with a score between 65 and 99 are front-runners, states with a score ranging between 50 and 64 are performers and states with 0-49 score are listed as aspirants.

Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key SDGs like removal of poverty and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the laggards.

A senior government official informed that the state government had in June this year ordered formation of a committee of 23 bureaucrats, including the chief secretary, and almost all administrative secretaries. They were asked to finalise the action plan for mapping of departments and schemes for each SDG target, facilitate approval of targets and indicators with timelines and resources for achieving SDGs, which would form Vision Document 2030 for the state and hold periodic review of progress on SDGs and suggest necessary corrective measures to achieve targets.

“But due to change of guard in the state’s power corridors, nothing much has been done in this regard,” he said.

According to the Index, the nation as a whole has a score of 58, showing the country has reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the sustainable development goals adopted by India and 192 other nations in 2015.

The Index tracks the progress of all the states and UTs on a set of 62 priority indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the government of India.

The index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country, its states and UTs. It is an aggregate measure which can be understood and used by everyone—policymakers, businesses, civil society and the general public. It has been designed to provide an aggregate assessment of the performance of all Indian states and UTs, and to help leaders and change makers evaluate their performance on social, economic and environmental parameters. It aims to measure India and its states’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030.","State hasn’t topped in any of 13 UN goals, achieves 53 points against national score of 58Jammu and Kashmir stands at 20th spot in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index of the 29 states of India.

The Sudanese Pound (SDG) continues to fall against the US Dollar, as the greenback surpasses the SDG 70 threshold on the parallel market in Khartoum. This in spite of a crackdown against street forex traders by the security authorities this weekend.

Financial analyst, former banker and civil society activist Hafiz Ismail predicts “the depreciation of the Sudanese Pound and the deterioration of the standard of living will continue to an unusual extent, with no foreseeable end”.

His remarks came after the Dollar purchase price in the black market rose to between SDG 62 and SDG 63 for cash and for cheques at SDG 72.

The Market Makers Mechanism retains the Dollar purchase price of SDG 47.5 in commercial banks and ATMs, however, Ismail told Radio Dabanga that partial treatment as it is happening now is for no avail and stressed the need for radical treatment in the overall framework.

Balance of payments deficit

Ismail says: “The current government does not have the ability to find any radical solutions due to the weak infrastructure of the economy, the large balance of payments deficit, and the lack of sources of financing or external borrowing.”

He pointed out that “the government’s attempt to drain cash liquidity created another problem: It converted the same currency into a commodity so that the price of the cheque and the price of hard cash are different.” He added that “many people are trading in the Sudanese Pound.”

He attributed the problem to the lack of the overall view of the solution and the lack of means of reform in the hands of the current government.

68.93% inflation

The rate of inflation in Sudan rose to 68.93 per cent in November.

Ismail: “Prime Minister and Finance Minister Motaz Mousa did not imagine the severity of the crisis when he took office because the problem looked like an economic crisis. However, it is in essence a crisis of governance that needs radical reforms, a comprehensive review of the state apparatus, performance of government, and fighting corruption.”

Ismail said that “contrary to the belief of many, Sudan is not a free market because a few groups are monopolising goods and control their prices”.

He pointed out that the increase in commodity prices occurs much higher than the decrease of the value of Sudanese Pound because traders in this way want to maintain their capital despite the disastrous effects on the citizen.

He added that the lack of confidence in the government makes things worse because officials say contradictory things and make promises that do not keep or have the ability to do so, which accelerates the deterioration.

Financial analyst, former banker and civil society activist Hafiz Ismail predicts “the depreciation of the Sudanese Pound and the deterioration of the standard of living will continue to an unusual extent, with no foreseeable end”.
His remarks came after the Dollar purchase price in the black market rose to between SDG 62 and SDG 63 for cash and for cheques at SDG 72.
