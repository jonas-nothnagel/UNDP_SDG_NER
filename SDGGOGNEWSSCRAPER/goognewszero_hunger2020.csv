INTRODUCTION

Achieving Zero Hunger is central to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, to which Zambia is a signatory.

Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) calls on the Member States of the United Nations to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. In particular, SDG 2 aims to end hunger and ensure all people have access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round; end all forms of malnutrition; double the agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholders; maintain the genetic diversity of seeds; increase investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, and technology development; correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in agricultural markets; and promote functional food markets in order to control food price volatility.1

The Zero Hunger Challenge is a mechanism that allows countries to systematically articulate how they plan to achieve SDG 2 by 2030. It identifies five key areas or pillars, which countries must achieve in order to effectively end hunger and malnutrition. These pillars include ensuring 100% access to adequate food all year round; zero stunted children under the age of two; all food systems are sustainable; 100% increase in smallholder productivity and income, and zero loss or waste of food.

The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) is committed to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to reporting on progress towards the SDG 2 goals and targets. These global goals and targets are consistent with the African Union’s commitment to eliminate hunger and food insecurity by 2063, and Zambia’s priorities in the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP). The 7NDP lays out national strategies to address food and nutrition challenges in the first development outcomes under economic diversification and human development. These strategies are consistent with the five pillars of the Zero Hunger Challenge and are pertinent to ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030. The Zambia Zero Hunger Challenge is thus effectively anchored at the highest political level in the Country.

The GRZ commissioned the Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR) to lay out in a comprehensive manner the status, trends, responses and gaps in the five pillars of the Zero Hunger Challenge. The review recommends actions needed to achieve SDG 2 by 2030.

OBJECTIVES

The review provides a situational analysis of food and nutrition security in Zambia to contextualise the challenges and opportunities of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030. Based on this overview, a number of priority actions and milestones are recommended as the basis of a Road Map to Zero Hunger. This provides clarity on the specific roles that the private sector, civil society, and other non-governmental stakeholders would play in helping Zambia achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. The proposed strategic objectives and initiatives will strengthen Government efforts in ensuring the country achieves the food and nutrition security outcomes of the Seventh National Development Plan. The specific objectives of the review are as follows:","Executive SummaryINTRODUCTIONAchieving Zero Hunger is central to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, to which Zambia is a signatory.

India has performed dismally on UN’s Sustainable Development Goals with only seven Indian states successfully addressing “hunger and malnutrition”. The worst performers in the zero hunger goal were Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. Overall, India performed worse than last year with its score falling from 2018’s 48 to 38 in 2019, according to NITI Aayog’s report on Sustainable Development Goals 2019. The same is in line with the findings of Global Hunger Index 2019 which was released in October 2019. The SDG 2019 report also highlights special attention is needed towards achieving zero hunger goal. “Two goals — 2 (zero hunger) and 5 (gender equality) demand special attention, as the overall country score is below 50,” the report said.

Despite India’s agricultural produce going up by six times in the last 70 years, food loss and wastage keep millions hungry. More than one in every three children aged below five is stunted in India and 40% of children aged between 6-59 months are anaemic. “It is important to emphasise that hunger is a problem not because there is not enough food for everyone… Food wastage and loss remain a major concern… Globally nearly 40% of the fruits and vegetables, and 30% of cereals that are produced are lost,” the report said.

However, some states and Union Territories have performed well in achieving the goal. “Goa and Chandigarh are the top-performing among States and UTs, respectively. Seven states and two UTs bagged a position in the category of Front Runners (with Index score higher than/equal to 65),” the report said. Besides Goa and Kerala, these states include mostly north-eastern states — Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.

Talking about India’s hunger issue, Chanchalapathi Dasa, Vice-chairman, Akshaya Patra, had earlier told Financial Express Online that the government needs to infuse more money in child nutrition to combat hunger. Akshaya Patra Foundation works with the government for Poshan Abhiyan or Child Nutrition program.","More than one in every three children aged below five is stunted in India and 40% of children aged between 6-59 months are anaemic.

MANILA -- To free more Filipinos from hunger and achieve food security, President Rodrigo Duterte has created an inter-agency task force on zero hunger.

Duterte signed Executive Order 101 on January 10 creating an inter-agency task force on zero hunger which will be chaired by Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.

Serving as his vice-chairperson is Social Welfare Secretary Joselito Bautista.

Members of the task force include the Agriculture Secretary, Agrarian Reform Secretary, Budget Secretary, Education Secretary, Environment Secretary, Health Secretary, Labor Secretary, Interior Secretary, Trade Secretary, Science Secretary, Communications Secretary, National Economic and Development Authority Director-General, and the Commission on Higher Education Chairperson.

In the EO, Duterte recognized that involuntary hunger, food security, undernutrition, and child wasting, stunting and mortality, continue to be serious concerns in the country.

“There is a need to carefully coordinate, rationalize, monitor and assess the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities to ensure a whole-of-government approach to eradicating hunger and achieving food security,” Duterte said.

The task force will be assigned to formulate a National Food Policy (NFP), which will outline national priorities based on a comprehensive understanding of the problem of hunger and related issues, and will provide a roadmap for achieving zero hunger, taking into consideration existing laws and issuances, as well as international law and treaty obligations.

Under the NFP, initiatives for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture will be identified.

It will coordinate and rationalize the efforts of concerned government agencies and instrumentalities to ensure a “whole-of-government” approach to attaining zero hunger and at the same time evaluate, through the identification of key performance indicators, the government's progress in ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

Technical working groups from among its member-agencies will also be formed to address particular concerns relative to the implementation of this Order.

Finally, the task force will also prepare and submit to the President annual reports on the state of hunger, food security, nutrition and agricultural production in the country, as well as the task force's initiatives and recommendations.

Support and assistance of other government agencies and instrumentalities may also be sought by the task force. Meanwhile, local government units are enjoined to render necessary assistance to the task force.

Initial funding requirements for the implementation of this order will be charged against the current appropriations of the member-agencies of the task force.

However, budgetary requirements for the succeeding years will be included in the annual budget proposals of the concerned agencies.

The order takes effect immediately.

Based on the third quarter of 2019 Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey results fielded from Sept. 27 to 30, 2019, 9.1 percent or an estimated 2.3 million families experienced involuntary hunger at least once in the past three months.

The figure is lower than the 10 percent or an estimated 2.5 million in June 2019 and 9.5 percent or about 2.3 million families in March 2019.

Nograles expressed hope that fewer Filipinos will suffer from hunger with programs like the Enhanced Partnership Against Hunger and Poverty (EPAHP), an initiative to help mitigate hunger, ensure food and nutrition security, and reduce poverty in urban and rural communities, including marginalized communities.

Agencies which are a part of EPAHP are the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Education, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Trade and Industry, National Anti-Poverty Commission, National Irrigation Administration, and Landbank.

A deadly outbreak of the new coronavirus emerged in this city of 11 million people last month. Within weeks, the virus has killed nine people , sickened hundreds and spread as far as the United States.

Wuhan has been on high alert since the number of confirmed infections surged into the hundreds earlier this week.

New year celebrations that had been expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people have been canceled. In some parts of the city, including a major shopping area, streets remain largely empty, with most people walking outside donning face masks.

In the city's center, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market sits empty, its rows of stalls shuttered. Police and security officers in face masks stand guard outside, prohibiting anyone from filming or entering a cordoned off area.

The market has always been a popular spot at this time of the year, packed with shoppers stocking up on fish and seafood for Lunar New Year feasts with family and friends.

But this year, Chinese authorities and scientists say wild animals sold at this market are the likely source of the new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family of viruses as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The virus -- which can infect humans and animals -- has since spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Officials in Washington state confirmed the first case on US soil Tuesday.

The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection, but health authorities have not found out which animals are the source.

'How can I not be worried?'

Not far from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Xiao Chuan'an, from a neighboring city, is selling sugar cane she imported from southern Guangdong province.

""I do feel a bit scared,"" she told CNN. ""How can I not be worried? The situation sounds really serious. The news on the phone sounds really scary.""

The country's National Health Commission confirmed this week the virus can be transmitted between people, after Wuhan health authorities maintained for two weeks that there was ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.""

The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been linked to the coronavirus outbreak in China.

A staff member talks with a driver as he checks the body temperatures of passengers at an exit of a highway in Wuhan on Tuesday.

In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, 270 people have been infected as of Wednesday, and nine of them have died, according to the commission. At least 453 cases had been confirmed throughout China, leading to fears of a possible epidemic.

Xiao said her family had repeatedly urged her to go home, fearing that she will catch the virus in Wuhan. But she wants to stay to sell the sugar cane. However, business has been bad -- people are too scared to come to the market to shop, she said.

""You can see now -- does it look like the atmosphere of Chinese New Year?"" she said. ""I don't know when the pneumonia epidemic will stop... I might have to eat instant noodles during Chinese New Year.""

Emergency measures

The city government announced a series of new measures Tuesday to contain the outbreak -- efforts some critics say came too late -- the virus has already spread to a dozen provinces across the country.

Tour agencies in Wuhan have been banned from taking groups out of the city. Infrared thermometers have been installed at the airport, train stations, coach terminals and passenger piers to measure the temperatures of passengers departing the city since January 14, according to state media.

Staff members disinfect the Hankou Railway Station in Wuhan on Wednesday.

The city has over 60 routes connecting Wuhan with international cities, including direct flights to New York, San Francisco, Sydney, Paris and London, as well as over a hundred internal flights to other major Chinese cities. It is also a hub for the country's high-speed rail network.

At the high-speed rail station, the only faces that stand out are the uncovered ones, with the vast majority of passengers donning masks. As they prepare to exit the station, a railway staff member -- also wearing a mask and gloves -- puts a thermometer at the head of each passenger, checking for a fever.

Commuters wearing face masks walk in Hankou railway station in Wuhan, where China's coronavirous outbreak first emerged last month.

On a high speed train from Beijing to Wuhan, railway attendants and security guards left their faces uncovered. A train attendant told CNN they were asked by management not to wear masks, as it may trigger a panic among passengers.

But she added that the train company is preparing to purchase masks and they will begin wearing them should the situation worsen.

Some hotels in the city said they will also screen guests, checking their temperature and asking them to sanitize their hands upon entry.

Commuters wait in line at Wuchang railway station in Wuhan on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, the general manager of the Westin hotel in Wuhan told CNN he had asked staff to start wearing face masks ""for both their safety and for the safety of our guests.""

Others, however, are less worried about the outbreak. Yan Weixi, a jackfruit seller who did not wear a mask, said she did not find the situation ""so scary.""

""I have been checking online instructions... like drinking more water or washing your hands more frequently. I think that should be fine,"" said Yan, from northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is spending her first Lunar New Year in Wuhan.

""The most important thing is to keep a positive attitude, because if you're more scared, it's more likely you would catch the virus,"" she said. ""That's my opinion.""","Wuhan, China (CNN) The Lunar New Year -- the most important festival in the Chinese calendar -- is just three days away, but in the Chinese city of Wuhan, there are few reasons to celebrate.

There are at least two things wrong with the term: The implication that it is an unavoidable surprise from mother nature, and that running out of water equally impacts everyone in society.

Both of these perceptions are wrong and will be perpetuated as long as we continue to refer to “Day Zero.”

It’s time for the public sector, businesses and civil society to implement real solutions to water scarcity and associated inequity.

In 2018, the city of Cape Town in South Africa introduced the idea of Day Zero to focus the public’s attention on managing water consumption by convincing residents to reduce water usage (Cape Town Day Zero ).

The four million residents of Cape Town were about three months away from “running out of water” (Cape Town One Year Later) authorities said. The city experienced three consecutive years of low rainfall and April 12, 2018, was to be the date of what was being called the largest drought-induced municipal water failure in modern history.

The city’s plan was for the entire population to collect its water (an estimated maximum of a two-minute shower’s-worth a day per person) from 200 centralized water centers. However, when April 12th rolled around, the city made it without turning off the taps.

A bit of luck and last-minute emergency water conservation measures managed to get the city through the crisis.

This sounds like a success story. It’s not. Here’s why.

Hope is not a strategy

The first mistake is assuming that the past is a guide to the future with regards to water supplies. Why was the public sector surprised by outcomes from a multi-year decline in precipitation and increased demand for water?

For many, there is an ongoing expectation that we are experiencing droughts that are similar to previous droughts and that a good rainfall is all we need to get back to normal.

But hope is not a strategy, and climate change has impacted the predictability of rainfall and snow-pack. This means the past is no longer a guide to the future. Coupled with an over-allocation of water and holding onto ‘business as usual’ water management practices, like low water conservation and reuse rates, creates a reactive water management response. Hence, “Day Zero.”

The second mistake is that the supply/demand gap projections universally impact everyone equally, which is misleading.

The Charting our Water Futures report by global consultancy McKinsey predicted that by “2030, under an average economic growth scenario and if no efficiency gains are assumed, global water requirements would grow from 4,500 billion m3 today (or 4.5 thousand cubic kilometers) to 6,900 billion m3.”

This translates to 40 per cent above current accessible, reliable supply including return flows, and taking into account that a portion of supply should be reserved for environmental requirements.

As the report states, “the drivers of this resource challenge are fundamentally tied to economic growth and development. Agriculture accounts for approximately 3,100 billion m3, or 71 percent of global water withdrawals today, and without efficiency gains will increase to 4,500 billion m3 by 2030 (a slight decline to 65 per cent of global water withdrawals). The water challenge is therefore closely tied to food provision and trade.”

It is far too easy to view the supply/demand gap in some abstract term and that the gap will somehow equally impact all stakeholders. This is simply untrue.

Case in point: The October 2019 research by the World Resources Institute, Day Zero Water Crisis Lessons, which states, “the crisis revealed a dire picture of social inequity in both cities. While the rich could afford their own solutions, the poor had to wait for government help. For many of them, every day is Day Zero.”

“ There are at least two things wrong with the term: The implication that it is an unavoidable surprise from mother nature, and that running out of water equally impacts everyone in society.

There is no “gap” and declaring “Day Zero” is a reaction to poor water management by assuming the past is a guide to the future.

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) establish an urgent call for countries and cities to create a resilient, sustainable and equitable future for everyone. The SDGs consist of 17 goals, including those for universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, to be met by 2030.

For goal 6, which states, “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all,” we need innovative policies and technical solutions that consider equity.

Where do we go from here?

I believe 2020 will be the year we become more proactive and abandon reactive water strategies and rhetoric. There really is no other choice, as we are seeing increasing examples of what water scarcity and poor quality can do to degrade social well-being, ecosystem health, economic development and business growth.

We are also seeing advances in public policy for example the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act and technology such as the IWA Digital Water Report and better financing of solutions.

Here’s to 2020 being a turning point once and for all on water.

Food wastage is often neglected or remains invisible. An estimated 1.3 billion tonnes — a third of all food produced in the world annually — is lost or wasted along, according to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study. This happens across the chain — from farms to processing plants, marketplaces, retailers, food service operations and kitchens.

The resource to produce that much food leaves a footprint of about 3.3 billion tonnes of CO 2 . If food waste were a country, it would place third worldwide in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, between the United States (US) and India.

The United Nations estimates 40 per cent food produced in India is lost / wasted along the chain. It needs to reduce food wastage to feed the 194 million Indians who go hungry every day, according to FAO.

Amid the humdrum of our daily routines, the wants of the haves and the needs of the have nots, there are people who are consciously engaged in sustainable consumption and generating zero waste. Here, we profile a few of them:

1. Noida's Green Women

Green Crusaders, a women's group in Sector 47, Noida (Uttar Pradesh), have been working on reducing food wastage since August 2018. The self-sustaining initiative has benefitted all stakeholders, including waste collectors, residents and the city authorities.

The group started with informal social media discussions and gatherings. Members charted priorities and started by organising cleanliness drives, collating data, interacting with residents, researching best practices, training domestic helps and waste collectors. Non-profits then helped them with new technologies and practices for sustainable waste management.

Currently, the group collects waste door-to-door in four blocks. It has streamlined waste segregation into a value chain. Tricycles for collecting waste have two sacks — one each for dry and wet waste. The later is composted while paper, plastics, etc are further sorted and sold by collectors / kabadiwallahs to generate revenue.

The group receive 600-700 kilogram waste (wet and dry) from 1,000 households a day and produce approximately 60 kg compost, which is sold at Rs 10 per kg; compost leachate, used as a liquid fertiliser, is bottled and marketed at Rs 50 a litre within the locality.

As 70 per cent families segregate their waste, good quality compost is harnessed. It is used to grow healthy vegetables, fruits and flowers in gardens at homes and local public places by environment clubs, youth groups etc.

Kabadiwallahs now want to collect only clean, recyclable waste that they can sell at Rs 250-300 per day, which can shot up to Rs 500-800 during festivals.

All this has resulted in community participation, an organised set-up of waste segregation, collection and recycling. Subsequently, all key stakeholders (flowchart below) of the system have benefitted.







The big push for the first phase of the project came by mobilising funds from residents themselves; Nearly all contributed at least Rs 5,000 each; some donated up to Rs 50,000 and Rs 8.12 lakh was collected from the community.

Machines were procured for processing organic waste (from Riteways Verchew 200 with a four-bin system for aeration) for Rs 6.78 lakh. The total expenditure to create the system — setting-up infrastructure to operating the machines — was Rs 10-12 lakh.

Due to its success and to strengthen end-to-end segregation and sustainable disposal of household waste, the group expanded processing units by procuring new machines, installed additional eight bins and built a 1,000 square feet shed.

The group is now looking at streamlining e-waste to Chintan, an environmental research and action group and resolving the issue of sanitary waste, which goes straight to a dump.

Waste at landfill emits methane, which is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Utilising resources judiciously and involving the community, Green Crusaders has cut landfill waste load to 15-18 per cent of what it was.

Additional outcomes:

1. A steel utensil bank to curb plastic waste by loaning plates, tumblers, spoons, bowls, etc for a nominal deposit for events.

2. A Sunday farmers' market (October-March) to promote fresh food, earth-friendly packaging during festive months and to market chemical- and pesticide-free food; several vendors also interact directly with health-conscious buyers.

3. Children-led initiatives such as collection of old clothes, blue and green dustbins, etc.

4. Sowed 5,000 fruiting and flowering plants (Gulmohar, Amaltas, Guava, Jamun, etc) on a 200-metre plot, using Miyawaki — a Japanese technique to generate a 100-year-old forest in only 10 years. It was completed in August 2019 with an aim to co-create an urban dense forest on a wasteland not only to restrain garbage dumping and open defecation but also retaining groundwater, recharging groundwater tables, supporting local biodiversity, increasing green cover and curbing air pollution.

2. Scrapping waste in Rohini

Scrapped, an initiative in three areas of Delhi's Rohini sub city, has piloted projects for source segregation of waste, door-to-door collection, composting kitchen waste and dry waste collection.

It currently composts kitchen waste from 616 people and produces up to 50,000 kg of compost a year. Every day 55-150 kg waste is generated.

Additionally, all categories of recyclable waste and non-recyclable plastics are collected at doorsteps of more than 1,000 families across more than 40 societies, using a ‘box and a bag’ approach to store paper and plastic separately at the household level.

Using this technique, it can now segregate recyclables into more than 20 categories. It has not only reduced the burden on landfill drastically but have also strengthened the value chain robustly.

No matter where waste occurs, it represents a lost opportunity to generate revenue and feed people.

India placed 102 among 117 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI)-2019, much below South Asian neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.

Waste less, and you can save money, time, farmland, resources and fuel, and, since agriculture drives habitat loss, you can even help save some species.","Down To Earth profiles two initiatives in the National Capital Region that aim at reducing food waste and a number of other measures for making themselves zero wasteFood wastage is often neglected or remains invisible.

Special to the Reporter

Microsoft Corp. leaders are calling the company’s new plan to address climate change, a “Moonshot,” comparable to humanity’s achievements after John F. Kennedy’s announcement that the United States would send the first man to the moon.

On Jan. 16, CEO Satya Nadella, president Brad Smith, CFO Amy Hood, and chief environmental officer Lucas Joppa announced the Redmond-based tech company’s new carbon neutral plan to reduce and eventually remove 100 percent of its carbon footprint.

“Today, we are making a commitment that by 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative. By 2050, Microsoft plans to remove the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975,” Smith said.

Microsoft’s plan to not only become carbon neutral but also carbon negative is “thrilling,” according to Lisa Graumlich, a University of Washington (UW) expert on climate change. Graumlich, dean of UW’s College of the Environment, specializes in climate change research and most recently testified before the U.S. House of Representative Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.

“Carbon neutral means that Microsoft will balance their carbon output and removal, which is great but continues to put us on the trajectory of further climate change,” Graumlich explained. “But carbon negative means that Microsoft will remove all of its historical emissions, which can really mitigate the impacts of climate change.”

Microsoft committed to a $1 billion climate innovation fund for developing new sustainable technologies for carbon reduction and removal. The company plans to reduce its emissions from 16 million metric tons to net zero across its entire business and supply chain.

Smith also announced that Microsoft signed the U.N. “Business Ambition for 1.5°C — Our Only Future,” a pledge that aims to promote sustainable science-based practices that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Three scopes

To help explain the scope of the company’s carbon footprint, Smith presented the statistics, which he called “carbon math.” Microsoft plans to address three different scopes of its carbon impact. Smith defined the first scope as Microsoft’s direct emissions — the trucks, commuter buses and energy used for production. The second scope refers to the carbon emitted to create the electricity that Microsoft and its data centers consume. This is the electricity that powers consumer products and carbon emitted by millions of plugged in Xboxes and Surface Pro laptops.

“I’m absolutely convinced that it’s going to take all of us empowered with technology to achieve the stable climate that we, our children and generations to come will ultimately depend upon,” said Joppa.

Microsoft plans to take necessary steps within the next five years to be a 100 percent green company starting with the first and second scopes. In July, the tech giant will start phasing in an internal carbon tax of $15 per metric ton to cover the third scope of emissions. The tax will charge the company’s own business divisions. All taxes will go toward the sustainability efforts. By July 2021, Microsoft plans to have new processes and tools both to enable their suppliers to accurately report on their emissions and incentivize them to make a difference to be more energy efficient.

Graumlich feels optimistic about Microsoft’s plan for the future because of the company’s history with establishing their internal carbon tax in 2012.

“Microsoft had a culture of managing their carbon output before other companies even thought of it,” Graumlich said. “Their internal carbon tax has held them accountable to reduce carbon use.”

Smith said, “We will ensure that by the year 2025, we will have power purchase agreements in place for 100 percent of the renewable energy we need for all of Microsoft’s data centers, our buildings, and our campuses worldwide.”

To address the third scope, Joppa also announced the creation of the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator, which provides customers using Azure, Microsoft’s public cloud services for storage and virtual networking, with more transparency. The calculator will measure and report the carbon emissions associated with the use of customers’ workloads to incentivize them toward greener solutions. Smith likened Microsoft’s customer transparency regarding its carbon footprint to nutrition labels in grocery stores.

“Shouldn’t people around the world be able to do the same thing when they’re making purchasing decisions based on an understanding of how much carbon was emitted to produce that product? Just think about what that would do to empower consumers and incentivize businesses,” said Smith.

Ongoing and future efforts

In the long-term, Microsoft has many approaches to begin the carbon removal process, including nature-based approaches, like planting more trees and new green technology. Hood explained that the $1 billion climate change fund will go toward project-based financing to accelerate technologies that Microsoft is currently developing.

“We’ll create direct air-capture technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere, for example, where air is literally run through a machine and removed from it,” Smith said.

The new pledge is just an addition to the company’s current large-scale sustainability efforts through its AI for Earth, which addresses climate equity using cloud computing services, according to Hood. AI for Earth has provided nearly 500 grants to fund sustainability projects all over the world.

Projects like SunCulture, for example, use Azure to collect information on the environment to create detailed forecasts to help smallholder farmers in Africa to maximize yields and earnings.

Graumlich explained that Microsoft’s energy saving plan benefits both communities worldwide from a farming standpoint and the company itself from a business standpoint.

“In offsetting carbon emissions, there is an increased capacity of fertile soil that can be used to create tastier crops and eventually help address hunger in communities worldwide,” she said. “Reducing their energy use also saves Microsoft a lot of money.”

As climate change continues to affect communities all over the world, Graumlich hopes Microsoft’s efforts will inspire both the government and other companies to follow suit and make larger investments in sustainability.

“It’s easy to articulate a ‘Moonshot,’” she said. “But you have to ask, ‘Does this firm have the intellectual capacity and resources to achieve it?’ I’m willing to bet on Microsoft.”

He tweeted that it was a “disgrace” that the historic street lacked greenery “crucial for the environment – carbon, air quality – but also for mental health and wellbeing”.

Leaving aside the debate on whether trees would spoil Regent Street’s aesthetic, or the fact that Regent’s Park is only a stroll away, Stewart is largely correct.

Placemaking, architecture and design, including biophilic design, can play crucial roles in tackling the contribution to the climate crisis of the built environment, which accounts for 40% of UK carbon emissions, according to the UKGBC.

As an industry, we must work together to cut this contribution as fast as we can. It has to feel different and difficult if we want to make a real change. Otherwise, as well as contributing to climate change, we risk assets being stranded as environmental considerations become more critical for investors, operators, developers and consumers.

Architects and designers are in a privileged position to influence investment decisions through our design advocacy. And as many of our clients hold and operate the buildings we design, there is an alignment between prioritising sustainability by designing for better building performance and using circular strategies once the buildings are in use, with an operator’s objective to reduce operational costs. Sustainability pays for itself over the long term.

One obvious way to set about this is to choose materials that ensure we’re not creating places with a short lifespan. Interiors should utilise sustainable design to reduce wear and tear. The University of New South Wales claims commercial interiors are ‘churned’ on average every five to seven years. Its research argues that materials such as bamboo, cotton and wool are known for their long-lasting qualities and can be used for designing sustainable interiors. Timber is also a popular choice, as the only truly sustainable construction material due to its ability to be regrown and its role as a carbon sink, according to University of Cambridge research.

Of course, no building should be designed in isolation from its surroundings. A holistic approach needs to be considered to create places that foster greenery and improve air quality and wellbeing.

Another way to create cleaner, more eco-friendly places to live is by making towns and cities car-free: a third of all UK carbon emissions come from transport (mainly road transport), according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Car emissions are also detrimental to health. Shockingly, according to the World Health Organization, more than 40 UK towns and cities are above safe air pollution limits. Local authorities are starting to recognise this. At the end of last year, York City Council announced it was planning to make the city centre car-free by 2023. Brighton has recently made a similar commitment.

Designers and architects must strive to create cleaner places through effective masterplanning and use of sustainable infrastructure. They have the tools to advocate for forward-thinking solutions to the climate crisis. As an industry, we have to recognise the physical impact of what we do and start pushing for that net-zero future.

Prince Andrew is ""happy to talk"" to the FBI but has not been approached by them, a source close to the royal told the Daily Telegraph.

It follows US lawyer Geoffrey Berman saying at a news conference in New York on Monday that the duke had not cooperated.

Mr Berman claimed his lawyers had been contacted by prosecutors and the FBI as part of the probe.

US prosecutor: Andrew uncooperative in Epstein investigation

Buckingham Palace did not comment following the press conference, but it was understood the matter was being dealt with by Andrew's legal team.

But a source told the Telegraph: ""The duke is more than happy to talk to the FBI but he hasn't been approached by them yet.

The Duke of York in an interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis / PA

""He is angry about the way this is being portrayed and bewildered as to why this was said in New York.""

Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein, said in an interview with BBC Panorama that she was left ""horrified and ashamed"" after an alleged sexual encounter with Andrew in London in 2001.

Andrew categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre.

He stepped down from royal duties in November following a disastrous Newsnight interview in the wake of the scandal.

At the time, he said: ""I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency.""

Following the interview, he was accused of failing to show regret over his friendship with the disgraced financier, who took his own life in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Mr Berman, who is overseeing the investigation, told reporters outside Epstein's New York mansion that ""to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation"".

US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents five of Epstein's alleged victims, said lawyer Mr Berman had been left with ""no choice"" but to comment publicly about Andrew's alleged lack of cooperation because he did not have the power to subpoena the royal as part of the criminal investigation.

Speaking to BBC News on Tuesday, she called on Andrew to ""stop playing games"" and ""do the right thing"" by speaking to the authorities to assist with their investigation into the inquiry.

If you're looking to play an easy game of Horizon: Zero Dawn then these are the weapons you need to do it.

There are a lot of weapon and weapon mod choices in Horizon Zero Dawn for you to take down the machines and survive encounters with human foes. At time,s the weapon you choose will largely come down to the requirements of the combat scenario and your personal preferences when it comes to fighting.

RELATED: Horizon Zero Dawn: 10 Coolest Machines, Ranked

That being said, there are some clear standout weapons that make the game much, much easier when used in combat with the right coil setup. None of the entries will include Heavy weapons, as those are almost always temporarily in your possession and you can’t create more ammo, which isn’t very convenient. Nor are there any New Game + weapons.

10 Shadow Sling With Freeze

The Shadow Sling is the best sling out there, and an incredibly useful tool in combat. With this archaic weapon you can launch an elemental bomb at your enemies to apply status effects like Freeze, Burning, and Shock. This is a great weapon to start a fight, as your enemy will suffer a debilitating status effect.

Probably the best coils you can put on the Shadow Sling are coils that deal extra Freeze damage. This is the main elemental status effect you’ll want to be dealing anyway as Freezing makes the enemy weak to attacks anywhere on its body.

9 Lodge Blast Sling With Damage And Freeze

While standard slings are useful, Blast Slings are much more adaptable, being used in both stealthy and aggressive combat. The Lodge Blast Sling is the best one out there thanks to a higher handling stat when compared to the Shadow Blast Sling. With this weapon you can lob bombs that detonate on impact, go off after a period of time, or explode when something wanders too close.

The best coils to put on the Lodge Blast Sling are ones that increase base damage followed by something to boost Freeze. This is a great tool for laying down traps and triggering an ambush.

8 Shadow Sharpshot With Damage

The Shadow Sharpshot is a great bow for long range sniping. Whether you’re stripping an opponent’s armor, tearing off valuable resources, or getting a headshot on a human combatant, this is a great weapon. It can be fired from a great enough distance that some enemies wont know where you are.

RELATED: Horizon Zero Dawn: 10 Hidden Areas You Didn’t Know Existed

The best coils you can put on a Shadow Sharpshot bow are ones that improve base damage. The Tearblast arrows don’t benefit from Tear boosts and you’re not firing this to apply elemental effects so straight damage is the way to go.

7 Shadow Rattler With Damage

The Rattler may not be the most popular weapon among the fanbase, but under the right circumstances it can be a powerful tool for bringing down human enemies or dealing decent damage to larger foes. The Shadow Rattler is the best version, as it has better stats and allows the use of Freeze Bolts.

For modifications, go with bonus damage to get the most bang for your buck. The Rattler is handy when facing multiple opponents or when you need to deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time. But honestly it’s up to your playstyle and preferences whether this weapon ranks higher or lower.

6 Banuk Sharpshot Bow With Damage

While the Shadow Sharpshot Bow is very powerful, the Banuk Sharpshot Bow has all the same stats and abilities, with the exception of better handling, making it the superior Sharpshot Bow. Once again it’s best used in long range combat either to stealthy take out units, knock off resources and armor, or to pump a few arrows into an opponent charging from long range.

Like the Shadow Sharpshot coils the Banuk Sharpshot Bow will benefit most from coils that improve the base damage. Odds are you’ll have laid traps to trip up the enemy as they charge towards your location, assuming they even get that far so elemental bonuses aren’t needed.

5 Improved Stormslinger With Handling And Damage

The Improved Stormslinger is a weapon unique to the Frozen Wilds DLC and is immensely powerful. It fires Storm Bolts that deal excellent damage and apply Shock. Up to 20 rounds can be fired before needing to reload. Player’s can overcharge the weapon for greater damage, though doing so will shock Aloy, so use it sparingly.

RELATED: 10 PS4 Games That Make the Console Worth Buying

The best coils for this weapon are ones that improve handling and base damage. The improved handling is nice thanks to its awkward accuracy and the damage will make each round count. Simply get in close and pepper the enemy with your Storm bolts.

4 Lodge War Bow With Freeze

The War Bow is a strong weapon meant to apply status effects like Freeze, Shock, and Corruption. The Lodge War Bow is a strong version that can be acquired in the mid game by completing the Weapons of the Lodge quest. You’ll use this to apply status effects from afar before following up with another weapon like a Hunger Bow.

The best coils to put on the Lodge War Bow are those that apply extra Freeze damage. This is why you’ll be using the bow after all so having that extra boost to your elemental effects is handy for raising its DPS and effectiveness.

3 Banuk Champion Bow With Damage

While the Lodge War Bow is powerful as soon as you get into the Frozen Wilds, you’ll want to look into getting the Banuk Champion Bow, as it’s the strongest War Bow before New Game Plus. You’ll need 12 Bluegleam, but its enhanced elemental damage and the ability to overdraw shots for greater damage is too powerful to pass up.

RELATED: 10 Sci-Fi Games To Play If You Loved Horizon Zero Dawn

Any coil that improves the base damage is handy for the overdraw feature and makes this a truly terrifying bow to start fights with.

2 Banuk Striker Bow With Damage And Maybe Fire

The Hunter Bow is a very versatile weapon and will serve you in any battle, making it arguably the best bow in the game. The Banuk Striker Bow is the most powerful version and is worth every bit of Bluegleam you spend to obtain it. Whether fighting at short or medium range and capable of applying straight forward damage, fire damage, and tear this is a great weapon to have.

For your coils, go with something that improves damage, you could also make a case for having added fire damage coils, as this will be your weapon of choice to apply fire damage throughout the game.

1 Improved Icerail With Damage

This close range weapon is an absolute beast and considered essential by the fanbase for hunting fierce machines like Fireclaws and Frostclaws. The Improved version is the best and will require completing the quests For The Werak and Geared Up: Icerail before you can purchase it with Bluegleam. This weapon will blast enemies at close range with Freeze damage and is the quickest way to apply the frozen status effect. This version will also deal impact damage thanks to the Ice Cannon.

When modifying this weapon choose coils that will increase its damage to improve its DPS capabilities. When ready freeze up your enemies and then blast them with the Ice Cannon.

On Sunday, there were 769 new infections reported in mainland China, the National Health Commission said early Monday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 2,744, including 461 in serious condition.

There were also 25 more deaths and 5,794 suspected cases across the country.

Reuters reported that Hainan province confirmed an 80-year-old woman died after being infected, marking the province’s first fatality in the rapidly spreading outbreak, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Mr Li, the most senior government official to visit Wuhan since the outbreak started, was there to inspect efforts to contain the pandemic and spoke with patients and medical staff, the Chinese government said in a statement.

Official images show Mr Li wearing a green face mask and a blue protective gown over a dark suit as he spoke to medical workers in similar garb.

He was visiting the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, where most patients infected with mysterious coronavirus had been warded.

“As you put in all your effort to heal (patients), you must protect yourselves too,” he told hospital staff, according to local official newspaper Changjiang Daily.

China’s finance ministry and National Health Commission extended 60.33 billion yuan (S$11.8 billion) to help contain the spreading virus, according to a statement on the ministry’s website seen by Reuters.

Wang Xianliang, director of Wuhan's religious and ethnic affairs bureau, on Jan 26 became the first government official to die from the coronavirus infection, reported Chinese financial news outlet, Caixin. He was 62.

While a small number of cases have been reported in about a dozen other countries, including four in Singapore, there have been no fatalities.

Most of the patients infected were either from Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located, or had travelled to the area in recent weeks.

The State Council, China’s cabinet, said on Sunday that it would extend the Chinese New Year holidays by three days in a bid to curb the spread of the virus through reducing human movement.

Schools, including kindergartens, will also be delaying the start of term.

The week-long Chinese New Year holiday is usually a time for hundreds of millions to travel -- either back home to see relatives or on vacations -- but many cancelled their plans either due to virus-related travel restrictions, or for fear of contracting the disease.

Wuhan and several cities in Hubei province are under a virtual lockdown, with severe restrictions in place including the suspension of public transport services.

This further tightened on Monday when the city said it would be shutting down passport and visa services till Jan 30. But the city’s mayor said that before the lock down on Jan 23, 5 million people were able to leave the city for holidays and other reasons.

In an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang said shutting off the city was a “very difficult decision”.

Wearing a mask the right way up this time — he came under fire on Sunday for wearing the protective gear incorrectly — Mr Zhou said containing the virus has been the city’s top priority.

“But we know it’s for the good of the country in this very urgent time. If it can help stop the spread of the disease, it doesn’t matter if my name goes down in infamy,” he said.

Some in Wuhan have volunteered their own vehicles to ferry patients to hospitals while others have volunteered to cook for hospital staff who have been shunned by food delivery services for fear of contracting the virus.

But some villages in Hebei province have taken things into their own hands by preventing outsiders from entering, even going as far as to build mud walls as barriers, showed images on the Twitter-like Weibo. The Straits Times has been unable to independently verify the pictures.

Images from Hubei province have shown overwhelmed hospitals and long lines for treatment with dwindling medical supplies. Smaller provincial hospitals had earlier put out a call for donations for medical equipment including masks, goggles and protective suits.

Supplies have gradually streamed in and the army also mobilised close to 1,000 medics to reinforce overwhelmed hospitals.

Chinese leaders have called for transparency in managing the crisis, after public trust was eroded by the cover-up of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.

The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it remains unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday he was travelling to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus.

While the WHO has stopped short of declaring it a global health emergency, many question whether China can contain the epidemic, which has already spread to four continents.

Hubei Governor Wang Xiaodong said at a news conference on Sunday he felt “agonised” and responsible for the outbreak, although his comments sparked anger on Weibo, China’s equivalent to Twitter.

“He thinks one sentence of apology will be enough to solve the problem? Let’s await the judgment of the people of the country,” one user posted.

Some of China’s biggest companies have been affected by the outbreak, with hotpot restaurant chain Haidilao International Holding shutting stores across China from Jan 26 to Jan 31.

Gaming giant Tencent advised staff to work from home until Feb 7, and e-commerce firm Alibaba removed sales of overpriced face masks from its online Taobao marketplace as prices surged.

Reuters reported that the Shanghai government said companies in the city are not allowed to resume operations before Feb 9, an official at the municipality announced at a press conference on Monday.

The measure is applicable to government and private companies but is not applicable to utilities and some other firms such as medical equipment companies and pharmaceutical companies, the official said.

EVACUATIONS AND SCREENING

Reuters reported that airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health experts have questioned the effectiveness.

Australia, France, Italy, Japan and the United States have all said they are working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan.

And Japan is expected to arrange a charter flight as early as Tuesday for citizens who wish to return from Wuhan, Kyodo news agency said.

France said it expected to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area, Reuters reported.

The Spanish government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from Wuhan, Spain’s Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Monday, while the British Foreign Office said that it was working to offer British nationals in Hubei province an option to leave, Reuters reported.

AFP reported that anxious foreigners in the locked-down city say they are stranded at home, running out of food and desperate to leave, as governments scrambled to draw up evacuation plans.

“In the past week we’ve not been able to go out and buy anything to eat,” said Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University.

He told AFP that he and his classmates had been living on biscuits, and his embassy had not responded to requests for help.

“We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,” Jamalzai said.

Thousands of foreign students and other international residents live in Wuhan, a normally bustling transport hub in central China home to a huge steel and auto industry.

Mainland Chinese travellers from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan city will be barred from entering Malaysia temporarily, the Prime Minister's Office said Monday.

""Based on the latest information, the Malaysian government has decided to temporarily suspend the (no visa) entry, Visa on Arrival, e-visa and manual visas to Chinese citizens from Wuhan and Hubei,"" the PMO said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Macau said it will deny entry to visitors from Hubei province or those who visited the province 14 days prior to arrival unless they can provide documentation showing they are not infected with the virus.

Mongolia has closed its border crossing with China to cars and pedestrians and shut schools, AFP reported.

WFP aims to fight food insecurity, restore livelihoods of rural populations, eliminate isolation and inequity in South Sudan by constructing and rehabilitating trunk and feeder roads.

Road projects aim to enhance farm-to-market access in areas with agricultural potential and Improve rural connectivity to social services such as heath, education and other basic services.

How many projects are ongoing or completed?

Some 13 trunk road rehabilitation works have been completed totaling around 1,000 km of roads across the country. The Kuacjok Bridge (120m) was completed in 2019. Emergency road repairs were conducted in Maban on the Kaya - Banketa road. Currently, WFP is constructing 13.2 km of the Saura-Li Rangu road and a 14.8 km stretch of the Li Rangu- Nzara road both in Western Equatoria. The project for construction of the 48 km Torit-Magwi road in Eastern Equatoria commenced in early 2020 whilst works are ongoing on the Bor - Ayod road.

Are any other activities implemented under this programme?

WFP also repairs and constructs complementary feeder roads with community participation and conducts community sensitization, monitoring and evaluation as part of the operation. These are important to ensure that communities and authorities are informed about ongoing activities. It also allows WFP to monitor and evaluate the impact projects have in their areas of operation.

Why does WFP build roads at all?

In the past, WFP had difficulty reaching people in need of food assistance. A project started in 2004 to create access to those in need (2,600 km of trunk roads, as well as bridges and structures were repaired or maintained between 2004 and 2018).

Improved access to markets and social, health and education services increase the overall wellbeing of people. This is one way to fight food insecurity and assist the people of South Sudan to meet their own food and nutrition needs.

Improved infrastructure complements other activities such Food For Assets (FFA) and Smallholder Agriculture Market Support (SAMS).

FFA assists food-insecure communities through community-based asset creation activities including the restoration of productive capacity, community infrastructure development, natural resource management, climate change adaptation, and skills development (such as creating community access roads, vegetable gardening, tree planning, and training).

SAMS strives to connect smallholders to markets and enhance their livelihoods. Proper and reliable roads ensure that farmers have this opportunity by facilitating access.

How do you ensure road maintenance?

WFP is cooperating closely with authorities at national and state levels. This cooperation includes capacity building of national and state government staff as well as local community members, especially for maintenance works. Each feeder road project includes a maintenance programme of a duration of six months to one year after construction works have been completed.

Stakeholders (including donors, the Government and implementing partners) are consulting on a country-wide maintenance strategy to ensure roads are maintained after they have been handed over to the Government.","WFP aims to fight food insecurity, restore livelihoods of rural populations, eliminate isolation and inequity in South Sudan by constructing and rehabilitating trunk and feeder roads.

MANILA – The Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Zero Hunger is set to meet this month to discuss the government’s ultimate goal of eradicating hunger and achieving food security in the country, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Wednesday.

In a media interview, Nograles said this is the first time the member-agencies of IATF on Zero Hunger will meet since President Rodrigo Duterte created the body through Executive Order (EO) 101 inked on January 10.

Nograles, however, did not mention the date of the upcoming meeting.

“The first big meeting ng (of the) task force on Zero Hunger will happen this month also,” said Nograles, chair of the IATF on Zero Hunger.

“We will be identifying the different measurables, the different deliverables, the targets, the outcomes, the indicators. Para meron tayong mga target (We will do that so we will have targets) per year all the way up to year 2022,” he added.

Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that around 5.2 percent or 5.5 million Filipinos were unable to meet their basic food needs in 2018 due to inadequate income.

The figure, however, was lower compared to 9.2 percent reported by the PSA in 2015.

By virtue of EO 101, the IATF on Zero Hunger is tasked to ensure that government policies, initiatives, and projects on attaining zero hunger will be “coordinated, responsive, and effective.”

Member-agencies of the task force are departments of Social Welfare, Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, Budget, Education, Environment, Health, Labor, Local Government, Trade, and Science; Presidential Communications Operations Office; National Economic and Development Authority; and Commission on Higher Education.

Nograles said the scheduled meeting among members of IATF on Zero Hunger would also pave the way for the creation of a technical working group that will take a comprehensive plan on the implementation of National Food Policy (NFP).

“We will already be forming the technical working group to map out already the national food policy roadmap,” he said.

The NFP, according to EO 101, will outline national priorities based on a comprehensive understanding of the problem of hunger and related issues.

The NFP, which will also provide a roadmap for achieving zero hunger, should include initiatives to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.

Apart from the NFP, a memorandum of understanding on the implementation of the Enhanced Partnership against Hunger and Poverty (EPAPH) program was also signed in December 2019.

The EPAPH includes provisions for the institutional feeding programs; credit support to community-based organizations; and capacity-building and productivity improvement for community-based organizations.

The EPAPH also pushes for nutrition education; establishment of agricultural facilities and technologies, food hubs, and other infrastructure facilities; mobilization of funding, technical and research assistance from development local partners; and advocacy and education.

Nograles said there would be launching of EPAPH in all regions to meet the government’s goal to free more Filipinos from hunger.

On Wednesday, the Cabinet secretary said around 32 provinces with high hunger incidence will be given “special attention” to reduce hunger by 25 percent when President Rodrigo Duterte’s term ends in 2022.

It sounds like an ambitious goal, but the term may hide loopholes that can delay real climate action and drive land grabs and hunger

Launching the 2020 UN climate summit (COP26) this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for international action to achieve global net zero emissions by 2050. A coalition of British air travel companies, Sustainable Aviation, swiftly announced plans to go net-zero carbon by mid-century.

Real action to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions is crucial if we’re to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C and avert catastrophic climate change. This means polluting economies must undergo a total transformation within ten years.

Companies stepping up to take climate action is a positive first move, but it’s important to be mindful of the approach being taken. “Net zero emissions” may sound like an ambitious goal, but the term can hide a multitude of loopholes that can delay real climate action and drive devastating land grabs and hunger in the Global South.

While the intent may seem positive, there is a deeply concerning reason the UK aviation industry can pledge a net zero target while still planning to expand Heathrow and increase overall flight numbers.

“Net zero” refers to achieving an overall balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere.

But instead of actually cutting emissions, fossil fuel companies and governments, joined by increasing numbers of multinational corporations, can use the term “net zero emissions” to evade their responsibilities and continue polluting, business as usual.

By relying on trees and unproven technologies to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to compensate, they can continue to pump out greenhouse gases – for decades.

Distant 2050 goals allow governments to delay real climate action for another 30 years.

It will take political bravery to really respond to the climate emergency, and ensure we can meet the goal of limiting planetary warming to 1.5°C.

But this is not the only problem with net zero targets.

Most net zero goals assume that an untested technology called Bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) will be implemented and scaled up so as to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

The concept is based on burning biomass from tree plantations in power plants, then using technology to capture the resulting CO2 emissions and store carbon, most likely underground.

This amounts to crossing our fingers that as-yet-unproven technologies will somehow come good and can solve the climate problem without the need for any real system change.

But there are major technical challenges with BECCS. It is incredibly risky for governments to put the fate of the planet in the hands of a technology that might never work.

And even if BECCS does end up working effectively on a large scale, it would require vast areas of land for tree plantations, fuelling huge land grabs and hunger in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Some estimates suggest that using BECCS to stabilise global temperatures at under 2°C of warming, would require nearly 1 billion hectares of land. To put this into context, global crop production currently covers 1.5 billion hectares.

If implemented on a large enough scale to address the climate crisis, removing CO2 from the atmosphere with BECCS would end up harming poor and marginalised communities in the Global South – those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis but who are already suffering the most.

'REAL ZERO' NEEDED

ActionAid’s report Caught in the Net raised real concerns about net zero targets being used to delay climate action back in 2015.

If the term “net zero” had been defined early on to mean rapid greenhouse gas reduction to near zero, with the remainder of emissions balanced out through restoration of biodiverse ecosystems, it might have served as a useful goal to drive real transformation.

But now the term is so vague that companies and politicians can use it to disguise their lack of real action while we head towards a disastrous 3-5°C warmer world.

Already millions of people across southern and eastern Africa are facing a hunger crisis that has been exacerbated by climate change, with the worst drought the region has seen in 35 years, flooding, cyclones and a locust invasion – in which poor women and girls are among those most affected. Communities in Australia continue to be devasted by unprecedented bushfires.

As climate activist Greta Thunberg recently pointed out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, we need “real zero”, not “net zero” emissions.

The COP26 Glasgow climate talks in November this year are a crucial opportunity for leaders to convert the energy and outrage of ordinary citizens, led by young people, into bold government responses that match the scale of the climate crisis, and support those most affected.

Part 1 crimes -- including arson, homicide, manslaughter, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft -- saw an overall decrease for the the fifth consecutive year.

The FBI, which tracks these offenses nationwide, chose these offenses ""because they are serious crimes, they occur with regularity in all areas of the country, and they are likely to be reported to police.""

Porch said the continuing decline is an indication the department is on the right path.

""We set out for a 5-percent reduction and met that by 6.3. We're very proud to have met our goals in 2019.

""But it really comes down to a police department to be able to be proactive as opposed to reactive,"" said Porch, a two-decade MPD veteran who took the chief's role in April 2019.

Porch said the decrease in the most serious crimes have come as a result of numerous variables, including proactive policing, programing with the youth, seeking treatment help for drug addicts rather than incarcerations and the department's crime lab.

Porch said he was most proud of the reduction for theft crimes -- robbery, burglary and larceny.

""With shoplifting and theft, all that stems from the drug trade,"" Porch said. ""When you have drug addicts out shoplifting stealing and committing those offenses, that can really weigh a city down.""

Overall however, Porch said, he doesn't like to put too much stock in the numbers.

""It's exciting to celebrate the small things,"" he said. ""But we still deal with violent crime. The youth and groups of people that make up nearly 2 percent of the population, make up about 90 percent of the crime in the city.

""So I'm very leery of those numbers. They look fantastic but they could flip in the matter of a year,"" he said.

Through the Focused Deterrents Program, Porch said the department is continuing to work with individuals to steer them towards a less criminal lifestyle.

The police department has been tasked with focusing on gun crimes in Mansfield.

""There's still the violent crime that is not changing or (offense numbers are) going up,"" he said. ""When arguments happen, it's not an assault, it's 'let's go get guns' then it becomes felonious assaults and manslaughters and serious crimes.

""There's a lot of things I believe we still need to be focusing on which is violent crime.""

According to Sheila Bradshaw, records supervisor for the department, there were 20 incidents of aggravated assault or felonious assault and one murder with a firearm in 2019.

Porch said detectives and patrol officers have been told any case with a firearm is the department's top priority. There were four shootings in Mansfield during the first month of 2020.

""We're on the scene and doing everything we need to do to follow that up right now,"" the chief said. ""And no one goes on until the leads are dead and we've lifted every rock.""","MANSFIELD -- Mansfield police reported a 6.3 percent decrease in the most serious crimes in 2019, but Chief Keith Porch said he doesn't want to focus on the numbers.

Zero Hedge on Friday wrote that Twitter had notified the site that it had violated the social media platform's ""rules against abuse and harassment."" That followed a report by BuzzFeed that Zero Hedge had shared the identity and personal information — including the email and phone number — of a Chinese researcher it claimed might know about the source of the virus.

The article, posted under the pseudonym ""Tyler Durden"" (the fictional character played by Brad Pitt in the movie ""Fight Club""), was titled ""Is This Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?"" It included a photograph of a scientist at Wuhan's Institute of Virology and suggested that anyone curious about the epidemic might want to pay him ""a visit.""

Facebook also banned Zero Hedge in 2019, with the blog saying at the time that it didn't know why the social media company was prohibiting its content. Twitter, Facebook and other social media companies have vowed to remove accounts spreading misinformation about the virus, which has killed 361 people in China and one in the Philippines. The crackdown on Zero Hedge also comes as the coronavirus has fueled anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, with hoaxes touted by conspiracy theorists shared widely online.

""The account was permanently suspended for violating the Twitter rules,"" a Twitter spokesperson said to CBS MoneyWatch in an email. The company told other media outlets that Zero Hedge's Twitter account, which had about 670,000 followers, was suspended for violating its ""platform manipulation policy.""

Launched in 2009, Zero Hedge publishes news and commentary about the financial markets, with many articles reflecting a right-wing or libertarian viewpoint. In November, it wrongly reported that the head of the Ukrainian gas company in focus in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial had been indicted by Ukraine's prosecutor general.

Bloomberg News in 2016 reported that Zero Hedge's three main writers at the time were Colin Lokey, who quit the blog; Tim Backshall, a credit derivatives strategist; and Daniel Ivandjiiski, a Bulgarian-born former analyst who is currently listed by Wikipedia as its main editor and publisher.","The financial website Zero Hedge is now barred from Twitter after publishing an article relaying a conspiracy theory that a Chinese scientist might be to blame for the coronavirus outbreak.

24,https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/18716,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Varsity Online,Profile: Oxford Climate Justice Campaign and Cambridge Zero Carbon,"Both groups campaign for their universities to divest from the fossil fuel industry Louis Ashworth

According to People and Planet estimates, Cambridge and Oxford universities have a combined fossil fuel investment of over £440 million.

Most Cantabs are familiar with Cambridge’s Zero Carbon Society, which has organised everything from marches to hunger strikes to occupations in their fight to force divestment.

Zero Carbon’s Oxford counterpart, the Oxford Climate Justice Campaign (OCJC), was thrown into the spotlight last month with the occupation of the quad at St. John’s College, Oxford. The action resulted in a letter of support from alumni, and led to the College making adjustments to their ethical investments committee.

OCJC has been running for eight years at Oxford, where three colleges-Balliol, St. Hilda’s and Wadham- have divested in response to student pressure. Zero Carbon, in contrast, was founded in 2007 and relaunched in 2015. Four Cambridge colleges-Emmanuel, Jesus, Clare Hall and Downing-have taken action on divestment from fossil fuels so far.

In 2015, OCJC had what they describe as a “minor victory, when the University declared a screen on all future investments in coal and tar sands”. However, OCJC told Varsity that this was a “hollow gesture, as it did not result in any money being moved”.

Both OCJC and ZC have published open letters directed towards their respective Universities and signed by hundreds of academics, staff and students. They have also both conducted actions at fossil fuel company recruitment events from corporations such as Shell and BP.

In 2019, Zero Carbon blockaded Cambridge’s BP Institute twice and activists disrupted a lecture being delivered by a BP chemist at the Department of Chemistry. Members of the group also protested at BP recruitment events and at a careers fair.

Zero Carbon has also criticized Cambridge Zero, a climate research program launched by the University last year, accusing it of “greenwashing” Cambridge’s links to fossil fuel industries. The group described it as little more than a “public relations stunt, designed to convince the gullible and divert attention away from the University’s continuing link to oil and gas.”

In November, campaign groups including Zero Carbon faced Vice-Chancellor Stephen Toope, the Director of Cambridge Zero and other members of the University leadership at a divestment debate held as part of CUSU’s Ethical Affairs Conference. While the importance of tackling the climate crisis was acknowledged, the University still stopped short of committing to divestment and presented a divided front on its climate strategy.

At Oxford, over ​800 alumni vowed​ to withhold donations unless the University fully divested, including public figures like George Monbiot and solar entrepreneur Jeremy Leggett. The Cambridge Campaign has been supported by the likes of Rowan Williams and Noam Chomsky.

The two campaigns collaborated on a direct action at the Oxford-Cambridge ​Boat Race in both 2018 and 2019. Last year, they dropped a banner which read ‘Oxbridge come clean’ over Hammersmith Bridge, which was prevented by the police.

OCJC told Varsity that the two campaigns “have frequently been involved in matching actions, that when put together increase the profile of student divestment campaigning… We stand in solidarity as campaigns, and support each other both in person and through amplification on social media”.

OCJC described Zero Carbon as “inspiring and impressive… [we] are glad that our two campaigns complement each other in highlighting the moral responsibility of our country’s most powerful educational institutions. We hope to continue working together in the future.”

Cambridge Zero Carbon commented that “given the unique structure of Oxbridge... [the campaigns] can very usefully point to successes at colleges at the other institution when talking to bursars regarding divestment.”

Following the occupation of St. Johns, Oxford, Zero Carbon issued a statement ’“in solidarity with Oxford Climate Justice Campaign”, saying, “Oxbridge are shamefully lagging behind in their refusal to acknowledge their complicity [in Climate change] and instead take meaningful action.”

“We call upon both Oxford and Cambridge, along with their colleges, to Divest Now!”","Most Cantabs are familiar with Cambridge’s Zero Carbon Society, which has organised everything from marches to hunger strikes to occupations in their fight to force divestment.

26,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deported-parents-separated-children-return-us-advocates/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",CBS News,More parents deported without their kids may be able to return to the U.S. — if advocates can find them,"Los Angeles — Cleivi's youngest daughter, Alison, would not let go of her or the blue welcome poster she made for her father, Fernando Arredondo. Her eldest girls, Keyli and Andrea, scoured the arrivals area for the best vantage point to catch the first glimpse of their father. Cleivi herself was visibly nervous.

Shortly before midnight, Fernando's group of migrant parents, lawyers and faith leaders emerged. Andrea, 14, was the first to see him, but it was 7-year-old Alison who rushed towards Fernando, yelling, ""Daddy!"" One by one, Fernando hugged his daughters before kissing a teary Cleivi and lifting Alison in the air.

""Thank you, God. Thank you, God,"" Fernando said in Spanish, raising his hands and looking upward as he embraced his family for the first time in nearly two years.

The Guatemalan family's three-year quest to live together in the safety of the U.S. finally seemed to be within reach with Fernando's arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on January 22, made possible by a court mandate and advocacy groups like Al Otro Lado. While overjoyed to be back with his family, his thoughts immediately went to the other Central American families who had suffered the same plight.

""We all deserve an opportunity in life,"" he told CBS News. ""And to all the parents who are watching us, who are separated from their children, have patience, have faith and pray a lot because miracles exist.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, believes a precedent has been established following the court decision that allowed Fernando and eight other migrant parents to make a historic return to the U.S. last month.

In his ruling last September, Judge Dana Sabraw of the U.S. District Court in San Diego said Fernando and 10 other parents could come back to the U.S. to reunite with their children and pursue their asylum cases because he found they had been unlawfully deported after being provided false information by U.S. officials or coerced into waiving their rights.

If it can prove the parents were unlawfully deported, the ACLU believes Sabraw could order the return of some of the hundreds of parents the group estimates were expelled to Mexico and Central America after being separated from their children by U.S. officials.

""If we find out they were misled or coerced into giving up their asylum rights, we will ask the judge to have them be brought back as well,"" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU's top immigration litigator, told CBS News. ""I think these nine are a test case for what may happen going forward.""

""Unreachable"" parents

In the summer of 2018, the ACLU formed a ""steering committee"" to locate and interview parents the Trump administration had deported after splitting them up from their kids. Since then, the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and the non-profit organizations Justice in Motion and Kids in Need of Defense have undertaken what Sabraw has called ""Herculean efforts"" to locate these families.

Through phone calls and on-the-ground searches, the committee located Fernando and nearly 500 other parents who were deported after being separated from their children in the spring of 2018 under Trump administration' systematic practice of separating families. Most either chose to have their children sent to them in Central America or waived their right to reunification to allow their kids to continue their asylum cases in the U.S.

In October 2019, the U.S. government revealed it had separated an additional 1,556 children from their parents between the summer of 2017 and the height of the ""zero tolerance"" policy in June 2018. Since Sabraw said these families could potentially be eligible for reunification, the steering committee has spent months tracking them down.

The committee has reached 346 parents or their attorneys. But it has been unable to reach the rest — nearly 700 — since the phone numbers provided by the administration are often stale or outdated.

The committee continues to call 386 of these parents, but it has deemed the rest ""unreachable."" Justice in Motion has led the campaign to find them, dispatching 22 team members to conduct on-the-ground searches in cities and remote villages across Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

The group has tracked down at least 113 parents, and continues to scour the region for the rest, sending 1,100 letters to addresses provided by the government and establishing hotlines for separated parents. When U.S. immigration files don't include a home address, advocates have turned to local public records.

""Defenders are using all manner of transport. Some use motorcycles, motorbikes and scooters. Some need to rent four-wheel drive vehicles, and others are going on foot or bike,"" Nan Schivone, Justice in Motion's legal director, told CBS News. ""There's a lot of effort to actually reach the community of origin, whether it is listed by the government or listed on public record documents.""

Out of the families it has reached and interviewed in their home countries, Justice in Motion said it has identified parents who are still without their children and could be eligible for the same relief Fernando and 10 other parents were granted last September. The non-profit has been referring such cases to the ACLU for future litigation.

""We're finding similar situations, for sure: Families who are still in need of protection, who suffered a due process violation at the moment of separation and in the process of seeking asylum in the U.S.,"" Schivone said.

Fernando said he wants the same opportunity for other parents because he's sure some families have endured ordeals similar to the one experienced by his family before last month's reunification.

""Mommy, they're going to kill us""

After hearing more than a dozen loud, piercing bangs that sounded like explosions, Cleivi immediately worried about her children.

""When I went outside, my son was lying on the ground,"" Cleivi told CBS News in Spanish, breaking down into tears while recounting a tragic episode from April 2017 that has become etched in her memory.

Her 17-year-old son, Marco, was gunned down outside his grandmother's home in a working-class neighborhood in the outskirts of Guatemala City. Standing next to Marco as his body was pierced by bullets was his sister, Keyli, who was getting ready to celebrate her quinceañera, a traditional Latin American rite of passage for girls commemorating their 15th birthday.

""Keyli was next to him. They were together,"" Cleivi said. ""And Keyli witnessed that.""

Cleivi's husband Fernando, then a taxi driver, raced to see his family. ""The scene was horrific when I got to my mother-in-law's house,"" Fernando later wrote in a court filing. ""Everyone was still screaming, and I saw Cleivi holding Marco in her lap. Marco was already dead.""

Two young men had shot Marco multiple times in his head and abdomen, according to a report by Guatemalan police. A photo shows Cleivi on the ground, clinging to her son's body with onlookers and police surrounding her.

""That day changed my life,"" Cleivi said. ""Drastically.""

The family is certain Marco was killed because he and his father were part of a neighborhood watch created to protect their community from gangs.

The day after Marco's burial, Fernando said two armed men warned him that they would kill the rest of his family if he continued talking to the police. ""They knew all our names, where we lived, and how to find us,"" he wrote in a court declaration.

The family said Guatemalan authorities were unable or unwilling to fully probe Marco's murder and could not ensure they would not be harmed. They left their home of 12 years and moved from place to place, but never felt safe.

Cleivi said she realized they had to leave Guatemala when a neighbor was having a birthday celebration. ""They started to set off fireworks. This girl was traumatized,"" she said, referring to Alison. ""She yelled, 'Mommy, they are going to kill us. Mommy, let's get out of here.'""

In February 2018, the family set out for the U.S. through Mexico. But two hours away from reaching the U.S. southern border, Mexican officials escorted Fernando and Andrea off the bus they were traveling in.

Cleivi said she had promised Fernando she would push forward in the event they were separated. So she continued the journey with Keyli and Alison, telling U.S. officials at a Texas border crossing in May 2018 they feared returning to Guatemala.

The family was detained together in a hielera, or icebox, what many migrants call Border Patrol holding cells where they are issued Mylar blankets and sleep on concrete floors. The conditions were particularly difficult for 5-year-old Alison. ""I grabbed a roll of toilet paper and wrapped her from head to toe, like a mummy,"" Cleivi said, remembering one sleepless night inside the cell.

Cleivi, Keyli and Alison spent three days in Border Patrol custody before being released to a local shelter. Fernando and Andrea had reached the same U.S. border crossing less than a week after the rest of the family. But the two met a different fate.

""We all pounded on the cell door""

The father and daughter were separated during the administration's ""zero tolerance"" border crackdown. ""They separated us out of nowhere,"" Andrea told CBS News, adding later, ""They took me to a place with other children. The younger kids were crying and that scared me even more.""

Border officials separated more than 2,800 migrant families before a court ruling in June 2018 brought an end to the practice. Some families, like Fernando's, were separated even after asking for asylum at an official border crossing.

Fernando said his pleas to find out why he had been separated from Andrea went unanswered. ""Around 3:00 am on the day that Andrea was taken from me, all the children who were in detention were lined up outside,"" he wrote in a court filing. ""We could see them through the window of our cell. We all pounded on the cell door, to ask what was happening. None of the officials responded to our questions.""

Andrea spent about two weeks in a government shelter in San Antonio before reuniting with her mother and sister in Los Angeles. Fernando, however, remained detained for three months and was shipped between four different detention centers in Texas and Georgia.

In Georgia, according to court filings, Fernando suffered symptoms of dengue fever and from a urinary tract infection. He lost eight pounds. Growing increasingly desperate, Fernando tried to find solace reading the Bible. ""I prayed a lot to avoid thinking about suicide,"" he wrote.

After weeks in detention, Fernando was told he had failed his ""credible fear"" interview, the first step migrants need to pass to request asylum. ""I was feeling desperately sick, psychologically and physically, and the ICE official made it very clear that there was nothing I could do to get asylum in the U.S.,"" Fernando wrote in a legal declaration. ""I did not know how long they were going to keep me in that dreadful place.""

Fearing prolonged detention, Fernando signed a document reviewed by CBS News in which he declined to request that an immigration judge review the credible fear assessment. He was deported to Guatemala in August 2018 and immediately went into hiding.

Fernando's deportation occurred roughly a month after Sabraw, the judge overseeing the main family separation case, ordered officials to reunite families and to halt the deportation of separated parents. ""Fernando was deported in violation of Judge Sabraw's own order,"" Linda Dakin-Grimm, the family's attorney, told CBS News.

""We're safe here""

While Fernando hid from the gang members who killed his son, Cleivi and her daughters found some stability. She rented a home in the predominantly Latino Florence neighborhood of Los Angeles, where the girls enrolled in local public schools.

Still, Cleivi never stopped worrying about Fernando's safety: ""A part was missing to complete our happiness."" With his return last month, Cleivi said the family's ""puzzle"" is now complete.

The family's lawyer has merged their different asylum cases into one, and their next hearing in immigration court is scheduled for July. Though there is still some uncertainty regarding the fate of their asylum petition, 7-year-old Alison is happy her family is finally living together on American soil.

""We're safe here,"" she said.","""And to all the parents who are watching us, who are separated from their children, have patience, have faith and pray a lot because miracles exist.""

This means 100% of the waste materials leaving the facility are diverted from landfill via GreenCircle’s acceptable means of diversion such as reuse, recycling, or incineration for energy, also known as waste-to-energy.

Perdue Farms has established aggressive five-year environmental sustainability goals, including diverting 90 percent of solid waste generated and not sent to landfills by 2022.

“The certification is important because it aligns with our vision to be the most trusted name in food and agriculture products and our goal to be good environmental stewards. It also continues our decades-long track record of environmental stewardship and responsible management of our resources,” said Vice President of Sustainability Steve Levitsky. “Our waste diversion goal is ambitious, and we chose GreenCircle because they have the most rigorous certification available on the market. There are other certifications that allow a company to say their facilities are zero waste, but they allow up to 10 percent of waste to not be diverted. As a company, Perdue is focused on continuous improvement, and Lewiston is just the beginning. We are planning to have five additional facilities go through the audit and certification process by the end of 2022.”

GreenCircle Zero Waste Diversion certification is designed to help companies demonstrate their commitment to minimizing waste and develop programs to responsibly manage all waste created in their facilities with the goal of diverting 100% of waste from landfills.

To receive certification, Lewiston went through a rigorous audit and assessment process, including an audit of all waste streams, an inspection of all waste receptacles and assessment of all third-party waste management companies to confirm management methods and diversion rates.

Additionally, GreenCircle provided recommendations for improvement based on their findings.

“We commend Perdue’s commitment to transparency and continuous improvement,” says Tad Radzinski, Certification Officer at GreenCircle. “The goal of our Zero Waste to Landfill certification is to help companies understand where they are with waste minimization and zero waste programs. That information enables them to minimize waste and manage materials to reduce their environmental impact.”","SALISBURY, MD (WNCT) Perdue Farms announced that its Lewiston operation is now GreenCircle Zero Waste to Landfill certified.

28,https://www.eco-business.com/news/investors-drop-demands-after-tyson-foods-pledges-zero-deforestation/,"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Investors drop demands after Tyson Foods pledges zero deforestation,"Green Century Capital Management, the impact investment group that was pushing for Tyson Foods Inc. to rid its supply chain of unsustainable practices, has withdrawn its request after Tyson, the world’s second-biggest meat processor, committed to a no-deforestation policy.

Tyson announced last October that it would partner with Proforest, a nonprofit consultancy, to conduct a deforestation risk assessment that will examine its supply chain for palm oil, soybeans, beef, and timber and paper products — key commodities that are major drivers of deforestation worldwide. The results of this evaluation will form the basis of the firm’s commitment to “No Deforestation, No Peatland, No Exploitation,” or NDPE.

In recent years, Arkansas-based Tyson has expanded its international presence from two countries to nine, acquiring meatpacker Keystone Foods from Brazil-based Marfrig (the world’s No. 2 food processor), as well as poultry businesses in Thailand and Europe.

“Given the company’s expanded footprint, the supply chain is being reassessed to identify and classify potential risks.” Tyson’s communications manager, Caroline Ahn, told Mongabay.

Tyson’s operations today span China, Southeast Asia and Brazil — all regions with greater supply chain risks for deforestation and exploitation than in the US In Brazil, for instance, cattle ranching is a major driver of deforestation, while soy production, a primary source of poultry and livestock feed, has been linked to both deforestation and issues of inequality.

When asked if Tyson sources any soy from Brazil, Ahn said, “we’ll be able to share more once our risk assessment is complete.”

Tyson currently produces 20 per cent of the chicken, pork and beef consumed in the United States under brands that include Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, BallPark, Wright, Aidell’s and State Fair. It slaughters and packages 42.5 million chickens, 170,938 head of cattle, and 347,891 pigs every week, according to its website.

“Our deforestation risk assessment will inform the development of a company-wide Forest Protection Policy,” Ahn said. “We expect the deforestation risk assessment to be completed this year.”

To conduct the risk assessment, Proforest is working with Global Canopy and using Trase, a publicly available supply chain mapping platform developed by Global Canopy and the Stockholm Environment Institute.

“The main objective of this work is to categorise the level of risk present in those supply chains and provide recommended next steps to Tyson,” said deputy director of responsible sourcing at Proforest, Rob Bailes.

“ Our deforestation risk assessment will inform the development of a company-wide Forest Protection Policy.We expect the deforestation risk assessment to be completed this year. Caroline Ahn, communications manager, Tyson Foods Inc

Green Century was able to use its investor status with Tyson to initiate the shareholder proposal process. Investors who have held more than $2,000 in stock or 1 per cent of a company for at least one year can submit a shareholder proposal of 500 words or less (though the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed raising this threshold).

The proposal must give a reasonable recommendation for the company to take action on an issue. Once the shareholder proposal is submitted, the company must add the proposal to the agenda for voting at the next annual shareholders’ meeting, per SEC rules. If the concerns in the proposal are addressed before the meeting, the shareholder may withdraw their proposal, as Green Century has done.

Green Century has recorded some major successes through its shareholder advocacy program. In 2019, it collaborated with food services company Aramark to develop a no-deforestation commitment that it plans to implement by 2025. Green Century also pressed Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the US, to adopt a no-deforestation policy covering its private Our Brands label.

Investors are increasingly pressing companies about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and practices. In 2019, in response to the fires in the Amazon, 251 investors representing $17.7 trillion in assets wrote a letter urging “business leadership to reverse the worrying deforestation trends we are witnessing” and to uphold commitments “to end commodity-driven deforestation by 2020.” A majority of companies are not on track to meet these self-imposed deadlines.

“We are seeing an increase in investors who are concerned about ESG policies,” said Green Century shareholder advocate Jessye Waxman. “I wouldn’t say it’s an overwhelming amount, but I am hopeful … I hope it represents a trend.”

The Chennai Corporation has drawn up a comprehensive programme for processing and disposing of the 5,000-plus tonnes of solid waste generated in the city every day, in a scientific manner.

The Solid Waste Department of the civic body has come up with various initiatives like micro-composting, generating biogas, installing incinerators and using plastic waste as fuel for cement industries to dispose of wet and dry waste. The various projects for disposing of waste have already begun, and are at different stages of implementation.

A senior Corporation official, revealing the plans set into motion for managing solid waste, said the aim was to create a ‘zero percent garbage city’ by the year-end. The senior civic official said that as part of ‘zero percent garbage city’, both Pallikaranai and Kodungaiyur dumpyards, located on waterbodies, would be “shut down”, and the legacy waste also cleared by June next year.

The civic body has already given a work order to a private agency for clearing the garbage pile at the Alandur dumpyard, which was shut down several years ago. Bio-mining at the dumpyard, located on the Tambaram-Velachery Main Road, is under progress. The bio-mining plant in operation at the Alandur dumpyard has helped segregate plastic waste and bio-manure. The plastic waste processed from the plant is sold off to cement factories for powering them. The senior civic official said a total of over 5,000 tonnes of solid waste was being generated in the 200 wards, covering 15 zones of the city, every day, with 2,550 tonnes of wet waste and 2,450 tonnes of dry waste.

The civic body has set up micro-composting centres for processing 350 tonnes of wet waste a day. Through vermi-composting, construction of well rings, and installation of biogas and bio-methanisation plants, more than 750 tonnes of wet waste is converted into fuel in a day. Biogas plants are functioning at the Perambur slaughter house and at Amma Unnavagams. The fuel generated from biogas plants is used for cooking at the Amma Unnavagams and powering streetlights.

The civic body has also issued work orders for bio-compressed natural gas plants at four locations, for a total capacity of 350 tonnes a day, at the old central asphalt plant in Anna Nagar, Madhavaram, Pallikaranai marshland and Sholinganallur, along with windrow processing (open-air aerobic process) at two places, for a capacity of 100 tonnes a day. Five locations, including the central asphalt plant, general stores on Wall Tax Road and the two dumpyards in Kodungaiyur and Pallikaranai will have facilities for processing garden garbage, with a total capacity of 400 tonnes.

Recovery centres

For dry waste such as plastic covers and other inorganic waste, the civic body has set up resource-recovery centres at 74 locations, and material-recovery facilities at 110 places, with a total capacity of 250 tonnes. With the trial run of the incinerator plant of 10 tonnes in progress at Manali, the civic body also plans to remove over 600 tonnes of waste in a day, by having six 100-tonne capacity plants at Athipattu, Sathangadu, Mylapore, Ayanavaram, Kodungaiyur and Pallikaranai. The official said that a work order had been issued for setting up an incinerator plant, with a 50-tonne capacity, at the Kodungaiyur dumpyard.

The civic official said that tenders had been called for processing dry waste for fuel purposes, for cement industries, with a capacity of 300 tonnes.","Corporation draws up plans to process 5,000-plus tonnes of solid waste dailyThe Chennai Corporation has drawn up a comprehensive programme for processing and disposing of the 5,000-plus tonnes of solid waste generated in the city every day, in a scientific manner.

The challenge is built on the belief that technology can be a driving force for equality.

In collaboration with Engineering for Change (E4C), a knowledge organization dedicated to preparing, educating and activating the international engineering workforce to improve the quality of life of underserved communities, global software company Siemens is sponsoring Innovate for Impact: Siemens Design Challenge, a competition that gives individuals the opportunity to develop solutions to address fundamental human needs for clean water and adequate food supply.

The competition began accepting applications this week.

""[The challenge] brings together the ingenuity of engineering communities focused on changing the world and the resources of a top global software company,"" says E4C President Iana Aranda. ""By applying human-centered design thinking and powerful digital technologies, engineers and other innovators will be well equipped to address the challenges of clean water and zero hunger and improve the quality of life around the world. We are grateful and fortunate for Siemens' support in this vital endeavor, and excited to see the proposed solutions.""

E4C will run the application and evaluation process. Using its knowledge base, the organization will share human-centered design principles with challengers, as well as a variety of other tools and resources. For its part, Siemens will provide free access to and training on technology tools for digital design and engineering, including Solid Edge software and a new co-creation platform for low-code application development.

""We are proud to partner with E4C to provide engineers with platforms to expand what's humanly possible, creating new spaces to dream, innovate and develop technology to drive sustainable development goals,"" says Siemens USA CEO Barbara Humpton. ""Those who accept this challenge will get to use software and technology that have already reduced product development cycle times by half. But instead of speed to market, engineers can now focus on speed to society, delivering the solutions needed to advance a more equal world in time for 2030.""

The challenges two tracks are zero hunger and clean water. The problems the applicants will set out to solve fall into two buckets. One set of applications will design a postharvest off-grid preservation technology to reduce farm-to-table food loss in lower resource settings that lack electricity. Other applicants will design a low-cost, energy-efficient, scalable technology for desalinating brackish water.

The deadline for applications is Friday, April 3, 2020. Those accepted to the challenge will design their concept in 3D CAD software, iterate their design based on their research, and simulate how their product works.

Winners of the contest will receive $10,000 each.","Two tech heavyweights are joining forces to challenge socially minded engineers and hardware innovators to do something to end hunger and make clean water more accessible.

Steps within the objective include installing solar panels at Kroger Co., BB #:100073 Cincinnati, OH, locations, increasing food donations, partnering with the World Wildlife Fund on wastewater education, investing $10 million in environmental innovation, updating pesticide policies to protect pollinators, launching the Peculiar Picks “ugly produce” line, piloting a mobile market to bring fresh food to underserved communities, and reducing availability of single-use plastic bags.

Kroger also standardized all of its private label food brands for simplicity’s sake and to reduce waste. Other initiatives include a redesigned milk jug to reduce plastic use and partnering with likeminded businesses to promote sustainability.

Once such venture is working with Goleta, CA- based Apeel Sciences for improving the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by adding a plant-based protective layer. Kroger began by carrying Apeel’s naturally-enhanced avocados and was testing Apeel limes and asparagus in its Cincinnati stores.

Another partnership was with TerraCycle, a waste management firm in Trenton, NJ, to use its Loop ecommerce platform. Kroger began piloting the program’s reusable packaging platform, offering consumers more than 100 products in reusable metal or glass containers.

Kroger also jumped into the hyper local fray for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. The grocer paired with indoor grower, 80 Acres Farms, in the Midwest to provide fresh produce for its On the Rhine food court.

Similarly, Kroger joined forces in late 2019 with German grower Infarm to launch mini-hydroponic produce farms to produce greens and herbs within its stores, starting with two Quality Food Center (QFC) locations in Washington State.

Getting results

Kroger announced last August that it had reduced food waste by 9 percent in the first full year of its Zero Hunger/Zero Waste initiative. Among the other accomplishments was diverting 13 percent of waste from landfills; exceeding 40 percent in electric savings; and reducing the plastic resin used in its private labels by 9.1 million pounds. All represented substantial progress toward 2020 goals.

Despite all of this activity, however, some observers believe Kroger is playing catch-up with its key rivals on sustainability.

“Every retailer of consequence wants to tout how ‘sustainable’ they are, and Kroger is no exception,” says Bruce Peterson, president and founder of Peterson Insights Inc., in Bentonville, AR.

Nothing the company is doing sets it apart; instead, Peterson says, these moves keep Kroger in a position to manage potential negative publicity.

“To be perceived as ‘un-sustainable’ can have significant social consequences.”

The “Zero Point” on the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday transformed into a surging sea of migrant workers left with no option but to return home. But while they have a pressing need to do so as COVID-19 has deprived them of a livelihood in the national capital, the main casualty of the exodus is the physical distancing required to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Headed to Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow and in some cases, to destinations in various districts of Bihar, wave after wave of out-of-work migrant workers and their families thronged the location, a few metres from where the expressway connecting Gautam Buddha Nagar to Agra in Uttar Pradesh originates, to try their luck at boarding a vehicle.

Early in the morning, the district administration announced that 200 State-run buses had been arranged to ferry commuters to various locations every two hours from the area. The question “If not this, what else?” was as ubiquitous as the confusion on their faces and the backpacks — packed tightly with the odds and ends they could muster in a hurry — on their shoulders.

“I want to go to Kanpur; since there are no trains available, any form of transport which takes me anywhere close to my destination from here will do at this point. I’m going to die soon any way. If I stay here it will be of hunger, if I contract the infection, I can at least die on my own soil,” Manish Kumar said. He used to work at a cloth factory at Kasna, which has been shut for a week now.

“I have a small wholesale fruits business. The weather changed and all my stock got destroyed because there was no one to supply ice or a place to store my stock. I’d rather go home than go hungry or beg here. What else is there to do?” said Kapil, who was looking to travel home to Agra. A head constable attached to the Alpha 2 police station and deployed on the Expressway said the number of commuters had increased since the government’s announcement. “We are trying to help as many people as we can to get on both private and government vehicles after the announcement this morning. Buses operated by the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation have been deployed. We are trying to ensure that as many passengers as possible get aboard,” he said.

Coronavirus | Similar stories, very personal tragedies

Set aflutter each time a vehicle — whether an SUV, a minivan or a bus loaded with passengers occupying even its roof — would slow down near it, the gathering of over a hundred-odd hopeful commuters would slightly decrease in number every two to five minutes before more would join it, having walked several kilometres to be a part of it.

Being fed vegetarian biriyani and provided water by some volunteers from the back of their vehicles, the workers would thank their benefactors inattentively, their eyes fixed on the road in front of them.

“Things are really bad here... You know what is happening, then why do you keep asking? I’ve told you I’m on my way. I have nowhere else to go, I will come home soon, trust me,” Animesh, a factory hand, said as he broke down while talking to his mother on the phone as he looked down from the elevated arches of the highway he was on.

“They should have allowed us to come here two days ago,” he complained. “For two whole days, both in the morning and the evening, I tried to come here so I could catch a bus or use any other means to go home in Munger [Bihar]. The police beat me every time I tried to reach the expressway. I will get on any bus, any vehicle; I’ll start walking from wherever it drops me,” he said.","As out-of-work migrant labourers try to rush home from the starting point of Yamuna Expressway, physical distancing is a fading mantraThe “Zero Point” on the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday transformed into a surging sea of migrant workers left with no option but to return home.

Policy name: Pay As You Throw

Overview: Since the 1980s, South Korea has made several legislative efforts to reduce food waste. Most recently, in 2013, a law was established requiring food waste to be discarded in biodegradable bags, and a per household fee is charged based on the weight of the waste.

Location: South Korea

Population: 51.3 million

Food policy category: Food waste reduction; Sustainable agriculture

Program goals: To ultimately become a zero-waste society.

How it works: The biodegradable food-waste bags must be put in designated waste collection buckets so that the waste can be weighed.

In many areas of the country, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used to weigh the waste. New residential buildings are supplied with aluminum bins, placed in common recycling areas, for residents to deposit food waste. Each resident is provided with an electronic identification tag to use when disposing of food waste. The weight of waste is determined each time the bin is used, and the residents are charged for their waste at the end of each month.

The food waste is either dried to use as compost for urban gardens or animal feed, or it is burned to generate biofuel. Recycling food waste saves the country up to $600,000 dollars that would otherwise have been used to process it in a landfill or sewage plant.

Buying the garbage bags and paying for the food waste costs a four-person household approximately six dollars per month, and these fees pay for 60 percent of the cost of maintaining the RFID and recycling systems.

Progress to date: In 1986, the Waste Management Law was enacted to encourage the “three Rs:” reduce, reuse, recycle. In 1992, The government established the Act on Resource Saving and Recycling Promotion, which introduced the concept of “polluter pays” by requiring the purchase of the designated garbage bags and establishing the fee for waste.

In the late 1990s, however, the country started to see a significant increase in food waste as a result of higher standards of living, frequent dining out, and more single-occupant households. In 2005, it became illegal to send food waste to landfills.

The most recent legislation, regarding “pay-as-you-throw” for food waste, went into effect in 2013, along with a ban on throwing the liquid remaining at the bottom of garbage bags into the sea.

Why it is important: South Korea is one of the biggest producers of food waste in the world, creating 17,100 tons per day in 2005. The problem is largely due to the cultural concept of banchan, having a variety of side dishes accompanying every meal, which produces a significant amount of leftover food.

Reducing and recycling food waste is important not only for individual finances and the economy in general, but also for environmental purposes. Processing food waste at a sewage plant contributes to the greenhouse gases that are causing the world’s current climate crisis. Globally, food waste accounts for nearly the same amount of emissions as does road transport. In South Korea, however, it is primarily recycled and used as compost, and there are now six times more urban gardens in the capital city of Seoul than there were in 2012.

Additionally, the food waste was processed at sewage plants, the remaining garbage liquids were thrown into the waters along the South Korean coastline at a rate of 3,800 tons per day. The resulting pollution was detrimental to sea life, fisheries, and coastline populations. Moisture accounts for 80 percent of the weight of food waste; therefore, in addition to making it illegal to dispose of liquid waste in the sea, residents are encouraged to reduce the moisture in their food waste before depositing the bags in order to reduce their fees.

Program/Policy initiated: The pay-as-you-throw mandate for food waste was introduced in 2013.

Point of contact: N/A

Similar practices:

Several countries and municipalities in the EU and US have pay-as-you-throw waste programs that include not just food but all solid waste.

New York City has a voluntary recycling program through which food waste is turned into compost and clean energy.

Evaluation: South Korea is now recycling more than 95 percent of its food waste, up from less than two percent in 1995. However, the chair of the Korea Zero Waste Movement Network states that more needs to be done to reduce food waste, because there is now more compost and fertilizer being produced than can be utilized.

In a country with the formal trappings of a democracy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has held onto power for over 20 years while adhering to the letter of the law, or at least the constitution as it applies to the presidency -- and arguably even to its spirit.

This time, it's different.

When he stepped out of the Kremlin in 2008 and back in four years later, Putin was abiding by the rules and using a loophole -- as he essentially called it with a snicker this past December, when he offered his first hint that big changes to the constitution were coming -- that was entirely legal and certainly not designed with him in mind.

In 1993, when Russia adopted its post-Soviet constitution, Putin was head of the external relations committee at the St. Petersburg mayor's office and was perhaps best-known for a legislative probe that called for his firing over an alleged multimillion-dollar kickback scheme.

True, placeholder President Dmitry Medvedev's move to change the constitution months after his inauguration in 2008, extending future presidential terms to six years, did turn out to be tailored to Putin -- who would be facing the end of his presidency this May if terms were still four years long, like in the United States.

But other than that, it was all done by the book -- which is what Olympic pole-vault champion and Putin supporter Yelena Isinbayeva called the Russian Constitution after she was appointed to a committee charged with handling the changes: ""a very important book.""

There was, of course, a great deal of anger over Putin's decision to return to the Kremlin in 2012. The September 2011 announcement that he and Medvedev would trade places the following year sparked protests that grew larger after a December Duma election that was marred by allegations of widespread fraud in favor of the United Russia party, which is Putin's main political lever nationwide.

2008, 2024 -- 2036?

He weathered those protests, however, securing a six-year term in March 2012 and then, as expected, another one in 2018.

That set up the same problem he faced in 2008, with his more advanced age adding a twist: If he were to sit out the 2024 election and run again in 2030, he would be 77 years old at the start of a new six-year term.

Putin likes to use the Russian expression ""Feel the difference,"" often pausing for effect after uttering it, and there is a palpable difference between the path he took in 2008 and the one he has laid out for himself long in advance of 2024.

Back then, he adhered to the existing constitution, something he has seemed very careful to do until now. This time, the constitution is being altered for the express purpose of giving him the option of remaining in power until May 2036 -- when he will be 83 and, if he is still president, will have the longest reign in Russia since Peter the Great.

Putin will presumably still claim that he is adhering to both the letter and spirit of the law. In 2008, he said he had decided on his first day as president that he would ""not violate the existing constitution."" And in fact, he hasn't violated the existing constitution this time --- he is changing it instead.

He is also taking great pains to make it all look not only legal but unremarkable. In his appearance at the State Duma on March 10 to back a proposal that he be allowed to run again, he made statements that seemed aimed at portraying an obviously momentous change in the constitution as a run-of-the-mill procedural issue -- but that it seems safe to say fooled nobody.

Precondition Or Punch Line

First, he rejected the more straightforward of two proposals delivered by Valentina Tereshkova, the former cosmonaut who was the first woman in space and is now a ruling-party lawmaker -- that presidential term limits be scrapped altogether. Then, in backing her second proposal -- that the adoption of an amended constitution set the needle on the number of terms he has served back to zero -- he said it would be fine as long as it is approved the Constitutional Court.

For Putin's opponents, and many other Russians, that sounded much more like a punch line than a precondition.

Even senior officials such as Medvedev have voiced concern that Russian courts are beholden to the executive branch. And the chairman of the Constitutional Court, Valery Zorkin, happens to have been one of the most prominent figures to call for constitutional changes since Putin's reelection in 2018 thrust the ""2024 Question"" to the fore.

An opinion article Zorkin wrote for the official government newspaper a few months after Putin's inauguration was seen by some analysts as a sign that Putin was toying with the idea of changing the constitution to prolong his tenure in office.

Back To Zero

Meanwhile, much of the procedure by which Putin's constitutional amendments will go from submission to the Duma to adoption as law in just over three months -- and about six weeks in the case of the amendment allowing him to rule until 2036 -- is essentially made up, legal experts say.

If the idea of an impartial decision by the Constitutional Court came as a punch line, the premise behind the rule that will enable Putin to run for two more terms if he chooses was widely treated like a joke. And critics unleashed a hailstorm of biting humor in response, posting mocking memes playing on the word used to describe resetting his term count to zero: ""obnuleniye,'"" or annulment.

One Facebook post -- later removed -- showed Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's tomb on Red Square, but bearing the word ""Obnulenin"" instead of just Lenin.

An opposition deputy showed up for the Moscow City Duma vote on Putin's constitutional changes wearing a T-shirt with a crude mashup mixing ""obnuleniye"" with a slang word meaning ""f***ed up.""

There were also jabs referencing the coronavirus pandemic, including one that went: ""Coronavirus quarantine means Putin is barred from leaving the presidency until 2036.""

Peter The Great And The Point Of No Return

If Putin does extend his stretch as president or prime minister until then, he will be Russia's longest-ruling leader since Tsar Peter the Great -- the Westernizer who wrenched Russia into the global mainstream and built the stately, European-style city where Putin grew up 250 years later: St. Petersburg, the Window on the West.

Putin has sometimes spoken of Russia as being part of Europe, but in recent years has increasingly criticized the West and suggested that the values championed in Washington and Brussels are misguided. And with the constitutional changes, observers say he may be taking Russia to an entirely different place -- with few prospects for a rapid return once he is gone.

INFOGRAPHIC: Putin's Long Reign

""A new Russia is taking shape which is more disdainful of democracy -- and takes its cue from many other countries and regimes around the world in being so. Undemocratic but stable China is now openly deemed a more powerful model than Europe,"" Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in an article published on March 11.

""There may still be discussion about a constitution which is still European on the page, if not in reality. But this is a very different kind of Russian state, unashamedly authoritarian in design,"" Baunov wrote. ""If Russia ever wants to return to the European model, it will have to dismantle the entire political legacy that this regime has built.""","To receive Steve Gutterman's Week In Russia each week via e-mail, subscribe by clicking here.

Police personnel were seen tracking down, confronting and occasionally using their batons to “persuade” hapless migrant workers on the Yamuna Expressway to go to shelter homes here on Monday.

In most cases, however, the workers who failed to find transport to their home towns were told to find their own way to the shelter homes without being given transport or escorted. Nor were they provided any assurances, let alone guarantees, that they would not be chased away by police personnel deployed along the route.

The police resumed “strict enforcement” of the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 after two days when the workers were allowed to return to their hometowns across Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Bihar.

Turned away

Those who were unsuccessful in doing so over the weekend, like Ram Kumar and his family of seven, which included four children, sought to try their luck at the “Zero Point” on the expressway, but were turned away. It later transpired that in addition to the “strict enforcement” of the lockdown, the reason for such police action was a proposed visit by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to Gautam Buddha University in the area.

“I was engaged at a factory in Gurugram and couldn’t make it in time till here on Sunday. We reached only this morning; the police hit us twice with their sticks and asked us to find some camp which they have set up for us. They didn’t tell us where exactly it is, though,” Mr. Kumar of Firozabad, near Agra, said.

He and his family were among a dozen people who had, somehow, made their way to the location. A few minutes into their wait, however, a police van ascended the elevated entry onto the highway, the personnel aboard it got down, walked over to the motley group and confronted them before chasing them away. While the others, mainly young men, were able to sprint away to save themselves from being detained, Mr. Kumar, however, was caned twice.

Location of shelter

“My family and I have been engaged in work at Gurugram; how would we know where the location of the shelter which they mumbled while confronting us is,” he asked.

Below the “Zero Point”, the same police personnel confronted Satbir Singh and Anil Singh, who were hoping to travel to Mathura. “We tried to go back day before yesterday and the day prior to that, but there were no buses available or there was no space on those which were plying. So we thought we will try to go back again today. We didn’t know the lockdown was back in place,” Mr. Satbir, now an out-of-work factory hand, said.

Anil, Mr. Satbir’s colleague at the same factory, said the police personnel who confronted them merely pointed towards the opposite end of the highway and asked them to “go to the shelter”.

“They didn’t even tell us where to go. Who do we ask where we are supposed to go without being beaten up,” he asked.

When asked where they were supposed to go, one of the police personnel told this correspondent, “There are camps which are being set up. These people will find them themselves.”","Nor were they provided any assurances, let alone guarantees, that they would not be chased away by police personnel deployed along the route.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

The UN’s Global Goals include Goal 12 for responsible consumption and production, and Goal 13 for climate action. Setting ambitious targets for countries around the world to hit net-zero emissions is a vital part of achieving these goals and tackling the climate crisis. But those targets must be twinned with the present urgency to decrease carbon emissions. Join the movement by taking environmental action action here

While Greta Thunberg watched on, the European Union (EU) has passed its long-awaited climate law that officially enshrines its 2050 net zero emissions target into law.

The “European Green Deal” passed on Wednesday, and is being celebrated by some as having unified 27 member states towards climate action.

“We are turning words into action today, to show our European citizens that we are serious about reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” Timmermans said in a press statement released on Wednesday.

“The European climate law is also a message to our international partners that this is the year to raise global ambition together, in the pursuit of our shared Paris Agreement goals,” he added. “The climate law will ensure we stay focused and disciplined, remain on the right track and are accountable for delivery.”

But activists including Thunberg have voiced exasperation that plans for the future will be akin to “surrender” unless there’s a strategy to lower emissions in the here and now.

One of the key criticisms of the new law is that, while it legislates for a long term commitment to achieve net zero by 2050, it doesn’t currently include a target to lower its carbon emissions by 2030.

That’s despite a letter sent this week from 12 EU countries to Frans Timmermans — the executive vice president-designate of the European Commission, leading the European Green Deal — urging him to lead by example and update the EU’s 2030 commitment “as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest”.

The urgency of the 2030 target is connected to a number of summits over the course of this year that have the potential to be turning points in the fight against the climate crisis.

In November, Britain is planning the largest summit it’s ever hosted, as the UN Climate Change Conference, known COP26, comes to Glasgow. It’s been hailed as the most important climate conference since the Paris Agreement — with 30,000 delegates and 200 world leaders likely to be in attendance to discuss how global climate commitments can be met or even accelerated.

And in September, just weeks before COP26, the EU-China Summit could lay the foundations to determine how successful COP26 will be. China is a crucial stakeholder in global carbon emissions — and the letter from EU countries argued that it was vital to have agreed on a 2030 target well before the EU goes to China to convince them to meet their ambition.

But the present plan will only pursue a 2030 target after a “comprehensive impact assessment” takes place. The Guardian reports that the target will likely come later than September — something that Sebastian Mang, Greenpeace EU climate policy adviser, told Global Citizen would be “too little, too late”, leaving the EU turning up to COP26 in Glasgow “empty-handed.”

“Science tells us that the emission cuts we make today and in the next decade are what will determine whether we avoid the worst of climate breakdown,” Mang said. “The EU Commission’s plan amounts to kicking the can down the road — they need to urgently update it to start tackling the climate emergency sooner, not later,” he added.

""'Net zero emissions by 2050' for the EU equals surrender.""



I have - with 33 other climate strikers from all across Europe - written an open letter to EU leaders ahead of the presentation of the proposed climate law.#EUClimateLaw@CarbonBriefhttps://t.co/kzx425gSwh — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) March 3, 2020

That call to action was backed by a further open letter from 34 youth climate activists including Greta Thunberg, published on Tuesday, that urged the EU to take its carbon budgets seriously.

“If you are to reach the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement our carbon emissions must eventually come to an end,” the letter reads. “And science tells us that process must — drastically — start today.”

Right now there's already a commitment in EU law to cut carbon emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030. Although the European Commission itself has suggested revising that figure to over 50%, that aim played no part in the passed legislation.

“Climate science says that the next 10 years will be make or break for climate action, meaning higher emissions cuts by 2030 are crucial to avoid catastrophe,” Mang continued. ”The later the EU starts making serious reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, the worse the climate impacts will become and deeper the cuts will need to be.”

“This will have a bigger impact on our economy and the lives of ordinary people, making it harder to ensure that the transition to a zero-carbon society is a fair transition,” he continued.","NewsWhy Global Citizens Should CareThe UN’s Global Goals include Goal 12 for responsible consumption and production, and Goal 13 for climate action.

Time perception, in simple terms, is us experiencing events that happen each moment in relation to time. “How long has it been?” The brain processes every moment according to our neural networks. However, time perception is subjective and hence potentially alterable. Time perception is different for different species. Time itself is constant; our perception of it isn’t.

You have surely felt at times that time itself has slowed down or sped up. For instance, boring lectures and horror-inducing scenarios make us feel that everything is slow. It’s real. What’s more, drugs and alcohol too affect our time perception. That’s also why the concept of time perception is studied under both Psychology and Neuroscience.

The image above is from the 2019 indie video game Katana Zero. It features fast-paced sword-fights and a mesmerizing synth-based art design. Although, we’re here for the fictional drug featured in Katana Zero: Chronos. Named after the Greek God of Time, it gifts the player with two crazy abilities. First, the ability to look into the foreseeable future. Second, the ability to “slow down” time for crafty maneuvers. The “slow down” is shown in the image above. Consider it in some way similar to Quicksilver or Flash. After all, we can’t confirm if they are fast or everything else is slow. Still, the point is perception. Everything feels slow or fast.

A drug like Chronos seems science-fiction. To an extent it is. However, there is some truth to it. Real-life time perception altering chemicals exist even if not as potent as Chronos.

Chronos and Reality

Drugs, alcohol, and chemicals affect the passage of time in our minds. Some make time go “faster” while some make it go “slower”. Alcohol and cocaine belong to the “faster” part of the spectrum and weed belongs to the “slower”. Examples include LSD, Nor-epinephrine, Epinephrine, Methamphetamine, MDMA, Zolpidem, Marijuana, etc. Let’s take a look at some of them.

High consumption of alcohol causes the sensation of time flying by. The two major reasons could be the change in dopamine levels and the activities usually performed under its influence. It is also worth noting that time perception also depends on the amount of info you have to remember in a given moment. Simply said, stressful situations such as falling down or car accidents demand quick decisions. This pushes us to our survival mode. As a result, our brain analyzes everything around us. A greater amount of calculations give out the feeling of time being slowed down (kind of like Disco Elysium). This is where Epinephrine comes in.

Memories

Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, “slows” time down. Imagine any close-call situation. Maybe a ball just whisked you. You’ll realize a moment in that instance where time seemed to “stop”. That’s the work of adrenaline. Our survival instinct is strong, it pushes the limits of our physique and senses when time calls for it. You’ll understand faster, you’ll act faster, you’ll react faster.

When you intake more info from a moment, your memory of it also becomes richer. There’s a reason why life for a child is slow but for an adult life just ‘flies by’. As adults, we keep ignoring info we think is unnecessary. Children absorb everything.

A similar “slow” down effect is observed from marijuana. People under its influence feel that more time has passed than it actually has. It affects dopamine levels. Marijuana also affects our system’s circadian rhythm, which is responsible for our ‘sleep-wake’ cycles and hunger. The effects of marijuana have been observed and written about since the 19th century by literary figures and scientists alike.

Future

Present day drugs coupled with control over them through training and we are not too far away from Chronos. Especially considering that there are many soldiers trained from childhood just like the protagonist from Katana Zero. Sure, the foreseeing ability is nowhere near reality but science has some progress in predictive medicines. We still have to completely understand the nature of drugs on our anatomy. However, like we always say, only time will tell.

Only two years ago, it would have been practically impossible to grow apples in this part of Pakistan, 2,500 metres (8,200 feet) up in Gilgit-Baltistan region’s Gojal Valley.

Although the Khunjerab River provides plenty of water to those living in the valleys below, local farmers used to have no efficient way to get it up the mountain-sides.

But the installation of a hydraulic ram (hydro-ram) pump has changed that. It harnesses the pressure of fast-flowing water, such as a river, to drive a share of that water uphill without needing any other power source.

Because the pumps work without electricity or fuel, they are cheap to run and produce no climate-heating carbon emissions.

“Previously, we used to survive on rainwater,” said Shah, a teacher and secretary of a local women’s development group.

“The land used to be barren, as water couldn’t be lifted from the river flowing right next to the area,” she said, digging out weeds from around the bases of young trees.

“ These high-efficiency irrigation systems, which aren’t an expensive technology, can be used to improve the livelihoods of local communities. Haider Raza, regional head Giglit-Baltistan, WWF-Pakistan

Low-cost, sustainable irrigation systems like hydro-ram pumps could be key to helping Pakistan’s mountain communities adapt as climate change drives more severe droughts and floods across the country, environmental experts said.

“The government cannot afford larger irrigation systems,” said Haider Raza of green group WWF-Pakistan, which installed the pump in Khyber village two years ago under a project led by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).

“But these high-efficiency irrigation systems, which aren’t an expensive technology, can be used to improve the livelihoods of local communities,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Encouraged by the results, the United Nations Development Programme gave WWF-Pakistan additional funding to install 20 more hydro-ram pumps in 12 villages.

Each pump is connected to a drip irrigation system that delivers a steady, gentle flow of water to mountain-top crops, using less water than many traditional irrigation methods.

The pumps have helped revive about 60 acres (24 hectares) of previously barren land, benefiting nearly 300 households, Raza said.

Their simple design - consisting mainly of pipes and two valves - means few moving parts to maintain or repair.

Upkeep of the pumps, which cost up to 70,000 Pakistani rupees ($430) to build and install, is easy and affordable for communities, who have welcomed the new systems, Raza added.

Moving monsoon

Seeing the potential for low-cost irrigation to help mountain communities, Pakistan’s government last year approved funding for the Gilgit-Baltistan water management department to install 50 hydro-ram pumps, along with 150 solar-powered pumps.

Those systems should help irrigate 1,050 acres of orchards in nearly a dozen districts, according to Mudassar Maqsood, associate programme coordinator at ICIMOD.

The government’s efforts to bring water to high-altitude communities may also get a boost from nature itself.

Climate experts predict shifting rainfall patterns in Pakistan could in future move the wet season away from its southern and central plains to northern mountain regions.

Muhammad Irfan Tariq, who recently retired from his post as director general of Pakistan’s climate change ministry, said the plains might eventually get less monsoon rain than they do now.

That could lead to a drop of up to 15 per cent in the country’s wheat harvest, he noted, without specifying a time frame.

“Climate change is affecting the agriculture sector now and will continue to do so in future,” he said.

Waste can be a differentiator, sometimes providing unmistakable clues into essential features of a region, and these features may contrast sharply with those of other regions nearby.

“If viewed with a discerning eye, the waste you find in Sholinganallur will be different from what you find in Manali and the one in Alandur can throw up its own set of surprises. In some cases, the difference will be very obvious,” says Alby John, regional deputy commissioner — South, Greater Chennai Corporation.

This understanding seems to have permeated the think tank at GCC, as it is mirrored in recent exercises undertaken by the different zones to add value to the waste gathered in their micro-composting units and material recovery facilities.

Factoring in the differences in the kind of waste they may be dealing with — minor or major, subtle or obvious — Ripon Buildings is noticeably on guard against the danger of micro-managing its “Zero Waste Chennai” progamme at the zonal level down to the minutest fleck and gumming up any evolving mechanisms of innovation.

“Broad instructions are given to the zones and they are allowed to innovate as they go about adding value to certain types of waste,” explains Alby.

With a decentralised approach, a variety of recycling and value-addition narratives are coming out of different regions. While every zone has to deal with the whole gamut of waste generated within its limits, ranging from the basic wet and dry waste to hazardous waste, the potential for sharing less-common stories now seems built into the system.

So, there can be stories of one zone going big on refurbishing old bags and selling them. Another may be promoting the circular economy in other ways: It may be refurbished shoes being put on sale.

Larger initiatives

Besides, GCC is setting up value-from-waste projects across Chennai on a pilot basis, and which again provides unique examples from various regions to look for.

“Based on the success of these pilots, a call on extending them to other regions of Chennai will be taken,” says an official from the soild waste management (SWM) department of GCC.

“In Sholinganallur, Pallikaranai and Madhavaran, work is under way to set up bio CNG plants. In Kannagi Nagar, which is under Zone 15 (Sholinganallur), a unit to derive byproducts from plastic-waste has been established. Here, plastic sheets and table ‘clothes’ are made out of plastic waste. In Manali, a trial run of a plant where incinerated ash from dry waste will be used to create concrete blocks is under way. We are close to starting operations that would involve making of concrete blocks with ash derived in this manner. Five areas across Chennai have been earmarked for setting up five units that would derive by-products such as soft-wood blocks out of garden waste processing. The machinery for these five units have been imported. The units will come up at the Perungudi Dumping Ground, the Old Transfer Station at Nandambakkam, Old Central Asphalt Plant in Chetpet, Old General Workshop in Walltax Road and Kodingayur Dumping Ground,” says the Corporation official.

Three-R tourism

“Zero-Waste Chennai” does have the unmistakable tone of a catch-cry, and if the objective is to get the initiative to grip the consciousness of city residents, it would do well to start familiarisation programmes for residents’ groups and students.

By taking them through these exercises and facilities, the participants can be enabled to see how big a king-pin they are in the process of reducing waste generation, by applying the Three-R philosophy of waste management at source, which is their home.","In some cases, the difference will be very obvious,” says Alby John, regional deputy commissioner — South, Greater Chennai Corporation.

China on Thursday marked a major milestone in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic as it recorded zero domestic infections for the first time since the outbreak emerged, but a spike in imported cases threatened its progress.

(Coronavirus outbreak: All the latest updates)

The stark reversal comes as nations across the world have shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic, with more people now infected and having died abroad than in China.

There were no new cases in Wuhan - the central city where the virus first emerged in December - for the first time since authorities started publishing figures in January, according to the National Health Commission.



Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with more than 40 million other people in the rest of Hubei province entering lockdown in the following days.



The rest of China also enacted tough measures to limit public gatherings.



There were eight more deaths in China - all in Hubei - raising the nationwide total to 3,245, according to the commission.



There have been nearly 81,000 infections in China but only 7,263 people remain sick with the COVID-19 disease.



The global number has shot past 200,000, with more than 8,700 deaths.



On March 10, President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began and declared that the spread of the disease was ""basically curbed"".



On the same day, Hubei officials allowed people to travel within the province for the first time since January, excluding Wuhan.



On Wednesday, Hubei authorities announced they were partially opening its borders to allow healthy people from low-risk areas to leave the province if they have jobs or residences elsewhere. This also excludes Wuhan.



Life has slowly started to return to normal in the rest of the country, with people back at work, factories up and running, and schools in some regions resuming or preparing to go back to class.



But there is concern about a second wave of infections due to an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day.



Beijing and other regions are now requiring most international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.



The National Health Commission said there were 34 more cases brought in from abroad, the biggest daily increase in two weeks, with 189 in total now.



""We should never allow the hard-won and continuous positive trend to be reversed,"" Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on Wednesday.



The disease is believed to have jumped from an animal to humans at a market that illegally sold wild game in Wuhan late last year.



There have also been questions about China's official figures, as authorities changed its methodology to count infections, and the government has endured rare public criticism of its handling of the health emergency.



Local officials initially attempted to cover up the outbreak, with police silencing doctors who had raised the alarm about the emergence of the new virus as early as December.



One of the whistleblowers, Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, died from the virus himself in February, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger on social media.



The first case emerged in Wuhan on December 1, according to Chinese researchers, but it was not until January 9 the country confirmed a ""new type of coronavirus"".



Between January 5 and 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, even as Japan and Thailand declared first infections - a period that coincided with annual political meetings in Wuhan and Hubei province.

The bleak warning comes as deaths from the virus surpassed 170,000 worldwide, with governments anxiously trying to chart a path out of the unprecedented global health and economic emergency.

Debates are raging worldwide over when and how to relax strict lockdowns.

Many leaders fear triggering another wave of infections but are also worried about the mounting economic costs and signs of social tension.

The economic impact of the pandemic could lead to a “humanitarian catastrophe” with the number of people suffering from acute hunger projected to nearly double to 265 million this year, the UN’s World Food Programme warned.

“We are on the brink of a hunger pandemic,” WFP director David Beasley told the UN Security Council in a video conference.

“Millions of civilians living in conflict-scarred nations, including many women and children, face being pushed to the brink of starvation, with the spectre of famine a very real and dangerous possibility.”

The worst-case scenario could see famine in some three dozen countries, he added.

Freezes on whole sectors of commerce are already playing out dramatically on oil markets, where prices have crashed due to the drop-off in energy demand and a supply glut.

The United States is now the hardest-hit country with more than 42,000 people dead and 784,000 infected.

As the economic downturn starts to bite, US President Donald Trump has stoked conflict with Democratic state governors by urging a speedy return to business.

He also drew criticism for a late-night tweet announcing the US would temporarily halt immigration to the country, claiming it would save American jobs — some 22 million of which have vanished in the wake of virus shutdowns.

The vague threat was scant on details but suggested a hardening of his anti-immigration crusade, a move likely to delight supporters ahead of November elections.

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” he tweeted.

Beer and bulls out

In hard-hit Europe, some countries are cautiously creeping out from confinement, though large gatherings appear to be out of the question for the forseeable future. While Germany is allowing small shops to reopen, authorities cancelled Oktoberfest, a beloved beer-swilling festival in southern Bavaria, for the first time since World War II.

Spain also announced it was scrapping its annual bull-running festival in Pamplona, a centuries-old tradition that normally draws hundreds of thousands.

In one week, children in Spain, who have been house-bound for over a month under a tight lockdown, will be allowed to accompany parents on food shopping and other sanctioned outings.

Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has also promised to soon unveil a plan to start reopening the hard-hit country. But in a sign of what lies ahead, the gradual awakening of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first emerged, remains tinged with fear about fresh outbreaks of the disease.

The industrial city was released from quarantine two weeks ago, but many restaurants, for instance, have not reopened or are still only able to offer outdoor seating and takeout.

“We have very, very few customers,” said Han, the 27-year-old owner of a soy drink stall. “Everyone is worried about asymptomatic infected people,” she said. “Business is just not as good as before.”

Singapore, meanwhile, has become a sober example of how infections may ebb and flow, with the financial hub extending lockdown measures Tuesday as it battles a second wave of contagion.

Trapped at home

Elsewhere, there is fear over how the most vulnerable will survive lockdowns that breed their own dangers.

In many parts of the world, including Latin America, weeks of confinement have seen a surge in calls to helplines for victims of domestic abuse.

Eighteen women have been killed by their partner or ex-partners during the first 20 days of Argentina’s mandatory quarantine.

Appeals to helplines have also shot up nearly 40 percent.

“Every day, a women is abused, raped or beaten at home by her partner or her ex,” said Ada Rico, from the NGO La Casa del Encuentro.

“In normal times, we would help her to file a complaint. These days, the urgency is to get her out of the house as quickly as possible.”

Misery on the continent will be compounded by a looming economic recession, which a UN body says will spike poverty rates in the worst contraction in a century.

Oil upheaval

Financial markets continued a roller-coaster ride after the price of a US oil benchmark sunk below zero for the first time on Monday, sending world equities spiralling.

With energy demand sharply down and storage options running out, many traders preferred to effectively pay someone to take the oil off their hands.

The aviation sector has also been hammered particularly hard by the global economic pause, with cash-strapped Virgin Australia announcing it had entered voluntary administration — the largest airline so far to collapse.

Health workers, meanwhile, are still working round the clock under severe physical and psychological drain.

51,https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/health-benefits-ditching-plastic-and-going-zero-waste,"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",State PIRGs,The health benefits of ditching plastic and going zero waste,"On a normal day, I wake up and brush my teeth with a plastic toothbrush, coating the bristles with toothpaste I squeeze out of a plastic tube. For breakfast, I head to the kitchen to make some toast, pulling the bread slices out of thin plastic-film packaging. On my way to work, I listen to a podcast on my phone, which is guarded by a plastic case. Occasionally, I may even stop for a hot coffee in a disposable cup made of both paper and plastic.

It is nearly impossible to go one day, or even an hour, for that matter, without using a product made from plastic. Plastic is essential in our everyday lives, but what do we really know about its impacts?

Most people are familiar with the negative impacts that single-use plastic has on the environment. Plastic pollutes our air, water and land throughout its lifecycle, from the resource-intensive process used to extract fossil fuels that are then turned into plastic, to the plastic waste that litters our communities and parks, chokes our wildlife, and poisons our oceans. These negative impacts are the ones that the zero waste movement focuses on, and for good reason: plastic is one of the worst and most harmful materials for our environment.

However, plastic isn’t just a nightmare for our wildlife and ecosystems. It also contains toxic chemicals that harm our health. Over a hundred different chemical additives are in the plastic products that we use everyday, and we still don’t know the health effects of all of them.

We do know that at least a few of the chemical additives are toxic and can harm our health. Because of how reliant we are on plastic products in our everyday lives, we are constantly exposed to these chemicals in the food we eat, the water we drink, and even the air we breathe. Two chemicals in particular are most concerning: phthalates and bisphenols.

Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors -- meaning they interfere with the body’s natural hormonal regulation process -- and can interfere with reproductive development and cause infertility. Some phthalates have been linked to cancer.

Like phthalates, bisphenols are also endocrine disruptors. You may be familiar with one specific bisphenol, BPA, because many of our water bottles and hard plastic products now advertise that they are BPA-free. Research has linked BPA to reproductive disorders, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and prostate cancer, and asthma. Exposure to both chemicals is especially concerning during fetal development, infancy and childhood, as they have the potential to affect the brain during development.

So, now what? It can seem overwhelming to avoid exposure to these harmful chemicals once you think about how pervasive plastic is in your life. But by taking a few precautions, you can minimize your contact with toxic plastic chemicals that can leach into your food and drinks and come in contact with your skin.

Especially while many of us spend more time at home, it’s worth reducing your family's exposure to toxic chemicals contained in common household plastics. U.S. PIRG Education Fund has a complete guide on the major sources of toxic chemicals from plastic in your home and how to best reduce your exposure. A few of the tips include avoiding plastic food packaging, swapping out plastic containers labeled with codes 3, 6, and 7, and never heating plastic in the dishwasher or microwave.

Following all of these tips may not be possible for everyone right away. That’s ok!

Phasing some of these suggestions into your life can make eliminating toxic plastic chemicals from your home and diet more manageable and can have health benefits down the line. In the meantime, just be mindful of how much plastic you use, especially plastic that comes into contact with your food and beverages, and eliminate exposure whenever possible. It will benefit you in the long run and have major benefits for the environment, too.","It also contains toxic chemicals that harm our health.

Amnesty International accused the US military on Wednesday of providing “zero accountability” for civilian victims of airstrikes by its Africa command, Africom.

The rights group said its investigations into two February airstrikes that Africom claimed had killed al-Shabaab fighters showed “no evidence” the two victims killed were militants.

According to Amnesty, the victims were 18-year-old Nurto Kusow Omar Abukar, whose house was hit while she ate dinner with her family, and 53-year-old banana farmer Mohamud Salad Mohamud.

“We’ve documented case after case in the USA’s escalating air war on Somalia, where the Africom thinks it can simply smear its civilian victims as ‘terrorists’, no questions asked,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty’s east and southern Africa director.

“Not only does Africom utterly fail at its mission to report civilian casualties in Somalia, but it doesn’t seem to care about the fate of the numerous families it has completely torn apart.”

Africom’s commander, Gen Stephen Townsend, announced on Tuesday that quarterly reports would be introduced on US activities, updating any allegations of civilian casualties and detailing the status of investigations.

Africom claims to have killed several al-Shabaab fighters in two operations over the past two weeks. It said no civilians were killed, though this was disputed in local reports.

The US has already carried out 32 strikes in Somalia this year, compared with 63 in the whole of 2019.

Despite carrying out hundreds of drone strikes over more than a decade, the US has only admitted to killing two civilians in Somalia.

The monitoring group Airwars has estimated, however, that between 74 and 146 civilians have probably been killed. Local media reports suggest up to 300.

Oliver Imhof, the Somalia and Libya researcher for Airwars, said Africom’s announcement of more transparency is a “step in the right direction”.

“The issue of lack of transparency and lack of responsibility is that often local communities become nervous. Local communities not knowing who killed their loved ones causes a lot of anger and can help local extremists recruit fighters from them,” he said.

Imhof said investigations into civilian deaths can sometimes be difficult because al-Shabaab often confiscated phones from witnesses in areas they contro,l but added that discrepancies were also a result of how militaries investigate.

“Usually militaries conduct very little investigation in the field, so a lot of what they do is based on what they can see from the air. Post-strike assessments [are made] only from above, not from the ground. We often advocate for more on the ground assessments,” he said.","Faced with new allegations of killing civilians with drone strikes in Somalia, the US military has announced plans to make its operations across Africa more transparent.
Amnesty International accused the US military on Wednesday of providing “zero accountability” for civilian victims of airstrikes by its Africa command, Africom.
The rights group said its investigations into two February airstrikes that Africom claimed had killed al-Shabaab fighters showed “no evidence” the two victims killed were militants.
Africom claims to have killed several al-Shabaab fighters in two operations over the past two weeks.

The security group ZecOps (via Motherboard) says that one of the two vulnerabilities is a zero-click exploit (no user interaction needed) that can be performed remotely.

ZecOps detailed its findings in a blog post and the most serious vulnerability of the two affects even the latest iOS 13 public release (iOS 12 too). However, Apple has patched the flaws in the most recent iOS 13.4.5 beta that should be released to the public soon.

The zero-click exploit works through the default iOS Mail app and is potentially dangerous as a user doesn’t need to tap or click anything to have their device compromised:

The vulnerability allows remote code execution capabilities and enables an attacker to remotely infect a device by sending emails that consume significant amount of memory.

ZecOps says that it has discovered evidence of the attacks being used in the wild and believes them to be be “widely exploited.”

The attack’s scope consists of sending a specially crafted email to a victim’s mailbox enabling it to trigger the vulnerability in the context of iOS MobileMail application on iOS 12 or maild on iOS 13. Based on ZecOps Research and Threat Intelligence, we surmise with high confidence that these vulnerabilities – in particular, the remote heap overflow – are widely exploited in the wild in targeted attacks by an advanced threat operator(s).

The report details that it appears the nefarious emails sent are then deleted by the hackers after using them to access targets’ devices.

Noteworthy, although the data confirms that the exploit emails were received and processed by victims’ iOS devices, corresponding emails that should have been received and stored on the mail-server were missing. Therefore, we infer that these emails were deleted intentionally as part of attack’s operational security cleanup measures.

One weakness in the flaw is that it requires a relatively large email, which may be blocked in some cases. The founder of ZecOps, Zuk Avraham noted that the exploit doesn’t apply to Gmail or Outlook iOS apps but it’s not clear if Gmail opened through the Apple Mail app are also vulnerable.

On the other hand, this is not as polished a hack as others, as it relies on sending an oversized email, which may get blocked by certain email providers. Moreover, Avraham said it only works on the default Apple Mail app, and not on Gmail or Outlook, for example. (Google did not respond to a request for comment asking whether it would block such emails. Microsoft declined to comment.)

As noted by Motherboard, ZecOps hasn’t found evidence of the exploits being used for mass attacks but rather targeted ones. But if you are concerned about the potential security and privacy issue, you can use another email app until iOS 13.4.5 is publicly released.

The campaign was started by Mukta Kumar, the wife of a seafarer and keen Splash reader.

“As the wife of a seafarer I am used to a life of either waiting for my husband to return or bidding him goodbye. But for the first time, I am worried and helpless, for he can neither come home and nor is he safe there as his ship makes its way to Italy,” Kumar wrote in introducing the petition, going on to highlight the concern many seafarers have that Covid-19 could be brought onboard ships from people ashore, whether it be from a pilot, agent, stevedore or government official.

“Just one infection could spread rapidly as they live in closed spaces. There is no doctor, ICU or ventilator on board. They are too far away at sea to get prompt attention and every country’s medical system is already overwhelmed,” Kumar wrote in calling for a for a zero contact policy for all cargo / port operations and to ensure no one from ashore enters crew accommodation areas.

Commenting on the campaign, David Hammond, founder of the charity Human Rights at Sea, told Splash today: “Families are increasingly and rightly becoming vocal about the necessary safeguarding of their spouses from Covid-19 onboard ships, including access to individual protection measures. Fortunately, today’s online platforms now allow for such concerns to be publicly raised by the ordinary person, and not dampened down, or dismissed behind corporate veils.”

56,https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/california-sets-zero-bail-for-many-offenses-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/,"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Santa Rosa Press Democrat,California sets zero bail for many offenses amid coronavirus pandemic,"California sets zero bail for many offenses amid coronavirus pandemic

People arrested for many minor crimes in California will no longer have to put down money to bail out of jail, part of a series of actions designed to move low-risk criminals out of jail cells and reduce the remaining inmates’ risk of contracting the new coronavirus.

The emergency rule, adopted Monday by the state Judicial Council, will reduce bail to $0 starting next week for most misdemeanor crimes and certain low-level felonies.

“This change will reduce the number of individuals who are currently awaiting trial in county jails,” Justice Marsha G. Slough said during the meeting.

The order will make no changes in bail for people accused of violent felony crimes, sex crimes, domestic violence or violations of court-issued restraining orders, among other crimes, Slough said.

The council, which sets rules for California’s court system, is comprised of more than two dozen lawyers, judges and state policymakers. It passed the temporary bail schedule in a unanimous vote during a virtual, emergency council meeting Monday afternoon.

The temporary bail schedule is intended to establish a uniform bail schedule across the state’s 58 county courthouses, including Sonoma County’s Superior Court, amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, the council said.

It will go into effect at 5 p.m. April 13 and applies to people arrested for new crimes and those awaiting trial. It will expire three months after California lifts state of emergency orders related to the coronavirus, though Gov. Gavin Newsom has provided no date for when that might happen.

Monday’s Judicial Council meeting came on the heels of a separate, locally-driven change to the bail schedule at the Sonoma County Superior Court on Friday, which immediately zeroed-out bail for people in custody on most misdemeanor crimes and some felony offenses.

Under that order, bail for people brought to the Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of misdemeanors was set at $0, except for suspects charged with crimes listed in a penal code requiring defendants to appear in court before their bail is changed.

The same was true for felonies allowing up to a four-year sentence in state prison, unless the crime was an enhancement. The bail schedule for all other felony offenses was unchanged, a text of the Sonoma County emergency order showed.

The statewide bail adjustments approved Monday will void the local order, Sonoma County Presiding Judge Bradford DeMeo said in an email Monday.

The bail adjustments, one of 11 emergency rule changes approved by the Judicial Council on Monday, are the latest in a flurry of local and statewide changes to California’s judicial system amid the coronavirus pandemic. The changes are aimed at striking a balance between protecting the judges, attorneys, clerks and security personnel who work in courtrooms and safeguarding the rights of the accused.

The Judicial Council on Monday also approved rules that will allow defendants to waive their right to physically appear in court at any stage of the judicial process. Instead, they can appear remotely by telephone, through video, or through their lawyer.

The rule will not apply to those accused of murder with special circumstances, such as killings of witnesses involved in court proceedings or murders committed to escape arrest.

The Sonoma County Superior Court late last month began using video in certain, limited cases, including arraignments of in-custody defendants accused of both felony and misdemeanor crimes.

“We are at this point truly with no guidance in either history, law or precedent,” Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye, who chairs the Judicial Council, said Monday. “To say that there is no playbook is a gross understatement of the situation.”","It passed the temporary bail schedule in a unanimous vote during a virtual, emergency council meeting Monday afternoon.

While other cities, like New Orleans, Seattle, and Detroit, have struggled or are struggling with their own dire outbreaks, no city’s toll has generated the fear, the headlines, and the human drama of New York’s battle against the fast-spreading novel coronavirus.

As of Thursday afternoon, the state of New York faced 79,017 cases, roughly a third of all the 213,144 confirmed cases in the United States, and roughly 8 percent of all of the confirmed cases in the world.

The toll of the disease has escalated rapidly, as the city has progressed from mostly business-as-usual just weeks ago to a state where businesses are shuttered, office workers largely dispersed to their apartments, and residents can walk down empty streets that normally bustle with honking cars and trucks. Times Square looks so empty it’s as if tumbleweeds could roll through at any moment.

Email covid@wired.com Some fine print, required by WIRED: By submitting your Covid Spring story you are agreeing to WIRED's User Agreement and Privacy Policy found at WIRED.com. All submissions become the property of WIRED, must be original and not violate the rights of any other person or entity. Submissions and any other materials, including your name or social media handle, may be published, illustrated, edited, or otherwise used in any medium.

The images of emptiness, though, belie a desperate fight taking place largely out of view inside the city’s hospitals and health care centers. Over the course of the week, the New York death toll—and pace—increased daily. Last week, a New Yorker was dying of Covid-19 every 10 minutes. By early this week, that rate had fallen to every six minutes. Then, as of Thursday, a New Yorker was being felled by the virus every 3 minutes and 15 seconds—18 an hour, 432 in one 24-hour period. Altogether, New York’s 2,373 deaths account for more than half of the country’s 4,513 deaths. And the worst, doctors and officials say, is still to come.

That unrelenting toll has overwhelmed many hospitals across the region; videos surfaced online of hospital workers loading bodies into refrigerated tractor-trailer trucks parked outside after the morgues had filled to capacity. New York and the nation beyond watched as the USNS Comfort, one of the country’s two 1,000-bed hospital ships, steamed past the Statue of Liberty on its way to help ease the health care burden in the city.

To understand what life in New York is like—both on the front lines and on the home front—WIRED spoke with medical personnel, hunkered-down office workers, Covid-19 patients, and those who have seen the disease strike down their own family. The following oral history—the third in our ongoing series, Covid Spring—has been compiled from those original interviews, as well as from social media posts, online essays, public statements, and other primary sources, to tell the story of the people of New York in their own voices.

Editor’s note: If you'd like to read previous installments: Chapter 1 of Covid Spring dealt with patients and those on the front lines of the response across the country. Chapter 2 featured the voices of eight Americans who have watched what would normally be some of the biggest and most quintessentially human moments in their lives—births, weddings, loved ones’ deaths—remade and altered forever by the virus’s shadow. Quotes have been edited, copyedited, and condensed for clarity.

I. The Medical Crisis

The view into the worst of the pandemic’s epicenter is limited, both by privacy rules and because hospitals and care facilities have been prohibiting doctors, nurses, or other health care workers from speaking to the public—sometimes threatening termination. For that reason, Jordan Culver, a doctor interviewed by WIRED, is a pseudonym. Others quoted by name below, by other news outlets, have tried to sound the public alarm at risk to their own jobs.

Jordan Culver, emergency physician, New York City: You leave your home and you’re in this new postapocalyptic world where no one’s around. Then you make your way to the hospital, and the emergency department is usually this forgotten backwater; right now, it’s the center of attention. You walk in and you don’t recognize anyone because they’re all masked and gowned.

Michelle Verhiley, ER nurse, New York, via Instagram: Though the city streets are quiet, the ER is far from it. Intubations and deaths from this virus are becoming way more frequent and unfortunately a common daily occurrence we have been witnessing. Yesterday, we pronounced four dead throughout a 12-hour shift.

Colleen Smith, emergency room physician, Elmhurst Hospital, to the New York Times: On a regular day, my emergency department’s volume is pretty high—it’s about 200 people a day. Now we’re seeing 400 or more people a day.

Jordan Culver: We’ve split the emergency department into many units—we’d been thinking that we’d separate out the Covid patients from the other patients there for other reasons. But at this point, everyone has the fucking disease. The really sick people are on one side, the moderately sick are on the other.

You're looking at the owner of a brand new punching bag, oversized chest freezer, pink lava lamp, and a selection of Easter-themed merch – and that was just this morning's purchases. There are a plethora of things to collect, and the sense of needing them all is only exacerbated by seeing the things other players have amassed on their own tropical paradises via social media. Cute outfits strung together with items I've never ever seen, combined with shared snapshots of growing hubs, means that hunger for more items isn't going away anytime soon.

Because of this lust for stuff, many players over the years have suggested that, beyond all the cuteness and anthropomorphic animals, the Animal Crossing series is just one big capitalism machine. It's not hard to prove either. From the way we amass products from Nook's Cranny, the amount of disposable clothing we purchase, to the unending cycle of mortgage repayments, and the fact that everything you do in-game is to basically make more money.

And yet, while Tom Nook is still rinsing me dry and I've spent more Bells on unnecessary items than I'd care to consider, there's actually another element to the Animal Crossing series that puts the focus on the way we interact with the environment and use products for good.

(Image credit: Nintendo)

You may have noticed that there's been a lot of talk of people trying to adopt a zero-waste lifestyle. As much as we're all – hopefully – trying to use fewer plastic products, there are some that are trying to reduce the amount of landfill waste they produce to absolutely nothing. The ethos sees people reducing what they need, reusing as much as possible, and when possible, even recycling less.

It's a lifestyle that, strangely enough, seems to have penetrated Animal Crossing: New Horizons too. In between the constant spending and selling, there's a movement towards this kind of mentality in island life too. It's something I noticed right when I first started the game. All I had to my name was a tent, a handful of crappy camping items, a net, and my trusty flimsy fishing rod. So off I toddled to the closest stretch of water in search of fish, but instead started plucking tin cans and old tires from the depths. Not great for building out the museum.

But, after I'd fished up a couple pieces of rubbish, my little villager had a lightbulb moment, deciding to invent something with the trash rather than simply throwing it away. Over the course of my 200-odd (and counting) hours with the game, I've gained recipes for all sorts of items made solely from trash. A succulent planter made from an empty can and 10 clumps of weeds, some potted ivy for the wall from more weeds and some clay, a thumb piano from an empty can, some wood and an iron nugget… There's plenty that I've made from trash that has improved the overall aesthetic of my island for the better. Even the first pair of new shoes I got in New Horizons were made from a pair of shoes I fished from a pond.

Nook Waste

There are less useful recipes that my little islander has thought up of course, like a tire stack or literal trash bags, to walls and floors that let me recreate a literal garbage dump in my digital home. But, that hasn't stopped the online community from embracing these too. There's a thread flowing through the playerbase that opt for the more disturbing, and regularly hilarious, takes on island life, and objects like this only play into their particular fantasties and aesthetics. It might not be my choice, but I'm certainly here for all the chaos people are crafting.

The same goes for the trading and swap shops that players are running to exchange items and resources with other folks. Pinging out a cheeky Dodo code across social media for people to come and swap items, or fruit, or other such oddities has become a staple of the latest entry in the series. Just today I crafted two cutting boards to swap with someone for the ironwood dresser I needed to craft the ironwood kitchenette I'd lusted over for weeks. Madness, but now I have a kitchen, folks.

Perhaps in this little world where everything serves a purpose, it reflects the idealistic life we all should aspire to live. Yes, we're still going to sell a lot of items to the twins at Nook's Cranny, but at least along the way we've been a little better at making the most of what we've got. Let's hope Tom Nook recycles, eh?","Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a horrible way of making us all need things that we didn't know we even wanted.

The booths’ design ensures complete separation between the subject and the sampler, even down to the air they breathe.

Dozens of these units were designed and manufactured by I.M. Segev Industries in collaboration with engineering and medical personnel at Maccabi Health Services, one of the four Israeli national health-maintenance organizations.

HMO members swipe their membership card on a reader attached to the booth so that results are reported directly to their electronic health record.

After the oral sample is taken with the worker’s hands enveloped in rubber gloves attached to the unit, the gloves are disinfected. This allows a quick turnaround for the next test.

“We would be happy to share our concept with any health organization worldwide in order to support our shared mission of fighting the Covid-19 virus,” said Ran Sa’ar, CEO of Maccabi.

The Israeli Association of Manufacturers made the connection between Maccabi and I.M. Segev. Additional booths have since been manufactured by I.M. Segev for HMOs Meuhedet and Clalit.

“This is groundbreaking work in the global war against the virus,” said Dvora Hassid, head of Maccabi’s central operations.

The video below shows how the booths are constructed and installed.

IDF also makes contact-free testing booths

Until now, all of Israel’s Covid-19 testing has been carried out by Magen David Adom (MDA) in a variety of venues, including at home and at drive-through testing centers.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) Technology and Logistics Division created a mobile lab for MDA containing six testing booths similar to those created by I.M. Segev for Maccabi.

“The booths are built with negative-pressure conditions, which enables the teams to not use full protection gear and reduces the usage of gear,” a commander overseeing the project tells ISRAEL21c.

Most of the testing responsibility is now shifting to the HMOs, which led to increased demand for this innovative solution.

“Following the MDA project, a number of national health insurance providers turned to the IDF to produce similar booths for them,” the commander explains.

“We have created a single booth, mobile or fixed, according to their preference, in order to assist them and enable them to test potential patients as well. We deliver per request.”

Hugging booths

Segev, a family-owned urban furniture manufacturer in Yavneh founded in 1977, tells ISRAEL21c that the phone is ringing off the hook due to international interest in the contact-free testing booths spurred by media attention in France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, the US and China.

In addition, Israel’s Ministry of Defense is interested in producing its standalone units on a large scale.

Fenigson also revealed a new and heartwarming use for contact-free kiosks in the coronavirus age: “hugging booths” now under development for the national organization representing about 300 elder-care institutions.

The hugging booths will employ the same safeguards as the testing booths. Offering embraces rather than swabs, they are meant to ease loneliness for residents unable to be in physical contact with their families.","Unique Covid-19 testing kiosks in Israel let testers take samples without putting on expensive and uncomfortable personal protective equipment (PPE).
IDF also makes contact-free testing boothsUntil now, all of Israel’s Covid-19 testing has been carried out by Magen David Adom (MDA) in a variety of venues, including at home and at drive-through testing centers.
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) Technology and Logistics Division created a mobile lab for MDA containing six testing booths similar to those created by I.M.
“Following the MDA project, a number of national health insurance providers turned to the IDF to produce similar booths for them,” the commander explains.

The virus has been a major worldwide concern, infecting 3,131,659 people across the globe.

Many nations, such as Nauru, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, have reported zero cases because of their remote island geographies. Others, such as Comoros, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan are some the least populated places in the world. Geographically large but mostly empty countries like Antarctica also have reported zero cases as of Wednesday 29 April. The virus is highly contagious but mostly spreads in densely populated areas.

CORONAVIRUS has yet to infect anyone in 33 countries and territories worldwide.

Most countries around the world have reported cases of COVID-19, with 214 of them having been recognised by the United Nations as having at least one case.

Around 190 have experience local transmission, where COVID-19 spreads within the community.

Deaths from coronavirus have been recorded in at least 166 countries.

All countries in North America and the Middle East have reported cases of the virus.

The virus is highly contagious but mostly spreads in densely populated areas.

Five countries and territories say they have managed to eradicate the virus.

Greenland, Anguilla, the Caribbean islands of St Parts and Saint Lucia, and Yemen have all claimed that they have beaten infections.

Each says they do not have any currently active infections and have reported no deaths, despite previously recording cases.

Other countries say they have managed to dramatically reduce the number of new cases.

On Wednesday, China's National Health Commission reported 22 new cases on the mainland, 21 of which came from abroad.

This is a sharp decline from the hundreds and even thousands of daily new cases being tallied until early March.

61,https://www.eco-business.com/news/companies-race-to-net-zero/,"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Companies race to net zero,"From electric corporate fleets and rooftop solar to energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy certificates, there are opportunities aplenty for businesses to decarbonise their operations.

However, even the most progressive companies will find that shrinking their climate footprint is easier said than done. Where charging points aren’t available, companies can have a hard time switching to electric mobility. Co-working spaces can make sourcing renewable power difficult.

Space constraints can shatter dreams of producing one’s own power, and if the hands of firms are tied by burdensome government regulations, there is little they can do, is there? Even if companies can utilise electricity generated onsite, how expensive is it, really?

Corporates need not despair. Policies, practices and tools that can help firms along their bumpy journey towards climate neutrality are out there—they only have yet to be shared widely among stakeholders.

That’s why this year’s Ricoh Eco Action Day Panel will bring together leaders in government, business and civil society for a panel discussion to explore how companies can remove roadblocks to decarbonisation and leverage the opportunities available as they buckle up for the race to net zero.

Taking place on 2 June 2020, the dialogue session will delve into the business models at companies’ disposal to make the switch to green power and electrify transport fleets. It will also explore how firms can ramp up energy efficiency, and whether carbon offsetting can be a cop-out.

“ We hope that this discussion will help corporations seek viable ways to reduce their carbon emissions and switch to renewables, and that the insights gained will be useful for government officials in policymaking. J.D. Kasamoto, general manager, service & environment division, Ricoh Asia Pacific

“Based on the theme “the race to net zero”, the dialogue has three key goals: discuss opportunities and challenges in corporate decarbonisation, identify ways to communicate the need for corporate decarbonisation, and explore regulations that prevent or accelerate the adoption of green technologies,” said J.D. Kasamoto, general manager of the service & environment division at Ricoh Asia Pacific.

Kasamato said the dialogue’s focus on affordable and clean energy was in support of Singapore’s plans to increase solar power use, halve its peak emissions by 2050 and phase out fossil fuel vehicles within two decades.

Cutting corporate carbon

The event comes at a time when pressure is mounting on companies over their contributions to global warming. Corporates that keep operating at the expense of people and the planet in the coming decades risk going out of business, new research shows.

As such, more than 200 firms that have joined RE100, a global club of companies committed to powering their entire operations with renewables, are rising to the challenge, underscoring the momentum that corporate climate initiatives have gained worldwide.

Among them is Ricoh, which was the first Japanese company to join the initiative in 2017. Beyond its efforts to create a circular economy, Ricoh aims to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 63 per cent by 2030, based on 2015 levels, shared Kasamoto.

All of Ricoh’s manufacturing sites in Thailand, Japan and China that assemble its printers have switched to renewable power last year. So have its offices in Singapore, which, in addition, use LED lighting and motion sensors to conserve energy, he said.

“ There can’t be successful business in a world ravaged by climate change. Wander Meijer, director, GlobeScan

“Climate change is being seen by consumers, governments and non-governmental organisations as one of the biggest issues of our time. If, as a company, you want to be trusted by your stakeholders, you need to help tackle it,” said Wander Meijer, director at research consultancy GlobeScan.

Beyond the peril of damaging their brand’s image, companies that fail to act on climate change risk disruptions to their business operations, with erratic weather patterns and water scarcity threatening to wreak havoc on supply chains, he told Eco-Business.

“There can’t be successful business in a world ravaged by climate change,” said Meijer.

Ricoh Eco Action Day is Singapore’s largest and longest-running business-led environmental initiative held in celebration of the United Nations Environment Programme’s World Environment Day (WED) every year. It is observed by calling on organisations and individuals to pledge positive action for the environment in the city-state.

“Having championed sustainability for many years, Ricoh understands that tackling climate change is a collective effort at all levels of society—from national to individual levels. We need robust regulatory frameworks to support green initiatives, and to foster partnerships between the private and public sector for this cause,” said Ricoh’s Kasamoto.

“Therefore, we have been actively involving various corporate leaders, governmental bodies and academic experts in dialogues since our first panel discussion in 2014. We started our first roundtable in 2017 and have been holding it annually ever since,” he continued.

The format of this year’s panel will depend on Covid-19 measures determined by the Singaporean government. It will likely be an entirely virtual event, or a small physical event hosted at Ricoh’s offices where the dialogue will be livestreamed online.

Kasamoto said he hoped the dialogue would produce tangible and long-lasting outcomes, such as new commitments to reducing carbon emissions or increasing the use of renewables and other green technologies.

“When everyone comes together, we can truly make a difference,” he said.","However, even the most progressive companies will find that shrinking their climate footprint is easier said than done.

The event will bring together transportation leaders from around the world to explore the challenges, opportunities and best practices involved in electrifying bus fleets.

The eighth annual conference, to take place at the Hilton Denver City Center, will encompass two days of zero-emission bus (ZEB) programming – including keynotes, panel sessions, break-out groups and an expo – Sept. 17-18, with an optional ZEB 101 class available on Sept. 16. Attendees can expect a series of case studies and debates on the conference stage, as well as opportunities for networking and collaboration throughout the event. This year's conference will highlight the emergence of new markets, such as electric school buses, airport shuttles and university transport.

Bus operators across the country are increasingly turning to electric solutions. These clean vehicles offer many benefits but also bring many new considerations for fleet managers as they are not one-for-one replacements for conventional fossil fuel buses. Since 2011, CTE has hosted the ZEB Conference to educate industry professionals with practical information for making smart, informed electric bus and infrastructure decisions.

The transportation stakeholders attending the 2020 ZEB Conference will include fleet operators, vehicle manufacturers, utilities, hydrogen fuel and charging infrastructure providers, government agencies and more. Last year's conference in San Francisco drew more than 500 attendees from across the globe.

Stacey Simms, a 2019 conference panelist and senior portfolio manager of the Electric Vehicle Initiative for Denver's Xcel Energy said, ""With Xcel Energy striving to be a national leader in fleet electrification, I found CTE's ZEB Conference to be an excellent source of information on what to expect as fleet operators scale up their electric vehicle projects. I'm very pleased the conference will be in Colorado this year, and I look forward to connecting with the local school bus, commercial fleets and transit operators in our service area.""

Xcel aims to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by 2030 and deliver 100 percent carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050.

Denver RTD has one of the largest electric bus fleets in the country, consisting of 36 zero-emission vehicles operating on the 16th Street Mall, a key downtown corridor. Its 9.45-million annual Free MallRide boardings represent nine percent of Denver RTD's yearly total. Denver RTD says it is anticipating the arrival of 17 zero-emission buses in 2022 or 2023 through its current Low-No project, funded by the Federal Transit Administration.

At the state level, Colorado has taken strides to encourage the implementation of zero-emission vehicles. In January 2019, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced his first executive order ""Supporting a Transition to Zero-Emission Vehicles."" Subsequently, Colorado's Legislature has passed bills to support widespread fleet electrification, introduced incentives and investments to facilitate fleet transitions and adopted a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) rule requiring automakers to increase sales of ZEVs by 2030.

In addition, Colorado is leading the electric school bus (ESB) transition by prioritizing and supporting purchases of ESBs with funding programs from the VW settlement funds and Colorado's Regional Air Quality Council. West Grand School District in northern Colorado received a grant from Colorado's Regional Air Quality Council and donations from local electric utilities Middle Parks Electric and Tri-State G&T in February to purchase the state's first ESBs from Bluebird. A few other school districts around the state are expecting ESB deployments starting later this year.

The conference is now accepting abstracts and poster session proposals through the official conference website, zebconference.com. Event registration will open in June.

Platinum sponsors include Proterra, New Flyer and Ballard Power Systems. For more sponsorship opportunities, including the ability to display a zero-emission vehicle during the conference expo, contact Niki Rinaldi El-Abd at niki@cte.tv.

Members of the media interested in obtaining credentials to cover the conference should contact Wendy Noreña at norena@cte.tv.

CTE says it is cognizant of the unprecedented circumstances that the recent COVID-19 pandemic represents. At this point, CTE says it is moving forward with the conference as planned but will continue to monitor the situation. CTE’s first priority is the health and safety of our staff, partners, clients, and fellow zero-emission advocates. CTE will issue a conference update in the event of necessary postponement or cancellation due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the record-low level of near zero, as the Covid-19 fallout continues to ripple through the country.

""The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" the Fed said in a statement after concluding a two-day policy meeting, adding the Fed's policy-making committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0-0.25 per cent, Xinhua reported.

""The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" said the central bank.

The Fed noted that the virus and the measures taken to protect public health ""are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses,"" which have also significantly affected financial conditions.

In order to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Fed will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities ""in the amounts needed"" to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions

The Fed statement came after the US Commerce Department reported earlier in the day that US real gross domestic product in the first quarter contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the biggest quarterly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.

""Overall, economic activity will likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday afternoon at a press conference.

""Both the depth and duration of the economic down turn are extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control,"" he said, adding the central bank is committed to using full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.

65,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/energy/kt-explains-why-us-wti-crude-price-fell-below-zero-and-what-it-means-for-you,"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Khaleej Times,"KT explains: Why US WTI crude price fell below zero, and what it means for you","KT answers some questions you may have about the US oil price falling below zero.

The US crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slumped below $0 per barrel for the first time in history while its peer Brent comparatively remained stable, dropping 9 per cent to $25.57 a barrel. Here is an explainer of what WTI is, and how and why it fell to an unprecedented level on Monday.





1. How many grades of oil are there?



There are three main grades or benchmarks for oil - Brent, WTI and Dubai/Oman. Most of the crude oil prices are pegged to these three benchmarks.



2. Where are oil grades traded?



WTI is a light crude with low density and is 'sweet', as it has low sulphur content. Brent is lighter than WTI. WTI contracts are traded on New York Mercantile Exchange while Brent futures are available on ICE Futures Europe. The Dubai benchmark is marketed on Dubai Mercantile Exchange.



3. What are oil futures and how do they work?



Futures are advance contracts and are highly volatile. Buyers and sellers of crude oil agree to deliver specific amount of oil on a given date in the future. Oil futures are traded because oil extraction and delivery via tankers is a time-consuming process. Since factories and economies need assured oil supply to run smoothly, they sign advance contracts, called futures.



4. Why did WTI price fall below zero on Monday?



The key reasons for the decline in the WTI price was the slump in demand, no storage capacity in the US and the expiry of the future contract. Demand slumped due to the impact of coronavirus on the global economy, while refineries rejected WTI crude supply because storage sprinted to the brim. Under futures contract, WTI needs to be physically delivered while Brent is deliverable offshore. Given logistics and storage constraints in Cushing, Oklahoma (where WTI is stored) for physical crude amidst low demand, traders started selling Tuesday's futures to avoid taking physical delivery. This pushed WTI price into the negative territory on Monday.



5. What is the problem with oil storage capacity?



Due to the massive oversupply on Monday, traders rushed to find storage on land and at sea in what is believed to be the biggest oil glut in history. Fuel storage rates doubled this month in some onshore European and US hubs as traders rushed to secure tanks in the hope of selling their products at a higher price when the coronavirus outbreak eases and demand recovers.



6. What is floating storage?



Oil can be stored in very large crude carriers (VLCCs), commonly known as supertankers. On Monday, oil held in floating storages on tankers reached at least 160 million barrels, including 60 supertankers, which can each hold 2 million barrels. This can be compared with 25 to 40 VLCCs already chartered with storage options at the start of April and fewer than 10 VLCCs in February. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in 2009, when traders stored over 100 million barrels at sea before offloading stocks.



7. Will the fall in WTI price benefit the UAE residents in the form of lower oil prices?



Due to the contagion effect from the fall in WTI and Brent prices, it is highly likely that the benchmarks on which UAE oil prices are fixed each month will go lower. Therefore, we could see lower oil prices for UAE residents in May 2020. UAE retail oil prices are based on S&P Global Platts, which is a benchmark for refined petroleum products. UAE Retail Pricing Committee for Refined Petroleum Products adds margin and transportation/logistics cost etc. to the Platts prices to arrive at the retail prices for refined petroleum products each month. Global Platts price changes are linked directly to the changes in Brent crude.



8. What does it mean for airlines?



For cash-strapped airlines, the decline in crude prices will make it cheaper to operate flights that are already nearly empty as people remain homebound due to the coronavirus.



The plunge in crude futures also indicates that the market does not expect airlines to add back many flights to their slimmed down networks any time soon, said Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth.

Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle ?

What is this?

There are two kingdoms in this world – the Kingdom of Light on a floating island in the sky and the Kingdom of Darkness on the ground below it. Both are supposed to maintain the balance between Light and Darkness, but in recent times the King of Darkness has begun to fail in his duties. Frustrated by the deaths of everyone in his village due to uncontrolled monsters, a young man takes a dying knight up on his offer to go to the capital as his successor in order to become the Prince of Darkness. Meanwhile, in the sky, Queen Iris of the Light uses the powers of the Progenitor Rune to uphold her end of the bargain, even as the King of Darkness' inaction makes her battle appear futile.

Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is based on a game. It's available streaming on Funimation , Mondays at 10:30 am EST.

How was the first episode?

Nick Creamer



Rating:

Though Shironeko Project is another production based on a mobile game, this show is apparently adapting a key prequel event from the timeline of the game itself. What this means in practical terms is that rather than having an obvious “player character” protagonist and a generally open-ended narrative, Shironeko Project actually has a specific core cast, as well a clear story it is intending to tell. These qualities certainly help it stand out from its genre compatriots, though ultimately, this is still an altogether so-so production.

This premiere's greatest strength was likely the conversation that forms its centerpiece, a loose debate held between an impoverished boy who's busy burying his village, and the elderly knight who happens across his work. The exchanges between these two felt distinctive and passionate, and the elder knight's road to feeling genuinely invigorated by the young man's naive ideals felt thoroughly earned. Memorable declarations like “I'll teach you how to improve things without digging holes” are accompanied by some relatively fluid fight choreography, resulting in a sequence that effectively sold me on the protagonist's initial inspiration.

Unfortunately, the rest of this episode doesn't come close to matching the strength of that one sequence. The worldbuilding here hits that awkward mix of “overly convoluted in explanation, overly simplistic in practice,” and the show's central “light versus dark” conceit feels contrived throughout. There's just no sense of substance to this world; it seems unfair to say a videogame-based show's worldbuilding feels too much like a videogame, but if you want audiences to believe in the lives and feelings of these characters, you have to hide the game design seams a little more carefully than this. There are also visual issues throughout; the show's character designs possess little sense of internal congruity, and the characters rarely feel like they exist on the same plain as the show's underwhelming background art.

On the whole, Shironeko Project's premiere isn't exactly terrible, but it also doesn't inspire much interest in continuing the series. Even divorced from the immediate narrative of its source material, Shironeko Project just feels too much like a videogame; and with a world this unabashedly fabricated, it's hard to believe in the feelings of the people who live there.

The main character of Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is the edgiest boy around. He's so edgy that, when he watches his whole village get slaughtered at the hand of vicious monsters (including a bunch of children), he starts digging a mass grave with nothing but a pickaxe to bury every single one of them, a grave that he says “will be deep enough to reach the sky” — he's full of super deep sayings like that. The boy is so edgy that his hair has this super gnarly looking streak of red going right through it, like blood, and I bet he doesn't even dye it — he was just born that way. He's so edgy that nobody ever game him a name, and he never asked for one. It isn't like it matters anyway. Like the Edgy Boy says when a man named Skeers happens upon his dark and tragic existence: “Everyone's the same in the grave, anyways.”

Watching Shironeko Project's premiere is hardly what I would call a good time, because the art is cheap and flat looking, which isn't helped by the incredibly boring backgrounds, which range from such exciting locations as “a burned down village”, to “a cave”, and “some random grassy cliff”. Listening to/reading the show's dialogue is even worse, though, because every single line is determined to convince you that this is a super serious story about death, and revenge, and the never ending battle between light and darkness. Skeers, the old man who just kind of wanders into the unnamed Edgy Boy before challenging him to a fight an immediately dying, explains that the The Kingdom of Darkness is ruled by the King of Darkness, and in order to rid the world of suffering the Edgy Boy must take Skeers' sword and proclaim himself as the Prince of Darkness. Skeers gives Edgy Boy the sword because he failed to take the Throne of Darkness himself, and Edgy Boy assumes the Prince of Darkness mantle because, well, he literally has nothing else to do except for dig a giant grave until he dies. There's also a Kingdom of Light, and a Queen of Light named Iris, and the opening indicates that there is some sort of romance in the cards for Iris and the Edgy Boy, and even though the Queen of Light stuff takes up half the episode, I honestly couldn't tell you what any of it was about, since it all fell right out of my head the moment the episode ended.

By now this point it should be clear why Shironeko Project rubbed me the wrong way so much. It's like peeking at a notebook filled with the hastily scribbled story ideas written by a middle-schooler who has been up all night playing old RPGs and slamming cheap soda. It's a fatal mix of unearned confidence and glaring inexperience, so certain of its own badassery that it didn't even bother going for a second draft. Its really just as shallow and irritating that you would expect from a script that spends roughly half of its time tossing out variations of “light” and “darkness” with reckless abandon without bothering to think of a name for its main character. The first scene of the episode made me think this show was going to be about a war sparked by the star-crossed romance shared between two magical housecats; I'd much rather watch whatever that series might have been than sit through anymore of Shironeko Project.

Saying that this series is based on a popular, award-winning mobile game (which operated in English under the name Rune Story) is technically true but imprecise, as it doesn't feature any of the core characters from the game. More specifically, it is an adaption of the game's third anniversary event, which details the events surrounding a key legend in the game's setting's backstory. That explains why the first episode thoroughly has the feel of a fairy tale in action.

The basics are very simple and straightforward, even as fantasy stories go: there's a world of light and a world of darkness that are supposed to stay in balance and never mix, but one side (or rather, its ruler) is seeking to disrupt this by invading the other side. In the midst of that the newly-minted prince of the aggressor side, who disagrees with his king's actions, is going to encounter and fall in love with the queen of the other side. Since one of the couple is already a ruler, it's not exactly a “Romeo and Juliet” situation, but that doesn't make them any less star-crossed future lovers, and the characterization on the Light side has already made it clear that some of the Queen of Light's supporters won't take kindly to the pairing. Of course, I'm getting ahead of the story here, as the first episode is just laying the foundations for this and an episode or two could pass yet before they ever meet. Still, as retread as the story concept is, there are good reasons why it keeps popping up. Like many, I have always been partial to such premises, so I don't consider it a negative factor here.

And there are definitely negatives here, most especially a visual aesthetic which seems too artificial in a game-like fashion; even many VRMMO settings featured in other recent series feel more organic than this one does. (I am also not a fan of male protagonists who have off-color shocks of hair just to look cool, but that's a purely personal quibble.) Character designs are pretty enough but animation quality is mediocre at best, and the complete lack of graphic displays made certain scenes unconvincing. The one place where the visuals impressed was in the closer, where the reversed contrasts used on the clothing of the two protagonists (the Queen has white with black highlights, while the Prince has black with white highlights) is a neat effect.

There are some other problems as well – the old man dies a little too easily for someone who seemed robust just moments earlier – but those are balanced out by some potentially intriguing elements, such as the difficulty remembering the previous Queen of Light, which strike me as meaningful. Overall, I just can't be as harsh on this one as I probably should be, as the grand, essential story elements here and their presentation are just enough to keep the series afloat for now.

Rating:

There's something very old-school fantasy about Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle 's first episode, and not particularly good old-school fantasy at that. As I watched it, my mind kept trying to come up with what I had read or seen or played before that it was reminding me of, and at last I was forced to simply go with the answer “everything.” (Except, ironically, the light novel I'm currently reading, which is also fantasy and involves a white cat.) The concept of a world of light and a world of darkness tasked with maintaining the balance between them is classic in that it can be traced at least back to Classical mythology, and that doesn't necessarily mean that it can't still be used well – it just means that if this episode isn't doing it, the show's got a problem.

Part of that may be the way the episode is divided between the two worlds' protagonists. On the ground we have an unnamed lad (we'll call him “Boy” since that's how most people refer to him) whose entire village is wiped out by a variety of stampeding toothy monsters, including the kids he was meant to be protecting. Boy is angry and depressed, as well he might be, so of course he has a chance run-in with fate in the form of an unfortunately named old man, Skeers. Meanwhile Queen Iris is up flying around on her angel wings protecting the Light from the fact that the Darkness is encroaching, only Iris is surrounded by people who love and protect her, specifically the siblings Phious, Sheama, and Theo. The differences between Boy and Iris are so stark as to be almost unintentionally comical; yes, Iris has a lot of scary work to do, but she's positively pampered when you look at the hell Boy's life is – I mean, he doesn't even have a name, for crying out loud. The disparity is so marked that it gives the episode the feeling of trying too hard to set up its world, as if it doesn't trust its viewers to be able to believe in its story without a lot of hand-holding, and that's not what I, at least, am looking for in my sword-and-sorcery fantasy tale.

There are a few unfortunate design choices as well, with the most obvious being Boy's shock of red hair, which is presumably intended to look like a red-winged blackbird (or give that impression) but instead looks like he has a major head wound. The darker portions of the episode are also a bit too dark in color, obscuring some details, and if you're prone to headaches, the contrast between the two halves of the world can be a bit much. (I'm also concerned by the lady in the opening whose breasts seem to move independently of the rest of her, but at least that's a familiar visual trope.)

From what I can tell, the anime is adapting the lore of the game (released in English as Rune Story) rather than the actual gameplay, so things may improve from here. I suspect a star-crossed lovers story is going to emerge, so that may make it worth following if you're a fan of that flavor of romance. But if you're looking for a solid fantasy adventure, I might suggest looking elsewhere.","Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is based on a game.

70,https://citizen.co.za/business/business-news/2265686/pac-why-government-should-cut-interest-rates-to-zero-and-increase-spending/,"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Citizen,PAC: Why government should cut interest rates to zero and increase spending,"Lunga Mantashe

Cutting interest rates and increasing government spending must be an immediate plan, and giving the poor money in exchange for productive labour at the end of the virus could provide real temporary relief.

The national lockdown is supposed to stop the spread of the virus, and I hope it is doing so already.

On the flip side, the lockdown has made money move slowly; it is a fact that money has practically stopped moving from buyers to sellers in those branches of the economy which are not deemed “essential services”. Sadly, it has come to a complete halt with respect to a specific category of people, the dejected and dispossessed: the economic nothing – those men who were at the red robot to sell a car-charger, newspaper; hawkers, trolley-pushers, and car-washers. Also those who earn their living through commissions; and the causal and temporary workers are affected. This large category cannot save money; it does not have the money to buy food to eat as we speak: their situation is hopeless under the lockdown. There is, properly speaking, money lockdown on their part.

Clearly, money pronounces itself as a vital part of the economy, now apparently the most important.

This brings us to the following proposition: that the monetary and fiscal policy tools should be used to counterbalance the economic consequences of the lockdown. It is proposed here that the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) through the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) must cut the repo rate to zero and decrease taxes on the poor. An uncritical reader will quickly dismiss these propositions as theoretically problematic and practically dangerous for the economy. This reader, no doubt, belongs to the category of those who consciously or unconsciously subscribe to the current economic model, capitalism, and its caveats in relation to fiscal discipline and inflation targeting. After all, every economist graduates in a capitalist university. What could one expect!

But I want to assure such a reader that the proposition to cut interest rates and increase government spending has always been implemented throughout history for this or that reason; it is not necessarily a new proposition. When wars break out and governments need money to wage those wars, they increase their spending to buy arms, and naturally national debts increase. In other instances, we have historically seen nations such as Britain in 1815, and after world wars, with debts of more than 240% to GDP. Japan for more than two decades has kept interest rates at zero. I am not proposing a fantastic invention; I am proposing these measures to advance a war against hunger, poverty, diseases, and exploitation. Is that too much to ask?!

Having said this, I am not oblivious to the fact that adding more money into the economy may create inflation. Suffice to say that whether there is inflation, and the extent of it, depends on the amount by which more money is added in the economy and the uses to which it is directed as much as it depends on the resource capacity of the country, such as productive labour available. Of course, printing money beyond the nation’s resource capacity could be highly problematic. By increased spending I also do not mean the state needs to increase taxes on the poor to finance its spending; that (austerity) does not work, and the history of austerity by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank against developing nations deprives them of national economic development and becomes a strain on workers and the poor. An economy actually grows when people are engaged in productive labour and have money to buy commodities, not when more taxes are imposed on them.

In this connection, government spending should not be done merely on consumptive grounds, it must have in mind the idea of wealth generation. If, for example, government directed money to a community chicken farming project, the project would generate wealth and increase the state revenue in the long run, while sustaining itself beyond the need for help from government so that loan finances to this community are paid back. Thus, just like the state pumps billions of rands to keep SOEs so must money be pumped into value-creating economic activities.

I must stress that inflation does not follow automatically from the printing of more money: that would be silly to believe. It would be like saying that since the USA has signed a sum of $2.3 trillion (an economic stimulus) into existence, inflation will necessarily follow. Nothing of the (automatic) kind. The issue is one of creating the appropriate conditions for money increase (interest rate cut) to not create unnecessary inflation. This requires other mechanisms such as price ceilings, rationing and the central coordination of economic activity.

I have space to address these mechanisms here. The implication of the last condition is that the SARB cannot be assumed to be independent, as we are often told, nor has it ever been independent: It can either remain an instrument at the hands of ruling minority elites or be turned into the hands of the people.

Interestingly, if to appear to digress, capitalist principles are recognised (in a subtle way) as inherently problematic by the most developed capitalist economy, especially when dealing with crises. For example, the United States of America has a law (the Production Defense Act) which empowers a president to compel companies to divert their resources to much-needed uses, for example, to the production of sanitisers, ventilators, hospital beds, masks, test kits, etc – things that we really need right now. This very act recognises the inherent problem of selfishness of private corporations. It appreciates the disjointed – though not also the exploitative – nature of a capitalist system. It also unwittingly admits that “free market” principles – coordinated by demand-supply-price mechanisms, not by conscious socialist principles – cannot solve social and national crises. And this makes the case for central planning and coordination of economic activities more legitimate.

Cutting interest rates and increasing government spending must be an immediate plan, and giving the poor money in exchange for productive labour at the end of the virus could provide real temporary relief. Yet only a bold Africanist socialist democratic government can attempt these mechanisms.

Powerful 136 hp (100 kW) electric motor with 260 Nm of torque

Easy to use: various loading options and payment via ‘Free2Move Service’ app

View charge status and determine charge planning via ‘myOpel’ app

Unique in segment of compact EV commercial vehicles: Trailer towing possible

The new Vivaro-e is Opel’s first fully electric commercial vehicle. The model comes into the marketplace at an ideal time, as in many urban areas emission-free delivery of goods and services is an absolute must. The Vivaro-e is ideally suited for so-called ‘Last Mile delivery’. Opel supplies the Vivaro-e in three lengths and various bodywork variants. Thanks to its well thought-out construction, the battery-electric Vivaro-e is no less practical than a regular Vivaro van with a diesel engine. Both versions roll off the same production line from the same factory at the Vauxhall/Opel plant in Luton, England. The order books for the Opel Vivaro-e open in June and delivery will start around the end of the Summer. The starting price will be announced shortly.

“As the first electric-powered, light commercial vehicle with a range of up to 330 kilometers according to the WLTP test cycle, the new Opel Vivaro-e sets the standard in terms of ease of use, reliability and professionalism,” stated Opel CEO Michael Lohscheller on its official launch.

The new Vivaro-e is just as versatile as any other Vivaro. At 1,275 kg, its payload is just as good as that of comparable light commercial vehicles with a diesel engine (1,405 kg). Uniquely, the Opel Vivaro-e is the only electric utility vehicle in its segment that can tow a trailer. The maximum braked towing weight is 1,000 kg.

Opel supplies the Vivaro-e with a choice of two lithium-ion battery packs. The basic version has a capacity of 50 kWh and a range of 230 kilometres (WLTP*). The version with a 75 kWh battery offers a range of up to 330 kilometres (WLTP*).

Via a 100 kW DC charging station, the 50 kWh battery is up to 80% charged in just 30 minutes. The 75 kWh battery takes 45 minutes. The user can choose the standard 7.4 kW charger (1-phase) or the optional 11 kW charger (3-phase) depending on the distances covered daily and the time available to charge the battery.

In both cases, the integrated charger guarantees a long battery life, which is guaranteed for eight years or 160,000 kilometres anyway. The supply of charging cables and wall boxes depends on the energy infrastructure of the country in which the Vivaro-e is sold. Opel supports the customer in this from A to Z.

To further increase the ease of use of the Vivaro-e, Opel offers special solutions for electric vehicles, such as ‘OpelConnect’, the ‘myOpel’ app and ‘Free2Move Services’ from Groupe PSA’s mobility brand Free2Move. The services are accessible via handy apps.

The ‘Charge My Car’ function of the Free2Move Services app provides access to more than 140,000 charging stations across Europe, including convenient payments. To make it even easier for customers to find a suitable charging point, Free2Move pre-selects charging stations based on the distance to the charging point, the charging speed and the current charge price of the available public charging points.

With Opel Connect’s e-remote control features, customers can use their smartphone to check battery charge status, schedule a charging session or even cool or pre-heat the interior while the Vivaro-e is still on the charger. Finally, the OpelConnect portfolio provides access to eCall, breakdown calls and many other services, such as retrieving up-to-date vehicle information. LIVE Navigation provides real-time traffic information (36 months free of charge after activation).

Opel has developed the new Vivaro-e for a wide range of customers and therefore supplies various bodywork variants, such as a crew cab, platform cab or passenger version, with payloads of up to 1,275 g and a Gross Vehicle Weight of 2,800 to 3,100 kg. Load volume extends up to 6.6m3. The most compact version (S) with a length of 4.60 metres is exceptionally manoeuvrable and has a remarkably short turning circle at 11.3 metres. This makes the Vivaro-e very manoeuvrable in tight spaces. Thanks to its height of 1.90 metres, the Vivaro-e can also park in most car parks.

Overview of the Opel Vivaro-e length variants:

S: 4.60 metres long, load capacity 4.6 m3 to 5.1 m3

M: 4.95 metres long, load capacity 5.8 m3

L: 5.30 metres long, load capacity 6.6 m3

The standard load capacity is 4.6 m3 and can be increased to 5.1 m3 thanks to the FlexCargo under-seat loading facility. This allows objects of up to 3.32 metres in length to be carried. The length variants of 4.95 and 5.30 metres have a loading capacity of 5.8 and 6.6 m3 respectively. Thanks to FlexCargo, objects – such as ladders – of up to 3.67 or 4.02 metres in length can be transported. The interior – equipped with, among other things, an electric parking brake – has numerous storage compartments and turns into a mobile office in no time at all.

Wide rear doors and sliding doors on both sides provide generous access to the Vivaro-e’s cargo space. The sliding doors can be opened electrically with a foot movement towards the sensors; particularly useful when the user’s hands are full.

Like the version with a conventional internal combustion engine, the electric Vivaro-e is equipped with an above-average number of driver assistance systems that improve driving comfort and safety. In addition to a head-up display, the Vivaro-e also offers Lane Keep Assist, Extended Traffic Sign Recognition, Drowsiness Alert, semi-adaptive cruise control and a collision prevention system with Automatic Emergency Braking.

The Opel Vivaro-e has smart sensors that warn the driver of approaching obstacles at the front and rear and in the blind spot when parking. Depending on the equipment level, the image from the 180-degree rear view camera is displayed on the 7-inch touch screen of the Infotainment system. The infotainment systems Multimedia Radio and Multimedia Navi Pro offer a 7.0-inch touchscreen and smartphone integration via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (once launched by Google in the Netherlands). Multimedia Navi Pro also offers navigation with Europakaart in 3D view.

The electrically powered Opel Vivaro-e is the next step in Opel’s extensive electric model offensive, but also the next pillar in the Vivaro’s success story, which was introduced in 2001. Next year, Opel continues to expand its range of light commercial vehicles with the all-electric Opel Combo-e. From 2024, Opel will offer an electrified version of every passenger car and commercial vehicle.

See also: Brisbane Broncos, Canberra Raiders, Canterbury Bulldogs

Today we look at what the lockdown means for the Cronulla Sharks.

Positives

They have plenty of time to reflect on the first two rounds of the season and take good confidence for the road ahead as not a lot went wrong. The Sharks scored three tries in each of their two clashes against the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Melbourne Storm, only being let down by penalties.

Negatives

Losing by two points regardless of what sport you play is always a bitter pill to swallow and that is exactly what happened in their last game against the Melbourne Storm. The negatives are that they have to wait until June if not September to have another crack as well as tidying up the loose ends as everyone is isolated, disabling them from gaining chemistry.

Financial Position

Cronulla have long been one of the financial strugglers in the NRL over the past few years. The Sharks are backed by the Sutherland Leagues Club but they have felt the strain. The good news is they have $16 million in cash reserves and $30 million in total equity, despite having cash reserves in place they are still feeling the pinch.

Players

There are not too many big names that are off contract at the end of this year, as 2022 seems to be the year when most of the Sharks comes off their deals.

Coach

John Morris isn’t going anywhere in his second season in charge of the Sharks. His first season came as a bit of shock as he took the reins in January right before the season started. After having a full season under his belt, Morris now has an understanding of what it is like in the hot seat. This time though, he is putting a team together that he wants and one that rewards players who work hard in a changing of the guard to unleash a younger generation.

How they would’ve fared in 2020

There is belief that the renewed Sharks could’ve done good things under Morris’ young side in 2020 with the potential to play finals football. They were widely seen as one of the teams in the middle pack that could’ve finished anywhere from 8th-14th.

Where to from here

Maintain their form against the Rabbitohs and the Storm as the young brigade has shown they can match it against some of the finals favourites. They have only been beaten by penalties despite scoring the same amount of tries so they just need to fine-tune some things and reboot with the same hunger they had in March.","See also: Brisbane Broncos, Canberra Raiders, Canterbury BulldogsToday we look at what the lockdown means for the Cronulla Sharks.

Here's a round-up of all the latest developments you need to be aware of:

Dubai lifts 24-hr movement restrictions in Naif, Al Ras

The Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management, headed by Sheikh Mansour bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced the easing of restrictions on movement in Naif and Al Ras areas in Dubai. Public movement in these areas will return to normal between 6.00 am and 10.00 pm and restrictions will be in place only between 10.00 pm and 6.00 am as with the rest of the emirate. The Committee's decision to reduce the 24-hour controls on movement follows the success of efforts to combat Covid-19. According to the Committee, no new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the last two days in Naif and Al Ras. More than 6,000 tests were conducted among residents in the areas in less than a month. The achievement was the result of the combined efforts of all teams involved in the comprehensive sterilisation programme. Comprehensive monitoring and isolation of suspected cases played a critical role in controlling the spread of the virus.



UAE airlines receive requests for refund, rebooking and inquiries

The UAE's carriers have received more than 670,000 requests for refunds, ticket cancellations and inquiries since their aircraft were grounded because of international travel restrictions amid the coronavirus outbreak. Emirates, the largest international airline, on Sunday, April 26, said it has nearly 500,000 refund requests pending and, now, refund procedures have been ramped up. Prior to the outbreak, the airline has processed an average of 35,000 refund requests in a month. Now, it is gearing up to handle 150,000 per month and aims to clear its current backlog by early August. Since regular flights are not operational, the UAE carriers are offering passengers to either extend their tickets, get cash refund, or secure vouchers, which can be redeemed later to purchase tickets. The validity of these tickets and refunds range between six to 24 months.

UAE confirms 536 new cases, 91 recoveries

The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention on Sunday announced 536 new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus. It also announced 91 recoveries and five deaths. The total number of cases in the UAE now stands at 10,349, and the total death toll at 76. The ministry also announced that more than 35,000 new Covid-19 tests have been conducted.

No new Covid-19 cases recorded in Dubai's Naif area

The government's quick response to combating the Covid-19 coronavirus in Dubai's Naif area, including weeks of heightened restrictions, has hugely helped to contain the spread of coronavirus, said a member of the Federal National Council (FNC). Dherar Belhoul Al Falasi, who is also a board member of the Watani Emirates Foundation which oversees the volunteering teams helping government in the fight against Covid-19, on Sunday told Khaleej Times that no new coronavirus cases have been reported in Naif area over the past few days. This is a clear indication that people are adhering to the precautionary measures put in place by health authorities and that government's efforts were working out well, he added. ""The Dubai's Crisis and Disaster Management committee had acted swiftly to put in place measures, including the 24-hour curfew in Naif area to combat the spread of the virus, otherwise the situation would have been disastrous,"" said Al Falasi.

Although It may be premature to evaluate and assess the performance of the leadership of the State of Osun under Governor Gboyega Oyetola in the handling of Corona virus scourge, with available information and my deep knowledge of events in the state over the last four years, I can provide interim assessment of the performance of Governor Oyetola in the on-going war against the Pandemic.

One would not ordinarily relate health issues with war but anyone who has been following events during the lockdown will know that we are indeed at war.

Albeit, it is a war against invisible enemy and without the usual sound of guns and mortar and without the sight of men in military uniform.

At the beginning of the last year of the second decade of 21st century and shortly after the first year anniversary at the helms of Affairs at the State of Osun, Governor Oyetola was just settling down and stabilizing the state’s economy. Governance was moving in the right direction.

Citizens of the State of Osun were wondering about his magic wand and the source of funding for the continuing infrastructural development and fulfillment of all financial obligations of government without compromising social services. It was unexpected, the critics and opposition have not been able to say much.

There is general calmness and quietness in the state while many socio-political commentators were publicly expressing surprise on how the governor is successfully managing the state’s economy. The background to their surprise is known to many of you.

The State of Osun’s investment in necessary infrastructural development and social services (education, healthcare, recreation etc) in the last 10 years with global economic meltdown and recession put a significant financial burden on the government.

The state’s monthly allocation is one of the lowest after all deductions and the state’s IGR is abysmally low, despite government’s efforts. But fortunately for citizens of Osun, Governor Oyetola as the then Chief of Staff to the Governor was very conversant with Osun’s economy and her challenges. When he became the governor, he hit the ground running from his first day in office and Osun citizens are obviously benefitting from that continuity in governance.

While Governor Oyetola’s experience in business and government might have prepared him for what has been described, he wouldn’t have envisaged waging war against an highly communicable and infectious virus.

There was no notice and things happened in rapid succession. Typically, normal government projects take months if not years of planning, and execution are often sequential.

Sometimes, conventional wars take years of preparation with time to stock ammunitions and anyway, most military organizations are always ready, yet most advanced countries still have challenges managing those wars. In the case of Coronavirus war, yes, I call it war because it is actually a war against unseen forces, we only woke up and found ourselves at war. Fighting war against the virus wasn’t on the budget presented by Governor Oyetola for 2020.

I doubt if his contingency funds was even remotely earmarked for fighting a virus that most of us never heard of untll February 2020.

To complicate matters, all the efforts to combat the spread of the virus and treat the infected must be simultaneous. None of the efforts could wait for the other. Such efforts are quite challenging for most managers. The isolation centres must be ready while strategy for containment must be implemented concurrently.

The treatment for those infected must be continous. The state must be locked down and people must be cared and catered for. While government expenses skyrocketed due to the above situation, revenue became zero. The allocation from the federation account continued to go downward due to slump in oil price at the international market.

The usual selective need-based bailout by Federal government could not be activated because most states are affected. Yet, the government has no excuse not to deliver on all activities to win the war against Corona virus.Many Osun citizens could not even understand what is going on. They perceived stay at home order as punishment from government. They considered isolation as a favor to the government and moreover, they believed they were immune from the virus by the name of Jesus and Allah. They queried government order to stay at home when their ancestral oracle already predicted that we could not be infected.

While the Governor is busy with technical issues, he was being criticized by the suffering masses. How could anyone think properly in the face of such pandemonium?Yet, the government of state of Osun under Governor Oyetola managed the situation very well and carefully. For anyone that knows him, it won’t be much of a surprise.

He is calm and always cool, so that could explain why he is composed in the midst of genuine confusion and national emergency. Without such traits and long term crisis management experience, it would have been difficult to manage the situation as he is doing.

We have heard about the frustration of leaders in the most advanced countries with better resources and even preparedness at this COVID-19 era. Thus, it may not be too early to appreciate our Governor for his efforts so far and for him not to relent until lasting solutions arrive.

It is very easy to criticize, but anyone in position of power and responsibility in our society will appreciate the efforts of our leaders. I have great challenge in sharing a bag of rice per unit in my community and I sincerely don’t want the nightmare of sharing 6020 bags amidst many other highly important activities of a governor. When masses are crying of hunger, where is the time for quality control of items supplied by indigenous suppliers.

We, as citizens should demonstrate reasonable level of responsibility and honesty as we demand from our leaders. How do we identify the poor and those genuinely in need among us? How well are we making the work of our leaders easy? We know ourselves and our type of society. Waging war against Coronavirus is not ordinary, we need to encourage our leaders whenever they perform extraordinarily.

The Governor and his team have performed very well in handling the scourge of Corona virus and we should all abide by the state, federal and international rules and regulations to assist us in finding lasting solutions to this virus and end the war.

The WFP Centre works closely with regional and national stakeholders (governments and institutions) to expand food and nutrition security policies and programmes from a multi-sector perspective, particularly social safety net programmes that include school feeding linked to local agriculture and nutrition. Starting from the Brazilian experience in this area, the WFP Centre fosters food and nutrition security solutions for countries to deliver long-term development benefits for children and vulnerable populations in the Global South.

DEVELOPING CAPACITIES TO DELIVER ZERO HUNGER ON THE GROUND

Achieving a world without hunger is part of the global development agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by UN member states in 2015. SDG 2 sets to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. More specifically, its goals are to: end hunger, attain food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.

World Hunger is on the rise. Evidence from the “The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018” report confirms this fact. The number of people who suffer from hunger has been growing since 2015, returning to levels from almost a decade ago. In absolute terms, this translates into 821 million undernourished or chronically hungry people in 2017, 1 in 9 people worldwide, with higher incidence of food insecurity in Africa and Asia. Children constitute one of the most affected groups by malnutrition. Nutrient deprivation has an immense impact on the health status of children, affecting their physical and psychosocial development, as well as impacting their future opportunities and productivity.

Stunting among children remains unacceptably high. In 2017, almost 151 million children under five (22 percent) were stunted. In Africa, the situation is particularly worrying in the sub-Saharan region, where an estimated 24 percent of the population reportedly suffered from chronic food deprivation in 2017. In addition, more than 38 million children under five are overweight.

Tackling poor nutrition contributes to stronger health in populations and their economies. The “Cost of Hunger in Africa” study, already conducted in 14 countries, indicates that economies from these nations suffer an estimated annual loss associated with child undernutrition equivalent to 1.9 percent to 16.5 percent of GDP.

Investing in human capital can build up significantly a country’s competitiveness in a fast-changing world. Developing human capital provides workforces for the more highly-skilled jobs of the future, which can push for more continued growth and renovate the direction of economies. Human capital is essential for a country´s future, in terms of people, economies, societies, and for global balance. When countries fail to invest effectively in human capital, the costs are massive, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable people.

SCHOOL FEEDING IS A KEY DRIVER OF CHILD NUTRITION AND A HIGH RETURN INVESTMENT IN A COUNTRY’S HUMAN CAPITAL AND LOCAL ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT

Research shows that school feeding is cost-effective and offers multiple and multi-sectoral benefits. School feeding programmes have important impacts in children’s education, health and nutritional status. School feeding improves vulnerable people’s food security and nutrition, and strengthens smallholder agriculture. When school feeding programmes purchase food from local markets, they have the potential to enhance farmers’ access to income-generating activities, diversify national food production, generate stabilizing impacts on local agricultural production, and contribute to local economic development. School feeding supports local capacities to withstand and recover from shocks, and boosts local economies via home-grown school feeding.","DEVELOPING CAPACITIES TO DELIVER ZERO HUNGER ON THE GROUNDAchieving a world without hunger is part of the global development agenda.

78,https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/zero-fare-transit-kansas-city-case-study-free-public-transportation,"Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",State PIRGs,Zero Fare Transit Kansas City: A case study in free public transportation,"Each year, pollution from cars, trucks and other vehicles cuts short an estimated 58,000 lives, and increases the risk of lung cancer, stroke and heart disease. Cars are much safer than they used to be, but each year, motor vehicle crashes still kill an estimated 40,000 Americans and seriously injure 4.5 million. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation -- our cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles -- now surpass every other source of carbon pollution.

As most of us are staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, we’ve seen massive reductions in driving, leading to cleaner air, reduced global warming emissions and even cities closing to streets to allow more people to get out to walk and bike. But if we don’t make big, permanent changes when we emerge from the COVID-19 lockdowns, we can expect things to go back to normal.

Returning to the status quo after the COVID-19 lockdowns is not sustainable. Transportation in the U.S. needs a serious shakeup. We drive more and own more cars than other major industrialized countries. To build an America with cleaner air, safer roads and a more livable climate, we need to drive less. We need to give people more options for getting around, and make the cleanest, greenest and safest options the most convenient, pleasant and affordable.

Enter: free public transportation.

Nationwide, public transportation ridership has been on the decline since about 2014. Cities across the country, looking to meet climate goals, reduce air pollution and alleviate congestion are trying to find ways to reverse that trend and increase ridership. One thing some cities are exploring is making public transportation free.

There are some obvious upsides to free public transportation. It makes riding more affordable, more attractive and more convenient. People don’t have to worry about the cost, or having a fare card or having exact change. It can speed up the boarding process because it eliminates the lines at the front of the bus. Cities and transit agencies can save money on creating and repairing fare collection systems. And where it has been implemented, there often have been positive ridership gains.

But going fare free can also create a challenge for already-cash-strapped transit agencies. Each agency’s books look a little different, but fare revenues often make up a significant portion of the operating budget. So in order to implement free fares, that revenue needs to be made up in some other way.

This, by itself, doesn’t have to be a problem. There are a lot of options to raise revenue for investment in public transportation: increasing or implementing things like a gas tax (where state law would allow it), carbon taxes, tolls or congestion pricing, business taxes or transportation fees, to name just a few. But without a plan for making up the revenue, providing free services can be a problem.

Fare-free transit will not solve all of our problems. In order to sustain high ridership numbers and make a lasting impact on the climate and public health, transit agencies need to provide good, clean, frequent and convenient service. There need to be enough buses or trains running frequently enough to handle the increased ridership without overcrowding. Buses and trains need to meet people where they are, and go where people need to go. All of this requires investment.

Around 100 cities worldwide have implemented fare-free public transportation, and while several U.S. cities have implemented temporary fare-free policies during the COVID-19 crisis, very few U.S. cities have fully taken the plunge. One of the few exceptions is Kansas City, Mo., which, in December 2019, became the first major city to pass a resolution to make all of its buses free to ride.

Cities across the country are waiting to see how Kansas City’s experiment ultimately plays out. But here’s how it’s going so far.

Kansas City’s Zero Fare Transit Plan: A case study

Kansas City’s Zero Fare Transit plan is ambitious, and could drive up ridership on the city’s buses if implemented well. But, even in the project’s early stages, there have been bumps in the road.

The city is rolling out fare-free transit incrementally. So far, fares have been eliminated on one fixed-route bus along the east side of the city, as well as for students and veterans. That makes about 25 percent of Kansas City’s ridership fare free. But Kansas City’s size, budgetary issues, geographic constraints and historical sprawl have presented challenges for a full-scale rollout.

Who will pay the bills?

The most notable challenge is funding. Nothing is truly free (perhaps free transit is a misnomer, zero-fare transit may be better): The total cost of going fare free will be around $8 million per year. While the city council unanimously voted to implement free fares, it remains unclear where much of that money will come from. In order to run a fare-free system, the city needs to balance the lost fare revenue alongside increased ridership leading to maintenance costs, labor costs and operational costs.

In the 2020 budget, which began May 1st, the city has dedicated $4.8 million to support a fare-free transit system. The current plan is to make up the other $4 million in private funding. The city is hoping to secure private sector investment, but there are likely better ways to ensure sufficient funding. Businesses are going to benefit from a public service like fare-free transportation, meaning an additional business tax and/or parking or transportation fees might make sense. These are tactics Kansas City has employed before, with the RideKC Streetcar.

In fact, the RideKC Streetcar provides Kansas City with its own mini-case study in fare-free transit. Unlike the zero-fare bus policy, this one was fully funded from the start. The RideKC streetcar, which was completed in 2016, is free to ride. The streetcar service is funded through three key sources. First, the city council added $2 million a year in their budget for the streetcar. There is an additional sales tax levied on the properties along the streetcar route due to the benefits of riders being dropped off in front of their businesses. Additionally, there is a tax on parking spots that are not attached to a restaurant or business establishment. The streetcar, with it’s dedicated sources of funding, has been a success and an expansion is being planned.

A tale of two cities

The lay of the land of Kansas City poses a potential geographic hurdle to fare-free transit. The metropolitan area is split down the middle between two different states with several municipalities using a connected transit system (KCATA). When Kansas City, Mo., fully implements zero-fare buses, the question remains: What will happen when the buses cross state lines? One idea has been to implement a region-wide sales tax, with revenue dedicated to KCATA. However, Johnson County, Kansas, which lies across the state line, is currently working to reduce their fixed-routes, and so there are slim hopes that they will cooperate with a metro-wide fare-free transit system (although they are expanding microtransit options). Until this issue is resolved, only KCATA buses originating in Kansas City, Mo., will be fare-free.

Will increased ridership break the system?

KCATA currently has just enough buses to handle current ridership while providing relatively reliable service. The idea of fare-free transit is that it will get more people out of their cars and onto buses in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and traffic issues. To be able to handle that new ridership and maintain reliable service, KCATA needs to be prepared to increase frequency or the number of buses they will be running. That is going to require additional investment in new buses, new drivers and new maintenance expenses. The city doesn’t yet have a plan for simply making up the lost fare revenue, let alone making all of these additional improvements. For fare-free transit to work, the city must have a plan for greater investment in an expansion of the transit network.

The land use and suburban sprawl in the Kansas City metro area also pose a reliability problem for increased KCATA service. The current population of Kansas City is roughly the same as Kansas City in 1950. However, that same number of people now live in an area with five times the land area due to suburban sprawl. Back in 1950, Kansas City had one of the most comprehensive trolley routes in the United States. But as the city grew outward, and people spread out over more space, it became harder for a transit agency to serve all of them conveniently and efficiently. Even if the bus is free, if it doesn’t meet people where they are, they aren’t going to be able to ride.

While the Zero Fare Transit plan for Kansas City, Mo., is an exciting development for the city as well as the future of fare-free transit, it has not been without its bumps along the way. The largest hurdle has been the budget, but if successful, Kansas City may be on its way to transitioning from a car-centric city to one that gets people out of their cars and into public transportation. Cities across the nation that are considering going fare free should look to Kansas City and learn from its experiences when developing their programs.

By the declaration, world leaders would make 12 commitments and assert that multilateralism is “not an option but a necessity.”

The co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the text, Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden, circulated the zero draft on 14 May 2020. They plan to convene a virtual consultation to discuss the draft on 22 May. That meeting will include a briefing from the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advisor on preparations for UN75.

We will place women and girls at the center.

The introduction to the draft declaration describes the need for a strong UN and notes that the UN presently faces “the largest global challenge in its history,” referring to the COVID-19 pandemic. It recalls that the UN was established to save future generations, and it has had many achievements: “Every day, countries, citizens, private sector and civic actors use the platform provided by the United Nations to make life better” for humanity and the planet. However, the introduction continues, the UN also has “had its moments of disappointment,” which points to the need for greater action.

The UN75 Global Conversation initiated by the UN Secretary-General in late 2019 has elicited people’s concerns and aspirations, the text notes; the UN Member States “are here to respond.” The introduction also underlines that the pandemic shows that “we are only as strong as our weakest link,” and that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity and in every country’s national interest.

The declaration then sets out twelve statements of commitment, which the co-facilitators indicate respond to views expressed by people around the world through the UN75 global conversation:

We will leave no one behind;

We will protect our planet;

We will work to ensure peace and security;

We will abide by international rules and norms;

We will place women and girls at the center;

We will build trust;

We will promote the use of new technologies for the benefit of all;

We will upgrade the United Nations;

We will ensure financing;

We will boost partnerships;

We will listen to and work with youth; and

We will be prepared.

The draft concludes that “what we agree today will affect the sustainability of our planet” and the welfare of future generations. By the text, leaders would request the Secretary-General to provide recommendations on advancing the common agenda before the end of the UN General Assembly’s 75th session (2020-2021).

By Florence Schulz for Euractiv

Germany must become carbon neutral by 2038 to avoid overshooting its carbon budget to limit global temperature rise below 2C, researchers at the independent Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) have said.

Every four years, the SRU presents a comprehensive report on the state of the country’s environment and has been doing so for almost 50 years.

On Thursday, it did it again: on almost 560 pages, the seven climate researchers of the SRU have done an all-round job which doesn’t paint a particularly good picture for Germany.

Germany is not on track with 20 of the 25 environmental goals of its own sustainability strategy, according to the report. And binding targets on water protection, air quality and climate protection are regularly missed.

“So far, the failures are too often simply accepted and targets are postponed into the future,” the researchers noted.

Germany’s environment minister Svenja Schulze (SPD) seemed open to criticism. In a video message, she said the growing warnings by environmental researchers for the past 30 years risked becoming an “oppressive ritual”.

SRU researchers have sounded the alarm with very concrete figures.

Germany is allowed to emit 6.7 billion tonnes of CO2 from 2020 if global warming of 1.75C is taken as the target, which researchers consider to be the highest possible target to stay below 2C.

But if business as usual continues, this limit would already be reached in 2029. Consequently, if emissions were to be reduced linearly, Germany would have to be climate-neutral by 2038 at the latest, they argue.

“We will only achieve this if very, very strong reductions take place from 2030 at the latest,” said climate researcher Wolfgang Lucht.

The warnings of the Advisory Council echo similar messages by climate activist Greta Thunberg. Speaking to EU environment ministers in March, the teen activist warned about the rapidly declining amount of carbon dioxide that world nations are still allowed to emit before the rise in global temperatures risks hitting dangerous levels.

However, not all politicians are ready to consider carbon budget calculations.

In a statement yesterday, the head of the conservative alliance CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Georg Nüßlein, said that “the path to greenhouse gas neutrality must not, however, be lost in the small-scale climate budget”.

Instead, he called for more market-based tools and competition, including an expanded European emissions trading system, to achieve climate goals.

Nüßlein also denounced the connections environmentalists have made between the climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, saying it testified of a “fear among some climate experts that [the climate debate] would no longer be featured in the media”.

The CDU/CSU faction led by Nüßlein has recently published a controversial position paper in which he supports the European Commission’s Green Deal, but clearly rejects increasing the 2030 climate targets to 55% of emission reduction by 2030, up from 40% now.

In the report by independent advisors, criticism has also been levelled against the Germans’ favourite means of transport, the car.

“After the corona crisis, we must think carefully about what we promote. Every car with an internal combustion engine will continue to drive around and emit pollutants for at least another ten years,” said the advisory council’s chairwoman Claudia Hornberg.

In order to make driving in cities less attractive, expensive parking fees and a nationwide uniform road toll should be introduced, while environmentally friendly transport modes should be promoted, the researchers argued.

But not all advisors agreed. Building physicist Lamia Messari-Becker said there were need for a blanket demand for less car traffic but supported the introduction of CO2 emissions trading in the transport sector, as the German climate protection law already provides for from 2021.

The German climate experts also looked to Brussels to drive further climate action.

The European Green Deal is a “very good initiative”, but big promises are not enough, warned Christian Calliess, a professor of environmental law and a member of the advisory council.

“Ambitious programmes are adopted, but when it comes to concrete implementation, they are often missed,” he added.

Calliess called for the consistent integration of climate targets into all areas of EU policy, especially in the critical sectors of agriculture, transport and fisheries. Otherwise, he warned, biodiversity could reach an irreversible tipping point.

He suggested that all EU initiatives should be subjected to a sustainability check, adding European economic policy coordination could also help in this respect. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), for example, could carry out this screening, he suggested.

According to Calliess, however, some leeway must be offered to EU member states. “The EU must not always lose itself in the minutiae,” he said.

Above all, the EU should formulate minimum standards, because one cannot “put a European corset on everything,” Calliess said. EU member states must find their own regional solutions to the climate crisis, he added.

However, it would be hard to survive without those rare materials. One of them is the elusive Blue Essence, which can be used in several important ways. This guide will show you how to find Blue Essence in Population Zero.

Blue Essence is mainly used for crafting Concentrated Blue Essence, which is used in several types of equipment. Follow our instructions below if you want to collect the Blue Essence material.

How to Find Blue Essence in Population Zero

Blue Essence appears on large roots, which can be found in the cold biomes of sectors E10 and E12. These roots are very rare and hard to find, but if you go to these locations, you should be able to extract a lot of Blue Essence.

These large roots usually grow on cliffsides and hills. Though some roots are on the ground, making for easy extraction, some are high up on cliffsides and hills, making them very difficult to reach.

Luckily, you don't need any special equipment to collect Blue Essence. Just walk up to the roots and press the ""E"" key to interact, and the Essence will go straight into your inventory.

However, since the biomes in which Blue Essense is found are very cold, it is recommended to equip a Thermal Suit before venturing out. Without the suit, your character can die very quickly.

You can also use Warming Stew as a source of food, which will not only satiate your hunger but also prevent you from freezing. When you have both the suit and the stew, you are ready to collect the Blue Essence.

86,https://noisypixel.net/population-zero-early-access-preview-pc/,"Tue, 05 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Noisy Pixel,Intriguing Space Survival With Potential To Travel Far,"I have always been intrigued by the concept of open-world survival games but have also been intimidated by the learning curve. The idea of grinding and surviving only to lose all of your progress due to making a mistake makes it difficult to invest myself in the genre. However, when I heard about Enplex Games’ survival game Population Zero and how it is meant for players of all skill levels and playstyles, I was eager to check it out. I got the chance to take an early look before its early access release, and what I found was a conceptually interesting game that had a lot of complexities and nuances that were unfortunately bogged down by an overall lack of polish.

﻿

Population Zero has a sci-fi setting, with the premise being that you were on a spacecraft that crashes. This event left you and other human passengers on an unknown planet. You are then left to explore an unknown frontier, gather resources, and build up a colony. It was refreshing to see a survival game set in a 70s inspired science fiction setting, and I found it really helped add to the concept of surviving the unknown since literally, everything in the environment was foreign to me. Having to learn what different materials looked like and where to gather them helped with the immersion.

Population Zero features a PVE mode, which is meant to give you the layout of the world, the mechanics, and teach survival skills. Each new campaign gives you seven days to progress the story and develop your character. Over the course of the seven days, you will complete quests and objectives that will offer you skill points that allow you to go down a trait tree and unlock new recipes for crafting.

Additionally, you will unlock perks that can be slotted to improve aspects of the character, such as greater combat damage, resource gathering proficiency, and hunger-reduction. There are a limited number of slots available for perks that allow you to keep them even after death, but a majority of the slots for perks will be lost if you die. This adds a roguelite feel to the game and makes it a bit easier for newer players since you won’t lose all of your progress.

The PVE mode also includes other people who can help by trading resources, fighting enemies as a group, and sharing information on what you’ve discovered. I found this added a lot to my experience as we were all asking questions and helping one another survive this mysterious planet. Learning and exploring alongside other players gave me a sense of camaraderie and made it feel more immersive as it reflected the spirit of the setting.

However, there are some quality-of-life elements that I would like to see added to make this portion of the game even better. Chatting with other players is difficult due to there only being a single chat feed. You can’t really tell who is talking or where that person is on the map, which makes teaming up and playing with other people difficult. There’s also the absence of a party system, and only one person can pick up loot from a defeated enemy.

PVP in Population Zero is a separate game mode and one that is geared towards veteran survivors. I didn’t get to check this mode out, but from what I understand, it shares a lot of the aspects of PVE, with the significant difference being that you only have one life and will lose everything upon death. However, one thing the game does differently in PVP is that dying increases your mutation level, which will eventually turn you into a monster called a Void. Turning into a void gives you a major power buff, and you can go around getting revenge on the people who killed you. I think this is a neat addition to the genre as it gives a bit of a positive side to dying.

Interestingly, playing Population Zero gives your overall account experience. Leveling up your account unlocks new game modes and game mechanics for you to try out. While I didn’t progress far enough to unlock any of these features, I think the concept is cool since it means no matter what, you are progressing in some shape or form just by playing.

It is worth mentioning that since Population Zero is in early access and is still under development, it definitely feels rough around the edges. There are some bugs, glitches, and wonky animations that may hinder your overall experience. The main issue I had was with the combat, which involves dashing, dodging, blocking, and hitting enemies with weak and strong attacks. There’s a stamina bar here that gets consumed with every action you take, and once you drop to zero, you need to pause until you gradually regain it, which worked out fine. However, the animations of the characters made it difficult to understand hitboxes and ranges. It made combat feel tedious and unsatisfying, and I hope that it gets tightened up in the final release because it is a major part of the game.

Population Zero still needs some work done; the content offered in the early access build made me very interested in seeing where this game goes. There is a myriad of features and mechanics to explore, and it amounts to a lot of potential. I will be following the development of Population Zero to see where it goes. Still, from what I have already seen, I like the general direction of the unique survival sci-fi adventure.","﻿Population Zero has a sci-fi setting, with the premise being that you were on a spacecraft that crashes.

The game will debut for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam this winter.

The game will center on the Royal Selection storyline from the anime's first season, but will contain entirely new ""what-if"" events, with plot supervision by original author Tappei Nagatsuki . Original novel illustrator Shinichirou Otsuka is handling the game's character illustrations.

Amazon U.K. is listing a new Re:Zero game developed by Spike Chunsoft titled Re:Zero - The Prophecy of The Throne with a very similar premise. Amazon U.K. is listing the game for both PS4 and Switch with a listed December 31 release. The game's description is as follows:

One month after Subaru's new life in another world began, an emissary sent by the Royal castle suddenly appears with news that the Royal selection has been postponed, but offers no reason as to why. The postponement of this grand event that decides the next ruler of the kingdom of Lugunica stirs Subaru and his friends into action. They return to the Royal Capital only to find that a sixth candidate has claimed their stake for the throne. But the Dragon Stone prophesizes that only five Candidates would be chosen. With one candidate being an imposter, suspicions are immediately cast toward One woman in particular: Emilia. What answers lie beyond the mysterious web of assassination, betrayal, and conspiracies...?

Jaye de la Cruz-Bekema, 40, said she was rushed to the St. Luke's Medical Center on April 25 after a miscarriage. She was then 4 months on the way.

Under hospital protocol, she was asked to do a swab test. It was then she found out she had the disease.

""I even told the nurse (in my desire to avoid getting a long stick up my nose lol), 'I’m sure I’m negative because I never left the house since March 13 and I have had zero contact with the outside world,"" she said in a Facebook post.

But much to her shock, she later on received confirmation that she tested positive for the virus.

""[April] 25 was the swab test, in 3-5 days before the results are out, on Wednesday night I got a call from my OB telling [me] the results,"" she recounted in an interview with ABS-CBN News.

Bekema, who serves as chief legislative officer of Senator Risa Hontiveros, said the last time she was out was during a meeting with the senator and and her colleagues last March 12.

""Our limited testing capacity only allows us to test those with symptoms and those with exposure, or those like me with a medical emergency. If I didn’t have a medical emergency, I would not be qualified for testing. If I can be positive — me who never went to any grocery and who was a paranoid pregnant germophobe — can you imagine how many asymptomatic carriers are out there?"" she said on her Facebook post.

Since authorities have placed Metro Manila on lockdown, Bekema has not had any exposure to the outside world - except for when her husband went out to do groceries two weeks before she got tested for the disease for the safety then of her baby.

""'Yung husband ko ang may quarantine pass (My husband has the quarantine pass) [so he is the one who does the groceries]. The last time was two weeks from the Saturday of my testing. So technically parang 14 days lang din siya nasa bahay (he has been home for 14 days),"" Bekema said.

Self-quarantine under current coronavirus measures is for 14 days or two weeks.

Bekema and her family are currently waiting for the local government to coordinate with them on how she should pan out self-quarantine measures now that she is recovering from the disease at home.

""We are actually waiting for the barangay or DOH to call me. As of now wala pa po (there is none yet),"" Bekema said Saturday, 7 days after testing positive for the virus.

As of now, Bekema remains asymptomatic. But she said she does not discount the fact that she may experience more serious symptoms later on.

""I’ll admit na I’ve been looking at symptoms, effects of COVID [on] our health, so I had an idea. So what to expect, so of course I'm afraid that the symptoms will soon come, like one day I wake up not being able to breathe, high fever one of these days,"" she said.

Her husband, 2-year-old son and their househelp have all been tested for the virus and are currently under self-quarantine.

She added that her experience ""is a testament to how stealthy the virus is,"" as she urged the government to put more stringent measures in testing individuals.

""We really have to listen to the science. What will it take to flatten the curve? And don't make people choose [between hunger or virus] Kasi lalabas at lalabas sila dahil wala sila makain (They will go out at some point because they don't have food to eat). They can be like me, they can be asymptomatic carriers,"" she said.","MANILA - A woman from Quezon City said Saturday she caught the coronavirus disease 2019 despite observing strict quarantine measures.

""With deliveries, there is no food wasted in the restaurant kitchens.""

With restrictions on Iftar gatherings and dining at restaurants, there is a significant reduction in food wastage this holy month, according to eateries.

Restaurants are catering more to deliveries where there is hardly any wastage as food is prepared as per the volume of orders.

Mohammed G, manager of Mosaic Restaurant, is keen on avoiding food wastage throughout the year. ""Food is wasted in catering, open-buffets and dining areas.

These services are not being offered this Ramadan because of the current situation. Food wastage always happens during open-buffet when people take more on their plates than they can consume. We are not seeing that this Ramadan. Also, more people opt for deliveries,"" he said.

""With deliveries, there is no food wasted in the restaurant kitchens as we only deal with orders available for the day. We don't prepare anything in excess.

Also, food taken to customers homes won't be wasted as they can be preserved in refrigerators,"" said Mohammed. ""Under normal circumstances, some restaurants with no good management can prepare food anticipating more customers and end up throwing away the excess food.

""It is a good thing to always prepare only the food that you can sell on a particular day. It is economical and prevents food wastage,"" added Mohammed.

Chauduary Midhir, supervisor of Moti Mahal Delux restaurant, is happy there is absolutely no food wastage during this Ramadan.



""Dining and open-buffets have been restricted because of Covid-19. We are open throughout the day- but only serving takeaway customers and those making orders online and through phone calls,"" Midhir.

""Unlike before, currently were prepare food only after receiving orders and there is nothing in excess so no leftovers at the end of the day. Over previous Ramadans, groups having open-buffet would leave a lot of food on plates which are not happening now,"" he added.

Razik, owner of Sandwich Point Restaurant in Musaffah Shabiya, is not receiving dining customers as well. ""We only prepare a few snacks for takeaway customers so that we avoid food wastage. We mostly deal with delivery orders and don't prepare food in excess,"" said Razik.

""We are receiving big orders from generous people who want to distribute Iftar meals to bachelors and low-income families affected by the Covid-19 crisis. Generally, the current restrictions have reduced food wastage .""

I’ve never had an interest in the fantasy genre. Despite having a lot of heart, I feel like it is just too far fetched for me, and I’d rather spend my time watching / learning about something real. The only fantasies I get into are ones where I’m making out with a young Leonardo DeCaprio and then returning to my job the next day as Adam Richman in Man Vs Food.

Real fantasy.

When I turned twelve, my mum encouraged me to read Harry Potter. Unfortunately by the time I got my hands on a copy of ‘The Philosophers Stone’, I had just finished reading this book we happened to have at home. I picked it up as I really liked the authors name, Cupcake Brown, and wished it to be my own.

It ended up being an autobiography of a teenage prostitute who worked her way to being a big shot lawyer later in life. As a white twelve-year-old child from Sydney’s Hunters Hill, it really opened my eyes to the hardcore sexism, racism and extreme injustices to young black women in America during the crack epidemic of the 80s. Needless to say, going from memoirs of a teen prostitute to memoirs of a teen wizard felt like I may as well have been reading The Hungry Caterpillar. I was a woman of the world by the time I finished that book and I decided I would leave Harry Potter to the nerds (all of my friends, cousins, peers and siblings).

But it’s hard to live your life and not know a thing or two about Harry Potter. It’s simply just that famous. Although I’ve never sat down and watched the first movie in it’s entirety, I had been to a few sleepovers where it was on in the background. We also had the DVD at home and my siblings watched it a few times. I’ve definitely seen the first 40 minutes uninterrupted.

Anyway my editor thought it might be funny for me to watch the final instalment of Harry Potter with my very limited knowledge and try figuring out whats going on.

ENJOY!

I know this is Voldemort.

Voldemort is on an island, alone. He is living in an underground bunker on said island. The plot so far isn’ttoo far removed from ‘Lost’. I already have a side note: I didn’t know how to spell Voldemort but he is so famous IT’S ON SPELL CHECK!

A beardy man I assume to be Dumbledore is seemingly dead in the coffin. I say seemingly because you never know with these sorts of magic movies. Anyway I think he has just defeated Dumbledore, perhaps that is what HP 7 was about.

Voldemort seems weak but his wand seems strong. Now we are at Hogwarts.

Hogwarts look like it’s about to be invaded by these spermy looking creatures. Maybe they are friends of Voldemort and now that Dumbledore is gone, they are closing in on Hogwarts. If Dumbledore was Mufasa, Voldemort is Scar, these floating guys are the hyenas voiced by the likes of Whoopi Goldberg. Hogwarts is Pride Rock and Harry Potter is of course Simba. I cannot wait to find out how right I am about this. If Harry Potter ends up being the principal of Hogwarts, this is literally just the Lion King.



RIP Alan Rickman. Good to see Snape is still kicking around although I know he is a baddie in these films. Baddie as in bad guy not baddie as in thick thottie but he is one of those too for sure.

The schools quidditch team are returning from an away match. The mood in the air tells me they lost, hardcore. Or maybe they’ve just head about Dumbledore.

Oh shiiet, Dobby is dead. I haven’t seen Dobby in a movie but I’ve seen him meme-d around a bit. I assumed he was a bit of a throwaway character, like JarJar Binx. I was obviously wrong.

Harry is visiting Dobby’s grave and looking at his reflection in a shred of glass, it flickers between Harry’s face and Dumbledore’s. I don’t think Harry Potter was Dumbledore, because I’m sure I would have heard that around somewhere, like when you heard the twist in Fight Club before you saw it. This is soooooo when Simba looks into his reflection in the lake and sees Mufasa. Are they even trying to not be The Lion King?

Harry is also on a deserted island. Maybe the same one as Voldemort. I would be keen to watch if it just came down to a Hunger Games style battle between Voldemort and Harry. I feel like I’ve saved myself a lot of time and knocked a few years off my virginity by skipping the other movies if so.

Now I know who this is too, as people compare my hair to hers all the time, but I haven’t seen her in the films. Luna Lovegood. I don’t know anything else about her except my brother’s friend got a boner for her in the cinema back in the day.

OMG I love that actor on the right. He is in Black Mirror and Ex Machina which is such a great movie if you haven’t seen it. This might be racist but he must be a Weasley. I don’t know the thottie on the left but maybe she’s getting it from him, lucky gal. These are the only two in the movie so far who don’t seem to be in feral moods.

The Weasley that isn’t Ron explains to Luna that this is a house that is used by whats left of his family, like coronavirus hit really hard at Hogwarts.



This is the banker elf right? “Key please”. He had a role in the HP PS1 game me and my brother used to play. We had a glitch / scratch if you walked too close to him at the Hogwarts bank, he kept saying KEY PLEASE KEY PLEASE until you restarted the Playstation. I simply cannot believe he is here. Does Harry need to withdraw money? Is he off the island now?



OMG I’M RIGHT! He just said to Harry “I showed you your vault the first time you came to Gringotts.” I’m so proud of myself.

Back to the plot, the banking goblin seems butthurt about a sword harry stole. I didn’t know Harry used a sword, but seems like a downgrade from a wand. The goblin is horny for the sword and will help break Harry into the bank in exchange for the sword. I don’t know why Harry needs dollary-doos so badly.

Sounds like Snape is the new principal.

Harry needs a WhoreCrux. I don’t know what that is, but it’s in the bank.

At first, I didn’t know who this old rocker was:

But then he picked up the wand and I remembered.

He sold Harry his first wand. I remember this because the way he said “No, no definitely not” in the first movie is a line I still mock to this day. Are all these guys characters in all the movies or is this just one big reunion episode?

“The wand chooses the wizard, Mr Potter” – I’m 99% certain he said that in the first movie too. JK Rowling didn’t go that deep if she’s recycling lines and I’m picking up on it of all people.

He has just mentioned “Wand Law”. I take back my previous statement. J.K Rowling went deep. Too deep.

My understanding is that Voldemort tortured the wand professor guy for some information, which the wand guy gave. Voldemort has “found it” not sure what, probably a wand. Ah yes cause his wand looked powerful in the first scene, in fact I have a line above about it.

Whoa I didn’t know Helena Bonham Carter was in this. Isn’t that weird cause I already mentioned Fight Club. Small world.

Wait a minute…

Is that?…

Are they fucking??? I’m happy for the Goblin. Helena too if he treats her right. I’ve always wanted to be in a relationship where I’m taller than my man. It’s just a hot dynamic. Very Addams Family.

They have teleported to the bank to find a WhoreCrux. I have worked out that Hermione was doing voodoo on HBC to shape shift into her. Which is cool. I guess her and the goblin are not fucking though.

I actually had to text a friend and ask if this was Ron Weasley. Because this was the last image I had of Ron Weasley.

Harry and the goblin are under the invisibility cloak. The goblin must have been fired from the bank at some point. I used to work at Apple and I would love to use one of these cloaks to go back into the store when I needed without having to make small talk with my ex co workers.

Ron has super hearing and can hear that the peeps that work at the bank know that it’s not really HBC. They are about to be exposed. The banker asked for ID. When Hermione said no, the banker said “But it’s policy, I’m sure you would understand given the current climate.

COVID TRIGGERED.

Anyway, Harry must let some ganja into the air because all of the sudden the bankers are chill AF and let them in without any ID.

They are on a rollercoaster type thing on the way to their bank vault. This gives me hardcore PS1 vibes.

So there’s been a mishap in the bank and the goblin has turned on Harry, Hermione and Ron. He is yeeting without them and taking the goods with him.

What an asshole. No wonder he is getting no pussy.

Wouldn’t be a bad stripping scene if they weren’t in such shitty moods. Peep Ron’s fuego bod, Christ. Even Hermione’s kinda letting the tiddies out to play.

Ok I realise that I’m 15 mins into the movie and I’m already over my word limit. I’ll write dot point for a while in the interest of saving your time.

WhoreCruxes sound like health packs in video games. Like what mushrooms are to Mario.

The banking goblin got his sword but died with it in the end. YUUUUGE metaphor for life ey.

Voldemort is part of Slytherin, probably in cahoots with Snape. Draco Malfoy has been affected by puberty the least.

Fucking hell where is Hagrid? I just remembered him. I hope he isn’t dead.

This movie is so fucking dark I can barely make out whats happening even with my laptop on full brightness.

There are so many subplots going on that I clearly know nothing about. It’s almost as if there are 7 movies worth of stuff happening leading up to this.

Was Dumbledore gay? I remember hearing that somewhere…

I can tell Neville Longbottom climbing out of the picture of Dumbledore’s sister is such an iconic moment and I don’t even know what it means.

“Me dad’s a muggle, me mum’s a witch, bit of a surprise for him when he found out”. I also mock this line to this day.

Harry is like Jesus. He’s a man of the people but also leads and inspires the people and is a fictional character.

Who is this and does he need a girlfriend?

Does Harry have a crush on RON’S SISTER? Seems like it. Reminds me of the time my brothers friend (not the one who got a boner) wanted to take me to the formal but my bro said “no”.

House Ravenclaw has a Whorecrux hidden somewhere. One of my best friends, before we were friends, told me I would be in Ravenclaw. I took that as a huge insult when she told me, because she put herself in House Gryffindor. Now that we are friends, I have asked her again:

Ok that surprised me.

Oh look Luna Lovegood was right about the tiara, but no one listened to her because they think she’s a ditsy blonde. Maybe we are more alike than I thought.

I can’t keep up with this film. One second ago Draco was trying to kill Potter or at least steal his Whorecrux and now Harry is saving his life???? I can’t make tops or tails of this.

This movie has more whispering than an ASMR video.

A bit too soon to watch Snape die if you know what I mean 🙁

Snape was in love with Harry Potter’s mother? So Snape was just broken hearted this whole time??? Thats actually so sad and can relate. The repeated rejection from boys I like and am nice to over the years has turned me bitter, cruel and murderous also.

Dumbledore is bad. I repeat, Dumbledore is bad.

Wait maybe not just the only way Voldemort can die is if Harry does and Dumbledore knew this.

Is that Nearly Headless Nick?

WHOAAAAAAAAA. Yay he’s alive but noooooooo he’s being held hostage.

LOL Voldemort LITERALLY just said “Abra Cadabra”. Check it out for yourself. It occurs at 1:311:17 bahahahahahah.

Some serious green screen action during this movie.

I have lots to say about this but have a feeling I should just keep quiet.

Voldemort has thankfully had a few good meals since the last scene. Scar (Voldemort) announcing to Pride Rock (Hogwarts) that Simba (Harry) is dead. But I don’t believe that BS for one second. I’ve seen The Lion King and I know Simba will return.

Aaaand he’s alive what a surprise.

Uka Uka vs Aku Aku vibes.

Although Harry put the nail in the coffin on Voldemort, Neville Longbottom set up the shot. Neville was like Michael Jordan and Harry Potter was like John Paxson in the Chicago Bulls vs. Phoenix Suns game during the final seconds of the 1993 NBA finals. I feel like that’s the best way to describe Voldemort’s death scene.

Well there we have it.

Kind of surprised Harry is not the principal, he’s just a dad now. I respect him throwing that wand away, he’s not a greedy capitalist and I like that.

I can’t say I’m intrigued to watch the series. I defs won’t be twerking to the theme song any time soon. I like people who like the Harry Potter franchise but I can’t see what they get out of it. I didn’t get anything out of this.

Cute how it ended on their children going to Hogwarts though. Would have been fitting to have ‘The Circle of Life‘ as the end credits song.","When I turned twelve, my mum encouraged me to read Harry Potter.

During the lockdown, which has been enforced to save people from Covid-19 virus in India, the same thing has happened to the government school students. But thanks to the efforts of a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA), Jharkhand, the sufferings of these students are to end soon.

This MLA from Giridih constituency has initiated daily online teaching classes for Jharkhand students of Class IX to XII. During these four-hour-classes, the best teachers of Giridih will be explaining the chapters for pre-matric and post matric students. The pre-recorded lessons will be aired daily, thereby converting the living rooms into study rooms of around 50000 households with cable connections in Giridih, Pirtand and Bengabad blocks.

A month back, a similar concept had been initiated during the lockdown in New Jersey and Washington DC in United States, while in India; Punjab is the only state to have adopted this method of teaching.

Idea gets realized in four days

Giridih legislator Sudivya Kumar Sonu, is the man who conceptualized it informed that Education Minister (Jharkhand) Jaggarnath Mahto told him about Union Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal asking state education ministers to use Tata Sky and other cable networks to teach students during the lockdown.

“I told the Education Minister that it is not feasible for us as working with big cable operators like Tata Sky is a mammoth task. Also, the reach of these networks is not in households that have government school students. So, I asked him to give me time to chalk out something,” the legislator told eNewsrooom.

He further said, “After returning from the meeting I contacted City News Editor, Abhisek Sahay, who also manages City Cables in Giridih to understand whether it is possible to start online teaching for students using fiber optics. The moment he answered in yes, I began working on other aspects of realizing this plan.”

Lessons from City’s best teachers

As, he began laying out a plan to execute online classes using fibre optics, the MLA realized that already a private school – CCL DAV had been conducting video classes for its students during the lockdown.

“I contacted B P Roy, the Principal of CCL DAV and requested him to help me in this cause. He was more than eager to support us. His team helped us in getting things into place, later a government school teacher Munna Kushwaha coordinated with me to have the entire process in place,” said Sonu.

The MLA added, “The best part of this model is that now a government school student can learn not only from government school teachers but also from private school teachers. We have requested private school teachers to use Hindi words often while teaching, as they normally teach in English.”

Giridih becomes the first district

Sonu also claimed that within four days (Friday to Monday) the idea took full shape. Online Teaching Through Cable TV was launched on Monday in the presence of Jharkhand Education Minister, MLA Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed, Deputy Commissioner Rahul Sinha and Giridih MLA among others.

In doing so, Giridih became the first district to implement this type of education system. Education Minister Mahto also announced that the system will now be replicated in every district of Jharkhand.

Coordinator Kushwaha informed that 60 experts, who teach from classes IX to XII have been trained to record video lessons. The list includes 40 government and 20 private school teachers from the town.

Not a one-way process

Unlike many popular shows and classes, this online teaching will not only have lessons from teachers, but will give students a chance to ask questions and put across their doubts before the teachers.

“A WhatsApp number will be provided to the students, to which they can send in their doubts. The respective teachers will address these issues in the next session,” said Dr Sarfaraz Ahmed.

It comes without any expense

Both MLA Sonu and City News Editor Sahay mentioned that barring few thousand rupees, which has been born by each of them, the entire process to use teachers, and technical system had been provided by CCL DAV School, City Cable and Jharkhand’s Education Department.

The initiative also brought two rival cable operators—City Cable and DDC Cable Network as well as two local channels City News and Newsline together to telecast the sessions to all their subscribers and viewers.

Initially, for a fortnight, the sessions for classes X and XII will be aired first. This will be followed by sessions for standard IX and XI. It has been decided that the online teaching via local Cable TV will take place till July this year.","During the lockdown, which has been enforced to save people from Covid-19 virus in India, the same thing has happened to the government school students.

The 15 best ruckman of the century

Note that players must have played at least five seasons in the 21st century to meet the criteria and their body of work during the century is also key.

It’s not just players who have played in the last 20 years. This devalues names like Robert Harvey and Scott West.

Here is our top 15 midfielders of the century…

15. Jason Akermanis

An electrifying star of the game who could take control of any match, the 2001 Brownlow medalist was a magician with the ball in-hand.

‘Aker’ left fans, teammates and even the opposition in awe with dazzling displays of brilliance from almost every inch of the ground.

His clean use of the ball and hunger for winning fuelled his success with the Lions, taking on a leading role in the clubs early 2000’s three-peat.

The combination of bleach blonde hair and a brown goatee were one of a kind, fitting for Akermanis.

As well as a crafty onballer, Akermanis was deadly in front of goal, finding ways to bend them in from impossible angles.

His goal scoring totals won club leading goal-kicker awards for 2004 with the Lions during their run to the Grand Final and in 2009 for a third-place finishing Western Bulldogs.

The Lions star won three of his four All-Australian selections and his second Best and Fairest following the turn of the century, granting Hall of Fame status.

14. Joel Selwood

A fierce leader and game winner, Joel Selwood is everything a coach could ask for in a player.

Taking an immediate impact on the game, the 296-game Geelong skipper won the Rising Star award with 44 out of a possible 45 votes.

Selwood wasn’t born into a premiership winning team in 2007, he found a way to become a key contributor in one of the game’s most dominant sides ever right after walking through the doors at Kardinia Park.

The three-time premiership player already sits at eighth for all-time Brownlow votes and first by adjusted votes for players without a medal.

To further tease just how close Selwood has been to winning, he polled in the top-five of the final count on four occasions and is Geelong’s all-time leading vote winner.

Known as one of the most fearless players to ever take the field, the six-time All-Australian winner has won four AFLPA Robert Rose Awards – being voted by his peers as the most courageous in the game.

Selwood has won 216 games across his career at a staggering 73.14% win rate with just 76 losses. His established success ranks him 13th all-time for career wins, with plenty more pending.

13. Mark Ricciuto

Donned the ‘Mayor of Adelaide’, the two-time All-Australian captain was a brute force for the Crows.

His leadership and prowess at the club went unmatched, earning him Malcolm Blight Medals in 1998, 2003 and 2004.

Ricciuto earned his captaincy for Adelaide in 2001 and would lead his side until is last game in 2007, where he had capped 312 games with the club.

‘Roo’ won eight selections into the All-Australian lineup, the equal-most by any player in the games history, with five of those selections coming after 1999.

Ricciuto was a member of the Crows’ ‘Team of the Decade’ coming into the 21st Century, being named on the half-forward flank and still had his best football to come.

in 2003, Ricciuto won the Brownlow Medal in a stunning three-way tie with Nathan Buckley and Adam Goodes on 22 votes each and would end his career with 146 votes to his name.

12. Sam Mitchell

The four-time premiership player and 2008 premiership captain will go down as one of the all-time greats for Hawthorn.

His lethal ability to hit targets on both feet and find the ball at almost every contest was what separated him from the rest of the league.

Mitchell was an accumulator, averaging 26.40 disposals a game across 329 matches for the Hawks.

Had it not been for the circumstances that won him the 2012 Brownlow alongside Trent Cotchin, Mitchell would have been the best to ever miss out on ‘Charlie’, polling 227 votes to sit third on the all-time career totals.

While the asterisk will remain next to his medal, there is no questioning the pedigree Mitchell brought to his game in 2012, making the award as deserving as ever.

A five-time Peter Crimmins Medal winner, Mitchell proved to be the best of the best at the Hawks during their dominant run between 2008 and 2015, winning three Best and Fairests in that time.

Mitchell retired at the end of the 2017 season after a one-year stint with the Eagles after being head-hunted for a future coaching gig.

11. Dane Swan

The definition of a game winner.

A player like Dane Swan doesn’t come round too often, both on and off the field.

The three-time Copeland Trophy winner set himself from the rest of the pack as one of this centuries greatest onballers.

Swan averaged close to 27 possessions a game for his career, peaking in 2012 with 34.52 per match, with 13.48 of those being contested.

Swans heroics were vital to his side’s Premiership glory in 2010, winning Best and Fairest, All-Australian and both AFLCA and AFLPA ‘Player of the Year’ honours.

2010 wasn’t enough for Swan, adding a Brownlow medal the following season after polling a then-record 34 votes for the season.

Swan won five consecutive selections into the All-Australian team between 2009 and 2013, becoming a staple within the squad as one of the game’s best onballers.

10. Scott Pendlebury

The prized Collingwood captain just edges out his former teammate to reach the top ten.

The 300-game superstar has been a trusted figure within the heart of the Magpies side for well over a decade.

If Swan was the match-winner, then Pendlebury was the ever-reliable star of the show and big-game player.

‘Pendles’ won the Norm Smith Medal for his side’s Premiership victory during the replay match in 2010 and was awarded with the ANZAC Day medal on three occasions.

Pendlebury has been named in the All-Australian squad in ten of his last 11 seasons, winning a spot on the 22-man side during six of those seasons.

The boy from Sale is one of only three Collingwood players to win five Copeland Trophies, even pipping Swan in 2011 for his first.

While the accolades will continue to stack up, Pendlebury will always go down as the cool-headed, evasive Magpies midfielder that could nobody could seem to unsettle.

9. Patrick Dangerfield

Explosive, cunning and overall damaging to the scoreboard, Patrick Dangerfield is one menacing opponent.

The Cats star midfielder jumps, runs and plays like nobody the AFL has seen before, creating an unparalleled archetype of an athlete.

A breakout season in 2012 saw the then-Crows player lift his season averages tenfold, winning his first of seven All-Australian selections and finishing sixth in the Brownlow medal count with 23 votes.

Dangerfield had built a strong CV with Adelaide before departing to Kardinia Park, adding a Best and Fairest on the eve of his highly-anticipated move in 2015.

His first season in the navy blue and white hoops were record breaking from the start.

Dangerfield collected 43 touches on debut for the Cats, breaking Greg Williams’ record for most by a first gamer at a new club, and he didn’t look back.

He ended the year with the Brownlow Medal after polling a then-record 35 votes to go along with the Leigh Matthews Trophy, a Carji Greeves Medal and the AFLCA ‘Player of the Year’ award.

‘Danger’ has thrived since his return home, winning a total of three Best and Fairests and polling 112 Brownlow votes from his four seasons at the Cattery.

8. Nat Fyfe

Just ten years in the league and Fyfe has already surpassed a breathtaking amount of players to reach number eight on our list.

Fyfe had an instant impact on league, averaging 16 touches in his debut season before jumping to over 25 touches a game in his second year.

Fast forward to now and Fyfe has 4,469 disposals to his name, along with elite averages in possessions, contested possessions and clearances.

The dual-Brownlow medalist has been Fremantle’s rock for sometime, claiming the crown of the games best in 2015 and 2019.

Fyfe’s polling dominance in unmatched. So-much-so that he leads the all-time list for votes per eligible game with 1.07 votes a match.

Yep, on average he gets into the best every game he plays, sitting alongside Hayden Bunton as the only players to do so.

In just 174 games, Fyfe has amassed three All-Australian nods and three Doig medals while battling season ending injuries.

Somehow, the flashy Fremantle midfielder took his game to another level in 2019, averaging over 29 possessions, 17.6 contested possessions, 7.6 clearances and 4.7 inside 50’s a game.

Fyfe will have his eyes set for a Premiership, having gotten near to the taste of Grand Final glory in 2013, hoping to win the clubs first ever.

7. Dustin Martin

No player has a thirst greater for big games than ‘Dusty’.

Martin has always been a great accumulator of the ball and a damaging midfielder since his debut in 2010, playing in over 20 games each season while averaging over 20 disposals every year.

Added to his ability to win the ball, Martin is one of the league’s best goal kickers and match winners, looking to go that one step further when the game is on the line.

Two Norm Smith medals a two Gary Ayes Awards from 2017 and 2019 established Martin to be one of the best come September, breaking down and stiff-arming opponents on the big stage singlehandedly.

His 2017 season is unparalleled, polling a record 36 Brownlow votes for the year to go along with just about every honour a midfielder could ask for.

Martin’s 225-game, 251-goal career is far from over, meaning his chance to further move up our list is a near-certainty.

6. Simon Black

Black’s breakout season came with the turn of the century, averaging almost 23.89 disposals, 5.26 tackles, 12.11 contested possessions and a career-high 7.53 clearances.

The 2002 Brownlow medalist was one of the Lions best between 2001 and 2003, winning two Merrett-Murray Medals, two All-Ausrtralian selections and a Norm Smith medal during the Lions three-peat era.

‘The Fab Four’, including Michael Voss, Jason AKermanis, Nigel Lappin and Black was an unstoppable quartet, with Black playing the role of the dashing, explosive and efficient onballer every coach is after.

Statistically, he was the rock of the Lions dynasty.

The Lions record games holder at 322 matches, Black leads the club’s all-time list for disposals, tackles, inside 50’s, clearances, Brownlow votes and contested possessions – with close to 1,400 more than the next best for the latter.

Black is one of just six players to win a Brownlow, Premiership and Norm Smith, joining the likes of Jimmy Bartel, Dustin Martin, Greg Williams, James Hird and Chris Judd.

While the Brisbane side’s of the early 2000’s were unstoppable, it’s tough to say they would’ve found the same success without Simon Black.

5. Nathan Buckley

A player that constantly found himself to be in a league of his won, the now-coach of Collingwood goes down as one of the most decorated names to feature in the black and white.

Buckley had an evenly distributed career across his first half prior to 2000 and his second half following the turn of the century.

The former Magpies captain averaged over 20 disposals across all 15 seasons in the AFL and was crowned with the inaugural Rising Star Award in 1993 with the Brisbane Bears and finished second in the clubs best and fairest.

Fast track to 2000 and Buckley had readily established himself as one of the league’s best midfielders, having won four Copeland Trophies and All-Australian selections.

Buckley added another three call-ups to the AA side in 2000, 2001 and 2003, bringing his total tally to seven.

In 2002, Buckley became the second player ever to win a Norm Smith medal in a losing side during Collingwood’s loss to Brisbane.

In 2003, Buckley was awarded with his sixth Best and Fairest for Collingwood, a milestone never reached before.

That same year saw Buckley win the Brownlow Medal in the famous three-way tie along with Mark Riciutto and Adam Goodes.

Buckley announced his retirement in 2007 after 280 games and 284 goals to his name as a champion of the AFL.

4. Adam Goodes

Another player that has written their name across record books after fighting to become of the the game’s best.

Adam Goodes was almost invincible, taking on any given role come game-day and becoming one of the most versatile players in the competitions history.

Goodes won four All-Australian selections. One at ruck, one on the wing, one at forward-pocket and one on the interchange. He was a problem for all opposing 18 players on the ground, but his best came as an onballer.

Goodes won his first Brownlow in 2003 as a multi-faceted athlete, averaging strong numbers for disposals, clearances, goals and hit-outs.

His second Brownlow may have been the sweeter, winning as a sole champion after a stellar 2006 campaign.

The indigenous star is the Swans’ all-time leader for disposals, marks, inside 50’s and games with 372 to his name.

Goodes was a whole new player when it came to finals. His ability to burst through the midfield and crash packs in the air were key to both the Swans’ premiership successes in 2005 and 2012.

Goodes ended his career after 372-games as a three time Best and Fairest, four-time All-Australian and even lead his side’s goal kicking on three separate seasons, remarkable.

3. Michael Voss

The Brisbane Lions of the early 2000’s were an outfit nobody wanted to face, and there was one man who took on the leading role to cruise his side into GOAT contention.

The fierce leadership of Michael Voss could not be questioned. His prowess and professionalism on the field is what ranks him as high as any.

His strength, skill, poise and ability to get the best out of his teammates is why many rivals found themselves in a state of awe rather than anger.

The captain/coach pairing of Voss and Leigh Matthews was paramount, whatever was asked of Voss, it was delivered.

His career had already been established as record-breaking, but Voss’ time since 2000 brought it to be so much more.

There’s the four season as grand finalists with the Lions, the three All-Australian selections, the three Best and Fairests, the two Leigh Matthews Trophies, all of which coming in his first 119 games to start the century.

Heralded as the greatest Lion to ever play, Voss ended his career at the end of 2006 after 289 games with Brisbane.

2. Chris Judd

One of the game most explosive and damaging onballers, Chris Judd was the king of the contested ball in his heyday.

The words “C.Judd, three votes” will forever resonate throughout the AFL’s ‘night of nights’, as Judd managed to write his own name as best on ground game after game.

Judd rapidly made a name for himself within his first two seasons in the league and soon too out his first Brownlow medal in 2004 at the tender age of 21.

Judd became the third player to win the Norm Smith medal in a losing Grand Final side after recording

By 2006 he was a Premiership captain with the Eagles and had planted his name as the game’s best with multiple All-Australian selections and Best and Fairests.

His highly-anticipated move to Carlton rocked the league and many questioned his ability to perform without the like of Cox, Kerr and Cousins by his side. But Judd proved to just get better.

Judd exceeded under the pressure and soon had three John Nicholls Medals during his first three seasons in the navy blue.

The 279-game star won his second Brownlow at the conclusion of the 2010 season after averaging close to 27 disposals, 14-contested touches, 5.25 tackles and 6.50 clearances a game.

By the end of the following season, Judd had won six All-Australian selections, five Best and Fairests and two Leigh Matthews trophies.

Judd announced his retirement in 2015, drawing one of the greatest careers to an end.

1. Gary Ablett Jr.

Let’s be honest, there was never any doubt the ‘Little Master’ would be crowned numero uno.

It’s astonishing to think that Ablett would have gotten any near the level his father did, but he did so and then some.

Fast, skilful, accurate, hungry, balanced and strong. Ablett had it all.

Alike many in the Geelong squad, his 2007 season was a breakout, but it was one like no-other.

Ablett added nearly ten more disposals per game and had turned into a quick, flashy contested animal at the heart of Mark Thompson’s midfield.

Ablett polled 20 Brownlow votes for the year – finishing fifth for the year – and would soon go on to poll a greater tally in his next seven seasons.

By then he had won two premierships with the Cats, became a dual-brownlow medalist, won eight All-Australian selections, six Best and Fairests, five Leigh Matthews Trophies and was crowned AFLCA ‘Player of the Year’ on three occasions.

By that point in his career, Ablett had made the stunning move to one of the league’s newcomers in the Gold Coast Suns.

While his attributes weren’t questioned, many did however believe the ‘Little Master’ would slow down with no support.

Ablett only looked to find another gear, winning his second Brownlow and perhaps missing out on third, fourth or even fifth due to injuries and lack of wins.

His return to the Cats at the end of the 2017 season was a dream come true for all, finding a fresh start as a forward-midfield utility for the Cats, averaging 20+ touches and booting a goal per game.

Ablett currently stands at 346 games in the AFL and has booting 437 goals to amass a career greater than all.","See also 👇The 15 best defenders of the centuryThe 15 best forwards of the centuryThe 15 best ruckman of the centuryNote that players must have played at least five seasons in the 21st century to meet the criteria and their body of work during the century is also key.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations.

Social Share

A public servant has been given two weeks to pay half his monthly salary to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund or if not, face the possibility of being sued for defamation.

Grahame Bollers, attorney for Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves has also demanded that Kenson King, who is a prison officer at Her Majesty’s Prisons make “a full and unqualified apology” to the Prime Minister for what Bollers describes as King’s “outrageous defamation” of his client.

King was copied on a June 15, 2020 pre-action letter addressed to The Vincentian Publishing Company, which pertains to a back page story published in the Vincentian newspaper on Friday May 20, 2020, which carried the headline “Prison Officer To Sue”.

The Managing Editor and Editor of the Vincentian newspaper have also been asked to apologize to the Prime Minister in their newspaper and pay no less than $10,000 in the aggregate within two weeks, also to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund.

Bollers reminded the Vincentian that “in the High Court the Prime Minister is likely to receive $150,000 plus legal costs, if my client were to sue you”.

The story, which was written by J.P. Schwmon alleged interference by the Prime Minister in police procedure in relation to licensed gun holders.

Bollers, in his letter said: “By the said defamatory words, each of you meant and was taken to mean that my client …abused or

misused his power or authority by wrongly or improperly instructing the Police at the Colonarie Police Station to return, unjustifiably and without reasonable cause, Hanniffe King’s guns to him in a volatile situation of a domestic dispute involving Hanniffe King, his uncle and the uncle’s siblings. The clear and undoubted meaning, too, of the said defamatory words is that my client had committed the criminal offence of misbehaviour in public office, an offence punishable by imprisonment.

“In their ordinary meanings, and by clear innuendo, the said defamatory words have caused immense damage to my client’s character, reputation, official and professional standing.”

“…The simple truth is that my client never made any call to the Colonarie Police Station or to anyone at that Station about Hanniffe King or his licensed firearms. He certainly did not tell, threaten or instruct anyone at that Station or any other Station to return to Hanniffe King, his licensed firearms. The allegation is false; it is a fictitious invention; it is a fantasy!

“As responsible newspaper editors, each of you must be aware that even if Hanniffe King made or is alleged to have made the original defamatory comment about my client – which is to be seriously doubted – its repetition by Mr. Kenson King, and The Vincentian, does not turn a malicious falsehood into truth. So, neither of you nor your newspaper has any defense whatsoever to your egregious libel of my client…”

Bollers advised both editors of the Vincentian and King that his client reserves his rights in this matter should they fail to comply with “his reasonable demands”.

King’s “full and unqualified apology in terms to be agreed upon” by Bollers is to be published in Asberth News Network, which had earlier published a story on the same issue, also written by J P Schwmon.

The pre-action letter was also copied to SVG Publishers Inc., printers of the Vincentian newspaper; and to the author of the story, J P Schwmon. “They ought to be more careful in the future. For now, my client refrains from pulling any legal lever against either of them,” Bollers’ letter said.","Public servant to pay half month’s salary to Zero Hunger Trust Fund or face defamation suitSocial ShareA public servant has been given two weeks to pay half his monthly salary to the Zero Hunger Trust Fund or if not, face the possibility of being sued for defamation.

97,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/africa/zero-waste-farming-godfrey-nzamujo-benin-spc-intl/index.html,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,Meet Benin's zero waste farmer inspiring an agricultural movement,"(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, with just one acre of land, a couple of seeds and a bucket of hope, one Nigerian-born scientist began his quest to trample famine on his continent.

News of the drought across Africa in the early 1980s troubled Father Godfrey Nzamujo, then an expatriate priest and professor at the University of California, Irvine.

""People were dying of starvation. I couldn't stand it,"" Nzamujo told CNN.

Equipped with a microbiology PhD and his faith, he travelled back to Africa in search of a solution.

Father Godfrey Nzamujo, Founder and Director of Songhai, on his zero waste farm in Benin.

There, he found a continent ecologically rich, diverse and capable of producing food.

He believes drought wasn't the only reason for widespread hunger, and that sustainability had been left out of the equation.

Nzamujo began devising a ""zero waste"" agriculture system that would not only increase food security, but also help the environment and create jobs.

In 1985, he traded in his professor post for gardening gloves and started his sustainable farm ""Songhai"" in the West African country of Benin.

What is zero waste farming?

At the core of the idea of sustainable agriculture is designing farms that mimic the way natural ecosystems work.

""One really important piece of that is structuring farms to persist without external inputs like fossil fuels or toxic chemicals,"" said Liz Carlisle, an assistant professor in Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Those can create problems that degrade both the food system and the surrounding environment, she said.

Zero waste agriculture, a type of sustainable farming, takes these principles even further by introducing a regenerative loop, where waste in one area produces feed, fuel or nutrients for another.

""The output of one area, like the livestock production, would feed into either energy production or fertilizer for crops,"" explained Ronnie Brathwaite, a senior agriculture officer at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. ""The crop residues will be used in either energy production or livestock feeding, or even making other products.""

""Zero waste"" is a buzzword today with the spotlight on climate change . However, this type of farming is not new.

It was in place globally for millennia, until farms, especially in developing countries, moved toward synthetic fertilizer use and single crop production during the Green Revolution of the 1950s, according to Brathwaite.

During this period, growing populations generated a need to intensify the food supply quickly. Industrial agriculture created high yields, but it came with a high price, including large amounts of waste from crop production and livestock, Brathwaite explained.

""What was not taken into account was the impact on the environment and the very resources that support it, like soil and water,"" he said.

A symbol of African renaissance

Wanting to restore synergy to farms in Africa, Nzamujo started his sustainable farming mission on a small plot of land given to him by the government of Benin.

In addition to providing organic produce locally, Songhai employs 300 people daily. They harvest crops, tend to animals, oversee composting, or service the biogas digester -- which turns chicken excrement into fuel.

Nzamujo lives on the farm and constantly updates his techniques. He credits his degrees in science and engineering for Songhai's success. But he also thanks his spiritual and cultural roots, and his father -- a driving force in his life who encouraged him to pursue his studies to the highest degree and to use Songhai to share his knowledge.

Songhai has several ""eco-literacy"" development programs. They range from 18-month training courses for farmer-entrepreneurs, to shorter stays to learn techniques like irrigation. People come from all over the world to study Nzamujo's methods.

Father Godfrey Nzamujo educates a group of people on his zero waste farm in Benin.

After seeing success on his first zero waste farm, he expanded throughout Benin and western Africa.

Today, the Songhai model is implemented across the continent, including in Nigeria, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Nzamujo says they've trained more than 7,000 farmer-entrepreneurs and more than 30,000 people in total since it began.

It's not always easy to get started in sustainable farming. Beyond the educational investment, local policies and regulations also have to support this type of farming . Not every country allows crops and livestock to be grown together.

Many countries originally rejected Nzamujo's farm plans before Benin granted him some land.

Carlisle believes a key part in fostering the sustainable agriculture movement is decoupling the public sector from extractive agricultural models.

""There is a whole support system around industrial agriculture because it's been subsidized by national governments,"" she said.

However, Carlisle notes institutions are being built to support sustainable farmers.

Increasing food security

With more than 820 million people facing hunger globally, according to the UN , coupled with a rapidly increasing population , comes the need for even more food.

If there was a shift toward more sustainable farming practices, could it keep up with the demand?

Some research has shown this model, when implemented correctly, has the potential to produce almost as much as conventional farming. Both the UN and independent scientists have called for a paradigm change away from industrial agriculture to sustainable practices in order to help our planet and the food system.

""With zero waste farming, I think we're in a better position to satisfy the needs of the globe,"" Brathwaite told CNN. ""We can continue to produce similar levels of food to feed a growing population, and we have the advantage of reduction in wastage.""

Nzamujo believes zero waste agriculture is now steadily tackling the issues he set out to defeat three decades ago: hunger, unemployment and environmental degradation. And he wants to see it go further.

""Yes, it is a revolution. But it's a revolution that is not them against us,"" he said. ""It is a revolution that is inviting every people to a new way of seeing things.""","What is zero waste farming?

The ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, launched during a virtual event on 5 June 2020, on World Environment Day, aims to mobilize leadership and support for a healthy, resilient, zero-carbon economic recovery that creates well-paying jobs and inclusive, sustainable growth and prevents future threats.

The campaign is led by the UNFCCC Champions for Climate Action, Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) and Nigel Topping (UK), and brings together a coalition of net zero emissions initiatives, covering 992 businesses, 449 cities, 21 regions, 505 universities, and 38 investors. These “real economy actors” join the 120 countries that are members of the Climate Ambition Alliance, a coalition of States committed to net zero emissions by 2050, representing over half of global gross domestic product (GDP) and covering nearly a quarter of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

The launch event touched on, among others: COVID-19, climate change, and the public health case for a resilient, inclusive, zero-carbon economy; new announcements, data, and plans to drive sector-level transformation; and zero carbon as the new growth and leadership agenda for cities, finance, and “real economy pioneers.”

The transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time.

According to a UNFCCC press release, prioritizing climate change and low-carbon stimulus can spur economic recovery from COVID-19 and job creation as effectively as, or better than, environmentally neutral or harmful programmes. The ‘Race to Zero’ campaign will identify the most effective pathways to zero emissions in such sectors as energy, transport, industry, food, retail, and finance.

Speaking during the campaign launch, Alok Sharma, President of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC and UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, expressed hope that COP 26 “can be a moment where the world unites behind a fairer, greener recovery from the effects of COVID-19.” COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt said that despite the health crisis, climate action must continue at all levels.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the initiative must help spur enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Maria Neira, Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health, World Health Organization (WHO), called on governments to put health and climate action at the center of recovery plans.

UN Special Envoy for Climate and Finance and adviser to the UK Government on COP 26, Mark Carney, highlighted “the greatest commercial opportunity of our time” created by transitioning to net zero. Citing the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda, he said the COP 26 Presidency and the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign will focus on reorienting investment and finance towards net zero.

From the private sector, Mark Schneider, Nestle, said building a more sustainable food system will be central to addressing climate change. Warren East, Rolls Royce, expressed confidence that engineers can help break the airline industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, and supported a gradual transition towards green technology.

The virtual launch event convened as part of the UNFCCC’s June Momentum for Climate Change. The campaign will run up to COP 26, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will now convene from 1-12 November 2021.

Kroger started an initiative called Zero Hunger Zero Waste with the three-year goal to donate one billion meals. In celebration of surpassing this goal in 2020, Kroger wanted to recognize an associate in each division that goes beyond to feed their community with the Zero Hero award.

The Mid-Atlantic Division includes more than 100 stores in Virginia, West Virginia, and some in Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio. The winner for this division was Ruth Johnson from Suffolk.

“This award means a lot,” said Johnson. “It shows I can help other people and feed a lot of families.”

Johnson has been with Kroger since May 2018, when Farm Fresh closed. She was previously with Farm Fresh before the transition.

Johnson was nominated from the store by the department heads. As they held a meeting to discuss who to nominate, Johnson’s name kept coming up.

“It feels awesome to have someone from our store receive this award,” said Kayla Saccoccio, Kroger’s assistant store manager. “We are very proud of Ruth and her accomplishments and are proud to stand by her.”

Johnson has served with her church, Balm of Gilead Missionary Baptist Church, and its food ministry for 41 years. As the winner of the Zero Hero award, Kroger donated $2,000 to help with the food ministry at Johnson’s church. The church offers a hot meal every day at noon to those who need it.

“It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak on the great things that my church has done in the city of Suffolk,” said Johnson. “I can’t wait to see what we are able to do this holiday season and as we help those affected by the coronavirus.”

In its Zero Hunger Zero Waste initiative, Kroger donates to Feeding America food banks and sponsors its own drive at the store. Johnson is an active participant in these drives. She stated that in 2018, Kroger donated to 300 families for Thanksgiving, and more than 600 in 2019.

The drive gave food to families to cook for a complete Thanksgiving meal. Last year, the boxes included paper goods to supply the additional need.

“Kroger’s purpose is to feed the human spirit,” said Saccoccio. “To have an associate embody this at our location in and out of work is amazing. It feels great that we get to showcase that.”","Ruth Johnson of Suffolk recently won Kroger’s Zero Hero award for her dedication in organizing food drives in her store and for her church.

100,https://www.chronicle.com/article/budget-transparency-now,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Chronicle of Higher Education,Higher Ed Is Not a Zero-Sum Game,"T wo images of the modern academic sit uneasily beside each other. One is the image of the ivory-tower idealist, the institutional Don Quixote, the radical who rejects free-market competition as a means of organizing our professions, institutions, and ways of life. The other image — more true to life — is the frazzled workaholic who feels guilty taking a weekend off, who compares the academic job market to The Hunger Games, who perseverates on news that the economics department just got four more tenure lines while “we” have gotten none. Academics tend to bristle at systems that reduce our lofty objectives to just another form of cutthroat competition. But cutthroat competition provides much of the structure of our professional lives.

This dilemma is a source of discomfort for many of us. We attempt to resolve it by externalizing the conflict altogether. We say we are captured by a neoliberal system that imposes competitive strictures on us, and that if the ground is always shifting beneath our feet, it’s not because we want it that way, but because the ground is really a treadmill.

There’s some truth to this view. Over the past decade, states have collectively reduced public funding for higher education by $9 billion, while state investment per full-time student fell from $8,489 in 2007 to $7,642 in 2017. This, in turn, has increased the student contribution to college budgets by nearly $2,000 per student. Funding cuts reflect waning support for the idea that a college education is a public good, and they place a greater burden on colleges and universities to compete for enrollments, grants, and tuition dollars. The consequent survivalist mentality filters down through departments, faculty members, and students, nudging all of us to do more and to do it better for the sake of showcasing our value in a zero-sum competitive system.

The continuing Covid-19 pandemic throws this phenomenon into stark relief. It cost about $80 billion to bail out the automotive industry in 2008-10, and about $700 billion to bail out Wall Street in 2008.The Department of Education estimates that eliminating tuition at all public colleges and universities would cost about $79 billion. Yet the possibility of a higher-education bailout to help us through the pandemic is not even on the table. Unlike the putatively competitive automotive and investment-banking industries, there is no relief from relentless competition in higher education. The expectation is that we compete or perish.

The way forward is therefore not to double down on competition. The way forward is to cooperate across divisions. And we can’t do that without making budgeting more transparent and collaborative. Faced with layoffs of both tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty members — in addition to custodians and culinary and maintenance workers — faculty members at Ohio University have already started down this path, creating an open-source, alternative budget that proposes to avoid these and any other layoffs by trimming from senior administrative salaries and athletics subsidies, among other expenses.

The Open Source Alternative Budget is certainly a work in progress, and it has sparked contention over issues such as whether to trim the salaries of the highest-earning faculty members as well as the highest-earning administrators. There is also uncertainty about whether enrollment in the fall of 2021 will bounce back, as the document predicts. I suspect that the Ohio administration is not thrilled to debate these questions in full view of the public, a scenario they might have avoided if their budget decisions had been made in cooperation with the faculty.

The point here is not that budgeting processes must be open to the public, but that they should be more transparent and collaborative within our institutions. One way to begin is to hold at least one “State of the Budget” forum per year, where faculty and staff members would get updates on key financial data — a breakdown of revenue and the operating budget; an overview of investment strategy, salaries, maintenance, capital and construction projects, and so on. Faculty members don’t like being told something just is what it is without an evidence-based explanation. Opacity undermines trust. Administrators don’t like it when faculty members make unreasonable demands or carp about things that administrators are in no position to change. Being transparent about the budget addresses both of these problems. It’s also the beginning of a more collaborative process, one in which the faculty, among the most important of what we now call “stakeholders,” might actually hold some of the stakes.

ADVERTISEMENT

F aculty members are not the only campus employees with expertise. The people who put together our budgets, for example, are experts in that domain. Regardless of field, the average professor can understand a budget if introduced to one. But few of us are experts in accounting or financial management. A transparent and collaborative budget process does not mean undermining the judgment and experience of financial officers and senior leadership. It means participating in decisions about what our institutions choose to value. Every budget is both a technical document, dependent upon forms of financial expertise, and a moral document, indicative of an institution’s nonpecuniary values.

Alongside this call for a more transparent and collaborative budgeting process, I would like to offer a more radical — if longer-term — proposal. We should re-evaluate the divisional model of organizing our institutions into administrative clusters of humanities, social science, and natural-science departments. Divisions do what the name suggests: They divide us, both epistemologically and functionally. Cooperative governance — whether building a budget, making staffing requests, or allocating research funds — is more difficult when the humanities look sideways at the social and natural sciences, the social sciences look sideways at the natural sciences, and everyone wonders what “they” get that “we” don’t.

For my part, I’m optimistic — if not quixotic — about such cooperation as a model of institutional governance, in part because I’m fortunate to work at a college where we’re pretty cooperative and transparent. Our president and senior administration have been open with our faculty about where we stand financially and how we plan to address the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Our entire faculty recently received a detailed financial report from the CFO, including a breakdown of several budget scenarios for how we can pull through Covid-19 disruptions.

It may be a function of scale, the fact that at a small liberal-arts college it’s virtually impossible to get along, let alone thrive, if you don’t engage in some degree of cooperation with people in different disciplines and sectors of the college. But small institutions may offer lessons, even if not all of them readily scale up. I’d like to think that if we start with a cooperative mentality and work across divisions to hash out our values and needs, coming to the table together is more likely to succeed in producing real change than coming to the table as competitors in a zero-sum game.

ZERO advances research, improves the lives of men and families, and inspires action for patients, physicians, and advocates involved in the prostate cancer cause. ZERO offers comprehensive support for millions of men with prostate cancer, including raising awareness and education for cutting edge technologies, such as the ExoDx™ Prostate (EPI) test, of interest to patients exploring all of their options to manage prostate cancer.

One in nine American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men and is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. In 2020, it is estimated that 191,930 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 33,000 men will die from the disease. Currently, nearly 3.1 million American men are living with the disease – more than the population of Chicago.

The EPI test is a urine-based genomic test that helps inform the prostate biopsy decision. This liquid biopsy test recently received coverage for the Veterans Health Administration under the General Services Administration (GSA) award, received a positive coverage decision from Medicare, and is included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for early detection in men for both initial and repeat biopsy. It is performed by Exosome Diagnostics in its CLIA, ISO, NY certified and CAP-accredited laboratory located in Waltham, Massachusetts. The EPI test is a risk assessment tool that assists physicians and their patients with determining if a prostate biopsy is needed when presented with an ambiguous PSA test result, thereby reducing complications from unnecessary and invasive procedures. ExoDx Prostate is now available with an At-Home Collection kit, enabling test access to patients unable to see a healthcare professional or preferring to collect their sample at-home.

""We are proud to partner with ZERO, an organization that through its support of prostate cancer research, diagnostics, therapeutics and patient initiatives has changed the lives of thousands of prostate cancer patients,"" said Chuck Kummeth, Bio-Techne's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""ZERO is an ideal partner to help spread the word about our ExoDx Prostate (EPI) test and educate men with indeterminate PSA scores that they can potentially avoid unnecessary biopsy procedures.""

""We are excited to join forces with Bio-Techne, an organization that aligns with our mission, values, and goals. Having a new diagnostic that can be administered at home is an exciting new development for patients who face difficult choices managing their disease, especially during this COVID-19 crisis,"" said Jamie Bearse, ZERO President & CEO.

ZERO and Exosome Diagnostics will kick off this newly formed partnership by hosting a Facebook Live broadcast on June 17th at 4:00 p.m. EDT with ZERO President & CEO, Jamie Bearse and Urology expert, Dr. Ali Kasraeian. The event will be broadcast live and will be available for replay on the ExoDx Prostate Test Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ExoDxProstateTest/) and on the Zero – The End of Prostate Cancer page (https://www.facebook.com/ZeroCancer/) and on ZERO's Youtube channel. Mr. Bearse and Dr. Kasraeian will discuss current challenges in prostate cancer management and how this is changing during the COVID-19 era where patients and their physicians are adjusting to new rules and regulations. Members will have the opportunity to address questions directly to either Dr. Kasraeian or Mr. Bearse. To see the broadcast tune in on Facebook at 4:00PM Eastern Time.

102,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/new-race-to-zero-campaign-needs-to-leverage-optimistic-messaging-into-concrete-climate-action-71584,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Down To Earth Magazine,New ‘Race to Zero’ campaign needs to leverage optimistic messaging into concrete climate action,"Messaging needs to be leveraged to put pressure on holdout national governments to increase climate ambition

The messaging and diplomatic push for the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign launched on June 5, 2020 describes itself as an “international campaign for a healthy, resilient zero carbon recovery”, which “brings together an unprecedented coalition of net-zero emissions initiatives, covering 996 businesses, 458 cities, 24 regions, 505 universities and 36 of the biggest investors”.

This seems perilously close to the messaging around the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in 2019, which was itself built on the messaging approach of business-led movements such as the We Are Still In coalition.

This messaging for the campaign — carried out under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — seeks to emphasise the potential for non-state actors (businesses, investors, cities, and other sub-national entities) to raise climate ambition. The current campaign refers to these as ‘real economy actors’, noting they “cover just over half the gross domestic product, a quarter of global CO2 emissions and over 2.6 billion people”.

As a substitute for real ambition led by national governments — especially major polluters such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, the European Union and increasingly China — this approach tends to fall well short.

The New York Summit was noted more for youth-led protests than for true advances in climate ambition. Business coalitions are much needed, but they sometimes obfuscate more than clarify climate action.

This is particularly because net-zero is a nebulous term. Businesses often interpret it as limited to their own operations and refuse to consider the emissions impact of consumers using their products (think of a ‘zero emissions as manufactured’ vehicle, which still uses fossil fuel once sold).

They also often use ‘net-zero’ targets to increase their consumption of carbon credits or offsets which, in current form, are bad for the climate.

The leaders of this campaign — UN High-Level Climate Champions Nigel Topping (from the United Kingdom) and Gonzalo Muñoz (from Chile) are presumably not unaware of these limitations.

The same goes for the president of the 26th Conference of the Parties (Alok Sharma from the UK) and COP25 President Carolina Schmidt (from Chile), who are launching the campaign today.

Diplomatic efforts have been made to re-emphasise the role of national ambition, especially by getting 120 countries and the European Union to commit to raising the ambition in their national targets in 2020.

The list of countries omits major emitters like China, US, Australia, South Korea, and Japan. But to its credit, it includes important G20 economies like Canada, Mexico, Argentina, France, Germany, Italy and the UK, apart from the EU.

In addition, there are some minimum criteria developed by Oxford University, to maintain quality control over non-state actors’ net-zero targets. On the positive side, this includes limiting the use of carbon offsetting or credits.

Still unresolved, however, is the issue of ‘scope’ — that is, whether businesses have a responsibility to limit emissions beyond their own operations.

As a campaign, ‘Race to Zero’ represents a modest step forward in messaging. It cannot be confused for actual action comparable to the scale of the climate crisis.

This messaging needs to be leveraged to put pressure on holdout national governments to increase climate ambition.

We need to cut global emissions by 7.6 per cent each year for the next ten years, to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.

That will not happen simply by generating optimism around technology or new business practices. We will have to go beyond, using the political capital of business and other stakeholders to force new policies more in line with democratic consensus.

After all, as the campaign notes, two-thirds of those polled worldwide are in favour of prioritising climate concerns in the economic recovery from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It is past time for businesses, investors and policy to catch up.","This messaging for the campaign — carried out under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — seeks to emphasise the potential for non-state actors (businesses, investors, cities, and other sub-national entities) to raise climate ambition.

It addresses eight goals and corresponding objectives: energy-efficient and climate-resilient buildings; renewable, reliable, and affordable energy; access to sustainable transportation options; becoming a zero-waste community; water conservation; increase and leverage green spaces; better access to healthy food options; improved air quality.

The comprehensive plan includes a shift to net-zero buildings—structures that produce as much energy as they consume—for all new construction by 2050. Data collected in 2015 underscores the need for such a shift, finding that 64 percent of greenhouse gas emissions came from the building and energy sectors. City officials hope a net-zero building code, which they aim to have considered and evaluated by 2030, will improve these numbers and help Dallas play a part in battling climate change. According to two of Dallas’ local businessmen, electrification and education may prove key in making the shift.

For developers, architects, and others involved in commercial construction, a shift like this will require significant changes in planning processes and building design. It starts with energy efficiency, said Dan Noble, president and CEO Dallas-based HKS Inc., one of the nation’s largest architecture firms.

“Efficient buildings are the result of thoughtful, integrated design. Improvements in light and daylight, views to the outside, air quality and ventilation, are all part of integrated design,” he said. “This, in turn, contributes to a more healthy, equitable, and beautiful Dallas.”

The shift also must include incentives for electrification—moving away from fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and toward electricity, Noble added: “Net-zero carbon is our goal. This means moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Building electrification is a necessary step. For buildings, this is a parallel to the goal of electrifying Dallas’ public transit systems.”

Alternative Sources of Power

Matthew Fisher, building systems manager at Granite Properties, echoes the importance of building electrification, explicitly suggesting a shift from alternating current (AC) electricity to direct current (DC) electricity.

“Our existing power grid is an AC because AC is safer to transmit larger volumes of voltage further distances, with fewer substations in between,” Fisher said.

Many of our devices work off DC motors and batteries, however. To power them, device cables are built to convert from a buildings’ AC power supply to the device’s DC power. Fisher says converting between the two types of power creates a loss of 30–35 percent of the power supplied.

“You’ve been supplied 120 volts, or 110 volts—depending on when your house is built—at the outlet,” Fisher said. “You’re paying for the full 120 volts, but you’re only using 12. Now, imagine that example over every single edge device in your home or every single edge device in a commercial building.”

To be more efficient, Fisher suggests switching to solar power, which accrues power in DC, and Dallas’ new climate action plan agrees; it outlines a goal of mandating conduits in new construction for solar power and electric vehicle charging stations.

A shift to solar alone, however, will not fully achieve the efficiency that constructing buildings entirely wired for DC power would, Fisher said. In fact, with solar panels, there is an additional conversion that reduces a building’s power efficiency: Once the solar power enters the home, it is converted to AC, then back to DC to power many devices.

“So now, even if I have solar panels, I have to have a lot more solar panels to overcome the efficiency loss from DC to AC and back to DC,” Fisher said.

He suggests shifting building construction to DC power entirely and believes manufacturers could adjust the way they create device cables were we to do so. “In theory, [creating DC cables to power devices] should be less expensive, because you’re removing hardware,” Fisher said.

The More We Know

Fisher believes local developers could make the switch to more sustainable energy, but more awareness and leadership is required.

“It’s going to take, education, and it’s going to take a big name to dive in and say, ‘Well, we’re sold: we want to be sustainable, or we want to reprise quality.’”

Education is addressed in the city’s new plan, with an emphasis on the need for continued partnership with public utilities to provide education on renewable energy sources to commercial business owners and the public.

As the shift toward sustainability and net-zero construction takes hold, Noble is excited by the opportunity for Dallas to become a leader and says his firm is on board.

“We know that business and civic partnerships are essential to meeting Dallas’ objectives,” Noble said. “We are aligned and offer our assistance in expanding these relationships.”","The comprehensive plan includes a shift to net-zero buildings—structures that produce as much energy as they consume—for all new construction by 2050.
According to two of Dallas’ local businessmen, electrification and education may prove key in making the shift.
To power them, device cables are built to convert from a buildings’ AC power supply to the device’s DC power.
A shift to solar alone, however, will not fully achieve the efficiency that constructing buildings entirely wired for DC power would, Fisher said.

These cookies were so addictively good that I ate two of them that evening, then woke up in the middle of the night to eat two more. I paid the price in the morning, however with a bad headache – the sugar hangover. I later discovered that each one had 7g of sucrose inside.

I assume part of the reason I had such a hard time staying away from these cookies was that they were packed with sugar, making them irresistible. Maybe you have a sweet tooth as well and recognize this feeling? Have you ever had something so deliciously sweet that you just can’t keep away?

Well, your sweet tooth is not all your fault, sugar is largely to blame for this. The simple crystalline sucrose molecule can actually produce a sort of physiological “dependency” as it releases endogenous opioids and dopamine in your brain.

Unfortunately, sugar consumption has been linked to unhealthy weight gain, and to obesity in particular. Although obesity is a multi-factorial disease that depends on genetics, lifestyle, and metabolism, evidence suggests that diets high in added sugar promote the development of obesity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of adult obesity in the United States in 2017-2018 was 42%. 42% is an incredibly high number. What’s even scarier is that this number has been increasing steadily for the past 20 years, and continues to do so.

Trends in obesity in the U.S. Since 1999, the percentage of obese Americans has increased from 30% to 42%. Many people may avoid sugar substitutes because they taste inferior to real sugar. Purecane could help address this challenge. U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC)

The price of obesity in the United States isn’t small, either. It’s estimated that the annual health care cost of obesity-related illnesses is $190 billion, representing ~21% of the annual medical spendings in the United States.

It is evident that a lower-sugar diet is key to weight management and healthy living, but we all need to satisfy our cravings once in a while. And if the addictive nature of sugar makes it hard to stop ourselves, is there a way for us to have our cake and eat it too? The answer is yes, and the biotechnology upstart Amyris has the solution.

Amyris supports a sustainable future by producing a wide array of molecules from engineered organisms and renewably-sourced carbon from plants.. They are committed to their “No Compromise” vision of a world in which both people and the planet benefit through better sustainable products. Their portfolio includes antimalarial drugs, clean skincare products, and now, their latest “No Compromise” product: the zero-calorie sweetener, Purecane.

Back in 2016, Amyris CEO John Melo felt that it was time for the company to have another growth spurt. On the lookout for the next big thing, Melo realized that big food and beverage companies were pursuing a new strategy of sugar reduction. This was in response to a huge consumer backlash against not just sugar and its negative effects on our bodies, but also against chemically-derived sweeteners.

You have probably tried a few zero-calorie sweeteners before, like Sweet’nLow, or Splenda’s stevia. Some consumers report that these zero-calorie substitutes taste “off.” Melo explains that many sweeteners are made with extracts from the leaves of the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana). The compounds responsible for stevia’s sweet taste are steviol glucosides, which are up to 500 times sweeter than sugar. When these compounds are extracted directly from the stevia leaf, you often end up with small impurities that can impart that “off-flavor” to the final product. Given the rising obesity rate in the United States, undesirable off-flavors were clearly not helping consumers transition to healthier calorie-free sweeteners.

Melo saw an opportunity. His team initially was reluctant to work on complicated sweetener molecules like rebaudioside M (Reb-M), one of the super-sweet steviol glucosides in the stevia plant. This Reb-M molecule is only present in low concentrations (less than 2%) in the stevia plant, and it is difficult to isolate. But the Amyris scientists developed a unique method of making Reb-M using fermentation, the basic process we use to make beer, wine, and bread. By using a yeast culture to ferment sustainably-sourced sugarcane, Amyris was able to make very pure, sustainable Reb-M.

Even better, Amyris’s fermentation method uses 10 times less land than traditional manufacturers who still isolate glucosides directly from stevia. The final Purecane product is 300-500 times sweeter than normal sugar, with no carbohydrates, no artificial chemicals, and a zero glycemic index.

Amyris’s Purecane offers a healthier, more guilt-free, and sweeter world—made with biology. AMYRIS

I recently tasted Purecane myself. I was skeptical at first, expecting the off-flavor of other zero-calorie sweeteners. But to my surprise, it tasted very similar to regular sugar. And I’m not the only one amazed by this product: very strong early sales earned Purecane a place on Amazon’s “Hot New Releases” category, and Amyris continues to expand distribution into the $9 billion non-sugar sweetener market.

Although the Reb-M molecule project at first seemed like a challenge too hard to crack, Amyris succeeded by taking inspiration from the greatest engineer there is: biology.

“When you come across an amazing molecule that exists in nature with the best properties, and you know you can make this molecule at higher purity, higher quantity, for a lower cost and in a more sustainable way, that doesn’t seem like a wild bet to me,” Melo says.

It will be exciting to follow Amyris’s Purecane journey towards a healthier, more guilt-free, and sweeter world. In the meantime, with many of us largely confined to home these days, more will want to bake a sugar-free, perfectly sweet banana bread with some Purecane baking sweetener.

(AngryWorkers, 2020)

AngryWorkers want you to build an international revolutionary organization guided by the axiom “the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves,” and they have a plan. Six years ago the communist grouplet relocated from London to a western industrial suburb called Greenford, where they found a dizzying array of industrial and logistical facilities central to keeping Greater London running. Greenford, they discovered, “typified one of capitalism’s main contradictions: that workers have enormous potential power as a group, especially if they could affect food supply into London, at the same time they are individually weak.” AngryWorkers set up shop and organized tirelessly inside and outside the union structure in a number of industrial workplaces, in community campaigns against austerity and their own solidarity network, and through the WorkersWildWest newspaper which they distribute at factory gates at the crack of dawn. None of these practices are new, and some may seem better left in the 20th century. But AngryWorkers’ new book Class Power on Zero-Hours (London: AngryWorkers, 2020), a sustained reflection on the past six years of this organizing, reveals their praxis to be even more timely than authors could have known.



Class Power recounts the group’s organizing experiences and the lessons they have drawn from them, while underscoring the necessity for coordinated working-class rebellions throughout global logistical networks, and the imperative for the UK left to change courses following the defeat of its social democratic ambitions in the figure of Jeremy Corbyn. By sheer coincidence the book hits shelves as the COVID-19 crisis has dramatically heightened social dependency on services like Amazon and Instacart, and thrust logistics workers’ struggles into the open as increased exploitation and dangerous working conditions add more fuel to the fire across the supply chain. Simultaneously a new generation of self-proclaimed socialists in the United States are reeling from the electoral defeat of Bernie Sanders, just as Corbynites were as Class Power was headed to press, and vow in great numbers to exit the US Democratic Party in search of more radical and unmediated forms of political participation. May this wonderful book fall into their hands, and those of all searching for direction in a moment of great transition, when few things are certain beyond the surety of heated struggles to come.



Getting Rooted



AngryWorkers delight in having found a base of operations of which many London leftists have never heard, and consistently contrast their experiences in Greenford with vogue theories of “post-industrial” societies and “immaterial labor” which thrive among urban intelligentsia. A far cry from post-industrial, Greenford is home to a highly-concentrated international proletariat largely hailing from Africa, South Asia, and Eastern Europe and thrown into fraught relations of cooperative labor at similarly heterogeneous points of production. AngryWorkers argue that places like Greenford represent the return of large concentrations of workers in space, following capital’s decades-long restructuring of productive relations away from large centralized factories that could serve as proletarian strongholds. Accordingly, they argue that Greenford and places like it present Achilles’s heels of capital in its present composition, begging concerted communist organizing. One nearby office park, which AngryWorkers dubs the “crown jewel of a workers’ vanguard,” boasts 40,000 workers laboring in 1,500 businesses ranging food production, custom printing, tech, transportation, laundry, waste processing, hospitality, and studio film production, alongside a hospital, international student housing, a massive supermarket, and all kinds of cafes and other working-class haunts. “We have to contrast the strategic joy of engaging with this potential jewel of a working class movement,” they write, “with the stale and often airy Labour party politics and internal power-fights that many London lefties prefer to get involved with. We ask ourselves: what the fuck?!”



The group suggests that anyone can simply walk around a place like Greenford with their eyes and ears open and learn a lot about the world they live in. But the treasure trove of thick descriptions and practical wisdom which fill Class Power’s nearly 400 pages is largely derived from years of full immersion in Greenford life, and purchased at great exertion of time and energy of a small group of dedicated militants. To get rooted in Greenford, AngryWorkers took up in crowded proletarian neighborhoods, labored for years on end in low-wage warehouse, factory, and transportation work, and merged their social lives with the dense local networks that crisscross thousands of shops drawing on temp workers, zero-hour (no work guaranteed) contracts, and other ingredients for high turnover. “You can do a lot more than you think,” they remark, “when your ‘political life’ and ‘normal life’ isn’t so divided.”



Getting to Work



“As an organization we take on a responsibility,” they write. “The responsibility to help turn the global cooperation of workers, which is mediated through corporations and the markets, into their own tool of international struggle.” While the group scorns programmatism, their model is tripartite, combining intensive workplace organizing, solidarity networks and other community engagement, and regular distribution of print propaganda which collects grievances and other seeds of potential workplace campaigns, reports on strikes in similar workplaces or nodes on the same supply chain, and conditions of daily life outside the factory. This final item has provided much of the raw material for Class Power, and demonstrates laudable efforts to move beyond the same old jargon and sloganeering and write for an audience far removed from the Facebook International. Above all, the honesty and self-critical stance from which they evaluate their organizing provides a wealth of practical reflection for organizers in a variety of settings.



For starters, AngryWorkers intend the solidarity network model to ground them in Greenford’s proletarian life and begin to tap the networks that traverse workplaces and neighborhoods. Class Power recounts a number of these campaigns, introducing the reader to Senegalese kitchen workers, Bulgarian apple pickers, Moroccan factory works, Somali bus depot cleaners, Punjabi truck drivers and construction workers, Sundanese hotel workers, and Polish tenants, united by their common status as highly exploited laborers and tenants, often victimized by more affluent and better-rooted members of their own “communities.” As a kind of organizing first principle, they opt to avoid a formal organizational name or “brand” identity, concerned that a clear organizational identity could become a fetish object, obscuring from its participants the material reality that their collective activity constitutes the group’s power.



The group narrates its initial trouble getting over the hump of making contacts. Film screenings and open hours at community centers fail to attract workers, they change tacks and set up at working-class cafes, including a McDonald’s. This pivot attracts far more interested workers, who bring with them rich social networks traversing the region, replete with experiences of exploitation upon which campaigns could be built. Predictably enough the solidarity network runs into problems typical of the model, namely their inability to transcend the “service” model which nonprofits and social workers have conditioned working people to expect in place of direct-action and empowerment. They also have trouble getting workers to stick around after their campaign has been won. Nonetheless, they rack up back wages to the tune of £25,000, and along with local efforts against library closures and the demolition of a working-class community center, demonstrate in practice the remarkable heterogeneity of Greenford’s proletariat and the invisible lines of interconnectivity that run throughout neighborhoods and workplaces. In their critical reflections, they wonder if a more formal structure would have proven more effective and sustained better over time. It is an open question with the solidarity network and all of the AngryWorkers projects, and it is a question that can only be addressed in practice.



The centerpiece of their strategy is workplace organizing, which lands AngryWorkers comrades in refrigerated warehouses, prepared food assembly lines, labyrinthine distribution centers, auto transportation across the so-called “last mile” between warehouse and the consumer’s home, and even a shop manufacturing 3D printers, which they discover to be a full 180 degrees away from the feel-good techno-utopianism of “open source” ideology. Their guiding praxis seeks to identify and encourage worker militancy, rather than recruit people to a group or a particular political standpoint. Once a comrade has taken root in a shop, they begin to identify grievances and potential seeds of struggle. While this comrade plays it tight to the vest, slowly building the trust of workers and not making their politics known, comrades on the outside distribute literature outside the shop, and stories from these various workplaces appear in WorkersWildWest.



All the while, the comrades on the inside toil under arduous, bleak (a recurring adjective in Class Power), and near-dystopian conditions. They take months and even years to build the basis for a single campaign, all the while engaged in punishing daily regiments. In the refrigerated “chill” warehouse, for instance, the comrade stuck in there all day must sort boxes and trays of food at a fast pace, with their forearm adorned with a computer console that gives orders and connects to a finger-mounted scanner monitoring productivity! If they sink below the required pace, they receive a text message warning, followed by loss of work. All this, on temp wages. When they are finally fired for organizing a slowdown, after the better part of a year in these conditions, they don’t seem too sad to go. Tellingly, the biggest obstacle facing their organizing efforts was the high turnover, and the propensity of the ablest would-be militants to simply quit in search of better conditions and pay instead of working long-term to build worker power in the shop. And who can blame them?



In this work AngryWorkers draws inspiration from the present syndicalism renaissance, in particular the organizing of Italy’s SI Cobas,1 militant unionists in the logistics sector whose actions AngryWorkers publicize in their factory newspaper as potential inspiration for English workers. They are appreciative but more critical of the en vogue approach championed by labor expert Jane McAlevey, author of No Shortcuts (Oxford University Press, 2016), who they argue correctly points for a need to break with top-down “service unionism,” but does not sufficiently break from the binary—and often hierarchy—of “organizer” and “worker” inherent to professional labor organizing. By contrast, the AngryWorkers call quite rightly for the abolition of waged union jobs and professional organizing altogether. At the same time, they draw influence from “class unions” like the IWW, who they partner with in a number of campaigns, but question the use of conflating unions with broader political organs of a working-class offensive.



Above all, their calculus of workplace strategy is guided by an aversion to allowing unions, or any organization, to become a fetish object standing above the power that working people wield when they take action in concert. These motives are understandable to any critically-minded person who has engaged with a contemporary labor union and suffered its vapid sloganeering, quasi-military hierarchy, and mystification of “the union” as greater than the struggles of its members—all while leadership acts as the left wing of management, enriching itself and perhaps a tier of the highest-waged workers at the expense of everybody else. Yet it is perhaps the greatest strength of the AngryWorkers’ praxis that they do not merely abstain from union participation on principle, but experiment with the union itself as a potential site of struggle.



As astute observers of contemporary capitalism, AngryWorkers believe unions “essentially exist to manage the relationship between labor and capital rather than overcome it,” as one member working at a food production facility writes. “But rather than rely on left-communist dogma,” they continue, “we wanted practical experience within the big unions to see how things actually operated.” Thus begins a multi-year experiment working as a rep in a rotten company union which scarcely masks its pact with management against the workers. Taken in sum the worker-cum-rep’s experiences surely do not contradict “left-communist dogma” about the structural role of unions in capitalist society. Simultaneously, however, they provide a nuanced account of how union offices can be used as a strategic point of leverage for building extra-union worker power.



For instance, under the cover afforded by the union rep position, this worker was able to openly collect and socialize grievances, distribute literature, network with more militant workers, and help organize a number of protests demanding pay increases—all to the chagrin of the union and its partners in management, who aren’t immediately able to clamp down. Similar conclusions are drawn from another comrade’s account of working as a rep in “last mile” delivery, who concedes the decision to give union office a whirl arose in part when “our efforts to create independent structures didn’t go too far.” Far be it from me to ever endorse the star-crossed endeavor of “union reform,” but these accounts, far too detailed to do any justice here, provide valuable reflections for workers in a unionized shop wondering where they can find the best possible leverage. Like all questions addressed by the AngryWorkers praxis, the answer is not an easy one.



Getting Acquainted



In the course of their struggles AngryWorkers have produced an immense body of writing for the purposes of agitation, debate, and to deepen their own understanding of the complex social world in which they are taking action. The best of it recalls Engels’s The Condition of the Working Class in England or the propaganda tracts by the enigmatic writer and illustrator known only as Prole. In contrast to the odd journalist or photographer who slums it for a short stint to document the lives of poor downtrodden workers, AngryWorkers are attentive not just to the obvious deprivation but to the potential power workers wield in daily cooperation and resistance. And in contrast to the sectarian, they are not simply looking for recruits, or to “colonize the factory” as many New Left groups attempted in the 1970s. They seek instead to identify working class initiative where it already exists and help generalize it across shops, supply chains, and entire regions. Thus when they engage with the contradictions of working-class life which emerge from divisions of productive and reproductive labor riven by race, gender, ethnicity, citizenship, language, and other factors, it is with a view to how these real differences can be overcome to constitute the class as a fighting force.



In two particularly profound lines of inquiry, originally composed for their propaganda and excerpted in Class Power, AngryWorkers examine “the crisis of the working-class family” and the particularity of women’s experiences in the gendered division of factory labor and bearing the brunt of austerity at home. Lengthy testimonials from three women speak to a diversity of backgrounds—the young Hungarian woman who seeks above all freedom from her hometown, the Irish mother who struggles to balance the impossible calculus of work and care for her autistic son, the Punjabi mother of two who lives precariously from visa to visa and has not seen one of her daughters in six years—grounded at once in a common condition of hyper-exploited labor. As bourgeois feminism enjoys its day in the sun, these working women’s voices demonstrate at once the complexity and necessity of approaching gender analysis from a perspective grounded in the work and home lives of working-class women. This method, AngryWorkers clearly state, is distinct from considering “class” as one particular form of “intersecting” modalities of oppression. Class, instead, is the basis of exploitation, and the very real and often devastating particularities of exploitation along lines of race, gender, citizenship, and so forth are, to pluralize a famous dictum from Stuart Hall, “modalities in which class is lived.”



These stories and other investigations AngryWorkers undertake paint a complex and visceral portrait of gender and working-class family life as immiserated by crushing austerity while rendered evermore necessary by a deepening harshness of life outside. An inquiry entitled “The Crisis of the Working-Class Family” builds on their analyses of gender and workers’ living arrangements to explore the family as a stopgap for the near-impossibility of survival on working-class salaries. The working-class family, they argue, is largely a necessity arising from the impossibility of being alone, and is accordingly packed into whatever tight living quarters workers can muster, which is often collective living with extended family or workmates, where the specter of the exploitative sub-landlord is never far. Simultaneously they argue that the heterosexual couple, defined by the desperate need to keep “romantic love” afloat, has become the sole outlet of emotional expression in search of rich expression, especially for men. The combination of these elements, they argue, renders working-class families combustible compounds defined by frustration, desperation, and strife, which episodically erupt into violence, most often men against women. While it is difficult to read these passages without feeling claustrophobic, it is simultaneously powerful to read the concepts of social reproduction, gender, and the family analyzed through the lives of real working-class people and in relation to their raison d'etre, surplus value production.



Another welcome intervention comes around the question of automation and its relationship to low-waged work. “The whole spiel about ‘full automation’ is bollocks,” they write in a discussion of the labor-intensive “chill” warehouse. “Here we are, using thousand-year-old technology…wheels!…to help us do the bulk of the work, while being controlled by 21st century high-tech. We are cheap, so why replace us with robots, which would have difficulty fitting the big banana boxes into the small cages anyway?” This example is a common theme throughout the book, as high-tech enables companies to juxtapose automation technology with disposable low-wage workers, whose resiliency and low cost or commitment make them a cheaper option than full automation. Importantly, the onus of discipline still rests on the human element. In the same passage, they continue:



But low-tech also means that the command of work is not transmitted through a big technical apparatus, which we might hate but at the same time admire and accept. Instead, the command of capital is primarily transmitted through the strained vocal cords of the dumpy managers, who stand and scream at the end of each line: ‘Andranik, stop talking to Preeti, get a move on!’



Elsewhere, they include a photograph of three workers struggling against a giant crate, with the caption: “Who needs a forklift when you have three men to move a ton of cabbage?”



As a textual whole, Class Power calls to mind the eccentric genius which strikes the first-time reader of Capital, and while lacking the lengthy mathematical interludes, Class Power compensates with extensive histories of supermarkets, food distribution, and West London itself, interspersed with hundreds of pages of workplace writing at once baroque and immanently practical. The characters who emerge are complex yet immediately recognizable—the pissed off temps whose excessive drinking sends an organizing meeting off the rails, immigrant workers who vote for Brexit to flip the middle finger to the status quo, the self-styled “rebels” who chicken out when the time comes to take risks, and perhaps above all, the authors themselves. The book’s authorial voice episodically changes from plural to singular as individual yet unnamed and ill-defined workers step forth to recount their particular experiences before once more dissolving back into a faceless we. All the while the text preserves a loose sense of narrative style and a breezy, bathetic, shit-talking sensibility which makes the collective author the kind of person the reader would want to have a beer with and maybe listen to a multi-century history of capitalist agriculture in the process.



Getting Together



By way of a conclusion, AngryWorkers provides something rare among groups who do not simply reproduce the received texts of the 20th century: a clear account of how their daily activity connects with the global communist revolution. “There is no lack of revolutionary anger,” they write. “What we haven’t seen is a section of the working class that focuses on the real centres of power—the grain baskets, manufacturing centres, ports, power plants—with the aim and a plan to take them over. It might take a few more waves of struggle for such an organized force to emerge,” they write, but insist nonetheless on the guiding question: “So what are the bare necessities during a revolutionary transition?” What follows is a detailed account of how strategic working-class takeovers throughout the social division of labor could simultaneously build revolutionary momentum and ward off counterrevolution or stagnation, the latter most likely to arise from hunger caused by interruptions of food from the countryside and abroad. “The communisation-fun,” they tease, “might last three days max before you start getting hungry.” Here the true prize of their years in Greenford reveals itself: a practical and strategic understanding of the social division of labor necessary to reproduce the infrastructure of an area as complex as Greater London, an understanding which can serve as the basis for theorizing a revolutionary offensive.



This is not to say that their plan—or anybody’s plan—could be followed to the letter in a moment of revolutionary transformation. Nor do they intend this text to be treated in the manner of those who still thump the Transitional Program onto the table as it approaches its centennial. Instead, rooted in their own practical-critical investigations into current compositions of class and capital, they have created an arc which few of us dare to consider in conversation, much less commit to publication, between the challenges facing small bands of organizers attempting to get a toe-hold in strategic centers of production and circulation, and the bare requirements of going all the way. It is a perspective far removed from fighting injustice, sticking up for the powerless, speaking truth to power, purifying oneself from the evils of capitalism, and inching toward a vanishing horizon of socialism through piecemeal electoral gains. Instead, it poses a simple question: how do we build the power it will take to win?



Class Power on Zero-Hours is not without its shortcomings, but like all great works, its weaknesses are simply the underside of its strengths. For instance, in their practical analysis of the local working class, AngryWorkers return time and again to the abstraction of “the community,” meaning cross-class networks bounded by common language, nationality, and faith. They correctly argue that these communities are led by petty bourgeois “leaders” whose interests—expressed in exploitative employment, housing rental, citizenship schemes, for-profit language classes, and so forth—are opposed to the interests of their “community’s” working people. The AngryWorkers theorize this relation as a basis not only for exploitation in the present but for authoritarianism in the future, an idea borne out in their workplace organizing and solidarity networks, where they encounter coercive “community” relations that prevent workers from standing up to their bosses and landlords. They have therefore identified a central contradiction facing the contemporary revolutionary left, and one which runs many organizers’ revolutionary praxis aground, as they embrace the abstraction of “community” and thereby lend their support to cross-class alliances which lead nowhere.



Unfortunately, in formulating this practical analysis, AngryWorkers do not take seriously enough the powerful objective forces which give these community leaders their strength. When workers complain of racism in the factory, the group is quick to offer alternative explanations more directly tied to the shop’s division of labor. While AngryWorkers do not dispute the reality of racism and xenophobia, and document extensively the sick mischief such chauvinism causes among the working-class, they appear to not consider the color line itself a worthy basis of struggle. This is doubly frustrating as their own theory, expressed by their masterful critique of social democracy, decries placing the abstraction of formal “unity” ahead of unity produced by taking contradictions like the color line head-on. The group’s aversion to advancing race or nationality as the basis of struggle is understandable given how decoupled the two have become in middle-class left analysis. But the fact that “anti-racism” has become a lucrative industry for building university and non-profit careers that don’t challenge capital in the slightest, makes it all the more necessary to carve out a strategic, working-class anti-racism that takes the color line head-on in pursuit of the strategic lines AngryWorkers draw so deftly.



A more obvious criticism, which surely dawns on the authors, is that their individual campaigns have largely come to naught, especially weighed against the group’s cyclopean labors. Over the years their small core has attracted a rotating lineup of comrades from across Europe and even South Asia, but the arduous work and scant unambiguous victories seem to have made retention in their Greenford cadre about as difficult as at the local factories themselves. One chapter, recounting an arduous multi-year organizing effort, concludes: “Things didn’t work out this time, but that’s the class struggle folks! Better luck next time!” As this sentiment recurs in various forms throughout their innumerable efforts, the reader gets the sense that the core comrades are possessed of a certain disposition which makes them as suitable for this work as they are rare among the contemporary revolutionary left. Unfortunately, “better luck next time!” might be enough for a core of stone militants, but the breakneck pace and dizzying array of campaigns which this small group took on in a short time seems like a recipe for burnout, especially absent the galvanizing effect of tangible wins.



Similarly, it is both a strength and a weakness of AngryWorkers that they attribute their failures thus far to a lack of capacity or unfortunate turns of events. Ultimately their scrupulously detailed critical reflections are less concerned with why things didn’t work and more occupied with how they could have gone differently. This is a sign at once of great optimism of the will, and also perhaps of a dose of stubbornness. To these critiques, I’m sure, the authors will reply: all of this is true, and that’s why you should join us to effect the shift from quantity to quality!



Accordingly, Class Power concludes with an invitation to comrades around the world—any town where there are at least two—to begin practical-critical investigations of nearby workplaces and infrastructure strategic to working-class insurrection, take up occupations there whenever possible, build solidarity networks, and to generalize this practical-critical work with the similar efforts of groups all over the world. Not all readers (present company included!) will be willing to cast aside whatever they’re doing and take up employment at physically punishing low-waged labor in these strategic sites. But some will, and the AngryWorkers are clear that important work remains outside the workplace, to agitate, organize in solidarity networks, support the comrades inside, and help build more generalized networks of shared practical knowledge. To this effect, the group has been organizing video conferences, necessitated in part by COVID-19 quarantine, and has continued a dizzying output on their website.2 They are offering literature and flyer templates and practical advice to anyone seeking to pick up the torch in their own town. If you are on the fence, don’t take my word for it—reach out to them!



Class Power on Zero-Hours is a difficult book to review, given its immense wealth of practical information and its scrupulous recounting of the high price its authors paid to earn it. Moreover, Class Power is simply a multiplicity of books—not just in its immense length, but in the rich variety of its content. What might be a throwaway paragraph to one reader might grab someone with experience in commercial trucking as the most poetic and damning description of their lives they have ever read. Same for exploited tenants, women harassed by their bosses, perennially stymied workplace militants, migrant workers anxious about the ascendant right, and so forth. It will be a different book to practically every reader, and will engender vibrant discussion that grounds strategic horizons in the lived experiences of working-class people. Accordingly, this reviewer strongly suggests the formation of study groups wherever possible, among workers already struggling around the COVID-19 crisis (wherever their time allows), organizers who find their terrain of struggle turned upside down, and everyone wondering how best to join the fight. “It can sometimes be frustrating and depressing when you’re on the front lines of the class war,” the AngryWorkers conclude, “but on the whole, it’s exhilarating and purposeful and gives us the means to live how we want.”

","But AngryWorkers’ new book Class Power on Zero-Hours (London: AngryWorkers, 2020), a sustained reflection on the past six years of this organizing, reveals their praxis to be even more timely than authors could have known.
All the while, the comrades on the inside toil under arduous, bleak (a recurring adjective in Class Power), and near-dystopian conditions.
Class Power on Zero-Hours is not without its shortcomings, but like all great works, its weaknesses are simply the underside of its strengths.

Before entering its stores, customers of Scoop Wholefoods must register using a QR code and then don a pair of single-use plastic gloves. The Australian chain says the gloves are an additional hygiene measure for customers, which use scoops to take dried food from self-service bins in the store.

Scoop’s stores in Australia and the United Kingdom have not introduced the disposable gloves policy, Eco-Business understands.

Scoop is the only zero-waste retail brand in Singapore to introduce such stringent hygiene measures. Until mid-June, when the city-state entered the second phase of opening up following a period of lockdown, Scoop customers were asked to use hand sanitiser before entering the stores.

Rival packaging-free bulk food brands Unpackt and The Source, which also use a self-service model, ask customers to use hand sanitiser but not plastic gloves.

The move comes as environmentalists worry about the mounting waste burden of the Covid-19 pandemic. Personal protective equipment has been called “the new pollution” as waterways become clogged with discarded disposable masks and gloves.

Scoop said the gloves are “100 per cent biodegradable and compostable” as they are made using corn and starch.

Scoop told Eco-Business that the company is “under immense pressure and supervision from government officials as our concept is very new and involves unpackaged goods,” adding that there have been no reported cases of coronavirus in its stores.

“In order to prevent [coronavirus spread] and please our customers and supervising government officials, we have implemented this strategy to keep both the hygiene level of our store at a high level and reduce the threat of closure. Thankfully, this does not cost the Earth,” the firm said, adding that it was “still on our plastic-free mission”.

Scoop has pledged its support for next month’s Plastic Free July initiative, a global movement that encourages consumers around the world to refuse single-use plastic.

Tom Peacock-Nazil, founder of ocean clean-up and plastic offsetting firm Seven Clean Seas, said that the disposable gloves initiative, while “hugely ironic” for a zero-waste store, is an understandable defensive move as businesses come under increasing pressure to raise their hygiene game.

Hotels in Singapore have pivoted from buffets to a la carte menus, because of the higher contamination risk of self-service restaurants, Peacock-Nazil noted.

However, he said that using biodegradable or compostable plastic would not reduce the environmental impact of the disposable gloves. “Even if they’re made from plant-based material, in Singapore we know they’ll be incinerated.”

He added that there was a need for consumers to question corporate sustainability messaging. “If brands tell them [consumers] it’s biodegradable, they believe it. If brands tell them it’s sustainable, they believe it. No one is asking the right questions to understand the mechanics behind sustainability claims,” he said.

Retailers in Singapore have taken a diverse approach to sustainability amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Some, like Starbucks, have rescinded bring-your-own container schemes in fear that they could aid viral spread, while others, like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, have not.

Starbucks told Eco-Business that it wanted to provide its customers with “peace of mind” and planned to reintroduce reusables “as our stores evolve from takeaway and to-go models, and in line with local government and health official guidance”. Singapore’s National Environment Agency has not restricted BYO schemes.

Last week, more than 100 health experts and scientists signed a statement to reassure consumers and retailers that BYO container schemes do not post a public health threat if basic hygiene rules are followed, and can still be used as an alternative to disposables.","A high-end organic foods retailer promoted as “plastic-free shopping” has mandated disposable plastic gloves for customers in its stores in Singapore as a coronavirus prevention measure.

A new association of independent zero waste grocers has launched today.

Sustain Aotearoa - Independent Zero Waste Grocers aims to increase the prevalence, influence and efficacy of grocers who are committed to minimising consumer and in-store packaging and food waste across New Zealand.

“Zero waste grocers are stores who sell everyday essentials - from food and pantry items through to toiletries and cleaning products - without single-use packaging”, says President of Sustain Aotearoa, Bron Green, who is also the owner of Be Free Grocer in Palmerston North.

“Generally, our members fall into one of two categories: either they stock unpackaged product in bulk dispensers or ‘on tap’, so that customers can fill their own reusable bags, bottles and containers; or they pack goods into reusable packaging, like glass jars, that they’ll then take back from the customer when empty for sterilising and refilling.”

“Our point of difference from other stores with bulk bin aisles is that we don’t also have aisles with products in single-use packaging. We’re zero waste only - that’s a key part of our membership criteria”, explains Green.

Over the last two years, New Zealand has seen a massive growth in dedicated zero waste grocers, with a 110% increase in the number of such stores in 2019 alone. More still have opened this year, seeing the national total hit 23, spread across eight regions. Twelve of the stores are independent and owner-operated.

“Most of us are stand-alone SMEs, dotted around the country. We don’t automatically have the buying power or big voice of major supermarket chains or franchises. However, we all share this really strong vision of reducing the enormous amounts of packaging waste in our current food system, and bringing healthy kai to our communities at affordable prices.”

“So, we created Sustain Aotearoa as a support network for the stores. We all recognise that by collaborating, we can grow the zero waste sector and magnify our positive impact”, says Green.

“We also want to act as a resource for new stores starting out. We’ve all been there; we know how hard it is to set up. If Sustain Aotearoa can help others get off the ground more quickly, with the benefit of our members’ learnings, that’d be a great outcome.”

Not only do the members of Sustain Aotearoa minimise the waste that they pass on to customers, they also work with suppliers to reduce packaging behind the scenes too. This has led many of the stores to hunt out local, New Zealand-grown products.

“Looking local is key to cutting waste in supply chains. It’s always easier to work with someone you’ve met directly, to chat about whether they can supply you a little bit differently. And it’s easier to trial reusable packaging systems with local suppliers. We’ve found a real hunger amongst local suppliers for these kinds of conversations. The only reason many haven’t done it already is because no retailer has ever asked them before,” says Nicola Cross, Secretary of Sustain Aotearoa and owner of Honest Wholefood Co in Wanaka.

The impact of a collective voice to influence supply chains is obvious. “At Honest Wholefood Co, we’d be on the phone to suppliers constantly, encouraging them to rethink their bulk packaging. But being able to engage with suppliers and major distributors as a collective of stores helps us advance zero waste supply chains faster - it makes suppliers see that there’s a growing market for this”, says Cross.

“For many of our members, we’ll actually look to switch suppliers if our current ones aren’t willing to work on reducing backroom packaging waste. None of us want to order beautiful food and have it arrive on a palette shrink-wrapped in one-use plastic. These are the systems we hope to change, both through our advocacy and through our ability to develop and trial alternatives that other players may choose to adopt in the future too.”

Sustain Aotearoa currently has 12 members from across New Zealand, ranging from Whangārei through to Wanaka and Hawea, including:

· Forward (Whangārei)

· Sprout The Grocer (Birkenhead, Auckland)

· Plastic Free Pantry (Waiheke Island, Auckland)

· The Store Room (Te Awamutu)

· Re-Store (Thames)

· Unpakd (Ahuriri, Napier)

· Be Free Grocer (Palmerston North

· Hopper - Refill, Shop & Cafe (Wellington)

· Honest Wholefood Co (Wanaka & Hawea)

The association encourages anyone who runs an independent zero waste store or who is thinking of starting up, to get in touch.

Spike Chunsoft announced on Tuesday that it will release the Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- : The Prophecy of the Throne ( Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Itsuwari no Ōsen Kōho ) game for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in the West this winter.

Spike Chunsoft describes the game:

One month after Subaru's new life in another world began, an emissary sent by the royal castle suddenly appears with news that the royal selection has been postponed, but offers no reason as to why. The postponement of this grand event that decides the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica stirs Subaru and his friends into action. They return to the royal capital only to find that a sixth candidate has claimed their stake for the throne. But the Dragon Stone prophesizes that only five candidates would be chosen. With one candidate being an imposter, suspicions are immediately cast toward one woman in particular: Emilia. What answers lie beyond the mysterious web of assassinations, betrayal, and conspiracies...?

Physical copies of the Day One Edition of the game will bundle four exclusive pins featuring Emilia, Subaru, Rem, and a new character. The Collector's Edition will include the pins, a SteelBook case, a soundtrack CD, and an art book with concept art, sketches, and commentary.

The game will center on the Royal Selection storyline from the anime's first season, but will contain entirely new ""what-if"" events, with plot supervision by original author Tappei Nagatsuki . In addition to existing characters, original novel illustrator Shinichirou Otsuka is designing new characters for the game.

A separate smartphone game for the franchise titled Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Lost in Memories will debut this summer.

The 25-episode first anime season based on the light novel series premiered in April 2016. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Crunchyroll is also streaming both the Re:Zero ~Starting Break Time From Zero~ and Re:PETIT ~Starting Life in Another World from PETIT~ short anime spinoff series. Funimation released the television anime on home video with an English dub in June 2018.

The anime has also inspired two original video anime ( OVA ) volumes, titled Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow and Re:ZERO - Starting Life in Another World - The Frozen Bond . Crunchyroll began streaming the Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow OVA in February, and it began streaming the Re:ZERO - Starting Life in Another World - The Frozen Bond OVA in April.

Tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.

The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa. Across the planet, the report forecasts, the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. (Flare-ups of acute hunger in the pandemic context may see this number escalate further at times.)

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World is the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. It is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Writing in the Foreword, the heads of the five agencies[i] warn that “five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030.”

The hunger numbers explained

In this edition, critical data updates for China and other populous countries[ii] have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million. Nevertheless, there has been no change in the trend. Revising the entire hunger series back to the year 2000 yields the same conclusion: after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so.

Asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). The global prevalence of undernourishment – or overall percentage of hungry people – has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. This means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.

This, in turn, hides great regional disparities: in percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. This is more than double the rate in Asia (8.3 percent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.4 percent). On current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.

The pandemic’s toll

As progress in fighting hunger stalls, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems – understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19.[iii] The setback throws into further doubt the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).

Unhealthy diets, food insecurity and malnutrition

Overcoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat – and especially what children eat – must also be nutritious. Yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families.

The report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than US$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. It puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. Nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.

The latest estimates are that a staggering 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet. In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 percent of the population – though no region, including North America and Europe, is spared. Partly as a result, the race to end malnutrition appears compromised. According to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted – too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight. Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.

A call to action

The report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.[iv]

The report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. While the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies. The study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food – including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.

The heads of the five UN agencies behind the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World declare their commitment to support this momentous shift, ensuring that it unfolds “in a sustainable way, for people and the planet.”

An annual study estimates almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018 and by nearly 60 million in five years.

The hungry are most numerous in Asia but expanding fastest in Africa, according to the latest edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI).

High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously.

Across the globe, the Covid-19 crisis could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020, the report predicts.

And flare-ups of acute hunger as a result of the pandemic could see this number escalate even further at times, it said.

The global study is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Writing in the foreword, the heads of the five agencies warned that “five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030”.

In the latest report, newly-accessible data for China and other populous countries have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million.

However the study’s authors said there has been no change in the trend reported in past editions of the report, which shows that “after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so”.

Asia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million), while Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million), UN researchers found.

While Africa is the hardest-hit region in terms of undernourished people per percentage of population and becoming more so at 19.1 per cent.

This is more than double the rate in Asia (8.3 per cent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.4 per cent). On current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.

While it is too soon to assess the full impact of lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that, at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by Covid-19.

This means the world is not on track to achieve the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) of ending hungry by 2030.

The UN agencies present evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than $1.90/day - the international poverty threshold.

The latest estimates are that a “staggering” 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet.

The report suggests that if current food consumption patterns continue, the health costs associated with unhealthy diets are estimated to reach about $1.3 trillion per year by 2030.

The researchers urge a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets.","Global hunger was increasing even before the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations has warned, putting its Zero Hunger 2030 target in doubt.

The report estimates 690 million people suffering from hunger globally in 2019, 10 million more than the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic, and the global recession caused by it, will without doubt make matters worse, the report warns, with 130 million more suffering from chronic hunger in 2020. In 2019, Asia had the highest number of hungry people (381 million), followed by Africa (250 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030. The lowest-cost healthy diet is estimated to cost, on an average, more than $1.90—which is more than the international poverty threshold—and around three billion people across the globe are unable to afford this. Rising food deprivation will exacerbate the existing problem of nutrition security.

The largest impact, both for the present as well as the future, will be of hunger amongst children—191 million children under the age of five are currently undernourished. While India saw under-5 undernutrition decline by around 60 million over the last one and a half decade, from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19, and stunting has also come down, experts fear the pandemic could erode some of this progress. The UN has pitched for clubbing direct cash transfers with in-kind transfers to ensure food security and diet diversity, though, in India’s case, it talks of the inefficiencies of the PDS and calls for reducing subsidies and redirecting these to direct cash transfer. Malnutrition, as estimated by FAO earlier, may cost nations 4-5% of their GDPs. Given how ensuring food security gets more urgent in the post-Covid-19 world, India needs to shift comprehensively to cash support, so that the vulnerable don’t fall through gaps—thanks to poor implementation, the bulk of beneficiaries of the free-grains announced under the corona relief package by the Union government were unable to receive these in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030.

By Ashwajit Singh

Covid-19 and the ensuing global economic crisis have demonstrated that the world is unprepared for food security. The UN’s recent report ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020’ projected that the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger by 2030 will not be met. Closer home, while India’s public health challenge is by far the biggest in these times, the food insecurity hurdle has also been looming in the background, threatening to become much bigger.

To counter this, PM Narendra Modi announced the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) will be extended till November. Free grain is being distributed to ensure the poorest of the poor are not left hungry. This scheme was touted as a response against the pandemic and was supposed to cost Rs 1.7 lakh crore to the exchequer. Even though it is one of the biggest food security schemes in the world in terms of scale, a closer look needs to be paid to its implementation.

While the government has claimed that many states had requested the Centre for the scheme’s extension, data shows that 11 states have distributed less than 1% of the foodgrains they lifted from the reserves. Almost 8 lakh tonnes of foodgrains had been allocated for distribution under the scheme in March, but the states were able to distribute only 1.07 lakh tonnes of that till May. The delay has been attributed to supply chain disruptions; states like Goa and Telangana have claimed there is no one eligible to receive the foodgrains since migrant workers have moved out.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) states that the four pillars of food security are availability, access, stability and utilisation. While the government is ensuring availability, access to foodgrains and utilisation are the areas that need the government’s immediate attention.

Even though there have been vast improvements in the public distribution system, the government needs to keep improving its distribution mechanism and solutions to the existing gaps need to be found soon. The FAO recommends improved information systems and collaborating with the private sector to solve distribution problems. Inter-state collaboration and learning can be a viable solution in India’s case, too.

The food security and nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the pandemic. A disruption in accessing foodgrains might also mean that the gains India has had in its fight against malnutrition among vulnerable groups like women and children might be lost. Almost 194.4 million people in India are undernourished, according to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019 report by the FAO.

Nutrition-centric programmes like the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and mid-day meals need to keep going strong even though Anganwadi Centres and schools—the respective nodal agencies for the schemes—might not open soon. States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha have responded well even during lockdown times by providing dry ration, under these schemes, from door-to-door. Other states need to replicate this.

Direct cash transfers into the accounts of eligible beneficiaries have worked in states like Rajasthan to reduce stunting, wasting and underweight among children and can be launched at the national level. The lockdown made it difficult for the established government systems to function seamlessly. It was at such a time that the efficacy of cash transfers proved to be more operational.

Another solution is the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme, under which eligible beneficiaries would be able to avail their entitled foodgrains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) from any Fair Price Shop in the country using the same ration card.

To not just deal with Covid-19, but to ensure its food security in the long-term, India would do well to expand its social protection measures to ensure the vulnerable are included in the food distribution system across all states. Another measure we need to take is to build resilience in the food system to protect it against unforeseen economic and health shocks. A vision is only as good as its implementation and monitoring—robust monitoring systems should also be designed to measure the impact of various initiatives around food security like ICDS and direct cash transfer to ensure that we continue to work towards zero hunger.

However, malnutrition is not uniform throughout the country, and its prevalence corresponds to the uneven levels of economic development between different regions.

According to a new report from the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI) that published July 15, researchers have mapped opportunities for India to reduce hunger and improve overall nutrition by reorienting its agricultural policies in favor of more nutritious foods.



Jorge Royan/Provided The Food, Agriculture, and Nutrition in India 2020 report advocates for diversifying India’s agricultural production to include more fruits, vegetables, coarse grains and pulses, such as chickpeas.

In “Food, Agriculture, and Nutrition in India 2020: Leveraging Agriculture to Achieve Zero Hunger,” TCI researchers assess India’s progress toward achieving zero hunger by 2030 – a sustainable development goal established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.

The new report assesses the prospects for enhancing productivity and increasing farm income across India, and it emphasizes the need for continued investment in agricultural infrastructure.

Since the late 1960s, India has made considerable progress in reducing hunger in terms of calories, but many people remain undernourished, and now the country is also facing rising rates of obesity. The TCI report says this is due to government policies that boosted staple grains, like wheat and rice, which helped meet people’s caloric needs but are now inhibiting the production of more diverse and nutritious foods.



Prabhu Pingali

“To provide its people with nutritious foods, India must turn the focus of its food policies from quantity to quality,” said Prabhu Pingali, director of TCI and professor in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, with joint appointments in the Division of Nutritional Sciences and the Department of Global Development in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). “Without policies that promote access to and availability of nutrient-rich foods, much of the country is left with diets high in either nutrient-poor grains or fattening processed foods.”

In the economically lagging and less agriculturally productive states of central and eastern India, 63% of dietary calories come from cereal grains. This leads to stunting and wasting of bodies due to nutrient deficiencies in diets, especially for the impoverished.

In contrast, in the more developed and more agriculturally productive states of northwestern and southern India, access to processed foods and edible fats have had the opposite effect. In the last 10 years, the rate of obesity doubled for men and increased by 62% for women, bringing with it a rise in diabetes and heart disease.

Using district-level data, the report’s authors created maps showing the dominant crops grown in different areas and offered advice for increasing productivity and diversifying local food systems.

For example, for the cropping systems of eastern India – which are less productive due to poor infrastructure and agroclimatic conditions – they recommend adopting crops that require less water, such as pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds.

Pingali and his team collected data for food systems and nutrition maps using the District-Level Database for Indian Agriculture and Allied Sectors, a comprehensive data platform jointly developed by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and TCI, which is part of CALS and hosted by the Dyson School.

“India has many different agroecologies that lend themselves to distinct cropping systems,” said Kiera Crowley, M.S. ’07, co-author and research support specialist at TCI. “The widespread data collected by TCI and ICRISAT proved indispensable in our efforts to map those systems.”

Tailoring efforts to local cropping systems will help ensure that new policies can be as effective as possible. However, this approach requires close coordination between all levels of government. “Breaking out of our disciplinary and organizational silos is crucial for ensuring success in achieving the zero-hunger goal,” Pingali said.

Enhancing agricultural productivity is particularly important in the lagging states. As the report notes, states that failed to invest in agriculture during the Green Revolution of the 1960s were left with weak agricultural sectors and high levels of poverty.

Since the lagging states are unlikely to match the productivity of staple-grain agriculture in developed states, the researchers recommend focusing efforts on adding more diverse crops like pulses, coarse grains, fruits and vegetables. With investment from the public and private sectors, farmers could take advantage of the growing demand for these crops, which can be sold at higher prices than staple crops.

“Investing in agriculture, especially in lagging states, can cause a chain reaction that improves nutrition,” said Andaleeb Rahman, co-author and postdoctoral associate. “It increases farmers’ income, allowing them to purchase more nutritious foods, while also improving household health environments and allocation of food within the home, both of which are key to better nutrition outcomes.”

The report is the first in a series from TCI. Future reports will provide updates on progress toward a hunger free India.

“The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020” also indicates that the number of people affected by severe food insecurity has experienced a similar upward trend over the last five years. In 2019, close to 750 million—or nearly one in ten people in the world—were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity.

The figures reveal that about 2 billion people in the world did not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019.

COVID-19 and Hunger

Considering the widespread impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that the pandemic may add between 83 and 132 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world in 2020 depending on the economic growth scenario.

Also, the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.

Children and Malnutrition

While the burden of malnutrition in all its forms remains a challenge for the world, current estimates reveal that in 2019, 21.3 percent (144 million) of children under 5 years of age were stunted, 6.9 percent (47 million) wasted and 5.6 percent (38.3 million) overweight.

Healthy Diet

The report states that healthy diets are unaffordable to many people, especially the poor, in every region of the world. The most conservative estimate shows they are unaffordable for more than 3 billion people in the world. Healthy diets are estimated to be, on average, five times more expensive than diets that meet only dietary energy needs through a starchy staple.

Diet, Health and Climate Change

Under current food consumption patterns, diet-related health costs linked to mortality and non-communicable diseases are projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030.

On the other hand, the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions associated with current dietary patterns is estimated to be more than USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030.

Policies and Measures for Affordable Healthy Diet

The United Nations agencies call on countries to rebalance their agricultural policies and incentives towards more nutrition-sensitive investment and policy actions all along the food supply chain to reduce food losses and enhance efficiencies at all stages.

Nutrition-sensitive social protection policies are also central for the countries to increase the purchasing power and affordability of healthy diets of the most vulnerable populations.

Iran’s Situation

According to the report, Iran experienced a relative reduction in the prevalence of undernourishment in its total population, dropping from 5.2 percent in the period of 2004-2006 to 4.7 percent in period of 2017-2019.

by NUR HAZIQAH A MALEK/ pic by BLOOMBERG

THE global Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be the main stumbling block for the United Nations (UN) to achieve its “zero hunger” target by 2030.

The UN secretary general spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric de la Rivière said the pandemic is making things even worse than it already is, as more people are slipping into hunger this year.

“The secretary general himself said we cannot make this happen. If the current trend continues, we will not achieve the sustainable development that’s zero hunger by 2030,” he said in a daily noon press briefing on Monday.

The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry last year, 10 million more from the number reported in 2018.

The projection also shows an increase of nearly 60 million in the next five years.

The study revealed that based on the latest available global economic outlooks, preliminary projections show that the Covid-19 pandemic may add an additional 83 million to 132 million people to the ranks of the undernourished in 2020.

“Despite the reassessment of the extent of hunger in China, the majority of the world’s undernourished — 381 million — are still found in Asia.

“More than 250 million live in Africa, where the number of undernourished people is growing faster than in any other region of the world,” the report stated, adding that the burden of malnutrition is also noted as a global challenge.

“According to estimates, in 2019, 21.3% (144 million) of children under five years of age were stunted, 6.9% (47 million) wasted and 5.6% (38.3 million) overweight.

“The world is making progress, but is not on track to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child stunting and low birthweight. For exclusive breastfeeding, is on track only for the 2025 target. The prevalence of wasting is notably above the targets,” the report revealed.

On the other hand, adult obesity is also on the rise in all regions and if it continues to rise by 2.6% per year, it will reach 40% growth in 2025.

“Adult obesity continues to rise, from 11.8% in 2012 to 13.1% in 2016 and is not on track to reach the global target to halt the rise in adult obesity by 2025,” it added.

After factoring in sustainability considerations, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings.

“It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$1.3 trillion (RM5.55 trillion) a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset, while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions — estimated at US$1.7 trillion — could be cut by up to three-quarters,” the report said.

The UN report also highlighted that in order to ensure nutritious foods are delivered, as well as affordability of healthy diets, policies would have to be adjusted, and measures would have to be taken.

“Reducing the costs of nutritious foods and ensuring the affordability of healthy diets for everyone requires significant transformations of existing food systems worldwide, including strengthening their resilience in the face of shocks from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Given the diversity and complexity of food systems, countries will need to implement a set of context-specific policies and strategies, step up public and private sector investments with significant policy coherence, and improved planning and coordination across sectors and actors,” it said.

An urgent rebalancing of agricultural policies and incentives should start the process, as well as policy actions along food supply chains to reduce costs, and that efficiency of internal trade and marketing mechanisms are the keys to reaching the objectives.

“Raising the affordability of healthy diets requires policies that enhance employment and income-generating activities, reduce income inequality and ensure no one is left behind.

“Nutrition-sensitive social protection programmes will be particularly necessary to support the poor and those living through humanitarian crises, without basic access to sufficient nutritious food to meet dietary requirements,” the report added.","If the current trend continues, we will not achieve the sustainable development that’s zero hunger by 2030,” he said in a daily noon press briefing on Monday.

This new funding is in addition to a $19 billion COVID-19 relief initiative announced in April, including $16 billion in direct payments to farmers, more than $14 billion in payments made to offset the effects of the Trump administration’s trade war with China, and more than $15 billion in ongoing, annual taxpayer-funded farm subsidies.

Overall, federal farm subsidy spending will set new records in 2019 and 2020 – likely violating international trade agreements.

Through Freedom of Information Act requests, EWG has learned that most bailout funding has flowed to the largest, most successful farms – not to the family farms in greatest need of help. Between August 2018 and October 2019, the top 1 percent of recipients of Market Facilitation Program payments collected 14 percent of all MFP funds, with 6,000 farmers each harvesting more than $300,000.

One farmer, Smith & Sons in Texas, received $2.3 million. Another, Deline Farms in Missouri, received $2.2 million. By contrast, in the same time period, the bottom 80 percent of MFP recipients – or about 500,000 farmers – each received about $7,000.

Unlike hunger or housing assistance programs, MFP payments and other farm subsidies can still go to millionaires. The Trump administration’s Agriculture Department chose to retain the same meager means test that applies to most farm subsidies: Farm couples can receive payments so long as their annual average net income does not exceed $1.8 million.

The agency also did nothing to close loopholes that allow distant relations or silent partners to collect subsidies, regardless of whether they live or work on the farm. As a result, EWG keeps finding ""city slickers"" on the list of farm bailouts. Even Trump campaign advisors and billionaires are cashing in.

Despite the surge in funding, the USDA has not yet pledged to spend any COVID-19 disaster funds to provide growers or farmworkers with personal protective equipment or funds for housing and transportation options that will reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

So far, bailout spending has provided $590 million to farmers in the 100 counties with the most farmworkers. But there is no requirement that these funds be used to improve worker conditions. Instead, the lion’s share of bailout funds flowed to the largest and most successful farmers.

The harvest season is in full swing, bringing thousands of farmworkers into the fields, but the Trump administration has so far refused to issue mandatory protections from COVID-19. Although some farmworkers are able to spread out in fields, many migrant and seasonal workers live and travel to work in ways that increase the likelihood the virus will spread.

So far, at least 5,000 farmworkers have tested positive for COVID-19 and at least six have died.

Despite appeals from Congress, neither the Occupational Safety and Health Administration nor the USDA has yet issued emergency standards requiring farm employers to meet safety guidelines developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only 10 states have adopted mandatory job safety standards.","There’s only one word to describe Senate Republicans’ proposal to shower even more COVID-19 relief funding on the nation’s largest farmers while providing none to protect farm workers or help hungry families.

Tam Keong Yee opened the restaurant’s doors in 1911 in Butte, Montana, a boomtown that welcomed surges of immigrants from all over the world. Many came to Butte in the 1860s looking for gold, but ultimately made their fortunes with copper.

The country’s hunger for electricity fueled the demand for copper in the 1890s and paved the way for Butte to become known as “The Richest Hill on Earth” during its mining heyday.

Butte is no longer a boomtown. It’s rough around the edges and many of its side-by-side houses could use a fresh coat of paint. The Berkeley Pit, a mile-long, man-made divot that yielded 290 million tons of copper ore, is an eyesore that’s impossible to ignore. The pit is now filled with acidic, arsenic-laced water that’s toxic to all living creatures—except apparently Auditor, a shaggy, feral dog who somehow managed to survive there for 17 years and is now memorialized with a bronze statue in Butte.

Butte’s skyline has 14 abandoned headframes marking the defunct mines. The tall steel structures once lowered men and mules into the mines and hauled ore out. Underground, 10,000 miles of tunnels connect these mines.

As the copper price declined, so did Butte’s population. Through it all, Pekin Noodle Parlor remained unchanged.

100 years

Today, Pekin Noodle Parlor is run by Jerry Tam, the fifth generation of his family to do so. Tam’s ancestors started a mercantile and later an herbal medicine shop on the ground floor—but the upper floor has always been a place for chop suey. The original sign above the restaurant’s entrance says so. I climb a steep set of stairs to get to the restaurant minutes after it opens, following three diners who came from Indiana just to experience dinner and hospitality at Pekin.

Chinese workers first came to Montana in the 1860s, seeking a better life and to try their luck at the gold rush. The restaurant was originally opened by Tam’s great-grandfather and great-great-uncle.

“Pekin has gone through every war, every pandemic,” Tam says over a plate of barbecued pork and hot mustard sauce. “And we’ve been social distancing for 109 years.”

The restaurant still has its original cubicles, featuring tangerine-colored walls that stop just short of the ceiling. Even though it is a traditional Chinese design, Pekin’s private dining setup has allowed it to weather two pandemics (and counting). The tables and wrought-iron ice cream parlor chairs are original, too.

Tam says the most important things to him are his family and preserving Pekin. After his mom passed away in 2014, Tam stepped in to help his dad, Danny Wong, run the restaurant. For Pekin’s 100-year anniversary, father and son served a complimentary dinner to 1,000 people.

Pekin’s patrons

Pekin opened before World War I and survived the 1918 flu pandemic. It bore witness to bloody riots between rival union workers and the dynamiting of the union hall in 1914. It shared the grief of an underground fire that claimed the lives of 168 miners in 1917. Pekin persevered despite anti-Asian sentiment and outlasted the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was overturned in 1943.

It stood as most of Chinatown’s other buildings were razed years ago. And Pekin remained through every economic downturn that’s occurred in a town whose livelihood is linked to a single industry. Today, as Butte transitions to a tourism-based economy, Pekin is a destination.

Over the years, Pekin, which was nominated for a James Beard Outstanding Hospitality award earlier this year, has welcomed celebrities, politicians, miners, and copper kings. Famous guests include country singer Waylon Jennings, who spent plenty of time in the lounge, and a handful of famous boy bands. “NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to one of the band members right here,” Tam says, pointing to the banquet area. “Oh, and the cast from A River Runs Through It ate here, too, before Brad Pitt was famous.”

But, Tam insists, “the real celebrities are our regular customers.”

Comfort food

Years ago, Pekin stayed open until 4 a.m., feeding the bar patrons after last call and hosting its share of alcohol-fueled brawls; bullet holes mar the wainscot. The restaurant is tamer now—open from 5 p.m. until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, and until 10 p.m. on weeknights.

So far, the restaurant has been thriving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, patrons started ordering dinner for 10, easily filling a couple of boxes for takeout. They weren’t having dinner parties, just stocking up in reaction to the world shutting down. This is Butte’s comfort food. The restaurant is open again for in-person dining and the wheels of a serving cart make a clickety-clack sound as long-time waitress Arlene Breyer pushes it over the original floorboards.

Tam gives me the behind-the-scenes tour, showing off the century-old smoker filled with pork tenderloin and the pulley system used to haul ingredients up to the second-floor restaurant. Stepping up to one of four huge woks, Tam tosses chicken, vegetables, and curry into sizzling oil. The curry is a secret family recipe and has a lot of zing. “Noodles or rice?” he asks. I choose noodles but he includes the rice, too.

“Pekin one, world zero,” Tam says. “One of my customers said that after World War III, Pekin will be the only thing still standing.”","The nation’s oldest, continuously-operated Chinese restaurant, Pekin Noodle Parlor, is surviving yet another pandemic.

The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare a number of reckonings for our urban spaces and how we interact with them. A notably striking one has been with our carbon footprint. Global lockdowns in movement correlated with the single largest drop in carbon emissions since World War II—and reopening has seen a return to “business as usual” so fast that even climate scientists are startled. Now, cities worldwide are wondering how they can lock in the environmental gains made during the pandemic before they disappear.

So it appears more timely than ever to ask this question of Rio. How can the Cidade Maravilhosa—a city that has held a statured role in the sustainability debate, home to the first-ever global conference on the topic—craft a low-carbon future? Specifically, let’s focus on the transportation sector, which is now one of the largest contributors of CO2 emissions globally (and steadily increasing). In the end, it was the drop in mobility, namely from air, freight and automobile travel, that led cities to see the cleanest air in a generation.

Using the backcasting approach to scenario analysis—where we project a future scenario and work back through the steps necessary to attain that scenario—this article will frame alternative futures for Rio, sustainable and unsustainable, examining both the key drivers of change and the uncertainties affecting transport here over the next 30 years. Ultimately, it will propose a future vision for low-carbon transport in the city by 2050 and discuss the potential policy routes available to achieve those goals.

Definitions and Considerations

According the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) definition, “sustainable” refers to a stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere at 450 parts per million (ppm), or lower than 1,000 Gigagram (Gg) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Given relatively stable trends, let us assume that the city’s population grows from around 6.5 million in 2020 to approximately 7 million by 2050. According to the United Nations, Rio’s metropolitan region will climb faster, from 13 million in 2020 to 14 million in 2030, and perhaps to over 16 million by 2050—holding significant implications for transport.

Rio’s transport here is defined as all transport generated by the city’s residents, including journeys made both domestically and internationally, and freight transport. Nearly half of Brazil’s carbon emissions are caused by land use, which, after years of decline, are poised to rise due to increased deforestation. But in Rio, energy consumption made up 79% of the 20.56 million tons of carbon released into the atmosphere in 2017; of that, transport contributes nearly 36%, or 7,371 Gg of CO2e. “On road” traffic makes up about three-quarters of transport emissions, with aviation contributing around a quarter. Therefore, reducing passenger transport emissions is critical.

Using forecasts deployed by Jonas Åkerman and Mattias Höjer, our analysis acknowledges technology’s potential in reducing vehicular fuel intensity 35-80% by 2050, 40% in aviation, and 20-60% for freight. We have to distinguish also between the travel needed to reach a desired destination (derived), and the travel necessary to complete certain functions, like employment or groceries (structurally enforced). The latter is, of course, more difficult to change, but is by far the most significant: in Rio’s favelas, 49% of all trips are taken for work, 39% for study. In order to shape this travel, one has to look at geographic and functional accessibility, or the distances of the trips made; in Rio, the average trip to work is 17.74km, which takes about 52 minutes. The private car owner travels the farthest (22.1 km), and almost the longest (51 minutes), second only to bus riders (63 minutes). The highest potential for fuel efficiency is projected for short-distance car travel, but with growth expected in population and automobile sales (which we’ll get to below), it can be concluded that technology alone will not guarantee sustainability.

It is also worth providing context for transport in Latin America. In Rio, the automobile is the mode used for only 22% of transportation that occurs in the city. Yet Rio’s built form is still heavily car-centric, clustered around major urban highways, hillside-bored tunnels, and trafficked thoroughfares. Bus journeys, which make up 37% of modal share, can be arduous or unsafe; walking journeys, a quarter of trips made, involve crossing dangerous roads with little sidewalk space. As Brazilian transport planner Eduardo Alcântara Vasconcellos explains, for years, resources were predominantly dedicated to a car-driving minority rather than to public transport users. This is due to a range of historic factors in Latin America, he writes, including lack of political representation, scarcity of data, centralized power, economic constraints, and conservative transportation planning. As a result, services once available locally are now located farther apart, most conveniently accessed by car.

Transportation and Urban Inequality

Urban transport in Rio entails underlying issues of equity that may not exist to the same extent in a Western context. This distinction is crucial in whatever planning or policy prescriptions are made going forward. Under the technocratic administration of Mayor Eduardo Paes, the city marketed itself as addressing these inequities through several major transportation investments, including the introduction of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network; an expansion of the cycling and cycle-hire network; new light rail services; and a fourth subway line with larger cars. However, commute times actually increased, the increase in modes being more of a marketing ploy than assurance of access (since numerous bus lines were cut, including direct access from lower-income areas to higher-income areas of the city).

The investments appeared to pay off in ridership: in 2010, the city had 2.3 million bus riders, 588,000 metro riders, and 499,000 tram riders; in 2018, there were 2.9 million, 661,000, and 598,000, respectively. However, it is unclear how much of this is an increase in individuals, since rather than taking a direct bus now multiple modes are required (hence why commute times increased).

The city’s 450 km of cycle lanes accumulated over the years (up from two in 1990), are an improvement, though the patchwork nature of those paths leads to significant gaps that cause many injuries and fatalities. For decades Avenida Atlântica and four other important roads are closed to car traffic on Sundays. Micro-mobility devices, like scooters, are now being deployed by private companies with city regulation. Today, in yet another generation of marketing ploys, conservative mayor Marcelo Crivella has pledged “fossil-fuel-free streets” with electric buses by 2030 and other traffic calming measures—but as with other pledges of his first administration, now coming to an end, little has been done, kicking responsibility once again to the next administration.

While the city’s overall transport emissions declined from 8.7 million tons in 2012 to 7.3 million in 2017, this may be due primarily to economic recession. Furthermore, the city government said that “the growth in the number of private cars” was a key driver behind a spike in overall energy consumption, without a major population change, from 8.7 million tons in 2005 to 17.9 million tons in 2012. Car ownership has grown from 1.3 million automobiles in 2001 to 2.2 million in 2019, encouraged by a burgeoning middle class and relatively low gasoline costs, according to the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Although still less than 1% of modal share, ownership of two-wheel mopeds is growing even faster, from 75,755 in 2001 to over 330,000 in 2019. An outsized ethanol-based “flex-fuel fleet” has helped offset emissions, but the rate of automobile growth still poses the most significant obstacle affecting transport over the next 30 years.

This key driver of change is, again, underlined by the structural enforcements of travel in Rio itself. Geographically, the city is difficult to cross, lying at the intersection of mountains, rainforest, and the Atlantic coast; its vastness is divided in four zones: North, South, West, and its downtown Centro, where half of the city’s jobs are concentrated. Unlike industrialized countries, where wealthier residents often live far away from city centers, Rio’s well-off are concentrated in the beachside South Zone, while low-income residents are increasingly pushed to the urban periphery. This segregation means that each day, millions trek to Centro for work, and more are expected with Greater Rio’s projected growth in the years ahead. Currently, at 52 minutes, Greater Rio has the highest home-to-work transit time of any metropolitan region in Brazil.

Assuming no interventions surface, the “Unsustainable Rio 2050” scenario projects that transport emissions will stay around 7,000 Gg of CO2e by 2030. Should the vehicular modal share hover near 25%, and 1 million people join the region’s population, 250,000 new cars and motorcycles on the road as well as continued air travel will largely offset fuel efficiencies of 35% to 40%, and 20%, respectively. Maintaining the current transport investments, as seen, will not have a significant impact. Greater Rio’s growth will raise automobile sales even higher by 2050, but new technology may limit emissions further to 5,000 to 6,000 Gg. Regardless, “business as usual” will continue.

The Road to Sustainability

Here’s the “Sustainable Rio 2050” scenario. To reiterate, Rio’s transport in 2020 makes up 35.9% of its emissions (7,371 Gg), with a modal share of 47.3% public transport users, including bus, subway, train, and light rail; walking, 27.24%; cars, 22.74%; and cycling, 1%. To arrive at a sustainable level, by 2050, Rio’s transport must equal only 0-5% of the city’s emissions (1,000 Gg or below; the IPCC-level sustainability). To reach this level, we need to arrive at a modal share of public transport users at 60%; walking, 30%; cycling, 5%; and cars, 5%. In the meantime, on path to this goal, by 2040, transport must make up 15% of emissions, with public transport at 57%; walking, 29%; cars, 10%; and cycling, 4%. And by 2030, Rio’s transport must make up 25% of emissions, with public transport at 55%; walking, 28%; cars, 15%; and cycling, 3%.

This progression would bring a low-carbon transport future within reach by 2050. So how can this happen?

At the national level: investing in renewable energy, creating an intercity train network, installing eco-efficient freight networks, and implementing an air fuel tax should be explored to lower emissions from domestic and international transport. Rio itself already has a number of effective strategies available to boost non-vehicular modal shares within city limits. Shifting the BRT system to rail and improving bus service would help lessen travel time for riders. Expanding the BRT system could help too. But planners cannot repeat the same mistakes made in the lead-up to the 2016 Summer Olympics, when the BRT system was developed into to lower-need areas of the West Zone, displacing many in its wake and leading them to live further, not closer, to employment (and thus ultimately spending more time in traffic). Rather, BRT would be more impactful in the populous North Zone, where commuting times can reach up to three hours due to backlogged roads.

Robust, continuous, cycling infrastructure and rental networks should extend to the North Zone as well, helping to connect commuters to a large and safe network, along with affordable “last mile” solutions. Further efforts should increase sidewalk space, and make streets safer to walk. Additional train, light rail, and metro lines should also be developed, with greater seamless integration between the systems fundamental. Only if wide-reaching transport improvements are made can the city consider a minimal congestion surcharge to enter the South Zone or Centro; otherwise, charging car owners in this context encroaches upon aforementioned issues of equity. Assuming streets are safe enough, a citywide push for low- or zero-emission mopeds—increasingly an optimal choice of getting around—could offset expected growth.

The growth in automobile ownership, however, cannot be tackled without accounting for travel purposes, destinations, and the modes available. Average trips, as seen, are longest by car, at 22.1 km. A prerequisite of “Sustainable Rio 2050” is a reduction in structured travel to 50% or lower by 2050. One area for guidance is employment: researchers found notable disparities in commutes exist between informal and formal jobs. In Rio, 55% of residents are informally employed, meaning they work without employment papers, or are self-employed. This population is more likely to live closer to work, and not drive, with a mean commuting distance of 6.4km; thus, 23.2% walk. Formal employees, meanwhile, have a mean commuting distance of 10.6km, with only 16% of journeys made on foot. While shifting economic headwinds can be difficult, maintaining helpful facets of informal employment—e.g. incentives for working near home; stimulus for self-entrepreneurship—should be implemented.

As shown, however, where wealth and opportunity are concentrated, spatial inequities result. The city must do more to address this imbalance in access, by creating local and regional nodes for employment, shopping, and leisure in the North and West Zones, such as are promoted in the “15-minute city” trend in urban planning. Residents should not need to travel three hours to obtain a well-paying job; 50% of public transport trips should not be for educational or health services. Vital community infrastructure, like parks and cultural amenities, should be widely dispersed, not only available to upper strata. The need for a car to access the most basic of resources should be minimized at all costs.

A case study can be found in Rio’s favelas, where residents travel significantly more by non-motorized modes than the rest of the city, according to a report from the Lincoln Institute. Most trips within the community are for leisure, shopping, and work, and only 3% of said trips are done by cars; when residents leave the favela, 50% of trips are for work. Recognizing that these neighborhoods have historically been marginalized, and steep slopes in some favelas discourage car use, the temporal nature of hyper-local services is worth mentioning here.

A sustainable future in Rio hinges on a dramatic rethinking of how the city functions for its residents and who the city is built for in the first place. Acknowledging trends in modal share and emissions, this article laid out the targets necessary to achieve a low-carbon transport future by 2050—as well as the realities of what would happen should inaction take hold—utilizing backcasting as its scenario analysis approach. The future, however, is not hopeless: Rio’s mobility has made inroads, and vehicular modal share remains lower than in many developed cities. But ‘pledges’ are threatened by rising car sales, population growth and haphazard transportation planning, which will hinder progress unless spatial inequities are addressed and comprehensive transportation planning undertaken.

Rio, like any great city, is unique, but characteristics applicable in developing contexts upend typical transport planning assumptions. Planners must recognize area-specific dynamics at play; too often, ideas imported from Asian or European contexts have failed, or exacerbated existing tensions. In the words of Vasconcellos, policies for low-carbon transport must be both environmentally conscious and equitable to realize a green future for Rio.

The world in quarantine offers a short glimpse of what that could look like, albeit under tragic pretences. Now comes the hard part.

Dole Packaged Foods has just announced its new sustainability pledges, including eliminating food waste and all petroleum-based plastic packaging from its product lines by 2025, as well as achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Dole’s environmental commitments follow a slew of renewed sustainability promises made by multinational brands, and is yet another sign that corporations are feeling the pressure from consumers to step up climate action.

Last week, Dole, the world’s largest producer and distributor of fruit, announced they will be dramatically stepping up their sustainability efforts. According to an official release sent to Green Queen, the company hopes to achieve zero fruit loss at all Dole farms to markets and eliminate all fossil-based plastic packaging by 2024. They will also aim to reach carbon neutral status across its operations by 2030, decades ahead of the deadline outlined by the Paris Agreement.

Some of the practical steps that Dole is going to take to achieve these goals include exploring new ways to utilise food waste scraps, such as pineapple skins and banana leaves, into biodegradable natural packaging. They also want to utilise misshapen fruit and veggies – produce that are edible but would otherwise go to waste due to aesthetic reasons – by incorporating them into new snacks and products.

What about the remainder of excess waste? Dole says it plans to put it in new biogas facilities, which would turn food waste into usable electricity for its processing plants. It will additionally move towards clean energy solutions on its farms and its transportation systems.

“If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the United States and China in terms of impact on global warming,” president of Dole, Pier Luigi Sigismondi, told Fast Company.

“When we waste fruit or food, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it. And if it goes to the landfill and rots, it produces methane – a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide.”

Currently, the world’s food waste – half of which is generated by Asia – contributes a staggering 10% of global carbon emissions that drive our climate crisis. But in addition to coming at an enormous environmental cost, discarded food further fuels the issues of everyday hunger, malnutrition and food security – problems that have become even more pertinent amid the coronavirus crisis.

“As our society begins to fully understand the impacts of COVID-19, which has exacerbated the global epidemic of food inequality and put a spotlight on interdependent challenges in the supply chain, we know that the collective implications we’re facing today will have generational repercussions for the future if not addressed now,” said Richard Toman, president of Dole Asia Fresh Division, in the press release.

“That’s why we’re doubling down on our mission of putting the heart of the planet and people at the center of everything we do.”

Dole’s environmental commitments come after several multinational brands renewed their sustainability pledges in recent weeks – representing a reckoning amongst the world’s biggest companies that mass consumers are now demanding real corporate action on the climate and ecological crisis.

While tech giant Amazon launched a US$2 billion climate fund, no doubt in part to allay criticism over its tainted environmental record, consumer goods behemoth Unilever pledged to reach net-zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2039, as well as put carbon labels on all of its 70,000 products.

Both Amazon and Unilever’s pledges followed a joint statement signed by 155 multinationals with a combined worth of over US$2 trillion demanding world governments to make net-zero emissions the centre of coronavirus recovery plans.

“We do recognize we do have to score runs,” Shildt said when asked how to read the box scores of camp. “We can’t sit there and alibi it.”

But they can look deeper, and do. Part of what drove the conversation Marmol and Shildt had during BP was the granular data the team is keeping from intrasquad games and the live batting practice sessions. Shildt pooled it with the numbers from the Grapefruit League play for a larger data set and said they were encouraged that their “chase rate” – fishing for pitches out of the zone – had been reduced from last season and was more in line with the league leaders.

Shildt said that has continued into “Summer Camp.” That was a focus of spring training as hitting coach Jeff Albert individualized the drills, and Shildt regularly described how the offensive uptick was going to be a process throughout spring. Spring stopped, that process did not, Shildt said.

“It already had life to it,” the manager described. “The life from (spring). These guys worked tremendously hard a) during the offseason, b) during spring training 1.0, and c) during the break. Guys were super-intentional. A lot of it just looks really right. We’re in a good spot offensively.”","The numbers look the same.

The wait is over – Re:Zero Season 2 has arrived. Following a delay due to the ongoing pandemic, the season premiered July 8 on Crunchyroll, and was in such high demand that the streaming service experienced outages as fans clamored to log on. The wait was worth it. As the cast returned, along came the all too familiar emotional roller coaster as tragedy reared its head early on.

Two years following the premiere of the original series, ""Each One's Promise"" picks up immediately after Emilia and Subaru's victory over the White Whale and Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti. Subaru, donned in his typical track suit, confesses to Emilia that Rem had promised herself to him and that she, in fact, loves him. Expecting a strong reaction, Subaru is somehow shocked when Emilia simply responds by asking who Rem is.

As the caravan returns from battle, the re-forgotten Rem and the Matriarch of House Karsten, Crusch Karsten, discuss the benefits of smiling. The short but sweet moment is interrupted by an attack -- and the resulting chaos is both brutal and tragic. As the pair leap to safety, Crusch's vassals are wiped out in gory fashion. As viscera rains from the sky, two new Witch Cult Archbishops are introduced.

This might remind you of Full Metal Alchemist or other anime series that utilizes the seven deadly sins as villains, as Gluttony and Greed make their first series appearance. Greed, a tall pretentious man in white robes with an aura of faux royalty simply blinks and the caravan is destroyed. A swipe of his hand disembodies Crusch's arm, leaving Rem to crouch over her as a pool of blood forms on the ground.

Out of the carnage struts Sin Archbishop Gluttony, rambling about hunger and his desire to consume. The battle between the three is short. Subaru and Emilia, arriving on the scene with the survivors at Crusch's hold, find the gruesome aftermath to be too much -- especially for Subaru, who when finding Rem, decides to end his life using a broken sword to the throat.

This would normally allow him to restart from a previous point in time, much like a video game. He expects that by doing so he would need to fight Petelgeuse once again, not a small task, but a sacrifice he's willing to endure in order to bring Rem back from her comatose state. However, his suicide doesn't go according to plan and Subaru returns to life in the back of the wagon with Emilia, perhaps signalling that there exists a barrier between seasons that will keep him from traveling too far into the past.

Through the power of magic, Rem and Crusch are alive and well in the Karsten manor when Subaru and Emilia return. Crusch's arm has been healed, presumably by her servant Felix, though there is no onscreen confirmation of this. As Subaru sits by the comatose Rem, Puck arrives to fill us in on the new threat.

Gluttony doesn't simply eat physical aspects of a person -- he eats names and memories. Having consumed both Rem's name and memories, she exists as no more than a husk that even Puck's magic cannot heal. Crusch, on the other hand, simply had her memories taken, and though she cannot remember most anything, including who Felix is and that she is a candidate for the Lugnica crown, she is able to take part in planning how to handle the Witch Cult members. Felix's answer is simply to disband the alliance with Emilia, the target of the Cult's wraith. This suggestion is vetoed and the alliance carries on. As Subaru openly weeps at Rem's bedside, Emilia comforts him, promising to support him even though she has no memories of the girl.

Laid out are the foundations for a season that while some backtracking may ensue, Subaru's safety net has been altered, which will force him to find new solutions to undoubtedly dangerous situations that don't involve killing himself to start anew. With Rem down, the focus of Subaru's season two journey will need to involve serious personal growth -- or risk complete and utter failure. For a series built on suffering, either outcome is possible.

New episodes of Re:Zero premiere Wednesdays at 10:30 a.m. ET on Crunchyroll.

For those of you who aren’t familiar with the source material, Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action-adventure game from 2017. Developed by Guerilla Games, it’s set in a world where mankind lives in small hunter-gatherer communities reminiscent of the stone age under the threat of dinosaurs. The twist is these dinos are not made of flesh and blood, but metal and electricity.

Like many epic stories, Horizon Zero Dawn follows a young woman named Aloy who was ousted from society at birth. Using her unique position and rebellious disposition, she quickly embarks on an adventure and although initially her goal is nothing significant, she eventually finds herself uncovering the truth about her entire reality.

In the game, the character’s portrayed – both through voice and through motion capture technology – by Ashley Burch. For the film adaptation, however, Jennifer Lawrence is who the studio wants for the role. And while she’s likely not the only name on their wish list, she’d certainly be a good choice, as the actress already has tons of experience being the lead in a blockbuster action series, as she portrayed Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games movies.

Although little is yet known about the project and we can’t confirm which studio it’s housed at, Sony is presumably the ones who are developing it.

Former Director, National Police Academy, Hyderabad

The killing of gangster Vikas Dubey, a product of the police-politician-criminal nexus, in an encounter, within hours of receiving his custody by the escorting UP STF, stands in sharp contrast to the well-appreciated Peelian principle. According to this principle of modern-day policing, the degree of cooperation of the public that can be secured diminishes proportionately to the necessity of the use of physical force. And public cooperation is what the beleaguered image of the UP police needs the most. Normally, the cracks in the upfront posture of the UP police, while balancing the politicisation and criminalisation in its rank and file, would not be so deeply visible as have appeared in the aftermath of a Frankenstein ambush on the night of July 2-3 at Bikru village in Kanpur.

To an outsider, it might look remarkable how the police-politician-criminal nexus was effortlessly balanced in the jurisdiction of Dubey’s native police station, Chaubeypur, even though the prevailing equation cannot be called an exception in UP. The police station incharge (Station Officer or SO), who should have owed his posting to the will of the district SSP, remained loyal to Dubey. He is said to have alerted Dubey about the raiding party under his senior, the Circle Officer (CO). The CO, who supervised the functioning of the police station, had in that capacity repeatedly briefed the SSP about the SO-Dubey nexus and also sent him a written report in this regard in March. The officer was ambushed while leading the raiding party at Dubey’s village. The SSP, who had all along somehow ignored to effectively intervene in this serious hierarchical disorder, would become, after the ill-planned raid, super busy in stamping police authority in the area, and plotting an inevitable neutralisation of Dubey and his henchmen. There were, in addition, two higher police offices in Kanpur, of the IG Range and ADG Zone. Both had remained indifferent to the nexus in spite of Dubey’s notoriety.

To be fair to the UP police leadership, let us be clear about the long-set positioning of the police in the nexus. The routine of policing in India is not limited to the police-public-criminal interface. An additionally pronounced factor completes the interface — the politician.

That is what the morale-shattering events at the remote Kanpur village in UP, culminating into the gunning down of eight policemen by a politicised mafia, have so rudely demonstrated. Not that any reminder was needed; this balance in nexus policing is so well settled in society. The same sections that showered support to Dubey were later amenable to his neutralisation. When a bulldozer, in broad daylight, demolished the fugitive’s citadel at the behest of the seething police, it was also not only a show of political muscle, but also an act of regrouping of public indignation. Dubey, a product of feudal criminality and Panchayati Raj politics, had disturbed the balance of the nexus and had to pay the price.

Every morning, the police control room in Lucknow sends a summary of the previous day’s police encounters to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as a follow-up to a self-acclaimed quest for dominating and eliminating criminals. It has had little impact on the status of the crime situation in the state. Amidst the setback to the people’s trust in the law and order machinery, and no introspection on the agenda of the three-year-old government, their priority continues to be to teach all vocal adversaries, including human rights and pro-democracy activists, a crippling lesson through highly questionable criminal proceedings, aiming long incarceration and imposition of huge compensatory recoveries. That the stage-managed encounters are counter-productive to legitimate policing is not going to dawn on them in a hurry, the shocking loss of eight police lives in Kanpur notwithstanding.

The UP police should find itself a different image than allowing its stakes to be repeatedly tested at such dubious crossroads. Badri Prasad Singh, a battle-hardy former IG of UP police, who has post retirement, settled down at his native village in Jaunpur, reflected in the context of the Kanpur episode: “I was SSP, Meerut, in 2003-04. I had made it clear in the very first crime meeting to refrain from fake encounters. During the DGP’s arrival at the Circuit House, the local business delegation complained that the notorious criminals are not being killed in police encounters. I immediately countered that so long as I was the SSP in Meerut, no stage-managed encounter will take place. The DGP left the hall in anger to an adjoining room. The DIG, IG and I followed him. We had a long discussion there. At last, the DIG wholeheartedly supported me. He praised my work, saying that those districts under his range where encounters were taking place are witnessing poor crime control and inefficient policing and, hence, I be encouraged to function in accordance with law. At this point, the IG also fully supported the DIG.”

In contrast to the Dubey episode is the policing spectrum of the Covid battle, wherein a notion has gained ground that positive pandemic policing served as a redeeming platform for the police image. The effort could not look more heroic as more than 13,000 policemen have tested corona-positive and over 125 lost their lives in the line of duty. As they gained experience, a big number of police leaders have voluntarily come forward with innovative schemes of facilitative and philanthropic policing to ease the lockdown hardships and stresses, earning the gratitude of the community.

But this is an instinctive response, display of a cherished humanistic trait — a person in position helping out fellow beings in dire need. Suppose it is turned into a trained response in order to make the police exposure to the wide range of pandemic emotions, from the handling of sick and dead and mitigating of hunger and job losses to cheering up the newborn and comforting the quarantined population, into an organisational trait!

Policing by instinct cannot eclipse policing by training. An instinctive response, howsoever laudable it might be, is no match for a trained response in a huge organisational set-up. The trick would be to work backwards and instill these positive instincts into the training protocol by devising and incorporating appropriate modules. The colonial police were created to serve the designs of the political masters. There should be no justification in today’s India for the criminal nexus between the police and the politician to go on endlessly.","The police station incharge (Station Officer or SO), who should have owed his posting to the will of the district SSP, remained loyal to Dubey.

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- (TV 2) ?

What is this?

“Who. . . is Rem?”

Those devastating words from Emilia to Subaru open up a terrifying truth: that matters with the Witch's Cult are far from over. The party containing Rem, Crusch, and the head of the White Whale is beset by two new Sins: Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, Lye, and Sin Archbishop of Greed, Regulus. Together they devastate Crusch's forces and, despite Rem's defiance, eat the memories of both Rem and Crusch and the name of Rem as well, which causes almost everyone to forget her. When Subaru finds out upon everyone's return to Crusch's mansion, he tries to Return by Death so that he can stop this, only to discover that his save point has advanced past it. Felix, worried that further association with Emilia will draw more danger from the Witch's Cult, seeks to annul the alliance, which Crusch, despite her memory loss, will not have. Subaru, meanwhile, finds himself comforted by Emilia, though he cannot fully appreciate it with the comatose state Rem is in.

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Season 2 is based on a light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesdays.

How was the first episode?

After a truly upsetting finale to the re-done version of Re:Zero 's first season, we at last have our answer: Rem isn't dead, but she's very nearly as good as. This in itself is the confirmation that Betelgeuse calling himself an Archbishop of Sin wasn't a positive sign, because while he may be gone, there are six more of his ilk, one of whom is responsible for Rem's current state. Lye, the representation of Gluttony, isn't just a guy with a big mouth, creepy shark-teeth, and a blood-soaked outfit, he's an eater of what's inside your mind rather than the body that houses it. His name is an indication of what he does, too – lye is a caustic substance requiring the use of PPE to handle it and it can, among other things, burn and dissolve bodies. Only in this case, Lye is doing that to the memories of a person, which means that if they awake from his ministrations, they have no idea who they are…and if he eats their names, too, neither does anyone else, making their existence a lie for all intents and purposes.

Unless, of course, you're Natsuki Subaru. His memories of Rem remain intact by the same mysterious means as his memories of other timelines, which makes it an even harsher blow when “return by death” does not take him back before Lye munches on Rem's memories. This is the first time we've seen him essentially miss a save point in his new life; previous to this episode (listed as episode twenty-six, which makes sense; you really can't jump in here) he's always been able to go back and correct course. But this time when he tries it by stabbing himself through the throat (yes, this show is still brutal), he only goes back to after Emilia's forgotten Rem, meaning that he's missed his chance. And that indicates that there's no easy way out here, not that using his power is ever “easy.” But it has been a surefire way to keep trying until a solution is found, and that may not be a luxury Subaru has this time – and with Lye still out there and his buddy Regulus (greed) kicking around with the ability to basically blow anything up, he may not be able to reach any meaningful save points at all.

It's also very concerning that Puck popped in to ask Subaru to take care of Emilia before fading out again. Does that mean that Puck's spirit nature is in danger with the emergence of Lye? Puck doesn't have a physical body, so if Lye eats him, does that mean that Puck is just gone for good? While Puck may have just been speaking about the moment, Lye and Regulus are still too unknown for us to take that for granted. The alliance with Krusch is also in danger from Lye's attack; with Krusch's memories (but not her name) gone, Felis doesn't see any point in sticking around to see what the Witch's Cult will try next and they're very convinced that the Cult is just after Emilia. Being in an alliance with the half-elf is therefore a risk they don't want to take, especially since Krusch was mostly dead all day. There's even a real question of whether or not she can remain a queen candidate without her memories, since her political savvy and skills were what she had going for her before.

Re:Zero 's second season is really throwing us in at the deep end, and it absolutely works. Emilia and Subaru's relationship is already starting to look more mutual and her kindness as he grieves Rem's

comatose state is beautiful. It's a peaceful moment that can't last, but its inclusion in an otherwise fraught episode is a good reminder of why this series succeeds on multiple levels.

Subaru just cannot catch a break, huh? Not 5 minutes after his euphoric victory at season 1's end, he's got a whole new crisis involving one of his closest companions. Only now he has TWO powerful Archbishops of Sin to contend with. It's almost enough to make you feel sad for him, if only his turmoil weren't so compelling to watch. But thanks to the returning and expert direction ofit's just too engrossing seeing this guy spiral into desperate fear.

That element becomes key during the latter half of this season premiere, as after the quick and bloody fight between Rem, Crusch, and the new villains, Re:Zero returns to its trademark gradual and deliberate pacing. Much of this episode is just characters sitting around trying to make sense of the newest magical threat and figure out where to go from here, which could be absolutely tedious in different hands. However Re:Zero 's adaptive team have always showcased a knack for making its slower set-up portions engaging through strong direction and effective pacing. The other key is that much of the exposition comes packaged with strong character moments, with Felis' attempt to break off the alliance to protect a now amnesiac Crusch being the standout. While it's ultimately resolved with the alliance remaining, it's a strong reminder that these are all characters with their own priorities that won't necessarily align with Subaru's conflicts.

Overall this episode feels like Re:Zero picking up like it never went away. Direction, design, and writing are all so in line with the first that you'd never believe it's been four years since Season 1, meaning expectant fans likely have little to worry about with its return. Personally I'm not thrilled to have an arc where the emotional stakes revolve around Rem – I felt her story and character were the weakest of Season 1 – but Re:Zero has been able to subvert my expectations often enough that I'm going in with an open mind.

Re:Zero

If I had to choose my favorite “new school” isekai series right now, the decision would come down to a close battle betweenand, withas an honorable mention. However, if I had to choose theof the “new school” isekai, it would unquestionably be, the series which, by any measurement, was one of the biggest smash hits of 2016. The long-awaited and eagerly-anticipated episode 26 clearly shows why: compared to other isekai series from the past decade, this one operates on a whole different level of writing and storytelling.

Those who did not watch Winter 2020's Director's Cut version will not be left out in the cold, as the episode starts by repeating the new four minutes it tacked on at the end, leading up to Emilia's confusion about Rem when Subaru admits to her that Rem has confessed her feelings to him. We then get to see what really happened: two new Sin Archbishops appeared on the scene and either massacred or memory-wiped everyone, and apparently Gluttony in particular has been causing problems around the capital as well, with a “sleeping sickness” almost certainly attributable to him. He proves to be nearly as much of a freak as Betelgeuse was, but with different powers: memory and identity-eating instead of Unseen Hands. The more composed Regulus, meanwhile, has some power that works on both offense and defense; something wind-based, perhaps? Either way, they will be a force to be reckoned with for the new season, though whether they are part of the Ordeal mentioned by Betelgeuse, or are operating on a different scheme, has yet to be revealed.

The qualitative aspect shows up more strongly once events return to Crusch's mansion. The conference scene shows that Crusch, memory-wiped or not, still retains enough of her personality to assert her will: she might not know who she is or what's going on, but she understands that the Witch's Cult is a threat which they must stay united against. I was ambivalent about Crusch during the first series but have to give her new respect now. Felis's fierce loyalty and protectiveness is also touching.

And of course Re:Zero wouldn't be what it has become without causing mental anguish to Subaru. While I write that a bit flippantly, Subaru's convincing emotiveness – arguably greater than that of any other isekai protagonist – is one of the factors which elevates the series. The animation of him crying over Rem could easily have come across as exaggerated, but the writing sells it. Rem may not hold his heart the way Emilia does, but she's still very dear to him, and the first season clearly showed us why. The ending scene of Emilia taking him in her arms to comfort him is also a great one; if embraces could heal the troubles of the world, Emilia would be unstoppable.

On the whole, the production values are not top-rate, and my one quibble with the episode is that Gluttony comes off looking too cartoonish. However, returning director Masaharu Watanabe has not lost his touch in putting it all together. The scene selections, the framing, the script writing, and especially the stellar use of music all combine the intensity and potency of the content. Like the first season, it also scatters throughout little details to watch for. The most obvious are that Puck also seems to remember who Rem is and knows about Gluttony, but there are smaller touches, too, like how the two quickly-flashed frames right before Gluttony eats Rem are images of her having a family with","How would you rate episode 1 ofRe:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- (TV 2) ?

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- (TV 2) ?

It's been four long years since the first Re:Zero anime, but it's like it never left. The first episode of this second season picks up right quite literally where the first one left off; story-wise, only a matter of minutes have passed between the ending of the first season and the start of the second. The anime is even kind enough to begin with the cliffhanger scene from the end of the Director's Cut that aired earlier this year, so there's no continuity gap between versions. Which is nothing but a blessing, because holy heck was that first scene a game changer.

If you're reading this, you probably know what happened, but yeah, Rem got yeeted out of existence. Nobody even remembers her now except for Subaru, for reasons that are probably related to his Return By Death ability. This is an upsetting development, especially for Subaru, who was in the middle of telling Emilia that he's up for a threesome with her and Rem when she dropped that bombshell on him. But this must also suck for a lot of viewers, because Rem was easily the most popular character in the show by far. Her unconditional devotion to Subaru in the first season's second half was touching and even inspiring. I was one of those people who teared up at her heartfelt conversation with Subaru in season 1's episode 18. In the end, though, I feel particularly sorry for all the merch makers, because if Rem is absent from this season, which girl are they supposed to make a million figures out of?

Fortunately, it looks like Emilia is attempting to step up to the plate. In these two episodes alone, she and Subaru have more honest conversations than they ever had in the entire first season. It's not just a matter of Subaru showering her with puppy dog devotion and Emilia responding with awkward bemusement anymore. Subaru has dropped all pretenses around her, and she's trying her best to become someone who can be relied upon as well. The hug she gives Subaru at the end of episode 1 here is genuinely sweet, and it feels like the series is finally bringing those two to a point where you can actually sort of see them as a couple. (That said, her ""Next time, I won't just be the one who always needs saving"" at the start of episode 2 seems like a line that will age poorly.)

There's a lot going on in these two episodes, although besides a brief action scene at the start where Rem and Crusch get beaten soundly by the new villains, it's more about dialogue and setup for future events than anything else. Subaru's primary goal this season is to wake Rem out of her magical coma. This means apprehending the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, who ""devoured"" Rem's existence in episode 1, and unraveling the mysteries of the Witch Cult. In episode 2, Subaru finally gets to return to Roswaal's mansion and encounters our old friend Beatrice, who tells him that he must go to the Sanctuary to find the answers that he seeks.

Although that premise seems fairly straightforward, there are a lot of moving parts here, along with character introductions and re-introductions. To replace the ultra-maid Rem, we need two new maids: one of them is Frederica, who got a brief cameo in season 1's episode 11 as a maid who was previously employed at Roswaal's mansion; the other is Petra, one of the village kids (the cute girl with the ribbon). Although I like Frederica's design because she's got a mouth full of shark-like teeth yet the calm and no-nonsense personality of a consummate professional maid, so far she doesn't leave a strong impression. The new villains seem fun, though. The Sin Archbishop of Greed in particular has a very punch-able face and attitude. The introduction of the Witch of Greed Echidna ends episode 2 on an intriguing note, and I get the feeling she'll probably be the gleefully manipulative type, since Maaya Sakamoto 's voice performance is strongly reminiscent of her role as the Administrator in Sword Art Online: Alicization .

Finally, these episodes also deal with the aftermath of the Witch Cult attack and the Crusch-Emilia alliance. It wasn't just Rem who suffered from Gluttony's attack; Crusch also got her memories eaten. At least her soul wasn't taken, but the result is still deeply upsetting to Crusch's knight and best friend Felis (or ""Ferris,"" but I'm going with the spellings in Crunchyroll 's subtitles for these reviews). Felis is tempted to call off the alliance altogether after that, but Crusch overrides that decision because she wants to do things through her own free will. It's a bittersweet moment, because it's evident that Crusch's strong-willed personality has remained intact even with her memories gone. In some ways, she even seems happier now, offering a genuine smile to Emilia at their parting. Those of you who have read the first Re:Zero Ex novel will know of the tragedy that inspired her to take on the Royal Selection, but without those memories, it almost seems like she's been liberated of her past. Even so, I can't help but feel bad for Felis, who has strong memories with Crusch and seems to be taking things harder than she is. Although those two have exited the story for now, this will surely not be the end of their subplot.

So, yeah, these episodes were a lot to chew on, especially because they're longer than regular anime episodes and are unafraid of cutting out the OP and ED sequences to fit that extra bit of story in. I'm glad they've kept this tradition from the first season because it's things like that which make Re:Zero special as an anime. Another thing I want to note is that the animation in these episodes is actually fairly restrained; it's more usual to see a TV anime go all out with the first episodes. Given the level of care in Re:Zero 's production as a whole, I get the impression that the animation team can and will go above and beyond when the situation calls for it. We haven't hit this season's best material yet, but I'm excited for it when it comes.

Nigerian farmers and agricultural scientists have warned that ‘political farmers’ should not be permitted to hijack the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) ‘Agric for Food and Jobs Plan (AFJP)’ and the zero-interest loans meant for smallholder farmers in the frantic efforts to prevent food shortage, hunger and unemployment post-COVID-19.

The apex bank, on June 18, 2020, unveiled plans for a framework for the integration of non-interest window in all its intervention programmes, particularly the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) and the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF).

Farmers and scholars have consistent agitated that interest rate on agricultural leans should be lower than five per cent or free, and that conditions attached to such facilities should be made less cumbersome considering that the majority of food producers are either illiterate smallholder farmers or energetic youths and graduates who have no collaterals most of the time.

x

Also, the CBN and other stakeholders recently launched the AFJP initiative to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on food production in the country and add 10 million metric tonnes of food to the basket in 12 months.

The initiative incorporates the private sector through some out-growing schemes involving farmers and off-takers to ensure industrialisation of the crops, price stability and sustainable means of livelihood through interest-free.

The job and food increase expected from the scheme, the CBN had disclosed, would be achieved through investment in the sector by providing zero-interest inputs financing options such as fertiliser, seeds, seedlings, pesticides and other farm inputs to the participating farmers in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.

The palliative scheme would run for 12 months and about two million hectares of land would be cultivated with crop and animal production, with farmers cultivating one hectare each.

“The priority crops and livestock targeted by AFJP for local market are rice, maize, sorghum, groundnuts, cowpea, cassava, millet, livestock, palm kernel and cotton, while sesame seeds, hibiscus, cocoa, hides and skin; horns and hoofs are targeted for export market,’’ a statement had explained.

x

The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said during a review session on the ABP, and the strategies for the 2020 agricultural wet season that the creation of a non-interest window was a result of appeals from stakeholders for farmers across the country to also be considered for funding under the non-interest facilities.

The move for zero-interest loans, especially for small-scale farmers, has been commended by agriculturists.It will be recalled that food production stakeholders have consistently agitated for three per cent or less interest rate for long-term farm projects and smallholder farmers.

Professor Kolawole Adebayo, an agricultural extension specialist and former Regional Coordinator of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-sponsored Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), expressed satisfaction about the zero-interest intervention funds, saying, “If implemented to achieve the stated objective, it will be great. The impact on the Nigerian food systems will be immense. I truly hope that all the ancillary requirements to ensure that farmers make the best use of the fund will also be concurrently addressed.

Mr Augie Sahabi, Kebbi State Chairman of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), said the initiative is a welcome development, saying, “I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that only true farmers will be registered to benefit.”Shahabi said removal of interest from the loan would attract more Muslim farmers who hitherto avoided bank loans with interest due to religious prohibition.

x

Dr Richardson Okechukwu, a cassava breeding and value chain specialist with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), said it is an “Excellent way to facilitate agricultural enterprises that have for long been neglected.”

Okechukwu added that the government should ensure recipients are linked to off-takers and utilise improved seeds of good varieties along with quality inputs. He also suggested mechanisation as important to agriculture.

“A shift from hoe and cutlass is long overdue. This intervention, if handled well, will create jobs and reverse rural urban migration. Beneficiary farmers should endeavour to repay back their loans, which luckily, are interest-free, to ensure the facility is extended to other farmers.”

Pa Samuel Akinade, chairman of the Oyo State chapter of RIFAN, said the scheme is a good start. He said experience had shown that avoidable food imports do take away a bulk of the country’s foreign reserves, saying, “If this is properly channelled, it will encourage the smallholder farmers to stay on the farm. They will feel the sense of belonging as their operations are recognised as important.”

x

Pa Akinade added that the country would be able to use the available reserves only on very essential items that the country could not produce locally and, as time goes on, it would earn more for the nation.

“My recommendation here is that we don’t need to concentrate too much on the youths for now if we don’t want to fail. We should let the youths emerge. Let them grow along with the elderly farmers, no matter their educational or training backgrounds in agriculture,” he said.

Prof. Lateef Sanni, who is the Project Manager, IITA, BASICS-II and President, International Society for Tropical Root Crops (ISTRC), said to avert another recession, the government needs a quick win strategy, which agriculture offers.

“So, in the long run, it is economically viable for the government to stabilise food security and open more avenues for the industrialisation process with consistent supply of quality and viable raw material supplies.

“If industries have access to unhindered raw material supplies, uptime processing will be increased and more money will exchange hands and this will help to reduce inflation. I thank the government for yielding to the clarion call for free interest credit facilities,” he said.

The root and tuber expert, however, urged the handlers of such facilities to be transparent, inclusive and objective.

“I will only plead for inclusiveness of the loan scheme and the release should also be timely to restore businesses and livelihoods of the populace,” he added.","Nigerian farmers and agricultural scientists have warned that ‘political farmers’ should not be permitted to hijack the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) ‘Agric for Food and Jobs Plan (AFJP)’ and the zero-interest loans meant for smallholder farmers in the frantic efforts to prevent food shortage, hunger and unemployment post-COVID-19.

TORONTO, July 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Canada Nickel Company Inc. (TSX-V: CNC) (""Canada Nickel"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce it has created a wholly-owned subsidiary, NetZero Metals, to begin the research and development of a processing facility that would be located in the Timmins, Ontario region with the goal of utilizing existing technologies to produce zero-carbon nickel, cobalt and iron products.

The Company has applied for trademarks for the terms NetZero NickelTM, NetZero CobaltTM, and NetZero IronTM in U.S., Canada, and other jurisdictions related to zero-carbon production of nickel, cobalt, and iron products.

""The electric vehicle industry and many other consumer sectors needs zero-carbon metal this decade – not in a nebulous 2050 timeframe contemplated by many other resource companies,"" said Mark Selby, Chair & CEO of Canada Nickel.

""As a result of the unique advantages of the Timmins region with its close proximity to zero-carbon hydroelectricity and our Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide project, comprised largely of serpentine rock that naturally absorbs CO2 when exposed to air, Canada Nickel has the potential to develop zero-carbon products that our customers are expecting from the mining sector. With nickel as a preferred metal to power the clean energy revolution, our commitment to net zero-carbon production is the right step to take for the environment, for consumers, and for our investors.""

Serpentine rock, the host rock comprising more than 90 per cent of the mass of the resource at the Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide Project1, has had numerous studies completed that note that the rock naturally absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) when exposed to air through a naturally occurring process of spontaneous mineral carbonation.

The nickel industry faces a number of challenges as the current processing approach of laterite and sulphide ores generate a significant environmental footprint in the form of SO2 and CO2 emissions. These environmental challenges will only worsen given the industry supply profile with the bulk of recent nickel supply growth and the main source of future production growth being nickel pig iron production in Indonesia, which, according to industry sources, uses 25-30 tonnes of coal to produce each tonne of nickel, which when combined with other sources of CO2, generates nearly approximately 90 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions per tonne of nickel produced. (see Figure 1).

For an electric vehicle battery pack that contained 50kg of nickel from this source, it would represent approximately 4 tonnes of CO2.emissions for that vehicle. Other sources of nickel supply growth that have additional environmental footprint issues are HPAL projects in Indonesia that are considering technologies such as deep-sea discharge of tailings which would result in ocean discharge of approximately 100 tonnes of material per tonne of nickel.

Key Technologies Being Explored to Develop a Zero-Carbon Footprint Operation

Canada Nickel will explore the use of various alternatives to achieve its NetZero objectives in each stage of the mining process: Mining, Milling and Processing.

Mining

The biggest single technology to reduce the carbon footprint of mining activities is the utilization of electric rope shovels and trolley trucks which utilize electricity, rather than diesel fuel, as a power source wherever possible. Given the close proximity to zero carbon hydroelectric generating capacity, electricity use in place of diesel fuel has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

The deposition of waste rock and tailings during the mining process will also expose the serpentine rock to air which provides the potential for this material to absorb CO2 through natural mineral carbonation and offsetting any CO2 emissions from the project. The exact amount and rate at which CO2 can be absorbed from materials mined at Crawford will be analyzed during upcoming phases of work.

Milling

Traditionally, large scale processing of lower grade sulphide ores utilizes a significant amount of electricity. Again, the local proximity to hydroelectricity provide the potential to minimize carbon emissions for this stage of production.

NetZero Metals - Nickel-Cobalt Concentrate Processing

Existing processes for processing nickel-cobalt concentrates to remove sulphur, iron, and other impurities have resulted in the generation of significant quantities of CO2, SO2, and other impurities for a number of producers worldwide.

Canada Nickel will explore the potential for producing nickel and cobalt products from existing pyrometallurgical processes such as roasting, sulphation roasting, and reduction using electric arc furnaces (utilizing natural gas rather coke or coal as a reductant) with the offgases captured and re-routed to allow the CO2 be captured by the waste rock and tailings from the Crawford nickel-cobalt sulphide project1 The Company will also look at existing hydrometallurgical processes to produce nickel and cobalt products such as the Albion or other similar processes, which generate minimal off-gases to produce nickel and cobalt products. The off-gases will again be captured and treated to ensure CO2 and SO2 emissions are minimized.

NetZero Metals - Magnetite Concentrate Processing

The Company will explore the potential for the production of iron products utilizing existing direct reduced iron (DRI) processes or reduction in electric arc furnaces utilizing natural gas and then re-routed to allow the CO2 to be captured by the waste rock and tailings from the deposit.

Next Steps

The Company will announce some key leadership changes at the Board level to help guide the Company in this important endeavour. The NetZero approach will be incorporated into the work done for the engineering for the Preliminary Economic Assessment which has been previously announced and currently underway. Specific studies to analyze the quantity and timing of CO2 absorption by the host rock at Crawford and process design for downstream processing of nickel and cobalt materials and magnetite concentrate will be announced and get underway through the remainder of the year.

1 The Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide Project is an early stage exploration and development project. There is no guarantee that the project will reach advanced development or production stage. The economic viability and technical feasibility of the Company's Crawford Nickel-Cobalt Sulphide Project has not been established at any level of confidence supported by a PEA, PFS or FS, and as such there is currently no evidence to support that the project would result in a ""net zero-carbon"" footprint. The Company is currently planning to complete a PEA by year-end 2020.

About Canada Nickel Company

Here's a round-up of all the latest Covid-19 developments you need to know:

UAE leads vaccine race

The UAE has stolen a march over other countries in the quest for a vaccine against Covid-19 with the launch of final phase 3 human trials. Department of Health - Abu Dhabi, Group 42 and Chinese pharmaceutical major Sinopharm are partnering for the study that will rope in 15,000 volunteers to further test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. It will test two vaccine strains and a placebo. Two doses three weeks apart will be administered and volunteers followed for a year, said Nawal Al Kaabi, head of the UAE's Covid-19 Clinical Management Committee. Volunteers should be 18 to 60 years of age with no serious underlying medical issues and without previous Covid-19 infection, Al Kaabi said.

UAE reports 281 new Covid-19 cases, 994 recoveries

The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention on Thursday reported 281 cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, along with 994 recoveries. The new cases were detected through additional 48,000 tests. The UAE once again recorded no deaths in the past 24 hours.

Covid-19 vaccine trial open to 15k volunteers in Capital

Emirates flying to 4 more cities

Emirates airline has announced it will resume flights to four additional cities next week - Tehran from today; Guangzhou from July 25; Addis Ababa from August 1; and Oslo from August 4. This will take the airline's passenger network to 62 destinations in August, offering customers around the world more convenient connections to Dubai, and via Dubai. All flights will be operated with the Emirates Boeing 777-300ER and can be booked on emirates.com or via travel agents.

Varsity project to study virus' transmission from animals

Researchers in the UAE are now investigating how the Covid-19 virus - which is usually found in mammals - was transmitted from animals to humans. The project falls under the 'Covid-19 Research and Development Task Force' initiative of the Khalifa University of Science and Technology. The current Covid-19 outbreak is an example of zoonosis, which refers to diseases that can be transmitted to humans from animals.

The team members have expertise in medicine, molecular genetics, bioinformatics, veterinary science, and epidemiology.

'UAE-India travel agreement to be reviewed by July 20'

The travel agreement between India and the UAE will be reviewed on July 20, said Hardeep Singh Puri, Indian Minister of Civil Aviation. The arrangements, made by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) with Middle East carriers, were for a period of two weeks, he added. He underlined that bilateral air bubbles will be the way to resume international travel amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Vande Bharat Mission is currently in the fourth phase. It involves 619 flights which will bring back more than 200,000 Indians. He said 687,467 people have been brought back so far out of which Air India carried 215,495.

Indian states clearance must for chartered flights

Airlines operating unauthorised charter flights from the UAE will not be allowed to land in India, the country's Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has warned. The civil aviation body has told air traffic controllers (ATCs) via a circular to not allow flights to land in India. The decision comes a few days after a charter flight from the UAE landed in Mumbai without state approvals, due to which nearly 200 passengers had to wait for up to 12 hours at the airport's arrivals section, said a passenger on the flight.

Tears of joy rolled down as 21-year-old Ghanian national Naomi Doughan looked at the air ticket handed over to her by a representative of Dubai based charity Dar Al Ber Society (Dabs). She is one of the 44 Ghanaian nationals who received free air tickets and a goodie bag by the Dabs on Thursday at a ceremony held at its headquarters in Dubai. The group - all from Ghana - were found sleeping at a park in Satwa when the Dabs was alerted of their plight. All 44 Ghanaians, including seven women, will fly out of Dubai International Airport today on a special repatriation flight by Emirates Airline. The Dabs has arranged a free Covid-19 test and two buses will transport them to the airport. The 44 Ghanaians are expected to land on their home soil Accra, Ghana at 1.35pm local time today.

In gesture of kindness, hospital waives expat's Dh762,000 bill



Help is always at hand in Dubai as an Indian expat realised recently. Indian national Rajesh Lingaiah Odnala contracted Covid-19 and had to be hospitalised for 80 days. By the time he was fit to be discharged, he had run up a bill of Dh762,000, an amount he couldn't afford to pay. The distressed 42-year-old man from Hyderabad was in for a pleasant surprise when Dubai Hospital decided to waive the entire amount after the Indian Consulate, which came to know of his plight, wrote to the hospital appealing for a bill waiver on humanitarian grounds. The hospital responded positively and discharged the patient without any charges. The consulate also arranged a free ticket for him on Air India Express and Rajesh flew home on July 14.

2019 Data

In 2019 Asia stood as the hungriest continent of the world with 381 million hungry people.

Africa was placed in the second position with 250 million hungry people. UN further estimates that by the end of 2030 Africa will account for more than half of the world’s hungry people.

Followed by Latin America and the Caribbean both backed third place with 48 million hungry people.

UN: Lowest-Cost Healthy Meal

On average, the lowest-cost healthy meal costs for more than $1.90 which is more than the international poverty threshold. Just because of the cost value around 3 billion people of the world are unable to afford it. Thus, worsening the situation.

UN: Hunger amongst Children

Hunger amongst children is not only a problem of the present but also for the future as children are the future of this world.

As per the report, around 191 million children below the age of 5 are hungry and malnourished. However, in India, the record of below-five undernourishment decreased down from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19 but experts fear that this pandemic may erode the progress.

The fight against poverty and ultimately its eradication within sustainable development is at the basis of the country’s development cooperation policy.

Luxembourg’s development assistance focuses on several priority areas that are in line with FAO’s mandate. They include health, water and sanitation; food security and nutrition, which are crucial for sustainable agricultural development and resilience to crises (e.g. climate change); education, with a focus on equal access for all; employability, with a special focus on women and youth; and vocational training systems. Moreover, the country’s development cooperation maintains a strong geographic focus on West Africa, especially the Sahel region (aside Laos and Nicaragua, five out of seven priority countries are in West Africa: Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Mali, the Niger and Senegal).

The Agenda 2030’s principle of “Leaving no one behind” and the commitments set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development are at the heart of the country’s general development cooperation strategy — “The Road to 2030” — which focuses on people, prosperity, planet, partnerships and peace. Through this strategy,

Luxembourg has supported FAO’s work to eradicate hunger and eliminate poverty, while promoting economic, social and environmental sustainability within agricultural and food systems.

In the period 2009–2019, Luxembourg provided a total of USD 25.1 million (EUR 22.1 million 1) in voluntary and assessed contributions to FAO. More specifically, USD 5.4 million (EUR 4.7 million) were given in voluntary contributions between 2014 and 2019 and were mainly directed towards development projects in Africa (60 percent), followed by Asia (40 percent).

Luxembourg has proven its commitment to sustainable development in a versatile manner, by supporting food and livelihood security in Afghanistan, contributing to the resilience of young people in Mali and strengthening early warning and preparedness in Senegal.

Luxembourg’s strategy presents four inter-related thematic priorities that could serve as areas of continued cooperation with FAO. They include improving access to quality basic social services, enhancing socio-economic integration of women and youth, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth, and strengthening inclusive governance.

In the years to come, FAO and Luxembourg will continue to work around common priorities, exploring new and innovative partnerships and financing mechanisms that will strengthen their delivery of the 2030 Agenda and act as a driving force to achieve sustained prosperity and a Zero Hunger world. FAO will rely on its partners’ contributions, including from Luxembourg, to step up efforts to support the fight against hunger in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, while realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","The fight against poverty and ultimately its eradication within sustainable development is at the basis of the country’s development cooperation policy.

145,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/fao-belgium-innovative-solutions-zero-hunger,"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,FAO + Belgium Innovative solutions for Zero Hunger - World,"Partnership at a Glance

Belgium is a key strategic partner for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), supporting the Organization’s mandate for both humanitarian and development activities. The country is generously funding innovative and critical areas in support of food security, economic growth, employment and income generation to foster resilient and sustainable development, in addition to hosting the FAO Liaison O fce in Brussels. The strategic alignment between Belgium’s and FAO’s priorities is strong, and is the foundation of the partnership.

With agriculture as a key sector in its development cooperation agenda, Belgium places a keen focus on multiple themes at the heart of FAO’s mission: from responding to food security crises and fostering sustainable, economically viable agricultural production, to promoting commercially viable value chains and encouraging digital innovation in food security.

Discussions at the December 2018 strategic consultation echoed these commitments and helped to solidify Belgium’s and FAO’s joint vision, centred on saving lives, safeguarding livelihoods and human dignity, and building resilience against future crises.

From 2009 to 2019, Belgium totalled EUR 163 million(USD 180 million) in voluntary contributions. In the period from 2018 to 2019, the country invested in FAO’s emergency response to humanitarian crises, mainly in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Syria and Yemen along with early action in the Philippines, Madagascar and Malawi, and regional resilience activities in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. In the same period, the geographic distribution of Belgium’s contributions shows that the majority (69 percent) were directed to Africa, followed by the Near East (13 percent), interregional projects (11 percent) and Asia (7 percent). Thematically, the largest share of Belgium’s contributions during the 2018–2019 period supported FAO’s work in responding to crises and building resilient livelihoods (60 percent).

Belgium has played a fundamental role in providing flexible funding to the Organization, through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), as well as the Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism (FMM). This has allowed FAO to boost its capacity to develop more impactful ways of working, respond faster to emergencies, and promote early action to mitigate the impact of disasters. Furthermore, Belgium and FAO share a joint vision in bridging the humanitarian–development–peace nexus.

Belgium’s support has been critical to foster a stronger collaboration among the Rome-based Agencies (RBAs), also through its contributions directed to a project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) worked together on joint resilience programming as well as immediate life -saving activities.

The 2016 Framework Agreement between Belgium and FAO has provided the partnership a renewed and strengthened strategic direction. This has since been reinforced by strategic consultations such as that held in 2018, which o fered a forum for exploring common priorities for future collaboration, also with academic institutions. For example, a partnership between FAO and the University of Liège is contributing towards building resilience in African francophone communities by enhancing technical capacities and expertise to achieve Zero Hunger. The collaboration actively works on the themes of climate change and migration impacts on rural youth, One Health/ pandemic threats, sustainable energy for migratory populations, urban agriculture, and more generally in the fields of veterinary medicine and bioengineering.

The partnership with the Université Catholique de Louvain, also ongoing, is focused on strengthening capacities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change by combatting desertification, through remote-sensing dryness mapping for early warning systems of desert locust-a fected countries in Africa and Asia, and assessments, monitoring, sustainable management and restoration of dryland forests in agro -silvopastoral systems.

The strong alignment between FAO’s Strategic Framework and Belgium’s humanitarian and development strategies in agriculture, food security and nutrition — with a clear focus on digitalization for rural development, inclusion of the private sector, and the sustainable management of natural resources — provide scope for a long and ever-stronger partnership in the fight against hunger.

The year 2020 has been a time of great disruption for the world, compounded by an unprecedented global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with potentially severe economic and social impacts. In the years to come, FAO and Belgium will continue to work around common priorities to address current and emerging global challenges. Most recently, Belgium is supporting FAO in the rapid recovery of vulnerable households’ livelihoods in Mali during COVID-19 and early action to anticipate the impact of the pandemic in Haiti, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe.","The strategic alignment between Belgium’s and FAO’s priorities is strong, and is the foundation of the partnership.

The Simple Truth Recycling Program marks another significant milestone for Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan and establishes Kroger as the first Fortune 25 retailer to offer a free recycling program for its own private-label brand.

""A key part of achieving our ambitious Zero Hunger | Zero Waste vision is offering our customers innovative solutions to recycle and reuse product packaging,"" said Keith Dailey, group vice president of corporate affairs and chief sustainability officer. ""We're thrilled to partner with TerraCycle to launch our new Simple Truth Recycling Program, supporting our sustainable packaging goals and enabling Kroger customers to recycle their favorite Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic products without ever leaving home.""

How the Simple Truth Recycling Program works:

Sign up at TerraCycle.com/SimpleTruth Collect Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic flexible plastic packaging (bags, pouches, liners and wraps) Ship the packaging to TerraCycle using a free, prepaid shipping label Earn points for every pound of eligible packaging sent Redeem points as donations to charitable organizations

""Thanks to companies like The Kroger Co. and their popular Simple Truth product line, consumers can enjoy their favorite foods while being rewarded for doing the right thing,"" said Tom Szaky, TerraCycle founder and CEO. ""As the first major retailer to create a free recycling program for their own private-label brand, Kroger is offering consumers the opportunity to divert packaging from landfills and make a positive impact on the environment for future generations.""

""Since its launch in January 2013, Simple Truth has led the way in making natural, organic and free-from foods more mainstream and accessible for customers,"" said Ben Melillo, Kroger's senior brand manager. ""We know more of our customers are seeking out opportunities to reduce their environmental footprint and we're excited to meet their needs by introducing the Simple Truth Recycling Program—an initiative that not only simplifies the recycling process, but also makes it more rewarding.""

The Kroger Co.'s Long-term Commitment to Sustainable Packaging

""Sustainable packaging is a core tenet of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan,"" continued Dailey. ""While packaging is important for preserving product quality, freshness and integrity, we also recognize the negative impact packaging—especially plastic varieties—can have on the environment. As we continue to drive progress toward our current 2020 sustainability commitments, we're laser-focused on reducing unnecessary packaging from our enterprise, reusing where we can and striving for more sustainable packaging across our private-label portfolio.""

By the end of 2019, Kroger reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 10.1 million pounds, achieving its goal to reduce by 10 million pounds ahead of schedule.

The company's latest sustainable packaging results will be released in Kroger's 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report this August. The annual report builds on Kroger's 14-year history of sustainability reporting, which has tracked the company's journey to make its operations more efficient, use resources more responsibly and improve the health, safety and well-being of the communities it serves.

The report highlights the importance for governments to hold social dialogue with the private sector and trade unions to ensure that a transition to net-zero emissions creates decent jobs and aligns with the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Jobs in a Net-zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean,’ recognizes that dependence on fossil fuel exports, current prevailing work deficits, and inequalities have made the LAC region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, similarly, to future impacts of climate change. The publication finds that the agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, waste management, tourism, and construction industries hold the potential to create decent jobs and, with adequate measures, to ensure “that those who lose out in the transition are protected and supported,” while contributing to climate action, boosting growth, tackling inequality, and advancing the SDGs.

The report acknowledges that net jobs “mask winners and losers.” While 22.5 million jobs are expected to be created in LAC’s agriculture and plant-based food production, renewable electricity, forestry, construction, and manufacturing, a just transition would eliminate 7.5 million jobs in fossil fuel electricity generation, fossil fuel extraction, and animal-based food production industries.

The report highlights the importance of retraining and on-the-job training programmes to prepare workers for the transition from carbon-intensive sectors, including gaining new skills to cope with climate change impacts. New low- and medium-skill jobs will also benefit a portion of the 66 million people in the region currently being underutilized in the labor market, including the 9 million youth who are unemployed, according to the report. The report warns, however, that 80% of the new jobs would be in male-dominated sectors, so women would not benefit from job creation “unless the current gender segregation by occupation is addressed.”

In seeking to provide a blueprint for countries to create decent jobs, the report makes a number of recommendations, including: extending social protection coverage, unemployment benefits, and access to health care; improving agricultural risk management programmes; enhancing occupational safety and health measures; and improving producers’ access to markets and integration into supply chains.

Four more Giant stores in Pennsylvania have reached zero waste, which the company designates as meaning more than 90% of a store’s waste is diverted from a landfill or incineration, according to a press release.

more than 90% of a store’s waste is diverted from a landfill or incineration, according to a press release. In addition to implementing recycling procedures, The Giant Company team members monitor what is being sent to the trash compactor so nothing that can be recycled gets thrown away by accident. They watch for cardboard that is labeled as garbage, fill designated bins with food waste and scraps for organic recycling, and collect plastic bags, film and empty pharmacy pill bottles that are sent to its recycling center.

Each store will also partner with Feeding America to donate products to local food banks and the company’s Meat the Needs program, which donates frozen protein to regional food banks.

Dive Insight:

With the addition of these four stores, Giant is chipping away at its goal to get all of its nearly 190 stores to reach zero waste by 2025. Currently one other store — in Cleona, Pennsylvania — has the designation, which it achieved in September 2018.

According to its press release, more than 84% of all waste generated by Giant is already sent to recycling or donations. Giant has also implemented other sustainability measures, including installing a solar field and bee pollinator habitat at its headquarters, reducing emissions, installing energy-efficient fixtures in all stores and improving its sustainable product selection including tea, seafood and coffee.

To help its Cleona store become a zero-waste location, Giant said previously it would find several ways to make an impact, from cleaning empty frosting containers in its bakery to putting corn crates up for grabs for customers to take home and reuse.

Like much of the industry, its parent company Ahold Delhaize has also made commitments to improve its environmental footprint. After meeting many of its 2020 goals, Ahold Delhaize renewed its sustainability targets, including plans to cut food waste in half by 2030 and aim for zero plastic waste with its private label products. Earlier this week, the grocery company also said it would cut carbon emissions by 50% from its stores, distribution centers, operations and offices in the next 10 years.

Just last week, Kroger also launched a recycling program for its private-label line Simple Truth in which customers will be able to recycle more than 300 products, including those not accepted in traditional curbside recycling pickup like bread and product pouches, liners and plastic wrapping.

The IIGCC developed the ‘Net Zero Investment Framework’ with over 70 leading global investors representing an aggregate of over USD 16 trillion in assets. The guide is intended to enable investors to adopt a strategy to decarbonize their investment portfolios while increasing investment in climate solutions to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The Framework is “based on the expectation that governments and policy makers will deliver on commitments to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.” The IIGCC designed the Framework to help deliver “additional meaningful long-term emission reductions,” overcoming limitations in other approaches “based only on portfolio emissions reduction or portfolio temperature targets,” which allow investors to “technically meet targets while selling the problem to someone else.”

The Framework provides a comprehensive set of recommended actions, metrics, and methodologies to enable both asset owners and managers to become “net zero investors.” It covers four asset classes: sovereign bonds; listed equities; corporate fixed income; and real estate, with other asset classes to follow. The Framework identifies five core components of a net zero investment strategy: governance and strategy; objectives and targets; strategic asset allocation; asset class alignment; and policy advocacy and market engagement.

The Framework is open for consultation until 25 September 2020. Five investors – APG, Brunel, the Church of England Pensions Board, PKA, and Phoenix Group – are testing the Framework by modeling its impact across the performance of their portfolios, collectively valued at USD 1.3 trillion. Results of this analysis will be included in the final Framework, expected to be released later in 2020.

The IIGCC is a European membership body for collaboration on climate change. The organization includes over 240 members, mostly pension funds and asset managers, across fifteen countries, representing over EUR 33 trillion in assets under management. The Framework is a key output of the IIGCC’s Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII), which was established at the request of European asset owners to develop key definitions and concepts relating to the alignment of investment strategies to the Paris Agreement.

The underwater adventure @Subnautica and its icy sequel Subnautica: Below Zero are both coming to #NintendoSwitch next year. #IndieWorld pic.twitter.com/jpFEMjg5znAugust 18, 2020 See more

Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero will both be on Nintendo Switch in 2021, according to the latest Nintendo Indie World showcase. Check out the official trailer above.

Look at the gorgeous underwater world you'll be able to explore while on the move - and all the freaky creatures you'll run into along the way (did you see that octopus?!).

In Subnautica, you are the lone survivor of the Aurora spaceship crash, which has landed on an alien world submerged in water. You'll need to explore the ocean and survive the many dangers lying within it while also completing tasks like gathering resources, constructing tools, bases, and submersibles, and interact with the planet's mysterious wildlife. It's a ton of fun and you can easily sink hours into it, but what's most interesting is that Subnautica has several different difficulty modes.

The road sign read eight miles to Astoria as I zipped past. The battery gauge on the Zero SR/S electric motorcycle I was riding said I had just six miles of range remaining, and the nearest charger was on the other end of those eight miles - including a very long, narrow bridge across a typically angry body of water. As Everett McGill might say, I was in a tight spot.

Over sixty miles earlier, I had opted for a quick side-trip to take some photos of the Zero SR/S, and my math at the time seemed to indicate I would still have range to spare to make it to the picturesque coastal town of Astoria, nestled at the northwest tip of Oregon where the mighty Columbia River meets the mightier Pacific Ocean.

Now, my faulty math and some other poor decisions had come back to bite me on the butt. And it wasn’t like I could just pull over and recharge the gleaming blue bike; not only were there no Level II chargers anywhere close by, I had also forgotten to bring the 120-volt Level I charger with me, which plugs into a regular outlet like a toaster. Slower, but still workable.

It didn’t really matter since there wasn’t much civilization around anyway, let alone random electrical outlets. But as I rolled past a turnout with bathrooms that might have had an outside outlet, I tried to remember that this was how memories of adventures were made, through trial and tribulation. Trips where everything goes as planned tend to fade from memory over time. It didn’t seem like that would be the case this time. Would I end up having to push the bike across a long, narrow bridge humming with truck traffic? I shuddered and dropped my speed to 50mph.

I was in the second leg of my tour, which I embarked upon earlier in the morning to answer a question: What was required, in terms of cost, time, planning and effort, to go long-distance riding on an electric motorcycle? The Zero SR/S is the California company’s latest and greatest machine, a sleek, fully-faired open-road sporting mount bristling with the latest tech and massive power, capable of 0-60 times that will scorch most supercars and a top speed well into lose-your-license numbers. Around town, it’s a full-blooded traffic-carving weapon. But what about distance riding? After a couple of weeks of zipping around the Portland area on the SR/S, I asked Zero to add some panniers to the SR/S for the experiment, which they did along with a top case (which I ended up removing). They also added a centerstand.

My experiment was simple: I would follow a route I have taken many times over the years on gas-powered bikes, a route I like to call the “Tillamook Loop,” which begins in Portland, Oregon. The route follows the Columbia River north and then west along scenic highways to Astoria, then meanders down the coast to Tillamook, that town made famous by its namesake cheese. It’s pronounced “Till-uh-muck,” and yes, the cheese is world-class. From there, Highway 6, a snaking two-laner, threads through the forested Coast Range back towards Portland. Total (Googled) distance: 283 miles. On a regular ICE motorcycle, the ride takes about six hours, or a bit longer if you stop along the way to play some Skee-Ball in Seaside, get some saltwater taffy at Cannon Beach, dip your toes in the surf at Hug Point, or take the walking tour at the cheese factory (totally worth it - free cheese! ). Those are just a tiny sampling of the many, many places worth stopping at along the route. But how long might it take on an electric bike, with its longer charging times?

I used the PlugShare app to plan my route and the first leg of the journey went by the numbers. I left Portland at 8 a.m. and traced Highway 30 to the massive 90-year-old Lewis and Clark Bridge which crosses the Columbia River and connects Oregon and Washington, and arrived at Lower Columbia College in Longview, Washington, 62 miles distant, where I located a pair of Class II 6kW charger in the parking lot.

Normally, school would be in session, but the campus was quiet as students completed their studies at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Zero still had close to a 20% charge as I clicked the connector into place. I passed the time walking the neatly coiffed and quiet campus, eventually ending up at a Subway sandwich shop to lay in provisions for the rest of the trip. Time to charge to 100%? One hour, 10 minutes. Cost: Free. Sandwich? $6, plus tax (and root beer).

Fully charged, sandwiched and rootbeered, I pointed the SR/S up Highway 4, a glorious stretch of two-lane tarmac that winds along the Columbia River towards the Pacific Ocean, where it meets coastal Highway 101. This would be a 73-mile stretch for the SR/S’ battery, and I put the bike in Eco mode and locked in the cruise control at 55 miles an hour, which didn’t last for long as the curves began to come quickly, reducing my average speed and demanding actual human throttle control. The highway is occasionally dotted with tiny towns like Skamokawa, where I turned off for a brief detour to an old haunt, Lucky Mud, where some friends and I used to visit for some mancation down time and some of the best disc golf in the region - maybe in the world. It would be a fateful decision.

I was doing my best hypermiling to make it to Astoria, but the Lucky Mud detour had cost me a precious 10 miles of range, far more than I realized at the time, and now I was in full-on range anxiety mode as I watched the battery level turn red as it dropped below ten percent, then nine, and then eight, with just six miles of range remaining. Astoria, and the next charger, lay eight miles - and one enormous bridge - distant. I curled around a corner into a slight downhill and the mouth of the Columbia River opened up before me, the entrance to the Astoria-Megler Bridge in the distance, a wind-whipped, narrow four-mile long crossing that rises 200 feet above the Columbia River at closest approach to Astoria - and it was still three miles away. The battery meter clicked down to five percent. I dropped my speed to 45mph.

The Zero SR/S is basically a faired and tweaked version of Zero’s SR/F model, and I knew from my time with the F that the motorcycle doesn’t come to a screeching halt when the battery hits zero. Much like an older gas-powered bike, it has somewhat of a “reserve” of power that will continue to propel the machine forward, albeit at a reduced speed. But for how long? My experiments with running the SR/F to zero (while very close to home) seemed to indicate it had at least a couple of miles left in the tank after hitting 0%. I dropped the SR/S to 30mph, activated the hazard lights and rode along the shoulder as I approached the bridge entrance, occasionally buffeted by a log truck, pickup or RV as they whizzed by at 55 or better. Sliding onto the bridge, the battery read zero with range also at zero. Still, the SR/S soldiered on at 30mph, but the climb to the 200-foot peak of the bridge loomed before me, and I had my doubts there were enough electrons banging around inside the battery pack to make the steep ascent, seeing how the bike weighed about 530 pounds with the panniers, I added another 230 or so and I had a lot of camera gear on board - plus that sandwich. That empty battery had to push close to 800 pounds up a very steep but short hill. I began to grit my teeth as the climb commenced.

Almost there... stay on target... c'mon SR/S, you can DO IT! Roberson Photography

The 54-year-old bridge is very long but also very narrow with essentially no shoulder for cars, and losing all power on the uphill leg would put me in a dangerous position of stalling in traffic, much of which was made up of semis, RVs and pickups. But up the SR/S went, the speedometer numbers slowly ticking down as the crest of the span came ever closer. With traffic piling up behind me and a large pickup angrily trying to pass, I crested the top of the span at 25mph, sweet relief flowing through my veins as the SR/S picked up speed - and power from regeneration - as I rolled down the short but steep descent into Astoria. With zeros still showing on the Zero’s gauges, I slowly crept down back streets to the charging station, thankfully located near the bridge. Fifty feet from the charger, the motor switched off and “battery pack depleted” appeared on the LCD display. I pushed the SR/S the last few feet to the charger and clicked the connector into place. I can say with a great amount of certainly that the 2020 Zero SR/S with a 14.4kWh battery, mostly full panniers and a big rider aboard will definitely go a total of 88.7 miles of mostly highway riding at 55mph (and some at 30mph) on a single charge. It was 2:45 p.m., and my adventure was essentially at the halfway point.

In Astoria, the SR/S gave out just feet from this charger. A bit over two hours later, it was at ... [+] 100% once again. Cost: $4. Roberson Photography

Taking the battery from as dead as the Zero’s internal systems would allow it to get (and it’s not good for the battery to do this, mind you) to clicking off at a 100 percent charge from the Level II 6kWh node took 2 hours and 16 minutes, time I passed walking around Astoria’s historic and charming downtown, where stores and restaurants were struggling to survive on takeout and donations during the coronavirus lockdown. Some did not make it through, as new For Lease signs hung in numerous windows. The city has some benches set up near the charger and I perused my smartphone for a bit while the charge completed. Cost? A flat fee of $4.

Leg Three, the shorter ride to Tillamook, lay ahead. It was just after 5pm when I turned the key. Back on the road, I switched the Zero from Eco mode to Sport R, a custom mode I created that was a copy of the built-in full-power Sport mode but with the regen turned up to 95 percent, which gave the SR/S a deceleration behavior on closed throttle similar to my personal motorcycle, a Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird. And while the SR/S doesn’t have the borderline insane top speed of the Blackbird, it more than matched it on brute acceleration, as the motor’s 140 pound feet of torque rocket it past 60 miles an hour in the span of a deep inhale.

Unleashed, the SR/S is a corner-carving delight, even with the SHAD rear cases adding some weight to the rear. But despite hauling my derrière, the pannies, camera gear, rain gear, dry socks and a supply of snacks, the SR/S railed through corner after corner with commendable stability, exquisite smoothness and searing speed as I blitzed my way down the very curvaceous and relatively vacant Highway 101 towards Tillamook, 65 miles away. With Oregon campgrounds, tourist destinations and most businesses closed due to the pandemic, the twisting highway was largely free of traffic, and I passed what little there was with ease as the SR/S’ deep well of torque slingshotted me around the few RVs, boat-hauling pickups and other motorcycles (save for a group of sport riders) making their way south. I stopped off in Lost Boys worthy Seaside for a quick take-out bite and then again in beautiful Cannon Beach, because, well, that’s pretty much mandatory and my supply of the city’s famous saltwater taffy at home was running dangerously low.

Restocked, I shot down the 101 into Tillamook, but the late hour (and the pandemic) meant the doors at the famous cheese factory were closed to the public and the parking lot was barricaded, which scratched one of four charging points off my list (yes, I could have gone around the barricade, but....). The next charger in town was occupied by a Chevy Bolt, but the third time truly was a charm and I found an unoccupied charger at the Blue Heron French Cheese Company, a quaint tourist-trapish spot right on Highway 101 redeemed by amazing dairy products, impressive sculptures, vintage tractors and several rather friendly peacocks that were wandering the neatly kept grounds. Looking for the tap-to-pay spot on the charger, a small sign revealed that we are still in the early days of electric motoring: Charging was free, including for Teslas at the neighboring node. Enjoy it while it lasts, EV-driving friends.

With the SR/S slowly drinking up electricity and daylight fading, I walked along Highway 101 for a stretch, taking photos as the sky turned colors. Traffic was almost nonexistent as the small city buttoned up on a cool Friday evening; no restaurants or nightclubs were open although, at long last, rumblings of a restart were in the air. Oregon had managed the outbreak well, with a sudden rush to close schools and businesses in March no doubt helping to contain the spread of illness. Still, as of this writing, over 160 people had perished from COVID-19 in the state with nearly 5,000 infected. Low numbers, perhaps, but the empty highways, closed stores and the nearly complete absence of people at tourist stops typically thronging with crowds in mid-June made for an eerie reminder of what kind of dire outcome is truly possible under a worst-case pathogen pandemic. The crowds will return, in time. It could have been - or it could be - much worse if we are not vigilant.

An hour and 38 minutes after arriving in Tillamook, the charger clicked off and I slipped the cold weather liner into my jacket, donned a neck warmer and dug my winter gloves out of the rear panniers. It was just over 60 degrees, but I knew that was only temporary. I had been enjoying music and comms most of the ride thanks to the excellent Cardo Packtalk Bold system I installed in my AGV Sportmodular Mono helmet, but now I slipped in earplugs to silence the wind noise for the final leg home and switched off the tunes. It was 9:15 p.m. when I pulled out of the Blue Heron lot and rolled onto Highway 6 towards Portland. The nearest charger was only about 60 miles away in Banks, but that’s not what had me chanting “stay frosty” to myself as I left Tillamook and the highway narrowed to two slim lanes as it began to ascend into the Coast Range.

As a journalist for a local TV station years ago, I wrote many stories about crashes on “the Six” as it is known locally, a snaking, twisting and sometimes uneven stretch of roadway that connects the coast to Oregon’s interior. During the day, it’s a scenic wonder and sport rider heaven. At night, it’s a writhing, pitch black roller coaster of a road where deer, elk, a drunk driver, a broken-down vehicle or rockfall could lurk around the next corner, and there are many, many corners. I set the SR/S’ cruise control to 50 (the speed limit is 55) as the ascent into the mountains began, and just as I was thinking the only way this part of the ride could be any more dangerous was if it started to rain, it started raining. I switched the Zero to Rain mode, which bumped up traction control and ABS sensitivity while slightly softening power output, although freeway speeds remained on tap. I was out of the rain shower minutes later and back on dry pavement, but it was a reminder that now, the curving roadway could also be wet at any point and more vision-reducing rain could be coming.

Into the darkness the SR/S carried me, the excellent twin LED headlights casting a bright and broad swath of light down the road, and the brights - also twin LEDs - lighting up the dense stands of towering fir trees that framed the highway and blotted out the sky. There’s no cell service on much of Highway 6 as it cuts through deep ravines and threads through towering forests, so a misstep or mishap can have fatal consequences because if no one knows you’ve crashed, help ain’t coming. Bending around one corner into a straightaway, a line of headlights - the first I’d seen - were coming the opposite direction. Suddenly, while still a ways away, the lead vehicle veered across my lane - and disappeared. A second and a third did the same as I rapidly slowed. The last driver stopped, blinker on, and flashed their brights in recognition of my presence. I crept past at 20mph and saw that it was a quiver of Jeeps heading up a logging road; locals out for some fun on a Friday night. The driver of the last Jeep tooted his horn as I went by and then gunned it up the road to rejoin the group, and the highway was enveloped in inky darkness once again. I never saw a single vehicle behind me despite my slow speed.

Cresting the range above the 1,500-foot elevation mark, the temperature read 42 degrees on the Zero’s a bit too brightly lit cockpit display. The highway pitched downward, the pavement often pocked by inelegant repairs, dips and cracking left over from when numerous sections of it washed out during a period of epic rainfall in 1996 and subsequent years. But the SR/S’ capable Showa suspension soaked up the pavement irregularities with ease and I must say, it has one of best long-duration motorcycle seats I’ve had the pleasure to experience. I was never uncomfortable. Despite wearing winter gloves, my hands were getting cold, so now that I was on the downhill stretch of the pass, I activated the heated handgrips that came with the Premium version of the SR/S. Soon, my digits were bathed in warmth and as I kept going down in elevation, the ambient temperature began to rise. And it began to rain, again.

Back at the top of the pass, the battery level was reading in the mid-60s, and over the course of the trip, I had been averaging a bit less than one mile per battery charge percentage point. Rolling down the backside of Highway 6, the SR/S transitioned between coasting, regeneration, and slight power as gravity did most of the work. Miles later, as a full moon rose through parting clouds and the dim glow of Portland’s city lights began to brighten on the horizon, Highway 6 emptied out into the rolling farmlands of the broad Willamette Valley. The battery gauge remained in the low 60s. I had planned to stop at Banks for a final recharge, but now, that thankfully wasn’t needed.

The next charger was just down the road in Hillsboro in Oregon’s Silicon Forest, near where Highway 6 linked to Highway 26, the primary (but much more boring) link between Portland and the northern Oregon coast. Coming into the Hillsboro area, the battery was reading in the 40s and the range hung at 38 miles, which meant there was a possibility I could make it home without stopping. If my estimate fell short, that wasn’t such a big deal since by now, there were chargers seemingly on almost every other block, per the PlugShare app. So I pressed on, climbing Sylvan Hill at 60mph and then rolling down hot into Portland’s downtown region to pick up Interstate 405, then a blast across the double-decked Marquam Bridge which overlooks Portland, and finally up Interstate 84 into the Southeast sector of the city I call home.

Not the kind of readout you want to see far from a range display. But the Zero had a little extra in ... [+] the tank (as it were) that allowed me to reach home safely. Roberson Photography

Rolling onto an off ramp to exit I-84, the cruise control suddenly disengages on its own as the battery clicked down to four percent, with two miles of range remaining. It will be enough. I ride the short distance to home through the city as the range indicator slips to zero, and pull into the driveway with one tick showing on the battery gauge. It’s 11:11 p.m. and the tripmeter reads 87 miles exactly. Per the Zero app’s GPS-based ride tracking feature, the trip turned out to be 296 miles total.

What Is And What Will Be

It could be argued that electric motorcycles are not ready for long-distance touring duty. Certainly arguable, I agree, especially compared to the convenience of gas-powered bikes. But taken on its own, it’s obviously possible, completely doable, a challenge that can be met. You just have to realign your plans and expectations to the current limits of the key tech involved, namely battery performance. Everything else typical of a sport-touring motorcycle was present and accounted for on the Zero SR/S: comfy seat, cruise control, bug screen, heated grips, spacious bags, trip planning app, numerous “fueling” stations and so on. It can be done, right now, and the SR/S is gloriously fast and ethereally smooth - it’s a joy to ride it all day. The main difference is part of that day is spent refueling it. Slowly.

For now, that’s just how it is. In the future, likely sooner than we think, things will be very different. Modern battery technology is in its infancy right now, and big changes are on the horizon. In the years to come, that 87 miles of highway range is going to be 187 miles, then 287 then 500 miles and so on. At the same time, charging times will continue to drop as charging methods and battery formulations mature and develop. In time, recharging an electric bike (or car) will take minutes, not an hour or more. Have no doubt: it’s going to happen. Some of the biggest companies on Earth, in both the automotive and tech sectors, are dumping billions into battery R&D, and you can expect those efforts to bear fruit in the near term. Breakthroughs will happen, perhaps major ones, where capacities will triple or more for the same given storage space, a function of energy storage known as energy density.

The energy density of liquid fuels is pretty much set in stone (sorry); if you want to go farther, you have to carry more of it, which adds weight, which then fluctuates as it is used. With batteries, the weight never changes. Also, batteries can often do the seemingly impossible: weigh less yet hold more power. Want proof? Buy an eight pack of AA alkaline batteries and an eight pack of AA lithium batteries. The lithiums are far lighter but last far longer. Miracle? No, just battery science, the same science that allows the SR/S’s lithium-ion battery to ferry a 505-pound motorcycle, my prodigious carcass and a bunch of heavy gear for well over an hour at speed, and then recharge over and over again to repeat the process. When you think about it, the fact that the Zero SR/S works as well as it does right now is a modern technological miracle.

Time To Ride!

Yes, you can tour on it. But bring the patience of the pioneer that you are. Roberson Photography

What is life without adventure? Pretty dull. In modern industrialized society, most of the things our not-so-distant forebears had to struggle for - food, water, shelter, medical care - are now on-demand staples of daily life. City folk aren’t out hunting to stave off hunger and keep warm with animal skins. We have puffy jackets, ZoomCare, 7-Eleven nachos and amazing digital devices for instant communication and entertainment, let alone amazing electric motorcycles (and cars). Life is an embarrassment of riches for most people, whether they realize it or not. It’s hard to be a pioneer in this day and age, and while my electric motorcycle touring escapade had some tense moments, they were nothing compared to the travails endured by real heroes like Ted Simon or Bessie Stringfield, who looked danger, deep-seated racism and other perils in the face and turned the throttle anyway.

But in some small way, I felt a bit of that pioneer spirit in my ride through the quiet back roads of Oregon and Washington on a motorcycle that is essentially from the future, from a time when doing my coastal loop in a day at speed on an electric bike will be a no-brainer, because it has a 500-mile range, makes 200hp, recharges in 5 minutes and is reliable as a hammer. Zero’s SR/S is most of the way to that future right now. It was a hoot to ride, carried me in comfort, went like the dickens and worked exactly as designed, even going above and beyond its apparent maximum abilities when things got ugly. It capably got me to where I wanted and needed to go in style and comfort, and then got me home with no problems other than the limitations of the battery. I can’t ask for more than that.

Someday soon, sooner than we will likely realize, it will take five minutes to charge an electric motorcycle that gets 500 miles of range, and probably for a pittance compared to even today’s low gas prices. You could wait for that day, but you’d be missing out on a great riding experience on the Zero SR/S, the likes of which most riders rarely get to experience. All I can do is hope and root for battery design to catch up to the true abilities of the Zero SR/S, so that soon enough, my usual seven hour ride can be completed in a bit less than 15 hours.

There were only three COVID-19 deaths in the entire state on Monday. Despite the progress, the governor issued a stark warning for residents to continue to take the virus seriously — and the city announced it's setting up checkpoints to inform visitors of quarantine rules.

""Our progress in New York is even better than we expected, thanks to the hard work of New Yorkers,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""But we must protect that progress, which is why today we are adding another state to our travel advisory. We cannot go back to the hell we experienced just a few months ago — and surging infection rates across the country threaten to bring us back there — so we must all remain vigilant.""

The governor has ordered a mandatory 14-day quarantine for people traveling to New York from other states with high rates of infections. Visitors coming from 35 states are currently affected. While Delaware and Washington, D.C., were removed from the list, Rhode Island was added on Tuesday.

Several states, including neighboring New Jersey, have seen a recent uptick in cases. CBS New York asked Cuomo if he would add New Jersey to the quarantine list if the numbers kept trending up.

""I don't know how you could quarantine New Jersey... They don't fly into New York. You'd have to blockade roads, and we're not talking about blockading,"" he said. ""We're going to keep our fingers crossed and work with them to get the number down.""

On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio went further, announcing during a press briefing that checkpoints are being set up at key entry points into the city.

""Travelers coming in from those states [on the quarantine list] will be given information about the quarantine. They'll be reminded that it's required not optional. They'll be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law — and it comes with serious penalties,"" de Blasio said, adding that under certain circumstances fines could be as as high as $10,000.

""This is serious stuff,"" de Blasio said. ""If we're going to hold at this level of health and safety in the city and get better, we have to deal with the fact that the quarantine must be applied consistently to anyone who has traveled.""

In addition to the travel advisory, many other precautions remain in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. Restaurants are only allowed to offer outdoor seating and must ensure social distancing, and large gatherings are still banned.

It's a huge turnaround from early in the pandemic, when New York was the biggest hot spot in the nation. At the peak in early April, the state was reporting nearly 800 COVID-19 deaths per day.

There have been a total of at least 417,589 confirmed cases in the New York and more than 25,000 deaths, according to state health data.

Of the 70,993 coronavirus test results reported to New York State on Monday, 746 — a rate of just 1.05% — were positive, according to the governor's office.

On Sunday, Cuomo said in a statement that 6 million tests have been conducted, ""and the numbers are just about where we want them to be, which is all very good news and says that our plan is working.""

""However, context is important, and there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of new cases throughout the country and a lack of compliance here in the state, and I urge New Yorkers to stay New York Smart and local governments to properly enforce state guidance,"" he said.","New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday that New York City had no COVID-19 deaths for three straight days.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World, Season 2, Episode 6, ""The Maiden's Gospel,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll.

Foresight is a powerful tool, one that Subaru often uses to his advantage in order to avoid critical failures -- i.e. his own grizzly murder. In “The Maiden's Gospel,” his Return by Death ability has once again provided him with insight, but it proves to be just one small piece of a much larger puzzle.

Waking in the Witch's Graveyard post disembowelment by Elsa at Roswaal's Mansion, Subaru finds Emilia undergoing the Trial of the Sanctuary. This time, as he holds her, instead of calling out for Puck, she only says his name. Unlike the first time around, the meeting held to discuss the result of the Trial is also attended by Emilia, who is somewhat offended when Subaru reveals that there are actually three Trials and that he would like to take them in her stead.

Much to his surprise, Garfiel reacts negatively to the suggestion as well, in spite of literally telling Subaru that he would like that to happen when the half-beast transported him to the edge of the barrier in his previous life. Taken aback, Emilia's doubling down on her own ability to pass the Trial leaves Subaru with no choice -- he must return to the Mansion much sooner than he had before.

With little time to spare, Subaru confides in Roswaal that he will be leaving -- and reveals that the patriarch might know a lot more than he lets on. When Subaru mentions that leaving later will not work “this time,” Roswaal repeats the phrase, though Subaru doesn't elaborate. Roswaal suggests bringing Ram with him as he smiles slyly, further questioning whether or not Subaru should place his trust in him, or if he, in fact, has an idea about Subaru's Return by Death ability.

Leaving the Sanctuary two days prior to the last time, Subaru and Ram speak with Garfiel before heading out. Whatever happened between Garfiel and Subaru prior to being gutted like a fish seems to have not occurred in this new life as before they embark, Garfiel seems reluctant to hand over his own necklace, a protective stone that he readily gifted to Subaru previously. Exploiting his affection for Ram, he eventually hands over the stone and the pair head off.

While traveling, Subaru makes an executive decision to tell Ram about her sister, Rem. The conversation proves to be lengthy as it reaches its conclusion the moment the pair arrive at the Mansion where they are surprised by Petra. Subaru expresses his happiness to see her and when they enter, he brings Ram to see her comatose sister. Ram requests to be left alone with her, and so Subaru instead leaves to speak with Frederica.

Frederica had been suspected of being an ally to the Conservatives, a faction of Sanctuary residents who wish to keep the barrier intact. When asked about the stone and why it was given to Emilia, Frederica seems surprised to learn that it had such power. But when Ram returns, she manages to get Frederica to admit that she cannot speak any further on the matter due to having taken an oath.

The interrogation is cut short by Elsa, who also seems surprised that Subaru had arrived earlier than expected. As the maids and Subaru go on the attack, Elsa proves a powerful foe, injuring both Frederica and Subaru as they make a leap-of-faith-escape from the window.

As if Subaru needed any further proof that there exists no memory of Ram, Rem suggests leaving her and Beatrice to die so that the four could safely escape, proving that the power of the amnesia is absolute. But morality prevails, as Subaru is backed by both Frederica and Petra.

The four decide to go on the attack yet again. As Frederica transforms into beast mode, the trio heads off to retrieve Rem only to be confronted by a mabeast. Now with two threats in the Mansion, and with no time to question why a mabeast is roaming the halls, Ram rushes off to procure transportation as Subaru and Petra run for their lives. The pair is seemingly safe until an explosion renders Subaru unconscious. The next moments are ripe with violence until eventually, Subaru regains consciousness to find that he's clinging to the disembodied arm of the young maid Petra.

As Elsa returns, Subaru is left bloodied and near death. He questions her motives but she remains rather mum on the details. Thinking that he will die, Subaru rushes to enter Rem's room and is unfortunately rescued by Beatrice, a horrifying turn of events for the hero who relies on death to save himself and others.

The bloodiest episode thus far of the season has proven that the series still has the capacity to shock. With Petra meeting a gruesome end, Re:Zero has entered new territory wherein safety is a thing of the past and tried and true tactics are challenged, if not erased entirely.

New episodes of Re:Zero premiere Wednesdays at 10:30 a.m. ET on Crunchyroll.

The truth about these zero-sugar drinks with a caffeinated kick,"With eye-catching rainbow colors plus the promise of increased energy, better focus and even weight loss, loaded teas have been popping up on Instagram with increasing regularity.

These brightly hued drinks with names like Blue Hawaiian, Gummi Bear and Unicorn have all the makings of social media stardom — but are they actually worth the hype in real life?

The answer is complicated.

What are loaded teas?

Loaded teas are beverages that feature a cocktail of supplements with a range of purported health benefits, from performance enhancement and mental clarity to a metabolism boost and hunger suppression. While they aren’t a trademarked beverage, many accounts posting about the drinks on social media are affiliated with the supplement distribution company Herbalife, whose supplements are used as the base of many drinks.

There isn’t one single formula for loaded teas, as different purveyors make their own versions, but many involve a combination of Herbalife’s Liftoff energy tablet, Herbalife’s Herbal Tea Concentrate, other add-ons from Herbalife, like aloe or collagen water, and a variety of sweet, (often) sugar-free syrups or even juices. The enticing tropical flavors and swirl of colors add a little magic to the otherwise unpalatable experience of gulping down a 32-ounce cup of supplements.

“It’s the same formula as an energy drink, but they call it a tea — because teas are what ‘healthy’ people drink,” said Dr. Tanja Johnston, a Los Angeles-based board certified naturopathic doctor and nutritionist. To her point, not all of the loaded teas advertised online contain actual tea.

Where did loaded teas come from?

It’s unclear whether Herbalife's corporate offices created the idea for loaded teas and shared recipes with distributors or if distributors came up with the concept and it's taken off, but searches on Instagram and Facebook turn up hundreds of shops, many of them concentrated in towns across Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Florida, advertising their new beverages at special events while linking to a Herbalife digital storefront.

You’re not likely to find loaded teas at your neighborhood cafe, as they are mainly sold by Herbalife-affiliated “nutrition clubs” which are “locally owned and operated by independent Herbalife distributors” who sign up for a membership program with Herbalife to purchase discounted supplements they can use for themselves or sell to consumers. There are currently 2.3 million independent Herbalife distributors, according to the company, but only 5,900 clubs in the U.S. Unlike a GNC, for example, people need to be “personally invited by a Herbalife member or customer to visit their club,” according to company documentation. Many distributors don’t have a nutrition club but do share loaded tea recipes, loaded tea kits and other Herbalife supplements on their digital storefronts.

In 2016, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million to settle claims brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission for deceiving ""consumers into believing they could earn substantial money selling diet, nutritional supplement, and personal care products."" The FTC also called the company's compensation structure ""unfair"" since it ""rewards distributors for recruiting others to join and purchase products in order to advance."" Herbalife agreed to the settlement, but maintained that many of the claims against it were factually incorrect.

Herbalife acknowledged TODAY’s request for an interview, but would not answer any specific questions about loaded teas or the company's current practices.

After repeated attempts to contact the company, Jennifer Butler, Herbalife's vice president of communications, emailed the following statement to TODAY: ""Every day millions of people around the globe enjoy Herbalife Nutrition products and like other companies that serve caffeinated beverages, we actively educate and advise distributors and consumers about the responsible use of caffeine.""

Related: Drinking tea has many health benefits. Here's how a daily cup (or two!) can be good for you, along with healthy teas you should try.

Laura Ligos, a registered dietician and blogger based outside of Albany, New York, said she first noticed nine of these shops pop up around her town about two or three years ago. She started receiving questions from clients and local fitness studios about the efficacy of loaded teas, so she decided to take a closer look. Johnston said she also started hearing about loaded teas from her clients around the same time.

Are loaded teas healthy?

Since each shop mixes up their own unique tea blends with various supplements, syrups and flavorings, there isn’t a standard nutritional profile. However, many shops post that their drinks start at just 20 to 24 calories, and then go up with add-ons.

According to the nutritional labels for Herbalife’s Liftoff and Herbal Tea Concentrate, these drinks would appear to be chock full of vitamins B and C, and the amino acid L-taurine, which can benefit immunity and energy, as well as biotin. Herbalife makes product labels available online, so consumers can see the ingredients in individual supplements, many of which, according to Seattle-based registered dietician and Bastyr University assistant professor Maribeth Evezich, appear to be safe for most healthy adults.

Herbalife

One tablet of Liftoff contains multiple stimulants including ginseng, guarana and caffeine, while one serving of Herbal Tea Concentrate includes more stimulants from tea extract and caffeine powder. Many loaded teas advertised have at least 160 milligrams of caffeine, equivalent to about two cups of coffee (the FDA says 400 milligrams a day is safe for healthy adults, though the organization acknowledges that caffeine affects people differently).

Several nutrition clubs' Instagram posts suggest consumers may load on additional supplements, but unless you're looking at the nutrition label for every supplement, it would be difficult to calculate how many stimulants and vitamins you're actually ingesting. If consumers are drinking loaded teas on an empty stomach, the effect may be heightened, said Johnston, who added that a couple of her clients drank loaded teas while practicing intermittent fasting before she advised them to stop.

Herbalife's Tea Concentrate contains a mix of black, orange pekoe and green teas, and contains approximately 85 milligrams of caffeine per serving.

What nutritionists say

Despite the potential benefits of having more energy and consuming more vitamins, nutritionists TODAY spoke with advised proceeding with caution when it comes to loaded teas.

“The biggest beef that I have with these drinks is all the stimulants,” said Johnston. “They’re just an overdrive for your cardiovascular system. Your heart rate increases, your blood pressure increases, it can affect your hormones and even negatively impact your mood.” Teens, she continued, are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of large doses of caffeine.

Added Evezich, “High caffeine intake can lead to a vicious cycle of poor quality sleep, which then can negatively impact food intake and cravings, which can create low energy, which can make that person less likely to exercise, thereby decreasing mental acuity and energy levels.”

In other words, all of those stimulants can, over time, actually result in the very issues people turn to loaded teas to fix.

Ligos said some clients, and others who reached out to her, complained of headaches, jitters and digestive issues after drinking loaded teas — some after having the drink just once, and others after drinking the beverage several times.

“I just felt like there wasn't a lot of transparency with what people were getting with these teas,” Ligos said when she started investigating the ingredients in loaded teas. “It’s just a bunch of powders that they mix up with these unnatural colors and flavors that seem desirable.”

TODAY attempted to contact a dozen different nutrition clubs currently advertising loaded teas on Instagram. When TODAY reached Ole Brooke Nutrition in Brookhaven, Mississippi, the person who picked up acknowledged they carried loaded teas, but hung up after we identified ourselves. When TODAY contacted Orange Beach Nutrition in Orange Beach, Alabama, the person who picked up said they carried loaded teas, but asked that we call a manager when we identified ourselves as a news organization. The manager of that location then declined to answer any questions, including a query about the most popular flavors. All people who answered the phone refused to provide their names.

Many of these shops also have the word “nutrition” in their names, with examples including Twickenham Nutrition, Wild Nutrition and Ad Astra Nutrition. Ligos said consumers may logically expect that they know what they are talking about when it comes to doling out nutrition advice. While some people who run these clubs may have a background in fitness or nutrition, training in nutrition is not required — nor is it provided by Herbalife — to open a club.

However, these clubs are mixing supplements and making various claims to promote their loaded teas. For example, many nutrition clubs posting on Instagram claim that loaded teas contain zero sugar and some say they are keto friendly. However, the labels for Herbalife’s Liftoff and Herbal Tea Concentrate reveal corn syrup solids, fructose (both forms of added sugar) and maltodextrin, a starch-based thickener that is not considered suitable for those following a keto diet. And that’s before the addition of artificially colored and flavored syrups.

On social media, many nutrition club accounts have claimed that these teas promote weight loss. While the stimulants can boost one's metabolism, the nutritionists TODAY spoke with said claims about weight loss are often overblown.

“Of course you can lose weight if you're drinking these teas instead of an afternoon soda, you’re just taking away calories,” said Ligos.

So what if you really want to keep loaded teas in your life?

Hundreds of people on social media claim to enjoy them and sing their praises. You don’t need to get rid of them completely if you don’t experience any negative side effects after consuming one, said Johnston, but you’re better off treating them like an alcoholic beverage rather than a health drink you should consume regularly.

“My advice would be to drink eight ounces of water beforehand, to prepare your kidneys to flush everything out. Caffeine also dehydrates you,"" she said.

The nutritionists also said people can consider making their own version of a loaded tea at home using ingredients they are familiar with. Ultimately, said Evezich, you’re better off eating and drinking real food and suggested trying green tea for an energy boost.

“There’s no silver bullet to get that energy rush,"" she said. ""Rather, individuals really need to be looking at lifestyle issues to determine why they are needing more energy and consider the long-term implications of band-aid strategies such as loaded teas.”","Many distributors don’t have a nutrition club but do share loaded tea recipes, loaded tea kits and other Herbalife supplements on their digital storefronts.

My wife has, on several occasions, prayed for the moment when we can stop. But for all their imperfections, they’re some of the most exciting, weird and brave films I’ve seen, and my festival would celebrate them in all their wonky winsomeness.

Venue

The first time any of my work screened publicly, I turned up excitedly with my mum to find a disused office block in a field of rubble. We sat in an echoey conference room and squinted as a ghostlike version of my film played on a school-grade overhead projector.

In remembrance of that, my festival will take place in an abandoned building, designed by Fritz Lang. Robert Wiene (The Cabinet of Dr Caligari) would do the interiors and Dolby would be in charge of everything technical.

Price of admission

Getting people to watch debut films is hard, so you get paid minimum wage to attend and you’re put up on site. (Kubrick has designed the bedrooms.)

Opening night

David Lynch’s Eraserhead: the midnight movie that gave permission to anyone with a camera to get out there and do it themselves.

Key screenings

Juries on criminal trials give harsher verdicts when they haven’t eaten for a while, so, to give every film the best chance, this festival is planned in accordance with your bodily needs.

A waking daydream: I Lost My Body. Photograph: Netflix/AP

8am: You wake as absurd and dreamlike films like Jérémy Clapin’s I Lost My Body, Jane Campion’s Sweetie or Harmony Korine’s Gummo are beamed into your bedroom to remind you that you are only ever one coffee away from your darkest unconscious.

Breakfast

11am: High on breakfast, you are whisked away to explore far-off places: Naji Abu Nowar’s Bedouin thriller Theeb, Mati Diop’s ground-breaking Atlantics or Moon by Duncan Jones.

Lunch

2pm: We’ll take advantage of these alert couple of hours with important, thought-provoking films like Ryan Coogler’s heartbreaking Fruitvale Station, Steve McQueen’s Hunger or Clio Barnard’s The Arbor.

Tea and cake

5pm: The afternoon slump is conquered by bonkers flicks like Peter Jackson’s Bad Taste, new comedies like Karen Maine’s Yes, God, Yes, old favourites like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and mad wonders like Trey Shults’s Krisha.

Serious post-dinner fare: I Am Not a Witch. Photograph: Allstar/FILM4

Dinner

8pm: Some serious, arthouse fare because you are pensive post-dinner. Rungano Nyoni’s singular I Am Not a Witch, Joanna Hogg’s scalpel-sharp Unrelated or Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy’s disturbing The Tribe.

Coffee

11pm: Something terrifying to keep you up: Jordan Peele’s Get Out, Babak Anvari’s Under the Shadow, Julia Ducournau’s vegetarian-cannibal film Raw or that old fave Donnie Darko.

Midnight snack

1am: We’ll soothe your nerves with hot chocolate and the rhythmic pleasure of Céline Sciamma’s synchronised swimming debut Water Lilies, the dance-based brilliance of Anna Rose Holmer’s The Fits, Eva Riley’s tender Perfect 10 or – one of my lockdown finds – Věra Chytilová’s lyrical masterpiece Something Different.

Sidebars

First and only: For directors whose debuts were deemed so terrible their careers ended before they’d begun. Afterwards audiences have to write down 25 things they liked about the film.

Food and drink

Anyone spotted with popcorn is locked in a soundproof cabinet.

Parties

159,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/shironeko-project/zero-chronicle/.161818,"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Anime News Network,Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle,"Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is bad. It's boring, poorly animated, putridly paced and half the time barely even comprehensible. And yet, watching it, I couldn't help but see the faint flame of lost potential, flickering behind the bad CG and awful dialogue. Because unlike a lot of its mobile game anime-adaptation contemporaries, the basic story here is a thematically compelling tragedy; about a false ‘balance’ that resigns some people to squalor and poverty and others to riches beyond compare, and how the end-stage of that society can only be destruction. But these ideological prophecies, this small glimmer of a better, richer story – remain unrealized. All we have is a show that is, at best, so bad it's hilarious, and at worst, so devoid of meaningful story developments that it is utterly tedious.

In abstract, Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is about an unjust social order. The Kingdom of White is perched high atop the clouds, drenched in radiant light, with flourishing plants and regal splendor and a comfortable, content population. The Kingdom of Black, meanwhile, is a place defined by perpetual violence; in the opening scene of the show, the soon-to-be Prince's village is massacred by monsters who are allowed to roam free, putting him on an equally violent path to eventually take the throne for himself. These two nations, one of opulence and riches and the other ruled over by a survival-of-the-fittest totalitarian in the King of Darkness, are at war.

Queen Iris talks about the war in terms of maintaining some sort of wordly ‘balance’. Over the course of the series, we come to see that this ‘balance’ is an unfair scheme much more about ensuring that light and dark stay in their assigned, designated places—one prospering, the other not—than helping people and stopping entropy. The King of Darkness's end goal is to upset this scheme, but not because he believes it's unjust. He simply wants more power, for his darkness to encompass the whole of the world.

There is so much potential in this. In a world where terrible ideas that abet an oppressive status quo are so often framed as ‘in the middle’, as ‘working toward balance and peace’; where our greatest monsters, the ones whose actions will destroy the world, are a direct result of how our social systems have been constructed to privilege one over another – these ideas are apt and essential. And yet, none of it resonates. Not once is the viewer struck by how the fairy-tale Kingdoms of Black and White resemble our world, nor do they parse the many, many circuitous philosophical dialogues of the show as anything but long-winded exposition dumps.

And it's all because of the extremely poor execution. For one, Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle markets itself, in its opening and its promotional materials, as a Romeo and Juliet-styled romance between two star-crossed lovers unable to be together because of their conflicting social positions. But the show is so terrible at depicting any kind of connection between Iris and the Prince, romantic or otherwise, that this central hook of the show feels like it's not even present. The Prince of Darkness and Iris don't meet until episode 6. In the entire show, I think they have maybe three or four actual conversations—only one of which demonstrates any real, meaningful connection between the two (this being the conversation they have right before the King of Darkness invades and the climax begins)—in a span of maybe three or four episodes. There are occasional, furtive glances; silly fanservice moments where the Prince trips and knocks the queen into a pond. But these are nowhere near enough to sell the Earth-shaking, revolutionary shifts in worldview that are supposed to occur as a result of this connection. The Prince comes to realize that he values the life of the Queen more than his ability to seize the Throne of Darkness, while the Queen, through seeing the humanity and struggle of the Prince, realizes in turn that the scheme of ‘balance’ she has so long sought to uphold is one that must be destroyed if everyone is to truly be happy. What's in the show isn't nearly enough to justify these story developments, to portray romance this deep and cosmic and impactful; crucial character work is needed for these messages to be effective, and it's just missing.

This is only part of a broader problem that kills the series' ability to evoke emotion and meaningfully reflect upon our world: it's awful pacing. The series is based on the prologue to a mobile game, and the dearth of real story content is evident in how it mostly consists of padding. This is not a story that can sustain twelve episodes of a TV series. Maybe a movie. Maybe a 5-episode OVA . But in order to hit standard cour length, the show has to spend multiple episodes on a dress-up party and a vegetable hunt (plot arcs that could maybe work if there was any meaningful characterization, if the show emphasized ideology and the ways in which people from different walks of life identify and connect beyond liking soup, which there isn't and it doesn't); where the first half of the show is spent on stopping a demon who doesn't even have a presence in the final arcs; and where essential points of characterization (like the true loyalty of the Prince's retainer or the court mage's jealousy of Iris being the one who was crowned queen) are given so little attention. When a series spends most of its energy on things that are unrelated to the main plot and core themes, you have a serious, investment-diverting problem; doubly-so in the case of a show like Shironeko Project , where the whole point is to see how the humanity and ideology of these storytelling aspects pertain to us, to our lives and experiences.

The most baffling thing about Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is that it is a 12-episode prequel to the premise of a mobile game that doesn't seem to have much to do with the themes of this anime adaptation. A brief flashforward to a boy sleeping on a beach is all you get as resolution if the cycle of exploitation continues (and it seems like this flashforward is also mostly unrelated to the prologue, as the game from here on becomes an adventure narrative about visiting various islands). It leaves you wondering: what was the point of all that philosophical monologuing, if all it leads to is a traditional JRPG that we don't even get to see much of? Was it all just advertising for a phone game I'll never play? Who knows, but the one certainty is that Shironeko Project fails at everything it sets out to do, from beginning to end.

When you watch the first episode and see its flat, sterile colors, its stiff-as-a-board character designs that barely move, and hear its dialogue that rambles on endlessly, never coming to any real or lasting conclusions, you know any chances the series has of reaching past itself to say something rich and meaningful isn't going to happen. When the best thing about your high fantasy allegory for unjust social systems is that the music's ok, you know something has gone deeply, deeply wrong.","Shironeko Project: Zero Chronicle is bad.

160,https://www.zerotackle.com/harry-grant-should-be-next-on-mals-hit-list-nrl-66965/,"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Zero Tackle,Harry Grant should be next on Mal’s hit list,"I’ve been screaming from the rooftops as soon as I saw this man play in the Queensland Cup.

Immediately I could tell he had the potential to be very special, especially playing at the Storm, who would provide the perfect tutelage and coaching needed for him to blossom into one of the games elite dummy halves.

Boy, if you haven’t seen young Harry, play cancel your plans next time the West Tigers are on and watch this young superstar command a roster of veteran players around the park with absolute elegance.

He has every tool in the kit bag – he’s learnt from the best to ever do it and seemed to absorb every bit of knowledge he could. The calmest player and the commanding presence of a team which he’s just walked in the door as the first-ever NRL loan player.

This is exactly what the Gold Coast is building towards and trying to create a young core of players willing to go to war together, who are talented but also have a certain pedigree.

Harry Grant, with the likes Mo, Tino, and Fifita, would make for one of the best forward packs in the competition. Making it a viable destination for marquee halves and star backs players would like to join.

His understanding of how important each play is in terms of the bigger picture has put this young man light years ahead of many dummy halves in the competition and catapulted him to the top of the Dally M rankings, which is incredible for a rookie.

Only nine games into his NRL career and the superstar has himself three tries and four try assists respectively putting him 16th amongst try assisters which is incredible considering only Cameron Smith is above him for the hooking role.

As for running metres, he’s currently sitting on 90 runs for 735 metres, putting him fourth for all hookers in running metres, except for the fact Havili, Brandon Smith, Cameron McInnes play in the lock/utility position this year putting him atop the list in my eyes.

He’s fantastic in terms of picking his moments to run as well. Fourth in line breaks for hookers with three, tied with Cook, the current Blues hooker. Defensive hunger is something Holbrook is trying to ignite in his team and bringing in hungry young talented players who have bright futures ahead of them is the way this team is trending.

Tino and David are exceptional defensively and both have the ability to do damage with the ball as well. Harry Grant has shown himself to be a good defender so far, averaging 42 tackles a game and missing only two. This itself is just mind-boggling to think how he still spearheads their attack and is frequently the most dangerous offensive threat week in and week out. He’d be as good defensively as Nathan Peats but with so much more upside offensively.

Harry Grant has blown me away and I’m sure Mal has taken notice of him too. He is a Queensland born man from Rockhampton – does that mean he could be lured away from Melbourne or the Tigers? Back home per se?

I think he could consider it. At this point, both other Queensland clubs have long term hookers, the Cowboys with Robson and the Broncos with Turpin. Could the Titans offer Harry a contract within the next couple of years attractive enough to entice him out of Melbourne? Could we be looking at the beginning of a new era of Queensland rugby league? Headed by the former Bronco himself David Fifita, with the likes of Mo, Tino, Brimson and Harry all growing as a collective, forming an unlikely little brother takeover of Queensland.

Grant is someone who is passionate and bleeds the jersey he wears. That is exactly what the Titans need to build the club into the bustling hub of the Gold Coast, getting people interested in the club again.

For the fans who have been struggling in silence, I see your comments on the Facebook feeds and I sympathise with you. This kid could be exactly what the Titans need to refresh the club, building for the future alongside the youth.","I’ve been screaming from the rooftops as soon as I saw this man play in the Queensland Cup.
Boy, if you haven’t seen young Harry, play cancel your plans next time the West Tigers are on and watch this young superstar command a roster of veteran players around the park with absolute elegance.
Harry Grant, with the likes Mo, Tino, and Fifita, would make for one of the best forward packs in the competition.
Harry Grant has shown himself to be a good defender so far, averaging 42 tackles a game and missing only two.
Could the Titans offer Harry a contract within the next couple of years attractive enough to entice him out of Melbourne?"

The Food Bank of Puerto Rico, in an effort to raise awareness against hunger, launched the “Zero Hunger Puerto Rico” campaign, seeking to boost education and mechanisms to work toward achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture on the island.

“After the hurricanes, earthquakes and the pandemic that we are experiencing, the veil of what we do not want to see has been lifted: hunger on our island,” said Food Bank of Puerto Rico President Denise Santos, an entity allied with Feeding America.

“The increase in demand for food that we have had in the Food Bank evidences this reality. We can’t solve the problems that we ignore. It’s time to assume the inescapable responsibility of ending hunger in Puerto Rico,” Santos.

To begin to achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, the “Zero Hunger Puerto Rico” initiative will present five virtual dialogues and four documentaries that will be broadcast on several platforms, oriented to solutions during the week of Sept. 21-25.

Part of the initiative calls for collaborating with the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics to start developing the United Nations’ progressive goals of eliminating hunger.

From 2011 to 2015, 40 municipalities were found to have 50% or more of their homes under poverty levels, which has increased as of 2017.

“We want to play an important role in transforming the world’s supply chains to be regenerative,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Walmart Inc. “We face a growing crisis of climate change and nature loss and we all need to take action with urgency.”

He added, “For 15 years, we have been partnering to do the work and continually raising our sustainability ambitions across climate action, nature, waste and people. The commitments we’re making today not only aim to decarbonize Walmart’s global operations, they also put us on the path to becoming a regenerative company — one that works to restore, renew and replenish in addition to preserving our planet, and encourages others to do the same.”

Walmart Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart Inc., (shown here in 2018) will kick off this week's Climate Week NYC where he will share news about the retailer's zero emissions and efforts to help combat the cascading loss of nature threatening the planet.

Walmart, with over 11,500 stores worldwide, is building on its long-standing commitment to climate action by raising its ambition to zero emissions by 2040, without the use of carbon offsets, across its global operations by:

• Harvesting enough wind, solar and other renewable energy sources to power its facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2035;

• Electrifying and zeroing out emissions from all of its vehicles, including long-haul trucks, by 2040; and

• Transitioning to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in its stores, clubs and data and distribution centers by 2040.

Walmart

“We must all take urgent, sustained action to reverse nature loss and emissions before we reach a tipping point from which we will not recover,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, executive vice president and chief sustainability officer for Walmart Inc. and president of the Walmart Foundation. “People have pushed past the earth’s natural limits. Healthy societies, resilient economies and thriving businesses rely on nature. Our vision at Walmart is to help transform food and product supply chains to be regenerative, working in harmony with nature — to protect, restore and sustainably use our natural resources.”

Along with the Walmart Foundation, Walmart aims to protect, manage or restore some of the world’s most critical landscapes by:

• Continuing to support efforts to preserve at least one acre of natural habitat for every acre of land developed by the company in the U.S.;

• Driving the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, sustainable fisheries management and forest protection and restoration — including an expansion of Walmart’s forests policy; and • Investing in and working with suppliers to source from placed-based efforts that help preserve natural ecosystems and improve livelihoods.

The news comes as this year’s Climate Week NYC kicks off, where Doug McMillon will share Walmart’s news during the opening ceremony. On Tuesday Walmart holds its annual Sustainability Milestone Summit, held during Climate Week’s Hub Live, where the company will engage Walmart associates, suppliers, NGOs and other stakeholders to advance sustainability in the retail and consumer goods sector.

To date, according to the company, Walmart powers around 29% of its operations with renewable energy and diverts approximately 80% of its waste from landfills and incineration globally. Because most of the company’s environmental impact comes from its supply chain, Walmart is also working with suppliers through its Project Gigaton initiative to avoid a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. More than 2,300 suppliers have signed on, and since the effort launched in 2017, suppliers report a total of 230 million metric tons of avoided emissions.","Walmart on Monday announced it is doubling down on addressing the growing climate crisis by targeting zero emissions across the company’s global operations by 2040.

Administered by Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI), TRUE helps facilities define, pursue and achieve zero waste goals while becoming more resource efficient.

Cintas’ Chicago DCs were certified Gold as a result of diverting more than 90 percent of its waste stream from landfill and incineration, having a zero waste policy in place and meeting the TRUE certification requirements over the past 12 months. The facility services the regional Cintas rental locations and includes large production areas dedicated to shipping and receiving all types of new products, including garments for its largest direct sale and rental customers in the hospitality, gaming, healthcare and airline industries, among others.

“This TRUE Gold certification is a reflection of our dedication to company-wide sustainability efforts that positively improve the way we do business,” said Krista Jaeger, Manager of Sustainability at Cintas. “Led by distribution center managers, Justin Perry and Glade Parrish, the team at our Chicago DCs paired their sustainable spirit with continuous hard work to achieve their zero waste goals.”

TRUE certified spaces are environmentally responsible, more resource efficient and help turn waste into savings and additional income streams. By closing the loop, they cut greenhouse gases, manage risk, reduce litter and pollution, reinvest resources locally, create jobs and add more value for their company and community. TRUE also certifies events to improve their sustainability.

Since 2013, eight Cintas distribution centers have achieved Gold or Platinum TRUE certification – the highest levels attainable under the certification program. The DC facilities have displayed continued success throughout the journey and have helped to motivate the entire company in the right direction by setting a precedence for excellence when it comes to responsible waste management and overall facility efficiency.

“Companies with TRUE certified facilities are industry leaders in finding solutions to cut greenhouse gases, reduce litter and pollution, and add more value for their company and community,” said Stephanie Barger, Director, Market Transformation & Development for TRUE. “By adopting a zero waste strategy, Cintas is making an ongoing commitment to sustainability.

Microsoft released its newest foldable smartphone, the Surface Duo, on September 10. When folded it’s 9.8 mm thick -- some 58 percent of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold (16.7 mm). Reviewers call it “downright futuristic,” even if the device is still working through its bugs.

There is one thing you won’t get with the $1,399 Duo – the ability to fix it.

iFixit.com, which reviews the repairability of consumer devices, found the device wasn’t “meant to be repaired, maybe not even by Microsoft,” and gave it a regrettable repairability score of 2 out of 10.

The debut of an unfixable device flies in the face of Microsoft's recent commitments to the environment. In August, Microsoft committed to a goal of achieving zero waste by 2030, with proposals to divert 90 percent of all of its waste from landfills, create circular centers to reuse its servers, and manufacture 100 percent recyclable Surface laptops.

While Microsoft is pledging zero-waste, it failed to do the single most important thing a tech company can do to reduce waste: make devices that stay in use.

Researchers estimate that 85 percent of the climate impact of a smartphone comes from the initial manufacturing stage. If Americans used their phones just one more year on average, 42.5 million lbs of raw material would be saved every day.

Pledges to go zero-waste and carbon negative are praiseworthy, but their impact is undercut if you create a product destined to become electronic waste as soon as it needs a repair. After all, Microsoft has the ability to make repairable and ultra-sleek devices – it has before.

Unless Microsoft addresses sustainability in its own devices, its pledges are, if you’ll excuse the pun, surface level. Microsoft should use its environmental leadership to champion repairability, and support repair. Your voice can help encourage them to rethink their opposition to Right to Repair.

The devices the earth really needs aren’t the shiny new toys – they are the ones we’ve already made, lasting as long as we can manage.

It essentially means ensuring that any human-produced carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere through technological or natural means.

19 countries and the EU have adopted a net-zero target, with deadlines ranging from 2030 to 2050.

A U.N-backed global campaign to slash climate-changing emissions has added new high-profile members to its ranks, including social media giant Facebook and Ford, the first U.S. car company to join.

The ""Race to Zero"", launched in June, brings together businesses, cities and other organisations that aim by around mid-century to cut their planet-heating emissions to net zero - meaning they produce no more emissions than they can offset through measures such as planting trees.

As New York's annual Climate Week started on Monday, the British government - host of the next U.N. climate summit - said 22 regions, 452 cities, 1,128 businesses, 549 universities and 45 major investors had now signed up for the ""Race to Zero"".

Why does 'net-zero' matter?

It may be the latest buzzword in the world of climate action but it's key to keeping us safe from harm, scientists say. The U.N. climate science panel has said that man-made carbon dioxide emissions need to fall by about 45% by 2030, from 2010 levels, and reach ""net zero"" by mid-century to give the world a good chance of limiting warming to 1.5C and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change,

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries said they would act to limit the rise in global average temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times and strive to keep it to a ceiling of 1.5C.

But the world has already heated up by about 1.1C and is currently on track for warming of at least 3C this century as emissions continue to rise. Scientists say that would bring ever-worsening extreme weather and potentially catastrophic sea level rise, making some parts of the planet uninhabitable and fuelling hunger and migration.

That - and mounting public pressure - is why a growing number of countries, companies and others are promising to cut their planet-warming emissions to net zero by 2050 or before.

What is net zero?

Achieving net zero emissions isn't the same as eliminating all emissions.

It means ensuring any human-produced carbon dioxide or other climate-changing emissions that can't be done away with are removed from the atmosphere some other way. This can be done naturally, such as by restoring forests that suck CO2 out of the air. Or it can be done using technology that can capture and store emissions from power plants and factories or directly pull CO2 from the atmosphere.

Planting more trees worldwide is a popular way to absorb and store more carbon, but technologies that do the same job are still expensive and have yet to be deployed on a large-scale. Scientists say carbon ""removals"", in any form, cannot substitute for cutting planet-heating emissions as fast as possible.

Who has committed to net-zero?

According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington-based think-tank, 19 countries and the European Union have adopted a net zero target, with deadlines ranging from 2030 to 2050. The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has already achieved its 2030 goal, though measures such as adopting renewable energy, promoting electric cars and restoring or planting forests.

Some countries, including Denmark, France, New Zealand and Britain, have enshrined their targets in law. Others are less binding.

More than 100 additional nations are considering putting in place net-zero targets, WRI says - but the fraction of global emissions covered by some form of nationally adopted net-zero targets still hovers around 10%.

Several hundred cities and more than 1,000 companies also have committed to cut their emissions to net zero in the coming decades.

How do you set a net-zero target?

WRI and the 2050 Pathways Platform - which work with governments and others on their climate commitments - say cutting emissions within national boundaries should be the first priority, with efforts to offset what remains only considered after that. Right now, countries vary in whether their net zero targets can include offsetting emissions internationally, such as by paying to protect forests in the Amazon.

To be credible, net-zero targets should cover all greenhouse gases, including methane, and all economic sectors, as well as international aviation and shipping, WRI says. Those trying to achieve net zero emissions should do so by 2050 or earlier, with the highest-emitting countries doing the most, fastest. Plans also need to be reached in consultation with those they will affect and clearly communicated, WRI said.

When it comes to companies, net zero targets vary widely in terms of which parts of supply chains - and sources of emissions - they cover, and are difficult to compare, says the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which has released guidelines to help remedy that.

Is net zero and excuse to kick action down the road?

U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa says companies, cities and others that join the ""Race to Zero"" campaign will be held to their promises, although it is unclear how that will be done.

She and other officials have called for governments to stick to an international deadline for submitting stronger climate action plans by the end of 2020.

But she has also admitted that less than half are likely to do so, as the coronavirus pandemic distracts politicians and delays U.N. climate talks.

Getting net zero targets into national plans for this decade and into day-to-day decision making is crucial, according to WRI researcher Kelly Levin, to avoid investments going into high-carbon technologies or infrastructure.

How can net-zero targets be translate into short-term practical tools? One way is by using carbon budgets, as in Britain, which place a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases the country can emit over a five-year period, Levin said.","Achieving net zero emissions isn't the same as eliminating all emissions.

NEW YORK (BP) – Even months after the towers fell, the debris remained. Don Pierson saw it everywhere – in the city streets and the subways. And as the dust lingered, so did the hurt, anger and fear.



But, according to Pierson, that potent combination of emotions pushed people to find more strength and unity in prayer than he had ever before experienced.



As the chaplain coordinator for Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief (SBDR), Pierson was deployed to New York after 9/11. The program was in its infancy, but in response to the acts of terror and the sudden, intense need, Pierson and others kicked into high gear.



There was hunger for the comforting presence of God. Prayer was the main focus. Referencing Psalm 107 (“… they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; he rescued them from their distress…”), Pierson noted that in crisis, people prayed like never before.



“That’s what we saw in this nation during that time,” he said. “Of all the bad that was done through 9/11, it did unify churches and denominations. It wasn’t just Southern Baptists that were praying … there was unity in prayer in our nation that can only be known in a time of crisis like that.”



Pierson, who also formerly served as prayer strategist for the Tennessee Baptist Convention, retired seven years ago and is now pastor of Stewart’s Chapel Baptist Church in Flintville, Tenn. But his perspective was forever impacted by his time serving in New York.



In the initial days after 9/11, his ministry took place at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, where the twin towers had fallen. He regularly worked the midnight shift, providing counseling in temporary shelters set up for first responders to relax or take meals, in a temporary morgue or at St. Paul’s Chapel, which served as a ministry center and place of refuge.



“There would be maybe three or four people who were working in the pit that would come out to find relief,” he said of those overnight shifts, “and basically you just got to know them and you ministered to them.”



Pierson said he believes God was preparing the hearts of Christians to engage in intense prayer even before that unforgettable day. After 9/11, there was urgency to do just that.



“There was a lot of anxiety and intensity of emotions among our people,” Pierson said. “Prayer as a whole was at a climax. Fear will do that to people. Our nations and our churches were affected by that, by the unknowns.”



Shortly after 9/11, Pierson was provided with another perspective when he traveled to Palestine. In Gaza, he served alongside SBC missionaries and in hunger-relief efforts. He said he saw the anger of Muslim people, and that the experience affirmed to him the absolute necessity to listen and love, no matter the circumstance.



“I believe God said to me, ‘Don Pierson, it’s more important for you to listen than it is for you to speak. And what you hear may not be what you want to hear, so make sure you keep your emotions in check as you listen.’,” Pierson said. “Anger was high in America during that time. It was in our churches, it was everywhere. People said things during that time they probably wouldn’t say today, and so I think I learned to listen better. I learned to choose my words more carefully.”



Those experiences helped to form and refine his views on prayer.



“I still believe our God is a God who loves the world and is not willing that any should perish,” Pierson said. “Praying for the lost has to be for those that look like you, and those that don’t look like you.”



Pierson said God instilled a confidence in him that every life experience is for a purpose.



“Every part of our journey, God uses in the future,” he said, adding:



“I learned a lot in the midst of 9/11 and the months after about not only praying, but responding and ministering to people in crisis and doing so on both sides. I was a missionary that had a strong bent towards prayer; I am now a pastor that has a strong bent toward prayer.”","Don Pierson saw it everywhere – in the city streets and the subways.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Samuel Williams-Rodriguez confirmed this in a statement released Tuesday evening, saying, “There are currently no active cases of COVID-19 in the Cayman Islands.”

The two positive patients, reported on 19 Aug., were travellers who had recently arrived in Cayman and were subject to a 14-day isolation period. Those individuals were Cayman’s only two active cases in more than a month.

Williams-Rodriguez also reported that 105 COVID-19 tests were carried out since Monday, the date of his last report, and all were returned negative.

Cayman’s COVID-19 case total now stands at 205, of which 204 have fully recovered. Only death has been recorded due to the virus, the first person to be confirmed with COVID-19 in Cayman back in February.

That patient was an Italian cruise shipper who was taken to Health City Cayman Islands for emergency medical care off the Costa Luminosa cruise ship.

A total of 245 people remain in isolation, according to the statement, at either a government facility or in their homes, as required by the medical officer of health.

2020 has been a challenging year for everyone and our coaches have felt the pressure more than ever before.

Hub life has been good for some, whereas others have struggled. With five clubs having new coaches start this year, we expected the season to be a rollercoaster.

Coaches are the backbone of all 18 football clubs and ranking their performances of the 2020 season was was no easy task.

The pressure come from all angles for some coaches. In Ken Hinkley’s case, it existed because of the status of his contract, while Alastair Clarkson placed huge pressure on himself to deliver year after year.

For Nathan Buckley and Leon Cameron’s world, making the most of a quality list while in the premiership window was the immediate and real pressure.

Some coaches have surprised us while others have made us question their ability to coach and whether or not their careers at their clubs have expired.

Rankings were based off wins and losses, tactics made in games, the ability to handle the season’s bizarre circumstances, expectation vs. performance, team selection and how they have improved the club.

Do you agree with our rankings?

18. Rhyce Shaw – North Melbourne

In May 2019 Shaw was appointed interim head coach of North Melbourne Football Club for the rest on the 2019 season. His success as interim coach saw him sign a senior coach contract.

But his first full season as senior coach has not gone to plan. Shaw hasn’t been able to replicate his wining coaching performances in 2019. The Kangaroos sitting second last on the ladder with three wins and 13 losses and a percentage of 71.3%.

17. Matthew Nicks – Adelaide Crows

Nicks is in his first year at the club as senior coach and his inexperience is showing.

Having been a senior assistant coach at GWS, Nicks came with recent finals experience and understood what it takes to get a team there.

Yet to find his feet at the Crows, Nicks seemly looks out of his depth and the problems he’s faced at the Crows are worst than he thought.

In his first press conference as coach he said “he planned to enhance some of the team’s work around contested ball and the team would embrace the challenge of competing with those at the top end of the competition.”

The Crows went on a 13-game losing streak before managing to win their last three games against Hawthorn, GWS and Carlton.

Adelaide are still sitting last on the ladder but only 5.5% behind 17th place North Melbourne.

16. John Worsfold – Essendon

Woosha now seems like a coach who doesn’t really care. He knows his time will be up at season’s end when Ben Rutten takes over.

His attitude towards the game is reflective of how the Bombers are playing. Inconsistently and with zero hunger to push harder.

The Bombers have won only one game out of their past six matches.

“The first two years (I was) at the club was about … keeping the club alive really,” Worsfold told reporters on Friday.

“It was under a lot of pressure. We had a lot of players we had to support through pretty drastic times.

“And it’s the first year of a new game plan coached by (assistants) Ben Rutten and Blake Caracella.”

15. Alastair Clarkson – Hawthorn

Some may be in shock Clarkson is so low considering he is a four-time premiership coach. However, Hawthorn has the oldest list in the competition yet that experienced never showed in 2020.

When things went dire, Clarko took too long to expose younger players to senior level.

Many have questioned whether he is the right man to take the Hawks to the next premiership or if he is better suited elsewhere.

Clarkson is yet to say that the Hawks are rebuilding but has silenced his critics by blooding young players in recent weeks due to injury. With only four wins on the board, the Hawks are set to get an early first-round draft pick for the second time in 10 years.

Club president Jeff Kennett has come out in support of Clarkson and knows he will get this club back in the premiership window it was once in.

14. Leon Cameron – Greater Western Sydney

No surprise really. After the club made its first AFL grand final appearance last year, the Giants 2020 season has gone from bad to worst.

Like the grand final the Giants haven’t been consistent week-to-week and are yet to find the form they had heading into last year’s finals series.

Cameron’s side has looks confused and at times not hungry enough to push through. Currently sitting 10th on the ladder, the Giants have won eight games and lost the other eight.

Only sitting one game outside the eight, Cameron will need a big win on Friday against the seventh-placed Saints to give them a chance to feature in the finals.

13. John Longmire – Sydney Swans

The Swans have blooded a lot of young talent throughout this year but haven’t managed to get many wins on the board.

They sit in 15th position with one of the biggest injury lists. However, the Swan’ young talent under Longmire’s guidance shows a promising future.

12. Simon Goodwin – Melbourne

Similar to Leon Cameron, Goodwin has had another tremulous year. A good bounce back from their disastrous 2019 campaign, however Goodwin’s game plan has been questioned and isn’t always clear.

Goodwin has come out and said he’s had “nothing but support” from club president Glen Bartlett but admits he’s on notice after scathing public comments in recent months.

“I was employed to lead this footy club with a clear strategy to lead us to our next premiership and I’m still very confident we will be able to do that.”

Melbourne are only a game outside the eight and their finals hopes rest on the last round with a win and other results going their way.

11. David Teague – Carlton

The Teague train continues to roll on. The Blues have surprised many in 2020 and played their football for each other in 2020, looking as unified as they have in years.

After finishing 16th in 2019, a team many thought would show small improvement this year found themselves fighting for a finals place as recently as last round.

This young side has a lot of learning and have come a long way from those years at the bottom of the ladder.

The Blues are out of finals calculations but could finish as high as ninth if other results go their way and they find a way to knock off the Lions in Kade Simpson’s last game for the club.

10. Luke Beveridge – Western Bulldogs

The Western Bulldogs are yet to win against anyone above them but have been hitting their straps in recent times with some strong performances.

Their two-point win over the Eagles shows they have capacity to match it with the best.

Beveridge has backed in some of his young talent and they have shown some real promise of the future.

The Gogs know what it takes to win a premiership against the odds after winning one from seven position back in 2016.

Like many coaches, Beveridge has questioned the rules and how they are being used.

9. Nathan Buckley – Collingwood

Buckley is having an okay year. The Pies are nowhere near their Grand Final form with injuries mounting and other off-field distractions earlier in the season.

With superstars Adam Treloar, Jordan De Goey, Steele Sidebottom and Jeremy Howe going in and out of the side with various injuries the side has been unsettled.

The Collingwood ball movement is not what expected it to be this season. Their efficiency with ball in hand has dropped and they haven’t been able to make a big impact on the scoreboard. This is on Buckley.

Some of the Pies young guns have stepped up which would be pleasing for Bucks as they prepare for their third-straight finals campaign.

8. Stuart Dew – Gold Coast

The Gold Coast continues to take steps forward in improving and some day may be in the finals contention. Despite promising signs early, a post-season appearance wasn’t to be this year.

But with young stars improving game by game they are building something up north. With so much first-round talent in the side the Suns are going places.

A team most predicted would claim the wooden spoon and some even thought would go winless, their performance this season can be considered a major tick.

7. Adam Simpson – West Coast Eagles

The Eagles had a poor start to the 2020 season without getting a win in the Queensland hub. Simpson avoided blaming the hub as a result of the Eagles’ poor start but it definitely was a factor.

Once the Eagles returned home they went on to win every game since.

“It’s hard to measure how different environment affects players and individuals and staff, but I really don’t want to use it as an excuse. I think we came up here to win, so otherwise what is the point of coming here? That has been our attitude and we just haven’t delivered,” he said after the loss to Brisbane.

Concerning for the Eagles is the fact that all finals past week one are set to be played in Queensland. After their recent form playing at the Gabba their finals campaign could end sooner than the hope.

Simpson is a great coach no doubt and injuries have mounted at the wrong time, but his side has not handled this season’s adverse conditions well.

6. Justin Longmuir – Fremantle

You may be shocked at how high we have Justin Longmuir, but he deserves props for the Dockers’ immense improvement in 2020.

Another team many thought would dwindle in the bottom four find themselves in striking distance of the eight.

The new coach has clearly implemented his blueprint from the start and you can see the different style of football they are playing.

Fremantle finished the 2019 season in 13th position and are currently 11th this season but with a new coach it takes time. Finals could be right around the corner. Heck, they weren’t far off the mark at all this year.

5. Brett Ratten – St Kilda

The Saints had a very busy trade period in 2019 and they recruited very well. Bringing in Ratten along with senior experience in the playing group has helped the rising Saints this season.

Their run and carry and forward structure has everyone excited for this team and what they could do.

Ratten’s connection with his players in the hub life shows and as a team they seem united more than ever.

With impressive wins over Port Adelaide and Richmond throughout the season the Saints can match it with the best.

4. Damian Hardwick – Richmond

The dual premiership coach at times this season hasn’t done himself any favours. He’s made some questionable comments to reporters, but it’s all part of the parcel with Dimma.

His team had a poor start to the season, struggled in hub life with several injuries.

They currently sit third with 11 wins, four losses and a draw, and with players slowly coming back from injury the Tigers are starting to hit their stride at the right time.

There’s no denying that Hardwick has handled and managed his team as well as any in 2020 while maintaining their trademark tough game plan.

3. Chris Fagan – Brisbane Lions

Fagan has been a masterstroke that has saved football in Brisbane. Last year everyone was surprised at how well the Lions went after making the finals.

There was a lot of pressure on Fagan to re-create last year’s success, and his Lions currently sits second on the ladder and look very dangerous with finals approaching.

Queensland has been given the finals and the Grand Final will be played at the Gabba, with the the Lions being one of the favourites to win it.

Props to Fagan for leading the Lions to another top four, and potentially top two finish in 2020.

2. Chris Scott – Geelong

Many thought the Cats would take a step backwards this year after being one of the most successful sides of the last decade. Or just scrape into the eight.

But this team just keeps on keeping on and Chris Scott has reenergised this team without leaning or relying on Patrick Dangerfield, Joel Selwood and Gary Ablett Jr.

It’s the spread of contributions that would excite Cats fans so much and the emergence of several stars, currently sitting fourth on the ladder.

“It seems to me when you take a step back to be a more even midfield than we’ve had in the past, but we’ve been working away at that for a long period of time, it hasn’t just happened,” Scott said.

All of this having played just four games at GMHBA Stadium, the supposed only place this team can win. Not bad Chris.

1. Ken Hinkley – Port Adelaide

Port grabbed the hub life challenge and surprised the footy world in 2020.

Behind their leaders Charlie Dixon, Travis Boak and Tom Jonas and the development of their next wave of players, Port find themselves on top of the ladder with a round to play.

Let’s not forget this is a team not many even thought would make the eight.

Hinkley has had the pressure on him for many years and critics said this potentially could’ve been his last year, but with how Port is currently travelling could he be the man to take them all the way.","Matthew Nicks – Adelaide CrowsNicks is in his first year at the club as senior coach and his inexperience is showing.

SPOTT publishes annual assessments for the 100 most significant companies trading in a particular forest commodity, such as timber, rubber, and palm oil. Each company’s policies are scored according to 175 environmental, social, and governance indicators, making the report “the first step in a robust due diligence process for anyone sourcing tropical timber or palm oil to have a clear idea of which companies have a good commitment in place,” said Charlie Hammans, Forestry Technical Advisor at SPOTT.

Companies assessed in the 2020 Timber and Pulp Assessment received an average score across all indicators of 22.6 per cent — up 2.2 per cent from 2019, despite more stringent criteria this year. Companies met an average of just 26.7 per cent of indicators in the deforestation and biodiversity category, but one criterion — commitment to zero conversion of natural forests — was achieved by 56 per cent of firms.

Gap between policy and practice

Around one third of companies had a clear and comprehensive sustainability policy, but just 12 per cent extended that policy to all their suppliers. Only 15 per cent have procedures to trace raw materials to the Forest Management Unit (FMU) of origin.

More than half of companies surveyed said they were committed to respecting the rights of local communities, but only 9 per cent have published procedures for obtaining free, prior informed consent from local communities on all new developments, and only eleven companies provided evidence that they are paying all workers minimum wage.

“Reports like this one help to increase the accountability of the most influential companies and increase the pressure on them to improve their sustainability policies and practices,” said Sarah Rogerson, lead researcher on Global Canopy’s Forest 500 project, who was not involved in the report.

This year is the first way-point towards the important 2014 New York Declaration on Forests’ goal of eliminating natural forest loss by 2030, making it “a pivotal year for tropical forestry,” said Hammans. But “despite the aim to have halved deforestation by 2020, forty companies out of those we researched … still don’t have a robust commitment to reducing deforestation or conversion of natural ecosystems in the supply chains.”

“The latest SPOTT report has highlighted the lack of forest protection in the largest timber and paper companies,” agreed Rogerson. “A key point is also the lack of reporting on implementation or evidence of protection even from those that do have commitments.” Only 12 of the 50 companies with zero deforestation commitments have implemented a system to monitor deforestation, and just nine have published deforestation figures in the last two years.

These results are particularly concerning, says Hammans, because of the importance of tropical forests for biodiversity. Only 46 per cent of firms had clear policies on biodiversity conservation, and “only 13 per cent of the companies we assessed are reporting putting into practice any kind of active management,” such as restoring degraded forests or rivers.

Upping the standards

SPOTT’s 2020 report added new criteria to those used in 2019 to account for practice as well as policy, and offered points for companies that walked “the extra mile of external verification of some of their policies,” said Hammans. For example, companies earned extra points for criteria verified under certification from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).

FSC certification was established in 1994 and by 2020 more than 210 million hectares (roughly 811,000 square miles) of forest worldwide had received the council’s coveted international certification. PEFC’s complementary scheme, established in 1999, has certified almost 320 million hectares (1.2 million square miles) of forest worldwide through endorsement of national certification systems “tailored to the political, economic, social, environmental and cultural realities of the respective countries,” while also meeting internationally-accepted requirements, said Thorsten Arndt, PEFC’s head of communications.

In this year’s SPOTT report, average scores were lower for indicators of practice (19.5 per cent) than policy (25.3 per cent), a somewhat predictable result, given the time it takes to implement policy across tens, or even hundreds, of suppliers and millions of hectares of forestland, plus the fact that some companies may be impeded by a lack of technical capacity and the expense of hiring external consultants.

Not to mention those (hopefully few) nefarious players for whom high-scoring policies are merely a PR exercise. SPOTT’s new criteria for 2020 offer an extra level of detail to understand how the biggest suppliers are conducting themselves around the world.

A key finding: the relationship between large timber companies and their suppliers was one of the weakest areas in this year’s report card. A mere 15 per cent of the 100 large companies have policies to support contracted smallholders, and only 20 per cent said they discuss legal requirements and company policy compliance with their suppliers.

These results are particularly disconcerting, said Ardnt, “given the importance of smallholders in tropical countries in reducing deforestation and forest degradation through sustainable forest management on the one hand, and the importance of forestry for their livelihoods on the other hand.”

Some companies in the SPOTT-light

Despite the challenge of stricter rules, just under half of companies assessed still saw their scores rise relative to 2019. “Companies that have increased despite the changes should be celebrated as making true improvements,” said Rogerson.

For example, Swiss timber company Precious Woods, which manages 1.1 million hectares (around 4,250 square miles) of FSC- and PEFC-certified forest concessions in Amazonas state, Brazil and Ogoouée-Lolo and Haut-Ogooué provinces, Gabon, ranked second in the 2020 SPOTT report with a score of 89 per cent — up 12 per cent from 2019.

“The publication of Precious Woods’ first Sustainability and Transparency Report,” along with better communication of existing practices, were “key to improving our scoring,” according to Markus Pfannkuch, technical consultant at Precious Woods.

The company has a commitment to zero deforestation and an established plan to report it, and has conducted assessments of conservation value, social and environmental impacts. Furthermore, camera-traps have demonstrated that their sustainably-managed forest concessions in Gabon are providing a refuge for local biodiversity, including the elusive African golden cat (Profelis aurata).

Although there is still room for improvement among top-ranking companies, Arndt suggests, “working with currently uncertified companies and getting them to adopt sustainable forest management and sustainable sourcing practices may have a much bigger impact on the ground.”

SPOTT offered companies the opportunity to engage actively in their assessments and consultations with these firms during the process in some cases directly led to proactive improvements in policy and practice, according to Hammans. The positive impact of this engagement is evident in the final scorecards — engaged companies made up 19 out of the 21 highest-scoring firms.

Yet, despite engaging with SPOTT, paper giants Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) and Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Limited (APRIL) saw their scores drop this year, by 4.5 per cent and 10.7 per cent, respectively. This decline was driven, in part, by substantially reduced scores in the deforestation and biodiversity category.

Both companies have been embroiled in controversy for years over their logging concessions in Indonesia, which, despite pledges to improve, have been linked to destructive practices including deforestation, burning and draining high-carbon peatlands, as well as inadequate fire-prevention policies, conflict with local communities and attempts to conceal ownership of the offending concessions.

Engaging in the SPOTT assessments has been “a positive and constructive process for APRIL,” according to Charles Paul Hogan, Head of International Communications at the APRIL Group. “We have welcomed the addition of new indicators and the evolution of the scoring methodology, even though this has affected our rating,” he said. “What’s more important is the way the process has helped us to address the gaps in transparency or fill in gaps in our sustainability policy where these have been identified.”

Hogan added that the company also works with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and professional services network KPMG to conduct environmental impact assessments and review the implementation of APRIL’s sustainability policy commitments.

Asia Pulp & Paper did not respond to Mongabay’s request for comment.

Climate change risk is “optional extra”

The report found that just 12 per cent of the big timber and pulp companies have made time-limited commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and a mere 4 per cent have assessed future climate risk. Hammans explains why: climate change risk assessments are not a requirement for FSC or PEFC certification, so such evaluations are often viewed by companies as an “optional extra.”

Furthermore, the financial incentives to conduct costly environmental, biodiversity and climate assessments, beyond certification requirements, are often lacking.

“Climate change risk assessments are predominantly being pushed by the financial sector,” explained Oliver Cupit, SPOTT’s business and biodiversity manager. The financial sector has a well-established framework for climate change assessments because of the financial risk posed by the impacts of a warming climate, which, understandably, “investors are quite interested and worried about,” he said. However, widespread private financing in the timber sector means “it’s a lot more opaque as an industry to see who’s investing in where.”

Moving toward greater transparency

For consumers wanting to support sustainable wood and paper producers, Cupit accepts that available data “can seem a bit impenetrable… but most people do also have a pension scheme and investments in different organizations,” which can be a good place to start. There are more and more ethical investment options available, he says, but “it can still be quite bamboozling.”

SPOTT’s online platform offers a free tool for investors, asset managers and financial institutions to encourage the companies they invest in to improve their sustainability credentials, so that “consumers almost don’t have to make that decision… because there shouldn’t be an unsustainable or risky product on the shelf,” said Cupit.

“The finance sector can and should play an important role in influencing and supporting companies to improve their practices,” said Rogerson. “Some clear leaders in this sector are appearing.”

For example, the Storebrand Group (SG) — a Norwegian financial services company specialising in long-term savings and insurance — has implemented strict deforestation policies with the companies that they invest in, and SG recently led an international group of investors to meet with Brazil’s Vice President Hamilton Mourão to put pressure on the Brazilian government to take a stricter stance on deforestation and climate change.

Experts say that socioenvironmental government policies — in both producing and importing nations — will be a crucial component required to drive large-scale improvements in sustainability and transparency in timber and paper supply chains.

For example, Hammans believes that initiatives like the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan (which has already signed Voluntary Partnership Agreements with seven countries to control, verify and license timber entering the EU) help “raise the tide” for all timber and pulp companies and are the direction of things to come.

182,https://www.regulationasia.com/a-new-zero-tolerance-era-for-esg-reporting/,"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Regulation Asia,A New Zero Tolerance Era for ESG Reporting,"As nations across the globe come to terms with understanding and tackling climate change, mandatory reporting of such risks across capital markets could well become the norm.

In January, the World Economic Forum published its Global Risks Report 2020, revealing findings from a survey of 750 global experts and decision-makers who were asked to rank their biggest concerns over the next ten years. For the first time in the survey’s history, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood were all environmental.

Accepting our influence over our environment is hardly news. Governments across the globe have been making concerted efforts to mitigate our impact on the environment since the 1980s when we realised we were burning a hole in the ozone layer.

Today, while the environmental impact of climate change has been well documented, the economics are just as dramatic. Cumulative damages could reach a staggering USD 8 trillion by 2050, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

A harder line

Given the heightened urgency of the problem, many nations are now taking a harder line. New Zealand’s government, for example, is aiming to become the first country in the world to compel its financial sector to mandatorily report on climate risks. If passed through Parliament, the newly proposed law will require around 200 organisations to disclose their exposure to climate risk, on a comply-or-explain basis, as early as 2023.

Effectively any bank, credit union, asset manager and insurer with more than NZD 1 billion in AUM, any company with NZX-listed debt or equity, and any overseas incorporated organisation with annual reporting obligations in New Zealand will fall into scope. At the end of 2019, New Zealand’s banking system had total assets of around NZD 574 billion (USD 380 billion), 80 percent of which consists of loans. With banks serving as the primary source of finance for companies in New Zealand, the new mandatory disclosure rules will mean the entire economy will be seen through a climate risk lens.

Establishing what climate risks lie within a financial institution is far from easy. For example, they would need to scale up their ability to estimate flood risk from heavy rain, storms, and sea level rise on residential housing. To New Zealand’s credit, by pinning disclosure to an internationally recognised best practice, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework, institutions will be able to operate on standards that are already understood or, at least, easily accessible.

Shared vision

In fact, many firms across the globe are already volunteering to disclose climate change risk information in line with the TCFD recommendations. By February this year, more than 1,000 global organisations had declared their support for the TCFD, including almost 500 financial firms responsible for assets of USD nearly USD 140 trillion.

Yet, pressure for sovereign nations to follow the path of New Zealand is only likely to increase. According to an IMF report on global financial stability published in April, the development of mandatory disclosure may be necessary to sustain financial stability.

The IMF said: “Given the climatic trends, financial stability authorities have become concerned that the financial system may be underprepared to cope with this potentially large increase in physical risk, as well as with the so-called transition risk resulting from policy, technology, legal, and market changes that occur during the move to a low-carbon economy.”

Acknowledging the lack of reporting infrastructure currently available, the IMF had suggested that in the short-term, mandatory climate risk disclosure could be based on globally agreed principles. In the longer term, climate change risk disclosure standards could be “incorporated into financial statements compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards,” the report said.

The ball is already moving on this. Five organisations that guide most sustainability and integrated reporting very recently announced a shared vision for corporate reporting. The CDP, the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) have committed to working together and engaging with key actors – including IFRS, IOSCO, the European Commission, and the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council – to achieve a single, coherent global set of sustainability reporting standards.

Key ingredient

While there appears to be a healthy shift toward global harmonisation of reporting standards, how financial institutions go about actually integrating ESG and sustainability factors in their business decisions is still highly fragmented, due in part to a lack of very basic definitions (e.g. what is ‘green’?). “The shifting of capital towards the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and a resilient, low carbon economic model cannot happen without better definitions, standards, and transparency,” says Elena Philipova, Global Head of ESG Proposition at Refinitiv.

Currently, there are more than 250 providers of ESG data, including well-known providers with global coverage, such as Refinitiv, as well as highly specialist data providers covering specific verticals, such as real estate. While the role of ESG data providers is vital, different methodologies lead to wide variance in analytics and scores. Institutions using these scores to inform their own analysis need to be mindful of this. As taxonomies and opinions of what should be classified as green or sustainable vary wildly, the struggle is an uphill one.

“I think that the key ingredient that has been missing so far in the mix is the public sector,” Philipova says. “It has the power and the influence to bring clarity to the market and to make standards and disclosure mandatory. This is critical for the urgent task of mainstreaming sustainable finance practices.”

“As we have seen in the last few years, European regulators acknowledge this gap in the market and have taken a leadership role in the sustainable finance agenda, launching the most comprehensive and ambitious plan so far, which includes the development of a common classification schema – the EU Taxonomy.”

Big strides

The EU has indeed made big strides in this area, committing to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. As part of supporting this ambitious goal, a series of equally ambitious policy actions are coming into place.

In a bid to stamp out greenwashing, for instance, the EU-wide classification system defines which economic activities are environmentally sustainable by setting out six environmental objectives and defining specific requirements which must be met. The final taxonomy is expected to be ready by year-end, initially covering two of the six environmental objectives – climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.

The EU is also adopting standardised processes through its Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), under which investment firms and financial advisers will have to disclose how they are integrating sustainability risks in their decision-making and advisory processes, in addition to providing transparency on the extent to which financial products target sustainable investments.

Importantly, SFDR empowers European Supervisory Authorities to develop regulatory technical standards on the content, methodology and presentation of ESG disclosures at the entity and product level, paving the way for greater harmonisation across the EU. Most SFDR provisions will start to apply as early as March 2021, though certain provisions relating to ESG-focused products will apply from 1 January 2022.

A model that works

Institutions located in Asia, but with operations or clients within the EU, will need to assess the impact of and decide how to act on these regulations and deadlines. “The reach of the regulation is much broader than just Europe. Anyone having a license to operate or service financial consumers in Europe are also impacted and they cannot ignore it,” Philipova says.

In addition, Asia-based firms without significant EU exposure will have to consider using the framework to inform their own actions and decision-making. While the regulatory bar set in the EU is high, it is likely to be replicated elsewhere, given that it targets environmental and social challenges that are global in nature.

“The EU framework seeks to meet the same objective that all regulators are trying to solve for – the environmental and social challenges presented to our societies, and the need for resilience against what scientists expect to be a century of great volatility,” Philipova says. “It’s a matter of coming up with a model that works in practice. If the EU action plan and strategy is proven to be a workable solution, the chance of it being adopted more broadly is quite high, as there is so much hunger for clarity in the market.”

Clearly, there are still huge challenges to address around basic definitions, and the consistency and reliability of disclosures, especially in Asia-Pacific. However, the good news is that there is growing consensus on what those challenges are and there is a strong push for international collaboration to solve them.

As we start to tackle these challenges, mandatory reporting of climate and other ESG-related risks could well become the norm.

Medical equipment like disposable suits, hand sanitisers, face masks, respirators for air purification and gloves will be subject to zero-rated value-added tax (VAT) in the UAE. A resolution stipulating this was adopted by the UAE Cabinet on Tuesday to mitigate the repercussions of Covid-19 and support the healthcare sector in the country.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, chaired the meeting at Qasr Al Watan in Abu Dhabi. He hosted virtually a number of teaching staff and students from different schools in the UAE. In a video and photos posted on his social media handles, he can be seen interacting with the students and teachers while they were in their classrooms.

Sheikh Mohammed said the UAE's achievements are based on education. ""Our accomplishments and progress since the foundation of our beloved country started from schools. With education, we shall continue our journey towards the future.""

He stressed that education has always been a top priority. ""The country exerts unwavering efforts to develop the educational system despite all circumstances,"" he said. ""The previous school year is the best example of the strength of our educational system and its ability to continue without interruption in the most difficult circumstances.""

He was referring to the fact that education went online as in-person classes were suspended in March as a precautionary measure against the spread of Covid-19. Physical schooling resumed on August 30 after the summer break.

During the meeting, the cabinet approved a sponsorship policy in the federal government. It identifies the guidelines for accepting sponsorship and donations and ensures that all sponsorships are consistent with the entity's strategic direction, core values and brand attributes. The policy aims to unify the procedures and provide all government entities with underlying principles when cooperating with stakeholders.

The cabinet has also approved a federal law amending some provisions of the law regulating the notary public profession. The new law aims to employ advanced technologies and to conduct all notarisation requests and services remotely.

The cabinet issued a resolution on the implementing regulations of the federal law concerning Medically-Assisted Reproduction. The resolution underlines the objectives of the law, responsibilities of the licensed fertilisation centres, licensing requirements, genetic testing and requirements for gamete handling and storage.

The latest patch to hit Horizon Zero Dawn on PC keeps making progress on graphical glitches and crashes, but there’s still work to be done.

Last week, we got to see the fruits of Guerilla Games' ongoing labor. When Horizon Zero Dawn came out on PC, it was a violent mess of crashes, poor performance, and bizarre graphical glitches, but a diagnostic tool released in update 1.02 allowed the developers to get a handle on all of Horizon Zero Dawn's various issues. Update 1.03 was a smaller patch that fixed snow deformation and Aloy remaining a child forever, while the new update 1.04 takes aim at the game's crashes.

Those that found Horizon Zero Dawn too unstable to play might finally be convinced to give the game another try with update 1.04. There are quite a few crash fixes in this patch, including crashes related to combat, in-game events, and ""WorldData sampling."" There are even more niche-case fixes for a crash that only happened when a user ""would instantly back out when changing sliders in the Settings menu,"" or in the Greetings option in photo mode.

Other crash fixes were related to issues with memory allocation or graphics.

Besides all the crash fixes, patch 1.04 also brings a host of improvements to Horizon Zero Dawn, including a general improvement to CPU performance that will give everyone up to 10% gains in gameplay. Several graphical glitches have been eliminated such as texture pop-in during cutscenes and artifacting in certain weather conditions, and also a bizarre bug that caused Aloy to be ""unable to shoot while being able to do a critical attack near a machine.""

There are still some issues that are still being worked on, such as the ""out of memory"" error during the game optimization step of installation or Anisotropic Filtering just straight-up not working at all. There's also a weird bug with Aloy's hair whenever the frame rate goes above 30 fps. Stay tuned for the next update when Guerrilla Games hopefully gets those issues solved too.

There comes a point in every long-running anime/manga series where the character designs start getting progressively more Extra, and Re:Zero has officially reached it.

This episode introduces some of the other deceased witches: Pride, Wrath, and Gluttony. Even compared to the other members of Re:Zero 's colorful cast, their personalities are larger-than-life to the point where their introductions honestly felt like whiplash. On one hand, we definitely needed a palette cleanser after the murder bunnies from last episode; on the other hand, I can't be the only one who thinks that Daphne's character design goes a teensy bit overboard. An underage-looking girl in a spider-beast bondage coffin? Okay.

I appreciate that this episode was not as dense with the backstory of the witches as I thought it would be. Instead, the focus is on explaining and contextualizing the events happening immediately around Subaru. We gain a little insight into the mechanisms of Return By Death and we learn about how to deal with the rabbits. The larger mysteries in the extended world of Re:Zero are almost certainly tied to the witches and the fate that had befallen them long ago, but this episode gives enough direction for Subaru to go on for now while also maintaining the intrigue.

Speaking of intrigue... What an ending, huh? This episode marks the first time the witch Satella has physically appeared in the world, and it's expertly directed, even by Re:Zero 's standards. The way that scene juxtaposes the shadows with the lonely figure of the witch gave me the shivers and reminded me of the Heaven's Feel arc of Fate/stay night . Even after everything, I can't bring myself to despise Satella, and I think Subaru has mixed feelings about her as well, even as he clenches his fists and declares that he won't let her get away with her meddling. The way Yūsuke Kobayashi delivered that last line was hoarse and angry, but I didn't sense wrath. Even when Satella slinks off towards the mansion, presumably to kill Rem and Petra in her jealousy. Even when it's strongly implied that she took Emilia's body.

Honestly, at this point in the season, I can't begin to imagine how Subaru will get himself out of his current dilemma. There are threats everywhere he turns, and his only allies either possess little fighting power, or are dead in the real world. Doing the trials on Emilia's behalf seems like Subaru's only way forward at this point, but leaving Emilia by the wayside puts a bad taste in the mouth. If previous arcs are anything to go by, then the true solution will involve everyone coming together to help out. That's clearly not happening in this loop, because Roswaal in the post-credits scene literally says, ""Try not to make any mistakes next time."" (This scene also confirms that Roswaal possesses the second book of prophecy and knows about Return By Death.) Intriguing stuff, but for now, this is yet another run where Subaru has to take the L.

As a final, miscellaneous note: The rabbits were identified this episode as the Great Rabbit, one of the Three Great Mabeasts. The Great Rabbit actually appeared in the first Re:Zero Ex novel, although I didn't make that connection until now because it's translated as ""Giant Rabbits"" there. Crusch managed to successfully fend off the Great Rabbit from her domain, which is one of the reasons she's so respected. I don't think Crusch will be coming back this arc to help (besides, she's forgotten about what she did), but that part of her backstory does contextualize the role the Great Rabbit occupies in this world, and proves that Subaru's gruesome end didn't come out of nowhere. It boggles my mind just how relevant those Ex novels are to stuff happening this season, even though they're about characters who haven't appeared at all in this arc.

Blues list boss Nick Austin announced his excitement for the 10 new deals.

“There is enormous belief across our entire football club in the direction we are heading and today’s announcement is further proof of that,” he said in a club statement.

“Murph has been a class player and leader for this football club for well over a decade. For where our list is currently at, it is invaluable to have someone of Murph’s experience, professionalism and knowledge of what it takes to earn a long career at the elite level.

Instead, he has taken his work rate to a new level and that desire and hunger to succeed is infectious across our whole group.

“Sam, Josh and Matthew continue to impress their teammates and coaches with their work rate and desire to improve and get the most out of their development every day and while Nic and Caleb have been limited in their on-field opportunities of late, we know both players have a lot to bring to our backline group moving forward.”","Carlton have re-signed 10 players to new deals, including Marc Murphy, Ed Curnow and Nic Newman.

Canada reported zero Covid-19 deaths in the past 24 hours for the first time since March 15, according to public health agency data released late on Friday.



Canada's death toll from the pandemic stood at 9,163 as of Sept. 11, the same as the number of the deaths reported on Sept. 10, government data showed. The number of positive cases rose by 702 to 135,626 on Sept. 11 from the previous day, the data showed.



With most provinces easing lockdown restrictions and as schools reopen for in-person classes, Canada's infections have seen a mild pick-up in recent days. Authorities have been on high alert to avoid fresh outbreaks, and provinces including British Columbia have imposed new curbs to tackle the spread of the virus.



Still, Canada's situation looks relatively healthy compared to its southern neighbor. Across the border in the United States, more than 190,000 people have died from the pandemic and more than 6.38 million people have been infected.



Canada's experience dealing with SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, helped health officials be better prepared. SARS killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that outbreak in 2002-2003.



Canada's first recorded case of coronavirus was in Toronto, on Jan. 25. Both Ontario, the country's most populous province, and neighboring Quebec turned into the hot spots for COVID-19 infections.



Both provinces struggled with outbreaks in long-term care homes. Canada's first COVID-19 death was reported on March 9 at a British Columbia long-term care facility.



As COVID-19 cases began to spike in mid-March, Canada shut its international borders to all foreign nationals and ramped up tests in an effort to isolate infected patients. Ontario and Alberta faced outbreaks among temporary foreign workers on farms and meat-processing plants, which slowed reopening in certain regions.

In a statement made available to Blueprint Friday, which was signed by the special assistant on Media, Nneka Ikem Anibeze, the Minister, Sadiya Umar Farouq, made this known at the National Food Security Council Meeting held on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, stating that the initiative is being institutionalised as part of the ministry’s response to the challenge of hunger, aggravated by the lockdown.

Hajiya Umar Farouq recalled that the modified National Home Grown School Feeding Programme and Take Home Rations (THRs) ere provided for 127,589 vulnerable households during the lockdown with children in primaries 1 to 3 in public schools in the FCT, Lagos and Ogun states while 164 trucks of food items were also distributed to 36 states and the FCT as palliatives through donations from the Nigerian Custom Service.

Farouq revealed that the zero hunger roundtable is working in agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and some top private sector executives like Tony Elumelu, Tonye Cole as well as Sahel Consulting, IFPRI, IITA, NESG, FAO, IMMAP, ECOWAS and others.

She enumerated data of poor and vulnerable households, strategic partnerships, job creation and impacting the agricultural sector as well as strengthening the food value chain by connecting farmers to markets, increased local production of nutritious food, strengthening strategic food reserves with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and other critical stakeholders as long -term sustainability strategies to achieving Zero Hunger in Nigeria.

Nutrition for Zero Hunger is a global program that is aligned with the second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which seeks to end hunger in all its forms by 2030 and to achieve food security and improved nutrition.

Globally, more than 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to enough nutritious food. The global population continues to grow, with the need for food expected to increase accordingly. Through the Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative, Herbalife Nutrition is working with partners to provide resources, meals and education to help feed those in need.

In support of Herbalife Nutrition nonprofit partners’ critical programs and education campaigns, Nutrition for Zero Hunger to date has:

Made available nearly 700,000 nutritious meals to children and families

Delivered more than 500,000 servings of donated products and 3,500 pounds of food to families in need

Provided 47,000 women with breastfeeding and nutrition education for healthy child development

Provided 40,000 children with essential dietary supplements to reduce nutrient deficiency and support healthy child development

“Herbalife Nutrition’s Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative has been helpful in alleviating hunger, but we have a long way to go in building a world where everyone has access to quality food,” said Alan Hoffman, Executive Vice President, Global Corporate Affairs. “Eradicating hunger will take the combined efforts of governments, non-profits and corporations working together and we will continue working with all interested parties to ensure everyone has access to nutrition.”

The global pandemic is fueling food insecurity and according to a recent report from the United Nations, an additional 132 million people are likely to face food insecurity by the end of 2020. Now more than ever, there is an urgent need to provide at-risk populations with access to healthy, nutritious food.

In its first year, the initiative announced partnerships with global nonprofit partners who are recognized for their impact in addressing world hunger, including Feed the Children, The Hunger Project, Chrysalis, National Hispanic Council on Aging and the Chinese Red Cross Foundation. Through these partnerships, Herbalife Nutrition is working to help take hunger to zero by providing good nutrition and educational resources to communities in need.

InnerView offers paths for students to explore volunteer opportunities, capture service activities, develop skills through impact-driven projects, and demonstrate community impact aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Kroger’s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste youth program with InnerView builds on the success of the 2019-20 school year. During last year’s pilot, nearly 5,000 students in 41 states committed 37,000 hours of service aligned with SDG 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Of these, 960 students earned recognition as Zero Heroes for achieving the highest level of service. These efforts support Kroger’s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan, which aims to end hunger in its communities and eliminate waste across the company by 2025. This year, the program endeavors to engage more students in service activities and awards, plus add topic-focused workshops and a collaborative youth advisory panel.

Kroger highlighted this platform and Zero Heroes in its full 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, which highlights the company’s improved performance on Zero Hunger | Zero Waste and key sustainability commitments.

Through this program, Kroger invites students – whether they experience school in a virtual or classroom environment – to join interactive workshops with subject matter experts and key partners on a range of topics, including hunger relief, food waste, recycling, climate change, fair trade and more. Each program will include virtual or in-community activities as well as an introduction to purpose-driven careers in these categories.

“In a year like no other, we are eager to engage the nation’s impassioned youth in the social issues that COVID-19 has amplified, like food insecurity. Kroger’s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission has never been more critical and relevant, and InnerView’s platform is one way we invite others to join our journey to creating communities free of hunger and waste,” said Keith Dailey, Kroger’s group vice president of corporate affairs and chief social impact officer. “We applaud all Zero Heroes for being part of the solution, and we look forward to connecting even more students with organizations and programs aligned with our mission.”

“2020 will be a moment in time that students never forget. Every aspect of life has been affected by COVID-19, and there has never been a better personal understanding of the connectedness between people, local, and global challenges,” says Kristine Sturgeon, CEO of InnerView. “The start of this school year has been different; however, the most consistent pattern we have seen is the desire for students to continue to take action for their personal beliefs and passions. We are excited for students to work with industry leaders to engage in issues, activities, and volunteerism that aligns with their impact-driven nature.”

This Zero Hunger | Zero Waste engagement program is open to all students ages 14 to 24 in the United States. Awards for this school year take into consideration community service activity from June 1, 2020 through April 15, 2021.

196,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2020-global-hunger-index-one-decade-zero-hunger-linking-health-and-sustainable-food,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,2020 Global Hunger Index: One decade to zero hunger linking health and sustainable food systems - World,"What do we know about the hunger situation worldwide? Has progress been made or are there any setbacks? Using the Global Hunger Index, the global hunger situation can be calculated and assessed.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger and undernutrition at global, regional, and national levels. It is designed to raise awareness and understanding of the fight against hunger, and call attention to those areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and where the need for additional efforts to eliminate hunger is greatest.

Global Hunger Index 2020: Progress and Setbacks

The 2020 GHI shows that while the world has made gradual progress in reducing hunger on a global scale since 2000, this progress has been too slow. Hunger persists in many countries, and in some instances, progress is even being reversed. The global level of hunger and undernutrition is at a moderate level. It has fallen from a GHI score of 29.0 points in 2000 to 18.2 points in 2020. While this is encouraging, hunger persists in many countries, and in some instances, progress is even being reversed.

Of the countries for which data relevant to all four GHI indicators are available, three countries – Chad, Timor-Leste, and Madagascar – suffer from a level of hunger that is alarming (the second highest level on the GHI scale). Based on other known data, alarming hunger levels have also been provisionally identified in another eight countries. Hunger is at serious levels in 31 countries and provisionally categorised as serious in another nine countries. For 14 countries in the moderate, serious or alarming categories, hunger and malnutrition has worsened since 2012 – driven by conflict, poverty, inequality, poor health, and climate change.

On a global level, the prevalence of undernourishment has stagnated since 2015, and the absolute number of people who are undernourished was nearly 690 million in 2020. These levels are greatest in countries in Africa South of the Sahara and South Asia. Even in some countries without hunger crises at the national level, marginalised groups and selected regions face tragically high levels of hunger and undernutrition.

While the 2020 GHI does not yet reflect the impacts of COVID-19, it shows that the situation is already worrying in many contexts and is likely to worsen in the years to come.

Failing Food Systems

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our globalised food systems, their inherent inequities, and their inadequacy to the task of achieving Zero Hunger. This year's report focuses on the threat to human, animal, and environmental health posed by these food systems.

Although the commitment to reach Zero Hunger by 2030 is a fundamental ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals, our hard-won gains are under threat or being reversed. The 2020 GHI shows that multiple countries have higher hunger levels now than in 2012, and approximately 37 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030. Additional countries, for which data were insufficient to calculate 2030 projections, may also fall short of this goal.

Achieving Zero Hunger Means Reshaping Food Systems

“The 2020 GHI findings highlight the food insecurity challenges facing low-income countries as they battle multiple crises,” write Robyn Alders, Osman Dar, Richard Kock, and Francesco Rampa of Chatham House.

The focus of their special essay for the 2020 GHI is on how to make our food systems more resilient to shocks and protect the most vulnerable using an integrated approach to health and food and nutrition security.

""At this crucial moment, we must act to reshape our food systems as fair, healthy, and environmentally friendly in order to address the current crises, prevent other health and food crises from occurring, and chart a path to Zero Hunger by 2030."" Robyn Alders, Osman Dar, Richard Kock, & Francesco Rampa Chatham House

Where are Hunger Levels the Worst?

This year’s GHI shows that many countries still require urgent attention.

Alarming levels of hunger exist in three countries, Chad, Timor-Leste, and Madagascar. Countries with incomplete data are provisionally categorised according to the GHI Severity Scale based on existing data and complementary reports.

According to this, alarming hunger has also been provisionally identified in another eight countries: Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Several of these countries are experiencing unrest or violent conflict, which affects the availability of data as well as the food and nutrition situation in the country. It is quite possible that one or more of these countries would have a higher GHI score than Chad – the country with the highest 2020 GHI score – if sufficient data were available.

It is crucial to strengthen data collection to gain a clearer picture of food and nutrition security in every country so that actions designed to eliminate hunger can be adapted to conditions on the ground.

How is the Global Hunger Index Calculated?

The countries analysed can be categorised according to whether their hunger level is extremely alarming, alarming, serious, moderate or low. The higher the value, the higher the severity of hunger in the country in question.

In 2019, the drought in the country affected more than 400,000 people in 24 municipalities in the south region of the country, leaving the population, especially women, vulnerable to food security, the official stressed.

""All of these challenges are worrying, but the concern must lead us to action. We must transform these challenges into action plans for the labor, technological and financial inclusion of rural women, which include strategies to support their families,"" she underlined.

Barreto said six initiatives in favor of rural women are being implemented by Angolan in partnership with FAO, including agricultural field schools.

Food is the essence of life and the bedrock of our cultures and communities. It can be a powerful means to bring people together to grow, nourish and sustain the planet. The exceptional circumstances we have all been living in through 2020 underscores this — not only does COVID-19 pose a threat to food security and agricultural livelihoods, it compounds the threats already faced by 690 million people around the world. This World Food Day, we — the food agencies of the United Nations (UN) — pledge to work together to end hunger, eradicate food insecurity and achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2.

There is much to be done. While we can all be proud of the progress we have made — for instance, agricultural productivity has improved significantly in recent decades — yet sadly, more than two billion people globally still lack access to sufficient, nutritious and safe food. Projections show that the world is not on track to achieve zero hunger by 2030, or to meet global nutrition targets.

India has gone from being a net importer to a net exporter of food grains. This strength has been evident through the pandemic. Central and State governments were able to distribute around 23 million tonnes from India’s large domestic food grain reserves in three months (April to June) through the Public Distribution System, providing much-needed emergency assistance to families around the country. The government also successfully mobilised food rations for 820 million people from April to November 2020, including finding alternate solutions to provide food rations to 90 million schoolchildren. Throughout the national lockdown imposed in March, there were efforts to remove bottlenecks in the food supply chain due to restrictions on movements, and to ensure that agricultural activities weren’t disrupted. Thanks to these measures, agriculture grew at 3.4% during the first quarter this financial year and the area cultivated this kharif exceeded 110 million hectares. This is a major achievement.

Malnutrition, anaemia

But the focus on food during the COVID-19 containment measures has also brought out the multi-dimensionality of India’s food challenges — not least those centred around malnutrition and climate change. Even as malnutrition in India has notably declined over the past decade, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18 revealed that over 40 million children are chronically malnourished, and more than half of Indian women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. Initiatives such as the Integrated Child Development Services — which provides cooked meals and take-home rations to 100 million children under the age of six, as well as to pregnant and lactating mothers — and the mid-day meal programme, are however stellar examples of how the government is working to fix these challenges.

Climate change continues to be a real and potent threat to agrobiodiversity, which will impact everything from productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems. Though India is dealing innovatively with climate change — for example, through the development of drought and flood tolerant seed varieties, weather-based agricultural advisories, promotion of millets, and small-scale irrigation — this year, we saw how climate-related shocks made it difficult for farmers to deal with pest and locust attacks, as well as floods and cyclones. Intensified food production systems with excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable farming practices cause soil degradation, fast depletion of groundwater table and rapid loss of agro-biodiversity. These challenges multiply with an increase in fragmentation of landholdings. In India, more than 86% farmers have less than two hectares of land contributing around 60% of the total food grain production and over half the country’s fruits and vegetables.

Essay | The global text of hunger

All this points to two undeniable imperatives: the way we produce food must change through agroecology and sustainable production practices in agriculture and allied sectors; and second, we must stop the waste — one-third of the food we produce is wasted. That is why the UN, and our three agencies — the FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organisation), IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and WFP (The World Food Programme) — are committed to working with government, civil society, farmers’ organisations and the private sector to build sustainable food systems.

Supporting India

During the COVID-19-precipitated lockdown, the FAO, IFAD and the WFP worked in close coordination to support the Government of India’s Empowered Group 5 on facilitating supply chain and logistics management, so necessary items such as food and medicines were available. The agencies provided daily updates on the real-time situation on the ground, collating challenges/red flags, dynamic anecdotal data and good practices from their sources in the field. This prompted swift action in terms of resolving bottlenecks and ensured progress on addressing red flag issues.

Profile | World Food Programme, leading the global fight against hunger

What is a food system? It is a framework that includes every aspect of feeding and nourishing people: from growing, harvesting and processing to packaging, transporting, marketing and consuming food. To be sustainable, a food system must provide enough nutritious food for all without compromising feeding future generations.

As countries begin to develop and implement COVID-19 recovery plans, it is also an opportunity to adopt innovative solutions based on scientific evidence so they can build back better and make food systems more resilient and sustainable. Today, with the FAO celebrating 75 years of fighting hunger in over 130 countries, IFAD becoming the first UN agency to receive a credit rating, and the WFP being awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace this year, we are more committed — and better prepared — than ever to together develop solutions with the government, civil society and private sector.

Comment | It’s about food, nutrition and livelihood security

Working in concert

That is why this World Food Day (October 16), we call for global solidarity to help all populations, and especially the most vulnerable, to recover from the crisis, and to make food systems more resilient and robust. Everybody — governments, the private sector, civil society and local communities — has a role to play in transforming our food systems so they can withstand increasing volatility and climate shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and provide decent livelihoods for food chain workers. We must all work in concert to make sure that our food systems nourish a growing population and sustain the planet, together.

Not many students know Waco is a diverse community with a 26% poverty rate. A group of students are working on ways to bridge the gap and help the Waco community.

The Millennium Fellows is a program sponsored by The United Nations Academic Impact and the Millennium Campus Network. A group of at least eight students has to apply together for this semester-long program, and Baylor ended up being one of the universities chosen with a total of 13 members, Shreveport, La., sophomore and co-director of The Millennium Fellows Veronica Penales said.

Penales said they had to choose two sustainable development goals, and they are working on “No poverty” and “Zero hunger.” They will be working with local businesses and nonprofits in Waco to achieve these goals this semester.

“The whole point of this cohort is to create something that’s sustainable,” Penales said. “So we want to have some kind of goal to where we can continue building up on that even … when we graduate. It’s something that can be carried out throughout Baylor’s time.”

Houston sophomore Josefina Echeverria, co-director of The Millennium Fellows, said she was surprised to learn that there such a high poverty rate in Waco.

“Baylor is a pretty wealthy campus, and we could do a lot to help the outer community and even Baylor itself because … 10% of Baylor students are food insecure, which is also barely spoken about here on campus,” Echeverria said.

The Waco community needs Baylor’s help, Boerne sophomore and social media director Addison Knight said.

“On Baylor’s campus, a lot of people haven’t experienced hardship,” Knight said. “Sometimes that can lead people to a very closed-off view, especially when people always talk about the Baylor bubble, because you can go to the ‘Grease Pit’, or you can go to HEB, and you never really have to interact with the Waco community, but it is our community, and I feel that we are deeply responsible for it.”

Echeverria said working to decrease poverty and hunger is important but even more so because it’s happening right next to campus.

“I just hope Baylor encourages the students to take a step to help those in need, especially if they claim themselves as unapologetically Christian,” Echeverria said. “I think it’s super important to define those core values and act on them instead of just talking about it.”

Carmel, Calif., sophomore and recording secretary Liz McRae said The Millennium Fellows are currently working on raising money for The Store, a food pantry on campus, and planning a community garden, so Waco residents and Baylor students can have access to affordable fresh produce.

“It’s my obligation and duty to give back to the community that is basically providing that education,” McRae said. “I’m basically just kind of like, stepping into Waco for four years, and then I’m leaving, and I feel like it wouldn’t be fair for me to take and not give anything back … There’s something I can do and other students can do to.”

Knight said the community garden is one of the initiatives that will be carried on even after The Millennium Fellows program is over at the end of the semester.

“There is a need in Waco for perishable goods — especially just healthy goods in general. That really is the key when fighting poverty and hunger — to ensure that they have access to healthy food,” Knight said.

Echeverria said getting Baylor students to connect with the Waco community is the long term goal.

“After this, we’re not going to stop and move on,” Echeverria said. “We want to build a bridge now that stays for many years to come.”","By Emily Cousins | Staff WriterNot many students know Waco is a diverse community with a 26% poverty rate.

In a world where enough food is produced to feed all of its 7.8 billion inhabitants, the program contends that this issue shouldn’t exist.

Yet the organization’s officials estimate hundreds of millions of people are starving worldwide, which makes their goal to reach zero world hunger by 2030 seem extraordinarily ambitious.

The emergence of the coronavirus — which had killed more than 1.1 million people worldwide and infected more than 44 million as of Thursday — is expected to increase the number of people needing meals by many millions. Without an additional $5 billion in funding, said Steve Taravella, World Food Program senior spokesman, the program will fall short of the world’s needs during the next six months.

“Some people are likely to die simply because we cannot reach them in time,” Taravella said.

The World Food Program, which began in the early 1960s and serves more than 80 countries, relies mainly on international government contributions. Of about $8 billion in funds last year, $3.4 billion came from the U.S.

Here is more information about the World Food Program:

Background

Established in 1961, the World Food Program began as a three-year experiment to distribute food. It served as a global emergency responder and became a permanent part of the United Nations as natural disasters and conflict ensued.

Today, the program is the world’s largest humanitarian agency, with about 18,000 staffers spread around the world. It operates in some of the world’s most war-torn areas, such as Yemen and Syria. It also partners with other local and international organizations to chip away at underlying causes of hunger. It is funded by donations from individuals, corporations and governments, and is governed by an executive board of representatives from 36 countries who set goals, create policy and oversee its activities.

Chad, Liberia, Haiti, Rwanda, Madagascar and North Korea were the countries with the worst chronic hunger from 2017 to 2019, according to the United Nations. Several other countries may fall within that category but did not report their data.

Adapting to COVID-19

The program works with each country’s health protocols without using a top-down approach in pursuing its goal of providing food aid. Its 18,000 field workers collaborate with local officials to determine each community’s specific needs. In coping with the COVID-19 pandemic this year, that has generally meant following social distancing and other precautions advised by many health authorities.

“The basic principles of infection control are the same regardless of location — keeping distant from other people, washing hands frequently, wearing masks to prevent transmission, isolating from others if one has become infected,” Taravella said. “Many settings we work in make that more difficult, but the fundamentals are the same.”

During the pandemic, World Food Program teams, for example, have worked day and night to prepack food for more than a million refugees in northern Uganda, according to a video shared by the program’s Twitter account. Some workers filled empty sacks with a few potfuls of corn buds, while others poured maize oil into empty water bottles. Cups of salt were packaged into brown paper bags. This helped refugees get in and out quicker with their groceries.

There have also been efforts by communities facing severe food needs to help control the spread of the coronavirus. In the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, about 40 women began sewing masks for their community after their clothing business slowed down. The U.N. says these women are being paid for their work by the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Taravella said World Food Program workers are required to take their temperatures daily at the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp. If a fever is detected, workers self-isolate and medical officials provide further guidance. He said at least six workers — three in Yemen and one each stationed in Bangladesh, Sudan and the Dominican Republic — have died this year of COVID-19.

Program’s vision

The World Food Program has identified what it calls five steps to zero hunger:

Put the furthest behind first: “To realize the full potential of our globalized economy, national governments must expand social protection schemes for the most vulnerable.”

Pave the road from farm to market: “We must also improve rural infrastructure, particularly roads, storage and electrification, ensuring farmers’ ability to reach a wider consumer base.”



Reduce food waste: “In developed countries food is often wasted on the plate, while in developing countries it is lost during production, as crops go unused or unprocessed because of poor storage or because the farmers cannot get their goods to market.”

Encourage a sustainable variety of crops: “Today across the globe, four crops (rice, wheat, corn and soy) represent 60% of all calories consumed. Addressing the challenges of climate change, and food availability and food access, will require helping farmers explore and identify a more diverse range of crops.”

Make nutrition a priority, starting with a child’s first 1,000 days: “To prevent stunting and to promote healthy development, we must ensure that children and nursing mothers have access to the required nutritious foods.”



Caitlin Welsh, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Global Food Security Program, said inefficiencies will always afflict mammoth programs such as the World Food Program and noted it should be celebrated for undertaking a “huge challenge,” especially during the pandemic and economic recession.

“It’s the responsibility of local government to curb violence, to come together to address climate change,” Welsh said. “When we don’t see that happening, that’s when the World Food Program comes in.”","Yet the organization’s officials estimate hundreds of millions of people are starving worldwide, which makes their goal to reach zero world hunger by 2030 seem extraordinarily ambitious.
The World Food Program, which began in the early 1960s and serves more than 80 countries, relies mainly on international government contributions.

Introduction

Agriculture and its allied sectors are crucial to the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by 193 countries in 2015, setting targets for 2030 and referred to as Agenda 2030. Source of both food and raw material, agriculture—crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries and forests—traces its beginnings to the birth of human civilisation. It is the world’s biggest employer and the main source of food and income, especially for the extreme poor.[1]A large majority of the population in developing countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America depend on agriculture for their livelihood.

The SDGs are interconnected in many contexts and a link with agriculture is clear for many of them. (See Table 1)

Table 1: Agriculture’s link with SDGs

SDG Link with Agriculture SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms. Everywhere As most of the poor in the developing world are dependent on agriculture, ending poverty is linked to increasing returns from agriculture. Major indicators are ownership and control over land and natural resources, both of which are essential endowments for practicing agriculture. SDG2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Directly related to sustainable agriculture SDG3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Can only be achieved through nutritious food produced via agriculture and allied sectors SDG5: Achieve Gender Equality and empower all women and girls Women play an important but largely unrecognised role in agriculture; their empowerment, decision-making and time for care work are pathways in leveraging agriculture for nutrition SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Increasing water use efficiency across sectors, integrated water resource management, and protection and restoration of water related ecosystems—all have a bearing on agriculture SDG7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Reduction in agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels and consequent pollution SDG8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Agriculture engages a large segment of the working population and consequently has a bearing on the realisation of decent work and economic growth SDG10: Reduce inequality within and among countries Disparity in asset ownership and wages in agriculture activities SDG12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Sustainable management of all natural resources, sustainable production patterns, and reducing food loss and waste SDG13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity of agriculture to the impacts of climate change, and lowering green-house gas emissions without affecting food production SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, reduction of pollution, and sustainable fish harvest. SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss All these are the feedstock for agriculture activities; indiscriminate agriculture expansion has led to decline of forest area and biodiversity loss and overexploitation of land, resulting in degradation.

Authors’ own.

Agriculture as it is practiced today in most parts of the world, is facing multiple challenges: shrinking resource base; overexploitation of land and water resources; and climate change. Further, although agriculture and its allied activities are the most important source of food as well as livelihood for many, and the link of agriculture to nutrition and health is enshrined in the SDGs, the critical contribution of agriculture to nutrition is yet to receive sufficient attention.[2] It is increasingly being recognised that reforms in agriculture are crucial to harness its potential in helping realise the SDGs. Humankind in the anthropocene era finds itself in a situation where “…agriculture and food systems are characterized by a failure to deliver food security for all, as illustrated for example by the effects of the present price volatility, which is severely restricting access to food for the poor, while simultaneously placing an increased strain on the environment.”[3] This brief draws on examples from India to examine aspects related to current practices of agriculture and their impact. It outlines the nature of change required, in order to transform agriculture into a key driver of fulfilling the SDGs.

Contemporary Agriculture: Key Challenges

Agriculture is seen as central to the challenges facing humankind in the anthropocene era, in terms of being a key driver of global environmental change. Agriculture and food production has impacts on land degradation, deforestation, loss of habitat and biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, and contamination of air, soil and water.[4],[5] Improvements in technology and productivity have led to increased production of food for a burgeoning population. However, this has come with a huge cost as shrinking traditional agriculture vis-à-vis intensive commercial farming, and expanding industrial production have led to the exploitation of available limited natural resources. The progress has often come with social and environmental costs which include land degradation, decreasing water tables, loss in biodiversity, and high emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG). The productive potential of the world’s natural resources base has been compromised, affecting the future fertility of the planet.[6] Indeed, globally, production patterns supporting prevalent dietary patterns are responsible for anywhere from 21–37 percent of total GHG emissions.[7]

The use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture causes chemical pollution of the ecosystem—such contamination may in turn lead to health consequences.[8],[9] These practices, compounded by the growing competition for land, water and energy, affect the capacity for future sustainable healthy food production.[10],[11],[12] In India, for instance, 147 million hectares (Mha) of a total land area of 329 Mha has degraded soil or has water-related issues such as dwindling surface water and unregulated groundwater extraction. Deteriorating air quality has also emerged as a major threat to human life.[13] With declining agricultural land, growing populations, increasing pressure on water and energy resources, and soaring climate variability, South Asia and other parts of the world, are facing the challenge of producing food for an increasing population—food that is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable, given the same or less resources.

Apart from the decreasing water table, farmers are directly affected by floods, droughts, rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, crop diseases and pests such as locusts. As a consequence of climate change, sea levels have risen and low-lying coastal areas are being swamped with saltwater that increases soil salinity. These salts can be dissipated by rainfall, but climate change is also increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, leading to higher use of groundwater for drinking and irrigation. This further depletes the water table and allows even more salt to seep into soil.[14]

A large, multi-site global analysis in 2014 tested the effects of rising carbon dioxide (CO 2) on zinc, iron, and protein levels in staple crops, viz. rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, field peas, and sorghum. It was found that increases in CO 2 were associated with a decrease in the range of 3 to 17 percent in protein, iron and zinc in the tested crops.[15] Researchers then examined the effect of reduced nutrient level in staple crops on human nutrition and found that projected increases in CO 2 levels could cause 175 million people (1.9 percent) to become deficient in zinc, and an additional 122 million people (1.3 percent) to become deficient in protein. With regard to iron, 1.4 billion women of child-bearing age and young children (representing 57 percent of these groups) would be at high risk for iron deficiency. This is a matter of serious concern and calls for future research to focus on breeding CO 2 tolerant crop strains, biofortification and supplementation to address nutrition deficiencies.[16]

Loss of biodiversity is another threat to agriculture, globally. Currently, only 30 crops provide 95 percent of human food-energy needs. Of these, only five– rice, wheat, maize, millet and sorghum—account for about 60 percent. Five animal species – cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chicken –account for about one-third of average daily protein consumed. This narrowing down of the food basket increases the vulnerability of agriculture and food systems and puts food security and nutrition at risk, as the natural resource base and ecosystem services are the foundation of food and agricultural systems.[17]Genetic diversity helps species adapt to changing environment conditions and confers resistance against various stress conditions. The loss of this diversity reduces the feedstock for coping with environmental challenges like increasing salinisation of soil and extreme weather conditions like drought and floods. In his commentary, Swaminathan links the Irish potato famine in the 1840s to the loss of genetic diversity and emphasises the need to “promote genetic heterogeneity.” [18]

In India, researchers are calling attention to the consequences of food being “increasingly being produced in intensive industrial settings.”[19] This includes (mis)use of antibiotics in animals and birds grown for consumption, to promote faster growth and prevent disease. The gut bacteria in the animal or bird becomes resistant and spreads through food, contact and waste, besides antibiotic residues in food and unmetabolised antibiotics in faeces. Further, increasing monoculture and loss of genetic diversity may be help viruses amplify and attain higher virulence, and lead to infectious zoonotic diseases in humans.[20]

The current imperative is to find means of producing enough and enabling everyone to have access to healthy diets without overexploiting the earth’s resources. “Therefore in the Anthropocene, humanity faces the imperative question of how to transform agriculture that feeds the world, contributes to eradicate poverty, and contributes to a stable planet.”[21]

Recommendations

At one level, humankind is still trying to grasp the severity of impact of overexploitation of natural resources in order to produce more. It is clear that prevalent high-input, resource-intensive farming systems which have led to exploitation and degradation of natural resources cannot lead to sustainability of the food systems.[22]

There is evidence, however, in pockets across the globe of various initiatives and innovations that demonstrate how things can be done differently to address or avoid these problems. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN (FAO), sustainable food and agriculture practices if adopted and practiced in the right manner, have the potential to help achieve the SDGs.[23] The following paragraphs highlight a few of the plausible innovations for reforming agriculture.

Some of the most commonly proffered recommendations for building climate resilience in agriculture include water and energy-saving irrigation, conservation agriculture, controlled environment farming, livestock grazing management, energy-efficient cold storage, and biogas production.[24]In the context of rising sea levels, in particular, India has demonstrated the potential of Joint Mangrove Management (JMM) for widespread adoption and replication(See Box 1).

Box 1: Joint Mangrove Management and sustainable fish farming

The Integrated Mangrove Restoration Programme along the Coromandel coast of India led by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) has restored over 1,500 ha of degraded mangrove wetlands over the period 1999 to 2002. Further, the Joint Mangrove Management (JMM) programme has brought together about 10,000 mangrove user families covering almost 20,000 ha of mangrove forests for restoration. The programme proved crucial especially in the aftermath of the massive Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, because mangroves serve as a buffer against such extreme events. The JMM had a two-fold objective: to restore the mangrove forests, and to ensure the participation of the local communities. The National Mangrove Action Plan of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, has cited the JMM as the best available model for mangrove management. It can be adapted widely to help overcome the challenges of sea level rise and other climate change-induced disaster events. The MSSRF also promotes Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming System (IMFFS) in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, under which mangrove plantation and aquaculture are combined. Here, the promotion of traditional canal fishing in the midst of mangrove plantation, has resulted in healthy and high harvest of fish with low external inputs. This model has demonstrated the successful culturing of sea bass, milk fish, mullet, crab and prawn, and provides a tangible option of coastal aquaculture as a source of sustainable livelihood. The pilot model covering an approximate area of 20 hectares has shown potential of generating income between INR 15,000 to 30,000 from the fish ponds within four months of operation. The set-up requires limited energy to operate, and does not use artificial feed—these result in reduced input cost and less environmental pollution. Source: MSSRF [25],[26]

There are production processes that are more efficient in promoting sustainability and should be encouraged. For instance, crop rotation where short variety leguminous crops are planted after harvest, increase the nitrogen content of the soil and make it more productive; crop waste or animal waste can be used as manure and has the potential to improve soil health; collection of rainwater via channeling and use of renewable sources of energy encourages resource-use efficiency. There are also technological innovations like hydroponic (plants grown in nutrient-rich solutions), aquaponic (using water and fish waste), and aeroponic (nutrient-rich water is sprayed onto—in air—dangling roots) techniques, for growing crops without soil.[27]

In northwest India, which was the heartland of the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, groundwater has been overexploited due to the extensive use of the rice-wheat cropping system. A study observed that improved technologies which do not require deep drainage are being adopted.[28] The benefits associated with this include less energy consumption to pump groundwater, less nutrient loss by leaching, and no groundwater pollution. Laser land leveling, alternate wetting and drying water management in rice, delayed rice transplanting, shorter duration rice varieties, zero till wheat, raised beds, and replacing rice with other crops are other practices that can help in efficient water use. Another study suggests replacing subsidy for inputs like electricity to operate tubewells, with support for output (i.e. increase in procurement price or bonus on agricultural marketable produce), would encourage farmers to use irrigation water more efficiently.[29] This is because large-scale cultivation of rice and its early transplantation in June, before the monsoon, facilitated by regular subsidised supply of electric power to tubewells may be key to the fall of Punjab’s water table.

Yet another study in India, using a process-based crop water model and data on food production and nutrient content to understand whether various crop shifting scenarios had any impact on consumptive water demand and nutrient production, found that historical growth in wheat production during the rabi (non-monsoon) season was the main driver of the country’s increased consumptive irrigation water demand and that rice is the least water-efficient cereal for the production of some of the key nutrients—iron, zinc, and fiber.[30] By replacing rice areas in each district with alternative cereals (maize, finger millet, pearl millet, sorghum) with the lowest irrigation (blue) water footprint, it will be possible to reduce irrigation or water demand by 33 percent and improve the production of protein (+1%), iron (+27%), and zinc (+13%) with only a modest reduction in calories. There is also evidence of pulses and millets being climate-smart crops, i.e., they can be grown in regions without proper irrigation.[31] They are also more nutrient-dense crops, when compared to rice.

Speaking of leveraging agriculture for nutrition, it was only towards the end of the last century that the role of agriculture in promoting better nutrition outcomes and health started getting discussed in international discourse.[32] Agriculture and its linkages to nutrition are crucial to realise SDG1 to end poverty, and SDG2 which focuses on sustainable agriculture, achieving zero hunger, and ending malnutrition in all its forms. Focus is required at different levels: increasing awareness in the population on the importance of producing and consuming nutrient-rich crops; providing support and incentives to produce nutrient-rich crops such as millets and pulses; and promoting self-consumption by growing vegetables and fruits in home gardens and on common land, whose produce can be used for consumption. There is evidence from various studies that agriculture and production diversity promotes dietary diversity, and efforts that encourage farmers to diversify their crop portfolios will help in improving diet quality. [33],[34],[35]

The imperative is for agriculture policies and programmes to move beyond its traditional focus on production and productivity, and instead mainstream the nutrition dimension. M S Swaminathan advocates an approach called ‘farming system for nutrition’ (FSN), defined as: “The introduction of agricultural remedies to the nutritional maladies prevailing in an area through mainstreaming nutritional criteria in the selection of the components of a farming system involving crops, farm animals and wherever feasible, fish.”[36]The FSN approach comprises a combination of location-specific measures including advanced crop production practices, bio-fortification, and promotion of kitchen (nutrition) gardens of fruits and vegetables, livestock and poultry development, setting up of small-scale fisheries, combined with nutrition awareness. It is an inclusive location-specific approach based on the resource endowments to address the nutritional needs of smallholder farm families, who constitute the majority of farmers. (See Box 2)

Box 2: A Farming System for Nutrition Approach

MSSRF led a study from 2013 to 2017 to examine the feasibility of a Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) approach to address undernutrition, in a cluster of villages in Koraput, Odisha and Wardha, Maharashtra, under a research programme on Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA). Both regions are characterised by small and marginal land holdings and rain-fed farming. Baseline survey revealed high levels of undernutrition and lack of dietary diversity.[37] The FSN design developed in discussion with the community focused on increasing the production and availability of nutrient-dense crops like millets and pulses; promoting nutrition gardens of fruits and all three groups of vegetables based on a seasonal calendar, at household level, on common land; and setting up demonstrations in schools, increasing access to animal foods (fishery in Koraput and poultry in Wardha) and nutrition awareness across the board. The viability of recommended crops, varieties and practices in terms of economic returns was demonstrated through on-farm trials, along the lines discussed for the case of finger millet.[38] Nutrition awareness was integral to the approach and an important aspect of this was building the capacity of members of the community to be community nutrition champions or ‘community hunger fighters (CHF)’. Using participatory action research methods, selected community representatives, both men and women, were facilitated through a process of action and reflection to help them identify, prioritise and take action to address the issues related to the importance of balanced diet and dietary diversity, food availability and sourcing of food, good dietary practices, food, nutrition and care during different stages in the life cycle.

An endline survey in late 2017 revealed increase in availability and consumption of finger millet, pulses and vegetables by households, a greater proportion of households consuming more than 70 percent of recommended allowance of all food groups, and an improvement in household dietary diversity. [39],[40]

Conclusion

It is increasingly become clear that a ‘business as usual’ approach is no longer an option if the targets set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are to be met, specifically those related to food and agriculture.

It is clear that reforms are required in the practice of agriculture. Drawing on examples from India, this brief has outlined some of the practices that have been demonstrated as means to transform the sector, arrest the overexploitation of scarce resources, and nurture sustainability.

The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a food emergency and the number of people who are food and nutrition insecure is expected to further rise in the coming years.[41] Indeed, the pandemic has exposed the fragility of current global interconnections. Given existing gaps in the health sector of the economy, supply-side issues, and prevailing inequalities, the pandemic has led to an immediate failure of desired goals under SDGs 1, 2 and 3, for millions of people who were already food-insecure, to begin with, or were rendered jobless and therefore without means to take care of their health and nutrition. In India, the breakdown of the supply chain during the initial period of the lockdown caused massive wastage of perishable foods that could have fed many.[42] Further, there were numerous lay-offs, pay cuts apart from lack of work with a complete freezing of construction activities leading to job losses for workers in the informal sector. Not only did many migrants have to walk back to their hometowns, there was no assurance of their next meal at this time. COVID-19 has aggravated the situation of large populations who were already vulnerable before the pandemic; their numbers have increased.[43],[44]

While the 2030 Agenda was already difficult to achieve even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic—with many nations like India falling behind targets—the health crisis has exacerbated the situation.

Drawing on available evidence and examples from across the world, the FAO has listed 20 integrated and interconnected actions knitting together the many dimensions of agriculture and rural development, that may be seen as comprehensively laying the foundation for resilient and sustainable societies and achieving the SDGs. [45] (See Box 3)

Box 3. FAO Recommendations for Agriculture and Rural Development

Facilitate access to productive resources, finance and services; Connect smallholders to markets Encourage diversification of production and income; Build producers’ knowledge and develop their capacities; Enhance soil health and restore land; Protect water and manage scarcity; Mainstream biodiversity conservation and protect ecosystem functions; Reduce losses, encourage reuse and recycle, and promote sustainable consumption; Empower people and fight inequalities; Promote secure tenure rights; Use social protection tools to enhance productivity and income; Improve nutrition and promote balanced diets; Prevent and protect against shocks: enhance resilience; Prepare for and respond to shocks; Address and adapt to climate change; Strengthen ecosystem resilience; Enhance policy dialogue and coordination; Strengthen innovation systems; Adapt and improve investment and finance; Strengthen the enabling environment and reform the institutional framework.

Going forward, the Food Systems Summit to be convened by the United Nations in 2021 will be an opportune time for participating member nations from across the globe to commit to the required reforms in agriculture. The period leading to it must be used by nations to rethink strategies and initiate measures to change and work for the building of resilient and sustainable communities, beginning with the transitions required in agriculture. Replicating and upscaling sustainable agriculture practices and models from across the globe will be a good first step.

Herbalife Nutrition is commemorating the first year of its Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative and sharing the results in advance of World Food Day.

Nutrition for Zero Hunger is a global program that is aligned with the second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which seeks to end hunger in all its forms by 2030 and to achieve food security and improved nutrition.

Globally, more than 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to enough nutritious food. The global population continues to grow, with the need for food expected to increase accordingly. Through the Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative, Herbalife Nutrition is working with partners to provide resources, meals and education to help feed those in need.

In support of Herbalife Nutrition nonprofit partners’ critical programs and education campaigns, Nutrition for Zero Hunger to date has:

Made available nearly 700,000 nutritious meals to children and families

Delivered more than 500,000 servings of donated products and 3,500 pounds of food to families in need

Provided 47,000 women with breastfeeding and nutrition education for healthy child development

Provided 40,000 children with essential dietary supplements to reduce nutrient deficiency and support healthy child development

“Herbalife Nutrition’s Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative has been helpful in alleviating hunger, but we have a long way to go in building a world where everyone has access to quality food,” said Alan Hoffman, executive vice president, Global Corporate Affairs. “Eradicating hunger will take the combined efforts of governments, non-profits and corporations working together and we will continue working with all interested parties to ensure everyone has access to nutrition.”

The global pandemic is fueling food insecurity and according to a recent report from the United Nations, an additional 132 million people are likely to face food insecurity by the end of 2020. Now more than ever, there is an urgent need to provide at-risk populations with access to healthy, nutritious food.

In its first year, the initiative announced partnerships with global nonprofit partners who are recognized for their impact in addressing world hunger, including Feed the Children, The Hunger Project, Chrysalis, National Hispanic Council on Aging and the Chinese Red Cross Foundation. Through these partnerships, Herbalife Nutrition is working to help take hunger to zero by providing good nutrition and educational resources to communities in need.","BY DSNstaff | October 16, 2020Herbalife Nutrition is commemorating the first year of its Nutrition for Zero Hunger initiative and sharing the results in advance of World Food Day.

Cabinet Secretary and head of Task Force (TF) Zero Hunger Karlo Nograles said the goal of the National Food Policy (NFP) is to end hunger in the Philippines ""within this generation’s lifetimes"".

Aside from the NFP, Nograles also led the virtual launch of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Food Security and Nutrition (FSN) Roadmap.

“The President (Rodrigo Duterte), by issuing Executive Order No. 101, acknowledged that there is a need to carefully coordinate, rationalize, monitor, and assess the efforts of involved government agencies to ensure not only a whole-of-nation approach but a whole-of-society collaboration in eradicating hunger and achieving food security,” Nograles said.

He said the two initiatives underscore the government’s commitment in addressing involuntary hunger, food security, undernutrition, child wasting, stunting, and mortality –– concerns that the President had prioritized even before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.

The NFP includes initiatives for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

It states six key result areas including: (1) To review and rationalize existing policies, rules, and regulations related to the Zero Hunger efforts of government; (2) To ensure available and affordable food; (3) To secure nutrition adequacy; (4) To secure food accessibility and safety; (5) To ensure sustainable food systems, resiliency and food stability during emergencies; and (6) To ensure information, education, awareness, and people participation.

Serving as a catalyst to consolidate and harmonize efforts of the government to end hunger, the NFP shall constantly evolve to respond to the constant changes and needs of the times, Nograles envisions.

The BARMM FSN Roadmap, for its part, seeks to “achieve a sustainable, competitive, and accessible food supply chain for Bangsamoro; a balance intake of Halal food; and an adaptive capacity of its communities, which shall guide BARMM in paving the way for self-reliance, food security and resiliency”.

In the recent Global Hunger Index, the country ranked 70th out of 117 countries at a level of hunger classified as serious.

From 1990 to 2015, Filipinos have been experiencing serious levels of hunger, and while the nation’s scores and ratings have improved through the years, the country is still confronted by serious levels of hunger, the Palace official said.

It is a problem, Nograles said, that has been greatly compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic. A recent survey revealed that an estimated 7.6 million families reported involuntary hunger amid the ongoing pandemic.

The hunger incidence in September also saw a 9.8 point increase from the 20.9 percent level, or an estimated 5.2 million families, in July.

Given this, fighting hunger, Nograles stressed, is a “moral imperative, isang hudyat sa ating pagkakakilanlan bilang isang bansa.”

“Hindi lamang sa mga kasama kong naglilingkod sa pamahalaan, nakaatang ito sa ating balikat –– tayong lahat na kumilos at pagsikapang tumugon ng may determinasyon upang maagang dumating ang araw na wala ni isang Pilipino ang muling kakalam ang sikmura ([The fight against hunger] is not just for us in the government -- all of us should help in resolving this with determination so in the future, no more Filipino should be hungry),"" he said.

207,https://foodtank.com/news/2020/10/net-zero-emissions-future-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-offers-jobs/,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Food Tank,Net-Zero Emissions Future in Latin America and the Caribbean Offers Jobs – Food Tank,"A recently published report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) looks at the impact of a net-zero economy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The report, “Jobs in a net-zero emissions future in Latin America and the Caribbean,” finds that transitioning LAC to net-zero emissions has the potential to create 19 million net jobs in plant-based agriculture by 2030.

According to a previous study by the ILO, LAC will lose 2.5 million jobs from heat stress alone by 2030. Additionally, the IDB estimates that by 2050, climate change will cost the region US$110 billion annually.

The current economic system “locks societies into a high-carbon pathway [making] us more vulnerable to future climate change risks, including health crises,” Adrien Vogt-Schilb, Senior Economist at the IDB and co-author of the report, tells Food Tank. He explains that if LAC countries do not address these problems now, it will become costlier to reverse and reduce emissions later.

The report notes that over time, the transition will result in a loss of 7.5 million jobs in fossil fuel electricity, fossil fuel extraction, and animal-based food production, but create 22.5 million jobs in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, forestry, solar and wind power, manufacturing, and construction

The report outlines five pillars to achieve a decarbonized economy in LAC by 2050. It calls on the region to do the following: replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, utilize electricity for transportation, cooking and heating, expand public transportation, preserve natural carbon sinks, and reduce waste in all sectors.

According to the report, a decarbonization agenda would require a transition to sustainable plant-based agriculture. If governments create policies in consultation with farmers, there is an opportunity to improve the livelihoods and productivity of small farmers, Vogt-Schilb explains.

The report suggests governments can regulate and direct investments to help small farmers switch to high value-added crops, connect them with better infrastructure to domestic and global markets, make sure they benefit from insurance products, and incentivize farming that provides income diversification.

“A significant part of rural poverty is associated with a lack of economic opportunities,” Vogt-Schilb tells Food Tank. He continues, growth in smaller parts of the economy can provide more employment for people who live and work on small-scale farms in developing countries.

Despite these prospects, researchers found that 80 percent of jobs created would be in male-dominated sectors. The report suggests implementing new government policies that will help women and Indigenous communities to contribute to a more equitable and diverse workforce.

“Women frequently work in agriculture as family members and are thus more likely to be unpaid, or [women’s] contribution to the sector is underreported,” Ana Belen Sanchez, Green Jobs Specialist for LAC at ILO, tells Food Tank.

To provide equitable agriculture job opportunities for women in a net-zero future, Sanchez says that “giving women a voice in the decision process, at the local level and for the national strategy, is essential.”

Furthermore, the report emphasizes including Indigenous groups in the decarbonization strategy. ILO and IDB researchers highlight that inclusive and effective climate change policies must address all impacted communities.

“I hope that countries can be inspired into seeing long-term decarbonization as an economic opportunity and use that end goal as a compass – in discussion with all stakeholders,” Vogt-Schilb tells Food Tank. “Co-construction is key to ensure all sustainable development goals are considered and that challenges on the road are identified and addressed.”

208,https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/slcpd-to-undergo-zero-budget-exercise-in-response-to-protests,"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",fox13now.com,SLCPD to undergo 'zero-based budget' exercise in response to protests,"SALT LAKE CITY — The Salt Lake City Council will conduct a budgeting exercise slashing the police department's funding to zero and building from there.

It is in response to ongoing protests against racism and police brutality with calls to ""defund the police,"" Council Chairman Chris Wharton acknowledged.

""It’s in response to all the calls for reform and increased transparency that we’ve seen in Salt Lake City and across the country,"" he told FOX 13.

The exercise will not actually ""defund the police,"" but will use an auditor to run budget scenarios where the police department's funding is taken to zero dollars and costs are added on for officer salaries, patrol cars, equipment, etc. Plans for the activity were announced in July, but have accelerated in recent days.

In a typical city budgeting process, the Salt Lake City Police Department comes to the council with requests for increases or decreases in funding based on the previous year's numbers. For the most recent budget year, the police department's budget was nearly $80 million.

""The idea is with that we’ll have a much greater understanding of how the police expenditures align with what our goals are for Salt Lake City and with the expectation of residents for more transparency and accountability,"" Wharton said.

Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said he would willingly participate.

""In the spirit of being open and transparent, we look forward to working with the Commission on our budget and believe going through the exercise of doing a zero-based budget will be both informative and constructive,"" he told FOX 13 in a statement.

Advocates for slashing police funding were thrilled at the idea. For months now, council members have been inundated with demands that police funding be reduced and reforms be instituted.

""I love this so much,"" said Lex Scott, the founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""The fact that the city council is hearing our voices.""

She praised Wharton for instituting the budget exercise and said she hoped it would have real-world implications come next budget year. She said the council can now look at why exactly Salt Lake City Police have purchased military-grade gear.

""The police have been using the city council as their personal piggy bank since they’ve existed. We need to track the funding and make sure that it’s allocated to the right places. They shouldn’t have an MRAP (mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle). They shouldn’t have a tank. They shouldn’t update their riot gear every year,"" she said in an interview Monday with FOX 13.

Instead, Scott said she would like to see taxpayer dollars go to fund more body cameras for officers, less-than-lethal weaponry and social services.

Acknowledging the zero-based budgeting exercise could lead to changes with the police department, Wharton said they will look at where taxpayer money goes and whether it's a wise investment.

""We’re not going to take money from the police and just spend it on parks or something like that. We’re going to take that money that’s already earmarked for public safety, but it may go to like a crisis intervention team or co-responders, like social services, social workers and things like that,"" he said. ""Or it may go towards programs that prevent crime from happening rather than dealing with crime after the fact.""

The city council is soliciting public comment on the zero-based budgeting exercise until Oct. 9. Residents can submit comments here. Municipal budgeting typically begins in March. Under Utah law, cities must pass a balanced budget by the end of June.","SALT LAKE CITY — The Salt Lake City Council will conduct a budgeting exercise slashing the police department's funding to zero and building from there.

209,https://www.innovatorsmag.com/procurement-key-to-zero-emissions-goal/,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Innovators Magazine,Procurement key to zero-emissions goal,"Bonn, Germany – Cities around the world have committed to leveraging their purchasing power to reduce carbon emissions. They made the pledge at Daring Cities – the global virtual forum for urban leaders boldly tackling the climate emergency.

In three action-oriented sessions organized by ICLEI’s Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement, participants from over 45 countries engaged online to explore how public buyers can navigate the race to zero-emissions in an environment where ‘lowest-price’ still is the deciding factor.

Procurement accounts for 12% of GDP in OECD countries, and up to 20% in many developing countries. Two-thirds of that is spent at sub-national level. At the same time, local and regional governments around the globe are at the frontline of dealing with the climate emergency through local climate action. They engage as they are at the forefront of dealing with the impacts of climate change, which they already experience and they are closest to communities. Increasingly we see that subnational governments commit to the necessary ambitious targets towards climate neutrality, including operating at 100% renewables or aiming for zero emission construction sites. These targets can be achieved by adopting sustainable procurement as a tool.

“If climate is the problem, procurement is the solution. Mark Hidson, Global Director of ICLEIs Capacity Center.

Mark Hidson, Deputy Regional Direction, Global Director of ICLEIs Capacity Center says procurement is a key front in tackling the climate crisis. “It is a mechanism that is already in place within public authorities. It is essential to use it,” he said.

Paulo Magina, Head Public Procurement, Infrastructure and Public Procurement Division, OECD, emphasised that procurement is an administrative process. 90% of OECD countries have included green procurement in their policy making – recognising that sustainability policy priorities can be achieved through procurement.

“We need to mainstream procurement practice that connects its administrative function with the impact the function has for citizens, for their well-being,” added Magina.

From reducing emissions to bolstering the green recovery and improving the equity of food systems, members of the Global Lead City Network on Sustainable Procurement (GLCN) are using procurement to meet climate and sustainability goals and improve systems and quality of life for their residents.

How?

The City of Cape Town, South Africa, has adopted a number of successful green procurement projects and practices in its operations. The GLCN member city recently finalised a Green Procurement Action Plan, in development since 2016, which seeks to give effect to the City’s commitment to green procurement and seeks to consolidate and mainstream the implementation of green procurement in the City.

The City of Pittsburgh, USA, the newest member of the GLCN, is using procurement to reach important goals for 2030, such as their goal of operating the entire city with 100% renewable energy. Moving away from fossil-fuels is a key objective for Mayor William Peduto: “Our future does not have to be connected to our past.” The city uses procurement to build new industry as well as to develop local workforce, helping companies and communities in the region to transition to the 21st century. “Procurement gives cities the opportunities to lead and to build the type of world that we all want to live in,” added Mayor Peduto.

The City of Oslo, Norway, uses procurement strategically to reach climate goals aligned with the Paris agreement and the SDGs. In 2017, Oslo adopted a new procurement strategy which is based on the premise that all purchasing decisions have to contribute to the goal of becoming an emission free city. With €3 billion of annual spending on goods, services and constructions works – this is leverage. In addition, Oslo’s climate strategy outlines targets that related to procurement action. For example, the city created a climate budget that is fully integrated with the financial budget and that keeps track of how many emissions are impacted by which measures. “In Oslo we believe that emission reductions are not to be implemented somewhere else, another time or by someone else. We want to take responsibility now and our goal is to reduce emissions by 95% by 2030,” said Espen Nicolaysen, Head of Section Public Procurement, City of Oslo.

The Western Cape Government in South Africa, has launched a ‘Green is Smart’ strategy through which it aims to become the lowest carbon region and a green economy leader. Francini van Staden, Department of Environment Affairs and Development Planning, Western Cape Government, outlined that for cities and regions with a limited budget, and ambitious climate goals, procuring resource efficient infrastructure must have a life-cycle perspective. “We can no longer separate the economic, environmental and social component,” said van Staden. Embedding of sustainable procurement is not the responsibility of a single service provider or one tender, but can only happen through strategic thinking, needs assessment, and political support to include a life-cycle perspective.

Helsinki, Finland, another member of GLCN, aims to be carbon neutral by 2035 and reduce direct carbon emissions by 80%. To achieve this ambitious goal, the city leverages procurement as a key mechanism. “If the market is not ready yet, collaboration between public buyers at different levels of government is key. Because if only Helsinki is asking for specific machinery, it will negatively affect the offers we can get for the tenders. So communication with the market and others is key. It is better to communicate too early and too much. Even if we do not know everything yet. We are running out of time. We do not have the luxus to waiting for the perfect solutions. So, move with what you have.” Kaisa-Reeta Koskinen, Project Director, Carbon Neutral Helsinki City of Helsinki, Finland. Mayor of Helsinki, Jan Vapaavuori, adds the critical point that “GHG emissions decline by actions, not by writing reports or strategies.”

The City of Buenos Aires, Argentina aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. The energy sector accounts for 55% of the city’s emissions, thus creating a need to advance energy efficiency of public buildings. María Celeste Lemos, Environmental Policy and Strategy Directorate of the Environmental Protection Agency, City of Buenos Aires, points out the benefits of adopting sustainable construction practices using procurement. Among them are health and well-being, lowering emissions, economic savings, uptake of renewable energy solutions and optimized use of resources. However, those benefits can only be achieved if sustainable procurement is mainstreamed by the city administration throughout the construction sector. Thus, María emphasizes the need to train all the executing units in charge of public procurement, especially those responsible for infrastructure and maintenance. “For the city government, the network is a unique space for the cities of the world to be able to cooperate with each other in the matter of sustainable public procurement, to exchange knowledge and good practices and to make public policies and the commitments that the city has to promote inclusive development and sustainable procurement through the Global Lead City Network. The prioritized sectors and the diversity of the profiles of its members consider that the GLCN is a very important space to stay at the forefront of sustainable public procurement and is a pillar to strengthen the social impact in public procurement and the fight against climate change,” said Lemos.

The City of Malmö, Sweden aims for climate-friendly, organic and fair food for the city. With 65,000 lunches per day or 21 million a year, procurement of sustainable ingredients has a significant impact. The city’s ambitions are high: a 40 percent reduction of GHG emissions from 2002 to 2020. For implementation on those targets, the city worked a lot on the procurement processes. “And of course, as a city to do this, we need to work with sustainable businesses that can deliver on the ambitions,” said Gunilla Andersson, Project Manager, Environmental Department. In addition, Andersson describes how it is key to get education for cooking staff, teachers, health care staff. Looking at a recent school lunch menu, each day has two options: always a plant-based meal and twice a week meals sourced from left-overs.

Latha Swamy, Food Policy Director, City of New Haven, Connecticut, USA said that “only four years ago a new division with a focus on food policy was established in the city. Back then none of the pre-existing plans such as the Food Action Plan or Climate Strategy mentioned procurement.” With a view to establish the mechanism of sustainable food procurement, the division takes a coalition-building approach that looks at involving residents, various city departments, local organizations and businesses as well as international networks such as ICLEI.

In 2009, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA initiated a food system program to address racial inequities in employment, education, healthy food access and obesity. “The aim was for us as a city to expand everyone’s ability and access to sustainably grown and healthy food,” said Tamara Downs Schwei, Food Policy Coordinator, City of Minneapolis. Over the years, key roadmaps such as the climate action plan referred to the program ‘Homegrown Minneapolis’. Whilst the city’s direct procurement of food is limited, the city works with the school district and farms – this resulted in the school district signing on to the Good Food Purchasing Program. Downs Schwei described how the pandemic, the rise in unemployment together with the tragic killing of George Floyd and the connected unrest, challenged communities’ food security. The city faced and still is navigating Covid-19 crisis, racial crisis and an acute hunger crisis. As a response the city experienced major support from various communities and partners, establishing local food links and providing hunger relief. These experiences of structural racism i.e. barriers to access healthy food, will feed into the ongoing process of developing a food action plan that aims for a more resilient and equal access driven city.

Looking ahead, ICLEI will continue to work with its members, and specifically through the Global Lead City Network to strengthen the connection between procurement and climate action. In this time of a climate crisis as well as a global pandemic and economic turmoil, it matters more than ever to make deliberate choices on if, how and what we consume and produce.

","Paulo Magina, Head Public Procurement, Infrastructure and Public Procurement Division, OECD, emphasised that procurement is an administrative process.
90% of OECD countries have included green procurement in their policy making – recognising that sustainability policy priorities can be achieved through procurement.
The GLCN member city recently finalised a Green Procurement Action Plan, in development since 2016, which seeks to give effect to the City’s commitment to green procurement and seeks to consolidate and mainstream the implementation of green procurement in the City.
We want to take responsibility now and our goal is to reduce emissions by 95% by 2030,” said Espen Nicolaysen, Head of Section Public Procurement, City of Oslo.
To achieve this ambitious goal, the city leverages procurement as a key mechanism."

More than 50 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Moycullen in County Galway since Sunday, Oct. 4, even though the village has a population of just 1,700.

The spike in cases in the small village can be traced back to the celebrations, which appear to be a super-spreader event.

The celebrations came after Moycullen beat Mountbellew-Moylough in the Galway Senior Football Championship final; the first time that a team from Moycullen has won Galway football's top prize.

The famous win sparked wild celebrations in Moycullen. Footage obtained by the Irish MIrror showed players and supporters alike celebrating the win in a local pub, drinking and chanting in the packed bar.

County Galway was under Level 2 restrictions at the time of the celebrations, which allowed for pubs and restaurants to remains open as long as they observed social distancing and other health regulations.

However, there appeared to be no social distancing in the Mirror's footage, while no one seemed to be wearing a face covering.

2 weeks ago this happened in every single county. I'll go mad if I hear one more GAA lad say ""letting games go ahead will give us all a much needed boost"". Dya know what would be a much needed boost? Being able to visit our parents this Xmas #moycullen pic.twitter.com/dHtjg7LTPe — Kevin McGahern (@kevinmcgahern) October 16, 2020

The celebrations were widely condemned on social media and Moycullen players were forced to withdraw from the Galway senior football squad ahead of its rescheduled National League campaign after several players tested positive for the virus.

The club confirmed this week that a number of players had tested positive for the virus, but Local Green Party Councilor Alastair McKinstry told RTÉ's Drivetime that the infections went far beyond the players.

""I’ve heard numbers of up to 50 or so were infected,” he told Drivetime.

“It almost certainly has gone beyond the GAA players, there’s fear within the school in particular cases,"" McKinstry said.","A Galway village has emerged as a hotspot for COVID-19 after a local Gaelic football team and its supporters raucously celebrated winning the Galway county title for the first time in its history.

Following the release of two “hilariously relatable” ads featuring New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley, Oikos is partnering with some of the NFL’s strongest players to launch the #OikosOneTrip challenge. Notable athletes participating in this campaign include NFL wide receiver Juju Smith Schuster, Anthony ‘Spice’ Adams, Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliot and Zach and Julie Ert, the brand said.

This latest TikTok challenge celebrates the everyday strength it takes to carry in all the groceries at once. One lucky winner will receive $15,000 for groceries and a year supply of Oikos Triple Zero nonfat yogurt for flexing his or her strength at home.

Taking cues from the brand’s new “One Tri”’ ad where Saquon Barkley flexes his protein-packed muscles by carrying overloaded grocery bags, this TikTok challenge celebrates an everyday strength everyone can relate to, NFL athlete or not.

“People are grocery shopping differently these days, and we can all relate to the unexplainable urge to carry every grocery bag inside in one trip,” said James Valdes, senior brand manager for Oikos Triple Zero. “Our brand believes that human strength is the most powerful force in the universe, and sometimes that means flexing your strength at home. That’s why Saquon’s ‘One Trip’ ad inspired us to launch the #OikosOneTrip sweepstakes and TikTok challenge and honor the relatable, yet unexplainable, urge to carry grocery bags in one trip.”

From Sept. 30 through Oct. 31, 2020, fans are invited to show their strength as part of the #OikosOneTrip challenge for the chance to win big. Fans simply make a grocery trip or stuff at least four bags full of whatever hefty items they have on hand. They then make a TikTok video carrying all those bulging bags in one trip, Oikos Triple Zero said, using the brand’s strength-inspiring song, “Oikos One Trip,” and follow @OikosProtein, tag #OikosOneTrip and #sweepstakes to enter for a chance to win year’s supply of Oikos® products and $15,000.

Working with community partners, PGE Project Zero is investing in climate science and clean energy education, green job opportunities for young adults disconnected from work and school and greenspace development in communities disproportionately feeling the impacts of climate change. 'PGE Project Zero helps PGE live its climate commitments by contributing to the climate science education, environmental volunteerism and green job employment of students and young adults,' said Dave Robertson, PGE Vice President of Public Affairs and Vice Chair of the PGE Foundation. 'Our youth hunger for knowledge about our changing climate and purposeful ways to make a difference. PGE Project Zero is meant to meet this need and improve the lives of people and our planet right here in Oregon.'

PGE Project Zero, funded in part by the PGE Foundation, is focused on three impact areas: Education: PGE Project Zero starts with education. PGE teamed up with Portland Public Schools (PPS) in January to announce first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, K-12 open source climate literacy curriculum development. PGE is financially supporting PPS's work and offering expert perspectives on how climate change impacts the energy sector to aid teachers and students as they discuss climate impacts and the clean energy future. In addition, PGE is partnering with the Oregon Zoo, Oregon Children's Theatre, Mad Science and other partners to offer free safety and energy educational materials and interactive experiences.

Workforce Development: Young adults disconnected from work and school will benefit from Project Zero's green job internships with selected community partners. This summer, 9 PGE Project Zero interns began their 6-month paid internships, funded by the PGE Foundation, at 5 partner organizations across Oregon, following recommended health and safety guidelines. Each intern is supported by a PGE employee mentor and receives supplementary professional development training. Partner organizations include Blueprint Foundation, Verde, Forest Park Conservancy, Columbia Slough Watershed Council and Friends of Trees.

Environmental Stewardship: Most low-income communities, Indigenous populations and communities of color are already experiencing firsthand the negative health and environmental impacts of climate change. PGE Project Zero invests in enhancing parks and greenspaces and improving air quality in neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by climate change. PGE works alongside longstanding partners, such as SOLVE and Friends of Trees, to engage Project Zero interns, PGE employees and customers in a variety of environmental stewardship events and programs. Adam Baek, PGE Project Zero Works intern, said, 'PGE has given us interns a great opportunity to become contributing members of our community. It's refreshing to have a company give people of color an opportunity at diversifying a traditionally white workplace. Each day at my internship I work with community organizations that have green workspace opportunities for underserved youth. While teaching myself and others about native plant species and eco systems, I also learn professional development and the importance of diversity in creative processes.' Elaine Philippi of In4All, who collaborated on the development of PGE Project Zero's green job internship program and is part of the oversight team for the internship program said, 'Project Zero is the latest example of PGE's collaborative community leadership. With youth at the center, all partners worked together to develop an approach and program that would amplify historically and currently marginalized young adults, providing supportive and challenging work experiences that will prepare them to use transferable skills in a future career and to be responsible stewards and leaders of the environment. It is a privilege to get to work with and continue to learn alongside the interns, PGE and this community of practice on this project.' Learn more about PGE Project Zero.

Credit: OceanForesters As humanity struggles to limit ever-rising temperatures, it also seeks to address growing poverty, disease and hunger across the world. Our team has designed an approach to address both issues in a way that is practical, economical, and effective, relying on three newly demonstrated technologies.

The world faces multiple crises affecting basic human needs for food, shelter and health, while at the same time maintaining aspirations for education and meaningful work. Crises affecting food and shelter, such as droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, diminished glaciers/snowpack and sea-level rise are exacerbated by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Health issues such as pandemics and increasing ranges of disease-transmitting organisms are also intensified by climate change.

Human needs and climate crises require finding interconnected opportunities addressing these interrelated challenges. Indeed, Pope Francis has issued a call to ""...bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development…"" The 2015 Paris Agreement recommends ""rapid reductions"" of greenhouse gases be achieved ""on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.""

Our team found interconnected opportunities with two approaches addressing human and climate issues. The two approaches update our 2012 proposal to grow more seaweed to simultaneously solve the problems of feeding the world, fueling the world and reversing climate change. We discovered these approaches during our work on the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) MARINER Program. The program's goal was to reduce the cost of growing macroalgae for biofuel.

Figure 1 shows how wastes, biomass, and fossil fuels are employed by the three newly demonstrated technologies: (1) building floating flexible fishing reef ecosystems with nutrient recycling achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, such as producing a half-billion tonnes of seafood per year; (2) Allam-Fetvedt Cycle (Allam Cycle) power plants efficiently producing both electricity and sequestration-ready CO 2 ; and (3) advances in hydrothermal liquefaction transforming any type of biomass into high quality biocrude oil.

During our MARINER work, we found that growing shellfish and fish close to seaweed improves the growth and potential yield of all three. In fact, farming annual mono-crops, or even dual-crops, in the ocean is sub-optimal. The best seaweed productivity is a perennial crop as part of a complete ecosystem that is managed as forests are managed. Perhaps as many as 30 species of fish, shellfish, crustaceans and others can be harvested, leaving the 100 ecosystem-supporting species. It's best to harvest a little macroalgae every week or so (as opposed to one to three harvests per year).

The permanent artificial reefs can be placed at any seafloor depth while floating at the ideal depth for the seaweed species. With ideal depth for sunlight and nutrient recycling, each reef can be even more productive than are natural reefs. This Total Ecosystem Aquaculture is a proposed program for the U.N. Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).

Co-author Antoine de Ramon N'Yeurt, a senior marine biologist at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji, has investigated marine ecosystems across many tropical islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. He says, ""I have looked at the productivity and biodiversity of natural coral reefs and I realize that artificial seaweed reefs could be even more productive and thriving ecosystems. A scientifically designed mixture of seaweed and shellfish would uptake excess nutrients while attracting sustainable eco-communities of fish, crustaceans, sea cucumbers and their myriad associated microbial communities. This system could restore fishing jobs and natural habitat, helping island and coastal nations throughout the world not only to feed themselves, but export food to help feed humanity.""

Allam cycle electrical plants make electricity with zero emissions whether burning coal or biofuels, allowing no gases to escape. The result could be the ending of dangerous pollution from power plants, yielding great health benefits while capturing all the carbon dioxide for sequestration. And if they burn trash, plastic, crop residues or other dry biofuels, the process is carbon negative, resulting in high net carbon removal. The company 8 Rivers currently has a working plant in Texas demonstrating that the technology is ready for commercialization.

Then we looked at the World Bank analysis of the 2 billion tons of waste generated by humanity every year. We saw that only a small fraction is recycled; most is either dumped in landfills, which emit climate-harming methane, or dumped in trash heaps that often catch fire, emitting dangerous air pollution. Too much waste, especially plastic, finds its way into the ocean, harming turtles, fish and birds. The economics of hydrothermal liquefaction (see page 13 in our paper and pages 22-27 in our Supplemental Material) have improved to support commercial-scale conversion of organic wastes, mixed with some plastics, into high quality biocrude oil. The biocrude oil can replace bunker fuel or be refined to make biodiesel and bio-gasoline at prices comparable to fossil fuels by applying the waste disposal fees to the production costs. By the time waste is fully used, the process economics should support using purpose-grown macroalgae.

Our analysis found that the world could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, even with substantial fossil fuel use. In fact, a tax on fossil fuels could be used to pay for removing the trillions of tonnes of previously emitted CO 2 . The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 degrees C report projects nearly 3 trillion excess tonnes of CO 2 in the atmosphere and oceans (see the right side of Figure 2) if net zero emissions are achieved by 2050.

We put all this analysis into an Excel spreadsheet with 24 interlinked tabs that estimate the amount of waste and biomass of many kinds available globally. Combined with the three technologies and the estimated demand for energy, we were able to calculate how to remove all of the excess CO 2 . Removing excess CO 2 will bring global air and water temperatures and ocean pH back to pre-industrial levels. Climates and ocean currents will more slowly stabilize and eventually return to pre-industrial conditions. Many species extinctions will be avoided.

Our spreadsheet (Supplemental Material in the zip document) allows countries and communities to choose a suitable balance using variations of low bio-electricity and high biofuels (for current vehicles) or high bio-electricity and low biofuels (to supply electric vehicles). The spreadsheet is designed so anyone can plug in estimates for their region and see the outcomes in terms of quantities, costs, and carbon sequestration amounts.

Figure 2: Our paper’s calculations superimposed on the IPCC 1.5ºC projections. Both our low and high bio-electricity alternatives show much more carbon removal than the IPCC each year in order to return CO2 levels to pre-industrial levels of about 300 ppm. Credit: OceanForesters calculations superimposed on Figures SPM 3a and SPM 1c from IPCC, 2018: Summary for Policymakers. In: Global Warming of 1.5°C.

Tignor, and T. Waterfield (eds.)]

Figure 2 graphs possible emissions from both our approaches. Allam Cycle plants are only economical with dry fuels, such as trash, plastic, and crop residues. Some islands do not have sufficient quantities of dry biomass, but have access to Total Ecosystem Aquaculture reefs that could grow abundant seaweed biofuel that could make oil in hydrothermal liquefaction plants.

ARPA-E required us to have a path to market for our macroalgae-grow-harvest technology. That requirement inspired us to phase the three technologies for a path to full scale. We suggest roughly this order:

Grow up to 500 million tonnes/yr of seafood worth about $1 trillion/yr on permanent flexible floating reefs. While growing seafood, refine equipment for growing macroalgae for biofuel. Produce 20 million barrels/day of biofuel from solid waste worth $0.3-0.7 trillion/yr. While processing trash, refine the process to use purpose-grown macroalgae economically. Scale to produce more biocrude oil from macroalgae than current fossil oil. Scale up to sequestration of 28 to 38 billion tonnes/yr of CO 2 , which could restore pre-industrial CO 2 levels by 2140-2170. At full scale, our carbon dioxide removal costs are projected at $26 per tonne of CO 2 . That is less than one-third of cost estimates for bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration with pre-2019 technology or the projected cost of direct air-capture removal.

The climate window of opportunity is rapidly closing. Action is needed now. Starting on our path to scale appears immediately economically viable, even without a carbon fee/tax.

We look forward to ongoing dialogues with scientists, engineers, political decisionmakers and communities to ""bring the whole human family together"" with ""sustainable and integral development."" The more perspectives, the better. For action opportunities involving the ocean, please participate in the U.N. Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).

Serish Nanisetti, Marri Ramu and Abhinay Deshpande report on murders in the name of honour and the state’s inability to curb them

On June 10, 2020, Avanthi Reddy stepped into the sunlight, ready to run away from home and be reunited with her lover. While most people feared leaving their homes in the midst of a raging pandemic, sunlight meant freedom and a new beginning for the 23-year-old. Seven months earlier, Avanthi’s family had forced her to quit her job, seized her mobile phone, and locked her up in a room in her own home. She had finally managed to escape that day. Within two hours of eloping, she and her boyfriend Chinta Yoga Hemanth Kumar, 28, got married in a Santoshimata temple in Nalagandla.

But just over three months later, tragedy struck the young couple. On September 24, Hemanth was kidnapped and murdered, and his body thrown into a clump of bushes by the roadside in the neighbouring Sangareddy district of Telangana. According to Avanthi’s statement to the Cyberabad police, the murder was committed at the behest of her father, Donthireddy Laxma Reddy, and other family members. They were furious that their young daughter, who belonged to a family of nouveau riche landowners, had chosen as her husband a man from the Vysya community of traders. Unable to convince her to stay away from Hemanth, they hatched a plot to kill him.

The news about Hemanth’s death broke when Amrutha Varshini, 21, was beginning her 140-km journey from Miryalaguda to Hyderabad. The discussions on TV of yet another ‘honour killing’ vividly brought to Amrutha’s mind the gruesome details of her husband’s death two years earlier at the hands of killers hired by her father. Amrutha is from the Vysya community; her husband Pranay was a Dalit.

Amrutha, then five months pregnant, was walking with Pranay and her mother-in-law Premalatha towards their car parked outside a hospital gate when the assailant struck. Amrutha heard a loud thud. “I turned and I could not find Pranay for a moment. An unidentified killer who had approached us from behind hit my husband with a machete on his neck,” she recalls. The CCTV footage showed the two women screaming for help even as the killer, a tall man in a safari suit, inflicted a second blow on Pranay bringing him to the ground in a pool of blood. He died before he could be given emergency care. That fateful day was September 14, 2018.

“It was shocking that some people from my community cursed me for marrying Pranay even after he was murdered. They even formed a ‘fans association’ in the name of my father, Maruthi Rao,” she says. Rallies were taken out in support of Rao, a top builder. Rao and the hired assassin were later arrested by the police.

The police as counsellors

Caste-related killings are not new in Telangana. Citing the incidence of such crimes in Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, even before Hemanth and Pranay were murdered, Jharna Das Baidya, a Member of Parliament of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), made an impassioned plea in Parliament in 2017 for a special law to curb such crimes. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 28 ‘honour killings’ in 2014, 251 in 2015, and 77 in 2016 across India.

The 242nd Law Commission Report, too, sought a new law on ‘prevention of interference with the freedom of matrimonial alliances’. Following the Supreme Court ruling on March 27, 2018 in Shakti Vahini v. Union of India laying down preventive, punitive and remedial measures to stem such crimes, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an advisory to all the States. It ordered the States to create special cells in “every district comprising the Superintendent of Police, the District Social Welfare Officer, and District Adi-Dravidar Welfare Officer to receive petitions/complaints of harassment of and threat to couples of inter-caste marriage”. The advisory stated that these special cells should create a 24-hour helpline to aid couples in distress. In Hyderabad, the helpline is called ‘Bharosa (trust)’.

However, instead of protecting young couples, the police is reportedly counselling them. Hemanth’s killing could have been averted, says Avanthi. “If the police official had not slammed the phone down when I called him up less than a month into my marriage, Hemanth would have been alive today. They refused to acknowledge the letter submitted by us about our safety (a few days after the marriage),” she says.

Comment | Honour killings are a separate horror

Avanthi says the police often summoned the family for counselling. She narrates the time she was called to the Chandanagar police station along with her in-laws on June 17. “There were more than 50 people from my parents’ side. They came in batches of 10, fell at my feet, spoke about ‘honour’ and asked me to come back home. This went on for five hours. Finally, close to midnight, I spoke to the police and left the station,” she recalls. Avanthi is now at her in-laws’ place. Her parental home is just a short distance away.

“It isn’t just about caste. My family spoke of differences in financial status too, but that’s also not much (between our families). They kept telling me about paruvu (Telugu for ‘pride’ or ‘honour’),” says Avanthi.

About 50 km from Hyderabad is Gomaram, the ancestral village of Donthireddy Laxma Reddy. Dalits say they are not allowed to enter the temples of Shiva and Hanuman there. “We are not allowed into the temples,” says Errala Seenu who lives in the basti nearby. Reddy’s house is adjacent to the temple. It is this caste pride that Reddy brought to Hyderabad and embossed in large letters on his three-storeyed mansion.

Tricked into stepping out

On September 24, Avanthi was about to open the refrigerator to plan lunch for the day when she heard a loud knock on the door. Her relatives stood outside, pleading with her to go home with them. They tried to persuade her to meet her parents. After 40 minutes of cajoling, they finally convinced Avanthi to meet her parents. But she insisted that Hemanth accompany her. Hemanth called his parents too. “My aunts and cousins were so anguished that I felt they were reaching out to us,” says Avanthi.

The couple got dressed for the visit. When they were about to get into their vehicle, Avanthi’s relatives forced them to get into the vehicles they had come in. “They were rough with us,” she says showing a bruise on her forearm.

Hemanth’s parents reached just in time to see the cars leaving the house. When Hemanth tried to wave to them to get their attention, Avanthi’s cousins pulled his hand into the car. But Hemanth’s parents saw him and tried to follow the vehicles. However, they were unable to tail the cars that zoomed away. Suspecting foul play, they alerted the police.

Meanwhile, fear gripped Avanthi when the cars turned towards the Nehru Outer Ring Road instead of turning towards her parents’ house. She asked Hemanth to jump out of the car, and they both did. Avanthi held Hemanth’s hand and ran barefoot shouting for help. But the passers-by and commuters at the Gopanpally Tanda crossroads turned out to be mute spectators. In the chase that ensued, her maternal uncle Yugandhar Reddy grabbed Hemanth and pushed him into the car with the hired killers. The car sped away on the Outer Ring Road. Avanthi sat by the roadside wailing for help, but no one came forward. When her in-laws arrived, the family rushed to the Cyberabad Commissionerate. There they were instructed to go to the nearby Gachibowli police station since this was a case of kidnapping. Losing precious time, Avanthi rushed to the Gachibowli police station to file a complaint. In less than an hour, about 10 of her relatives were detained and brought to the police station, but it was too late to save Hemanth. His body was discovered a few hours later; he had been strangled.

The police could have prevented the murder as most of the accused were in their custody in less than an hour of the kidnapping, says Avanthi. “They had enough time to save Hemanth, but they couldn’t.”

A tragic love story

Avanthi and Hemanth dated for eight years. She got to know him when his family moved from Guntur to Hyderabad to the same area that she lived in: Chandanagar. In 2013, when Avanthi was in Class 11, a lecturer informed Avanthi’s father about her relationship with Hemanth. Her father warned her against meeting him. When she completed her engineering degree, Donthireddy Laxma Reddy gifted his daughter an iPhone.

Avanthi joined an educational firm as a marketing coordinator in June 2019. The job entailed visits to schools in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts. “During that time, Hemanth and I used to travel together. It was the only time we got to spend together. He used to pick me up and drop me at the sites,” she says.

But their happiness was short-lived. On November 27, 2019, a ‘stranger’ photographed the couple while they were together and sent it to Donthireddy Laxma Reddy. “That day, when I returned home at 8.30 p.m., I saw my whole family gathered at home. They began quizzing me about our relationship. They snatched my mobile phone to check my messages and calls, but found none. I used to delete messages and call logs after every conversation. But they stumbled upon Snapchat, where they found our photographs,” says Avanthi.

That was her last day of freedom. Avanthi’s family forced her to resign and stay at home. They took away her mobile phone and confined her to a room for seven months and six days before she managed to escape and get married. “I was under house arrest. Whenever my cousins visited us, I would secretly take their phones and call Hemanth. We never spoke for more than 20 seconds,” she says.

While Avanthi was confined at home, Hemanth, who owned an interior painting company, approached several astrologers with their horoscopes. The books he had read on astrology lie beside his garlanded photograph at home.

In the first week of June, three months after she last spoke to him, Avanthi called Hemanth and asked him if he was interested in marrying her. She proposed three possible dates: June 5, June 6 or June 10.

“As June 5 was my parents’ wedding anniversary, I did not want to ruin their day. So, I stayed at home. The next day, everyone was at home. Finally, on June 10, I left a letter at home and somehow sneaked out and called Hemanth. We rushed to the Santoshimata temple in Nalagandla and got married within an hour. We had rented a house at TNGOs Colony the previous day, so we went there,” says Avanthi.

On discovering that their daughter was missing, Avanthi’s parents lodged a kidnapping case against Hemanth. His parents were called in for questioning. The police asked Hemanth’s father Murali Krishna to surrender his phone.

On June 12, the newly-wed couple met Cyberabad Commissioner of Police, V.C. Sajjanar, who in turn told the Chandanagar police to close the case as both of them were consenting adults. Following this visit, the police counselled the families and sent them away. Later, Avanthi’s parents demanded that three properties which were registered under her name be transferred back to them.

Avanthi thought that her parents had reconciled to the marriage. However, her parents were now plotting Hemanth’s murder with the help of her uncle Yugandhar Reddy. Assassins were allegedly hired for ₹10 lakh and were paid ₹1 lakh in advance.

Editorial | Crime in the name of honour

“As a part of their plan, they did a recce of the area for more than two weeks. On September 24, they kidnapped Hemanth and strangled him,” says Madhapur in-charge Deputy Commissioner of Police, M. Venkateshwarlu.

Reconstructing the crime, Venkateshwarlu says Yugandhar Reddy and the three hired assassins kidnapped Hemanth and drove him all the way to Zaheerabad, which is more than 100 km from Hyderabad. While returning to Hyderabad, they strangled him inside the car and dumped the body in the bushes.

An inconsolable Avanthi told her father later that he may have “succeeded” in taking away her husband physically from her, but he cannot take away her love for him or annul the marriage. “All your money could not buy my husband’s love for me,” she said sobbing. “You lost your daughter as well.”

Awaiting trial

The state is directly supporting people indulging in such heinous acts, says Lakshmaiah, convener of the All India Struggle Association for Annihilation of Caste Inequalities. To illustrate his claim, he gives the example of the murder of a young Dalit woman, K. Sushrutha, and her four-month-old son, Devarsh, by her husband M. Ramesh, who belongs to a backward community, in Ghatkesar. The incident was reported on February 9, 2019.

Sushrutha and Ramesh fell in love and got married in 2015 against Ramesh’s parents’ wishes. Police records suggest that Ramesh, influenced by his family members who disapproved of his marriage with a Dalit woman, began distancing himself from his wife. The couple applied for divorce. But after giving birth to Devarsh, Sushrutha tried to reunite with her husband.

In the second week of February 2019, Ramesh called his wife and said they could try and sort out their issues. Sushrutha, who was living with her mother, agreed to meet him. Her brother dropped her and her son at Uppal on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Ramesh picked them up from there and took them to a secluded place in Ghatkesar. Police say following an argument between the couple, Ramesh throttled his wife and son to death and burnt their bodies with petrol.

Following the incident, Sushrutha’s family members approached the government seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor to argue the case under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The government appointed lawyer V. Raghunath as the special public prosecutor in the case. “After examining the charge sheet filed by the police, I found that the investigation was not done properly. I suggested to the Rachakonda Police Commissioner that a further probe be done,” Raghunath says.

Interestingly, the accused moved the High Court saying Raghunath was actively associated with organisations supporting the victim and therefore cannot be their lawyer. The High Court gave an interim order suspending his appointment. Though the writ petition was pending final adjudication, the government issued an order revoking Raghunath’s appointment.

“If this is not an example of the state supporting the accused in murders driven by caste hatred, what is,” asks Lakshmaiah. The state’s biased approach can also be seen in the arrest of four of Sushrutha’s family members for carrying out hunger strikes in front of Ramesh’s house, he says. After demonstrating for 150 consecutive days, the four family members were arrested and lodged in Warangal prison for a week.

Sandhya, president of the Progressive Organisation of Women, who is fighting for the rights of women, feels it is inaccurate to describe killings related to inter-caste marriages as ‘honour killings’, as is the norm in India. The very term ‘honour killings’ means we are accepting the killers’ intentions and actions. “These murders are driven by class, caste and patriarchal hegemony,” she says.

Charge sheets have been filed in the murder cases of Pranay, Sushrutha and Naresh, but trials are yet to begin.","According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 28 ‘honour killings’ in 2014, 251 in 2015, and 77 in 2016 across India.

India seeks global food supply champion role amidst pandemic – but may need to save its poor first,"India has been actively seeking a position as a global food security ‘hero’ of sorts during COVID-19, including pushing for ‘barrier free’ produce exports even through its own lockdown, and claiming that it has ‘no issues’​ with local food supply.

“Contrary to steps taken by some other countries during this difficult pandemic period, India did not place any restrictions on exports of farm produce,”​ Trade Promotion Council of India Chairman Mohit Singla told FoodNavigator-Asia​.

“In fact, the government has been taking requisite steps to ensure barrier free exports of surplus produce right from the first lockdown.​

“India had commenced exports of rice, meat, dairy and processed food items in the initial days of April 2020 [and] export of agricultural commodities surged by 23% during March-June, 2020.”​

He added that due to this stability in local food security, the main focus for the country at present is to expand global food trade.

“Due to its rich resource base and availability of sufficient surplus of essential food items, India does not face any issues with respect to domestic food supply,”​ Singla stressed.

“T​he priority is to sustainably grow India’s contribution to global agricultural trade in terms of commodities as well as processed food products - This will help boost farmer incomes in line with policy objectives as well as contribute to supply stability in the global market, particularly in the pandemic period.”​

Indian government officials have also made promises on a global platform to ‘ensuring a stable global food supply’​ through its agri-export policies, again assuring all who will listen that the country has enough food to provide for itself and others.

“[The] Indian government has taken prompt measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic which coincided with [winter] harvesting,”​ India Agriculture Ministry additional secretary Alka Bhargava told countries attending the UN FAO’s 35th Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC), according to an official statement.

The country’s Agriculture Commissioner S K Malhotra also emphasised that India had achieved ‘record’​ grain production and ‘successfully controlled’​ the recent pest attacks by locusts​ and armyworms, and would support in.

That said, the UN FAO also highlighted at the conference that the APAC region contains over half of the world’s undernourished people, with South Asia in particular expected to see a rapid rise of about a third to 330 million by 2030 in light of COVID-19 – and India is likely to contribute to a very large proportion of this, despite all its promises.

According to UN data, India has nearly 195 million people who are undernourished and one of the world’s highest child undernutrition rates, taking roughly a quarter of the global hunger burden.

“Nearly 47 million or 4 out of 10 children in India are not meeting their full human potential because of chronic undernutrition or stunting,”​ said the UN on its website.

“This has [long-term lifetime] consequences such​ as diminished learning capacity, poor school performance, reduced earnings and increased risks of chronic diseases. The impacts are multi-generational as malnourished girls and women often give birth to low birth-weight infants too.”​

Malnourishment in India​

Perhaps even more worrying is that despite India’s claims to have achieved food security, the majority of its population may be able to afford an ‘energy-sufficient’ diet, but less than 25% can actually afford a ‘healthy’ diet.

According to a recent international report by the UN FAO, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020,​ 99.1% of the Indian population can currently a basic diet that can just meet calorie needs, but only 22.1% can afford a healthy diet containing the ‘recommended intake of more diversified and desirable food groups’​.

Some 60.9% of the population was found to be able to afford a ‘nutrient adequate’ but still not healthy, diet.

“The health impacts associated with poor diet quality are significant – [these are] a principal contributor to malnutrition [and] are significant risk factors for non-communicable diseases,”​ said the researchers.

In addition, although India is trying to combat malnourishment via large-scale programmes related to food security and poverty such as giving out free food rations​ during the COVID-19 lockdown, not only are these blighted by operational inefficiencies as confirmed by government data, but there tend to be ‘critical gaps’​, according to the UN.

“[The] critical gaps [are] in terms of inclusion and exclusion errors - Women and girls are particularly disadvantaged,”​ said the agency.

This was echoed by the FAO researchers which highlighted what was called ‘efficiency ​problems’ with India’s food distribution programme.

“[India’s] Targeted Public Distribution System represents the largest social protection programme in the world, reaching 800 million people with subsidised cereals that can be purchased from more than 500 000 fair price shops across the country,”​ they said.

“[However, some studies have] found that the programme still faces efficiency problems, particularly in regard to targeting food insecure and poor population groups, [even if there has been] some positive impact on the intake of macronutrients.​

Worse yet, agricultural and policy challenges are also coming to the fore despite the country’s ‘record’ production season, which shine may soon fade if these are not addressed soon.

“In India, policies that [are biased towards] staple crop production, such as fertilizer and credit subsidies, price supports and irrigation infrastructure (particularly for rice), have tended to discourage the production of traditional non-staple crops, such as pulses and legumes,”​ said the researchers.

“[This situation has] limited the supply responsiveness of vegetables and other non-staple foods. [Policies should specifically target] strengthened capacity for all-season vegetable production, and other high-value commodities to increase availability of nutritious foods.”​

The UN added that some major agricultural challenges looming for India include slowing agriculture growth, climate change, land degradation due to imbalanced fertiliser use and shrinking bio-diversity.","India has been actively seeking a position as a global food security ‘hero’ of sorts during COVID-19, including pushing for ‘barrier free’ produce exports even through its own lockdown, and claiming that it has ‘no issues’​ with local food supply.

LONDON: A British Muslim woman said she is “grateful” for safely having a baby after she was placed in a coma due to complications from contracting COVID-19, describing it as a “miracle.”

Marriam Ahmad, 27, from the Welsh city of Newport, went into hospital in January after testing positive for the disease.

Ahmad, who was 29 weeks pregnant at the time and suffers from asthma, did not expect to be in hospital long, but her condition deteriorated quickly.

“All of a sudden, my oxygen mask was on a much higher setting — I couldn’t hear properly,” she told the BBC. “It was very loud. I had someone washing my face, looking after me. I was very weak.”

As her condition worsened, she was told that her baby would have to be delivered prematurely by Caesarean section. A few hours later, a decision was made to place her in an induced coma.

She was warned that her baby might not be strong enough to survive, and that she might not wake up from the coma.

“It just happened so quickly. It was within about five minutes, they told me ‘you’re going on a ventilator, you’re having a c-section, the baby’s going to come out, you’ll be unconscious, you might not make it. Say goodbye’,” Ahmad said.

“I facetimed my parents and I was crying. It was only like a two-minute phone call — my mum was like ‘what are you talking about?’ I was lonely and I was scared. I didn’t even speak to my husband or my son.”

Her husband, who was looking after their 1-year-old son Yusuf, was called by a doctor to inform him of developments. Their baby was born on Jan. 18, 2021, weighing just 1.17 kg.

Surprisingly, Ahmad woke from her coma naturally less than a day later — but was unable to see her baby due to their conditions and COVID-19 restrictions. For the next few days, nurses brought Ahmad photos and videos of her baby.

“I had no idea what happened. I woke up — obviously I could see there was nothing in my stomach anymore and I was in a lot of pain,” she said, adding that staff members became deeply invested in her baby’s wellbeing.

Ahmad and her husband decided to name their daughter Khadija. “In the Islamic faith, Khadija is a very strong, independent woman,” she said.

“From my point of view, my Khadija was very strong. She didn’t have issues, for someone being preterm at 29 weeks. They were telling me all the complications. She didn’t have any of those. It was a miracle.”

Khadija spent eight weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit before she was allowed home. After three and a half months, she weighed nearly 4 kg.

“I am just so grateful — that she’s still alive, that I am still alive,” Ahmad said. “Even though it was such a horrific, traumatic experience, I just found myself being even more grateful for the little things. Just spending time with family.”","“All of a sudden, my oxygen mask was on a much higher setting — I couldn’t hear properly,” she told the BBC.

The UAE is aiming to become the first country in the world to achieve zero contribution of oil in its GDP over the next 50 years, Minister of State for Foreign Trade Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi said.

""The UAE's trade and investment strategy is centered on economic diversification and focuses on enhancing investment in industries such as communication, blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics and genetics. We are also initiating measures to strengthen our position as a regional leader in supplying financial and logistical services and infrastructure for energy supply and other services,"" Dr Al Zeyoudi said during his opening remarks on the second day of the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM).

He said increased partnership and cooperation within the government and with the private sector will be key to achieve the objectives.

""For the UAE, foreign direct investment [FDI] has played a critical role in economic growth. In 2019, the UAE was the largest recipient of FDI in the region. Our policies and measures are in place, such as the FDI law enacted in 2018 to further open the UAE market to investors in certain sectors and assurance of our positive list that allows greater foreign investment across 122 activities,"" he said, adding that the country was able to increase FDI value by 52 per cent last year.

The UAE also came 16th in 190 countries in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 2020 ranking, thanks to digitalisation strategies and promising business regulatory environment provided by the UAE, he added.

The minister added that the UAE is continuing to refine and implement policies that will maximise competitiveness, increase collaboration and provide opportunities to facilitate trade and investment.

FDI recovery in 2022

The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global markets, creating new challenges for trade and investment. According to the United Nations, global FDI flows are estimated to decrease up to 40 per cent this year, driven well below their value of $1.54 trillion in 2019.

""This will bring global FDI below $1 trillion for the first time since 2005. Global FDI flows are expected to drop even further in 2021. We do expect to start seeing markets recover only in 2022. The challenges ahead are enormous. The UAE sees tremendous opportunities for government and business leaders to work together for trade and investment to shape policies to create new partnership, leverage new technologies and build a future global economy that is more diverse, inclusive and sustainable,"" he added.

Dubai in top 3 FDI cities

Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai FDI, said Dubai's policies and initiatives have primed the city to attract investments into new and emerging sectors, among which one of the most important is the digital economy that includes secure communication networks, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, machine-to-machine communication and other technologies of Industry 4.0.

""This is the reason Dubai was among the top 10 cities globally in attracting FDI capital during the first half of 2020, and third in attracting greenfield FDI,"" he said.

Gil Amelio, chairman of Safe Dynamics and former CEO of Apple Computer, said Dubai is known as a city of the future and an innovation hub in the Mena region and around the globe.

""Dubai and the UAE have implemented an innovative and forward-thinking approach. That's why we are also planning to launch other products that improve safety for both workers and the public in the UAE in the near future,"" he added.

Despite Covid-triggered challenges, electricity and water supply across Dubai remained stable, with zero interruptions over the past few months, authorities said on Friday.

The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (Dewa) is the first utility service provider in the Middle East to have received an ISO certification for business continuity management. It has a clear, approved plan for any emergency that may arise because of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Work has also carried on at all the projects of Dewa, including the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. It is the largest single-site solar park in the world using the independent power producer model.

Current projects at the solar park have a capacity of 1,013MW. The total capacity of the five phases announced so far will reach 2,863 MW and will reach 5,000 MW by 2030.

“We work in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to provide state-of-the-art infrastructure and manage all facilities and services through smart and connected systems that use technologies (like) artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, energy storage, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT),” said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD and CEO of Dewa.

Dewa currently has an installed capacity of 11,700MW and 470 million gallons of water per day. Between 2006 and 2019, it has increased its generation efficiency by 31.4 per cent.

It has also achieved the highest standards in global competitiveness indicators, which includes raising the fuel efficiency of the generation units to about 90 per cent. In addition, the availability of the generation units reached 99.73 per cent, while the reliability of the generation units scored 99.96 per cent, exceeding global rates of 91%.

Safety first

GOVERNOR Willie Obiano of Anambra State yesterday, told President Muhammadu Buhari that construction work at the Onitsha-Enugu federal highway has slowed down to almost zero level.

The governor also begged the President to intervene in ensuring that the equipment purchased for the ongoing work at the Second Niger Bridge which are still in Germany are brought to Nigeria for the speedy completion of the project on record time.

Speaking with State House Correspondents after meeting behind closed-door with the President, Governor Obiano, who is the only governor on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, said he sought the assistance of the federal government for the settlement of about 5,000 displaced people from his state.

On the reason for the visit, he said: ”I come once in awhile to brief Mr. President on the developments we are having in Anambra State and we do have a lot of beautiful developments. We also have some that bothered me to come right now, which is the flood.

”Four of my local governments, that is four out of 21 are under water now as we speak because of this flood and it affected a lot of things, properties which include farm produce and what have you.

”So, I called on Mr. President to assist us at this very crucial time being a COVID-19 time and now, the flood we are experiencing this time around is like the one of 2012 which is terrible. So, he promised to do something immediately.

”I did also told him about the progress so far made on the 2nd Niger Bridge. If you watch from their side, you will see that almost half of that bridge has been done.

”But because the water level is very high, the contractor working in that bridge requires some equipment which they’ve already purchased long ago sitting in Germany and requires some support from Central Bank to be able to be brought in. I did mention that to him and the President noted that and said he will do something about that.

”The other point was on citing the Federal University of Education in Aguleri. Anambra North Senatorial District which does not have any federal institution at all. Other two senatorial districts have two or three federal institutions.

”The place is part of the area I just told you that is flooded – Anambra West, Anambra East. The whole of Anambra West is under water now, half of Anambra East is under water, Ogbaru area is under water.

”All these are majorly Anambra North. So, the Senate graciously approved and wrote to Mr. President to assent to the bill that they passed. This letter was written 19th September 2019. So, Mr. President has agreed to quickly acquiesce to that so that this institution can move on.

”On my own, I have paid compensation to the land owners and I have started the fencing of the massive property. And I am doing the gatehouse of the institution. All I require is Mr. President’s support by acquiescing to the recommendations of the Clerk of the National Assembly on 19th September 2019.

“We did discuss some other roads, federal roads that are in very bad shape, about six of them and I requested Mr. President to see if they can go into their budget as they prepare for the budget of next year.”

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- (TV 2) ?

I didn't expect the witches this season to be Subaru's therapists, but here we are. It's one of those twists that isn't actually all that surprising when you stop to think about it. The themes of this series have been consistent since day one, because at the end of the day, this is a coming-of-age story about a boy finding himself in a new world. The witches may not follow conventional human morality, but in a way their detachment from society makes it easier for them to appreciate Subaru as an individual with no pretenses.

Over and over this season, from his reunion with his parents in episode 4 to his pained interactions with Beatrice to the trial where he sees his friends mourn his deaths, it's been established that Subaru is the kind of person who doesn't realize that he's loved by other people. Even the witch Satella comes out to tell him to love himself, in an interesting twist with the Japanese language. All that time she was saying ""Aishite"" (love), she never added a subject to the sentence; instead of saying ""Love me"" which would normally be how one would interpret the word in context, she actually meant ""Love yourself."" That moment where Subaru has his first proper conversation with Satella is one of the most powerful moments in the series so far for me, and it cements my impression of the witch as a deeply lonely person.

The rest of the episode isn't quite as strong, and honestly it felt like it was retreading ground at times. We get confirmation yet again that Roswaal is a dick, while Otto affirms (much like how he did in episode 7) that he truly cares about Subaru. Otto's friendship punch is where the episode ends, with Subaru still in the process of revaluating himself. So, yeah, the first cour of this season doesn't end on a particularly tense note. It simply just ends, as if the next episode was destined to air a week later. Tappei Nagatsuki tweeted last week that the show was originally scheduled to be two cours without any break, so it really feels like COVID-19 ruined the party.

Still, as an episode in its own right, this one was pretty solid, even if the decline in production quality was noticeable in Subaru's character art this time. I can see where they were going for by adding extra lines to his face to give off a tortured expression. Previous episodes throughout the series as a whole were able to pull this level of detail off to produce some truly memorable expressions, but these past few episodes have struggled quite a lot with that. I'll put that down to the influx of animation directors this season—there were seven credited on this episode alone and six on the previous two episodes. In a healthier production, you'd only need one or two per episode, because dividing the work between more directors means that it's harder to maintain consistency in the art. Adding those extra lines to Subaru's face makes that task even harder; it's not a cut-and-dry matter of matching the key animation to his character sheet, because the standard expressions drawn there don't convey the sheer emotional devastation he's being put through.

The strength of Re:Zero 's direction has felt like a double-edged sword this season. On one hand, as I've mentioned multiple times in these reviews, the strong storyboarding and slick editing means that the animation itself doesn't need to stand out as much. But there have definitely been times when the layouts were too ambitious for the animators to keep up with. Drawing characters from unconventional angles or with deeply contorted expressions seems to have been the sticking point this season. Episode 5 had a really excellent cut of Emilia first waking up from her trial with completely convincing terror, but if only the staff had more time to nail more of those types of expressions... So yeah, I guess COVID rained on the parade again. Also, the absence of master action animators like Hiroyuki Takashima means we never got standout scenes like the battle between Reinhard and Elsa in season 1.

I don't want to be too much of a downer on this season, though, because it's not like the first season was consistently on-model either. At the same time, it just feels like this season was a major step up in terms of scope and ambition—from the average length per episode to the layouts—and that also means more room for failure. Let's hope the break from broadcast gives the staff the time they need to put out that polished product they clearly want to deliver, as well as a good rest. They certainly deserve it, and I appreciate all the good work so far.

In the meantime, Re:Zero is over for now, and I really hope I don't forget too many plot details by the time it resumes! There was a lot to keep up with this season—even I'm feeling a little exhausted just thinking about it. It really goes to show what a special show this has been, packing in such loving detail every episode. I've enjoyed every minute of the ride so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing you guys again in January.

NAMIBIANS must find new and creative ways to collectively tackle the scourge of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.

President Hage Geingob met with representatives of the #Shutitalldown protest movement at State House and gave the reassurance that their goals were achievable and that fighting against the scourge of gender-based violence was not only their struggle but also a collective struggle.

The President reminded the representatives of the movement that it was essential for them to express themselves in a democracy.

“It is a manifestation of hope that things will change and that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Your willingness to attend the meeting is an illustration of the trust you put in the elected Government,” he said.

Geingob underlined the importance of buttressing the rule of law, including processes, systems, and institutions in the Namibian Governance Architecture.

“It was an opportune moment to meet with the petitioners following the processes of petitioning they had followed with the Prime Minister, including the statement by the Prime Minister in the National Assembly on 13 October 2020 dealing with the concerns of the youth,” he said.

The President expressed satisfaction with the fact that the Prime Minister dealt with the issues in the petition and further emphasized that alcohol abuse could not be used as an excuse anymore and the nation needed to look at rebuilding the family unit that has been broken.

While addressing the representatives, Dr. Geingob stressed that has zero-tolerance for SGBV and said that the elevation of the Gender affairs to the Presidency is in itself ample demonstration of the commitment he places on gender equality, including the plight of women and children.

“It would be wrong to assume that we are at war against each other, we have to address this issue together. Gender-Based Violence is something we have to address together as a nation”, he said.

Geingob also stressed the need for solidarity in fighting the shared challenge of Gender-Based Violence and said that urgency exists to build safer communities.

“Misunderstandings could occur when people don’t talk to each other. Countries go to war when diplomacy fails and when you don’t communicate. Dialogue and unity is the key,” the President cautioned.

Geingob also highlighted the importance of “disagreeing without being disagreeable” and finding one another through dialogue and he further assured the youth leaders that communication in Government will be strengthened to share actions and policies in place to strengthen the fight against Gender-Based Violence.

He agreed with the #Shatitalldown representatives that there was a need to be creative and to do more to protect vulnerable sectors of the community such as women and children.

In addition to continuous engagement during the implementation of the response measures as demanded by the protesters in their petition participants of the meeting also agreed to the establishment of a technical committee comprised of youth leaders against Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) and other stakeholders, including Government.

President Geingob assured the representatives of the #Shutitalldown movement that a policy of zero tolerance would be pursued and as part of the ethos of Transparency and Accountability and further assured them that the doors of the Presidency would always be open for dialogue and for finding common solutions to problems facing Namibians.","Staff ReporterNAMIBIANS must find new and creative ways to collectively tackle the scourge of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Femicide.

“When it comes to the ocean, we are still hunter-gatherers”, says Vincent Doumeizel, a senior advisor on ocean-based solutions at the UN Global Compact, and an evangelist for seaweed. “By farming just two per cent of the ocean, we could provide enough protein to feed a world population of 12 billion people. Seaweed is extremely protein rich, low in fat, low in carbohydrates, and rich in vitamins, zinc and iron”.

As any fan of sushi will already know, certain forms of seaweed are edible for human consumption. Whilst seaweed has been popular in Asia, particularly Japan, for many years, it is slowly becoming better known throughout the rest of the world, and Mr. Doumeizel is confident that it has the potential to become a mainstream food. “Most Japanese people eat seaweed three times a day, it is used in many dishes in Korea, and is eaten by many people in China. This may be a major factor in cutting the levels of non-communicable diseases in these countries.

Unsplash/freetousesounds Japanese sushi rolls are typically wrapped in seaweed.

Underwater carbon capture

Mr. Doumeizel also touts the environmental benefits of seaweed, particularly as an ingredient in animal feed: “Seaweed doesn’t need land, fresh water, or pesticides, just sun and saltwater. If livestock were fed on seaweed-based foodstuffs, rather than soy, methane emissions could be cut by 90 per cent, and improve digestion whilst boosting the animals’ immune systems, which reduces the need for antibiotics. This is already happening in some countries, such as Scotland and Iceland”.

Seaweed has many other uses and benefits, as an organic fertilizer, a sustainable replacement for plastics, and an ingredient in cosmetics and medicines. It also plays a role in tackling ocean pollution, cleaning the water of nitrates and phosphates.

Given the vast range of benefits seaweed offers, why isn’t it being used more widely? Technical barriers are one reason, according to Mr. Doumeizel. “There is a lack of space to grow underwater forests near shorelines, and it can be difficult to get a licence to grow them off-shore. We need to learn from oil companies, which have a lot of experience in dealing with strong ocean currents and waves”.

Manahas Farquhar Matthew Morgan Farming just 2 per cent of the Ocean could feed 12 billion people.

In fact, one company with big plans to expand seaweed production, is run by a former executive at international oil company, Shell. Kelp Blue is planning to grow huge underwater forests of seaweed off the coast of Namibia, covering some 70,000 hectares. These forests, say the company, would help to solve the world’s food crisis whilst, at the same time, removing vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and creating hundreds of jobs.

They would be populated by giant kelp, a form of seaweed that can grow to 100 feet (30 metres). According to Kelp Blue, one million tons of carbon dioxide would be locked away by the forests and, because one of the main products from kelp is feed for livestock, it has the potential to remove much more, via reduced methane emissions. An added possible side benefits of the forests is a projected growth in fish stocks in the surrounding waters of up to 20 per cent, with the expectation that around 200 species would their home within the kelp.

The seaweed manifesto

Whilst companies like Kelp Blue appear to have solutions to technical challenges, the main obstacle that still needs to be overcome is a lack of global safety standards for seaweed products, and resistance to collaboration, in an industry still driven by relatively small companies and entrepreneurs, who are not keen to share.

To overcome this problem, the UN Global Compact has published a seaweed manifesto, which calls for internationally agreed standards, new investment efforts, and greater collaboration between governments, science and industry, to drive production to the next level.

The manifesto was officially launched one the sidelines of the 2020 UN General Assembly, at an online event which brought together several players from the private and public sector, and featured Alexandra Cousteau, grand-daughter of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, and founder of Oceans 2050, a campaign and action platform dedicated to restoring ocean health over the next thirty years.

If it succeeds, the seaweed industry could find itself playing a much greater role in fighting the climate crisis, strengthening marine ecosystems and bringing the world closer to the big prize: an end to hunger.","Seaweed is extremely protein rich, low in fat, low in carbohydrates, and rich in vitamins, zinc and iron”.

229,https://theowp.org/reports/sustainable-development-goal-2-achieving-zero-hunger-by-2030-where-are-we-now/,"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Organization for World Peace,Sustainable Development Goal 2: Achieving Zero Hunger By 2030. Where Are We Now?,"The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is one of the 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in 2015 which aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030. The rise in food insecurity over the years has become a concerning global issue as the number of hungry and undernourished people continues to increase as a result of war, climate anomalies, poverty and increase in population in certain parts of the world. In addition, the increase in international food prices has severely impacted food production costs, particularly in food-exporting countries. As a result, countries have sought ways to protect themselves from price shocks by imposing export restrictions. According to the UN, an estimated 821 million people in the world suffered from food hunger in 2018. Currently, the rise and consequences of the coronavirus adds further challenges to achieving the zero hunger target by 2030 and may not be achieved if we fail to act.

According to UN statistics, over 2 billion people do not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, including 8% of the population in North America and Europe. Africa has been identified as the region with the highest rate of undernourishment of approximately 20%. Western Asia follows with more than 12%, and Latin America and the Caribbean with a prevalence of under 7%. Prior to the current pandemic, drought and conflict had been the primary causes of food insecurity around the globe in addition to population increase and poverty. For example, in the horn of Africa, climate anomalies such as drought and rainfall shortage has exacerbated food insecurity, as approximately 80% of the population live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for food and income. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says drought is considered the most catastrophic natural disaster in the Horn of Africa causing widespread famine while periodic floods also increases the presence of locusts in the region.

Conflict also exacerbates food insecurity, as men are not able to engage in agricultural production. This diverts the resources from uses that would be beneficial to the whole community and as a result the international community has to step in to provide assistance to those affected. Conflict also has a severe impact on the poor leaving them more disadvantaged by displacing them from their homes and their resources. Lastly, the increase in population in developing countries also increases the demand for food production, particularly in places with a low prevalence of contraception use. Furthermore, the increase in rural-urban migration has also impacted food production, especially for farmers through decreased productivity and less land to feed themselves in order to supply and meet the demands of expanding cities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global food security. According to the September 2020 report by the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE), lockdown measures by individual states have significantly affected the availability of food, causing a dramatic increase in hunger and undernourishment around the world. According to the UN World Food Programme, an additional 130 million people are at risk of facing acute food insecurity by the end of 2020. The lockdown measures to contain the spread of the virus have proved to cause disruptions to food supply chains through the closure of restaurants and other food service facilities, loss of income and livelihoods.

They have also widened the inequality gap and brought disruptions to social protection programmes. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 400 million full-time jobs have been lost in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of lockdown measures enforced in a number of countries, further exacerbating inequities by relating to access to basic needs and healthcare. Although lockdown measures have helped contain the spread of the coronavirus, the global food security crisis will further deteriorate as each economy suffers from higher rates of unemployment and poverty.

According to the 2020 Global Hunger Index (GHI), worldwide hunger is currently at moderate level . However, a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have the highest hunger and undernutrition levels around the globe. Countries considered to have alarming levels of hunger are Chad, Timor-Leste and Madagascar. Hunger levels have also worsened in conflict affected states including Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia , South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The GHI further estimated that approximately 37 countries will fail to even reach low hunger by 2030, therefore implying that the world is not on track to achieve SDG 2.

For decades, world hunger and the food security crisis has been a challenge for the international community and measures have been taken by world leaders, intergovernmental bodies and non-profit organizations to address this issue. For instance, in 1996, world leaders made a commitment in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action in the FAO World Food Summit to reduce by half the number of hungry and undernourished people by 2015. Today, there are UN agencies that cater to food security such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The WFP has been recognized for its efforts to combat hunger and in conflict affected areas like Yemen in 2018. The WFP has been recognized for its role in enhancing access to contested natural resources. For example, it has helped with engagement of communities by rehabilitating irrigation canals and pipelines in disputed territories along Kyrgyztan’s border with Tajikistan. This resulted in an increase in water supply and agricultural productivity which helped address inter-community conflict.

Overall, it is evident that there has been some progress towards addressing food insecurity around the globe, although we may not be at the pace towards achieving zero hunger by 2030. Addressing global food insecurity requires a multi-faceted approach as there are underlying issues that need to be simultaneously addressed, such as poverty and climate change. The increasingly interdependent nature of the global economy today highlights the need for joint efforts from the international community in addressing this issue. However, there are ways in which we as individuals and states can do our part by minimizing food waste, supporting efforts to alleviate the food security crisis through donations, ensuring fair trade policies and encouraging the use of sustainable resources. It is also important to note that we all have different starting points in life in terms of opportunities which leaves some more disadvantaged than others. Therefore, addressing these inequality gaps by providing conditions for an equitable society are key in helping eradicate poverty and food insecurity around the globe.","The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 is one of the 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in 2015 which aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030.

The Covid-19 pandemic could further add 83m to 132m food-insecure people worldwide. Globally, the prevalence of food insecurity at a moderate or severe level is higher among women than men. The gender gap in accessing food increased from 2018 to 2019.

In Pakistan, the Prevalence of Undernourishment — an important indicator for measuring our progress on SDG 2 Zero Hunger — has slowly declined to 26m Pakistanis in 2017-19, from about 33m in 2003-04. Some of the gains were however reversed by climate-related shocks, such as the floods of 2010-13, as well as recent challenges of drought, more floods, locusts and Covid-19 impacts. With all this to bear, we can expect a deterioration in Pakistan’s food security as we head towards the end of 2020 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Economic slowdowns due to lockdowns, such as Pakistan experienced in 2019-20, tend to increase poverty, which is closely interlinked with food insecurity. The shocks are consequently affecting poorer commu­nities disproportionately, and pushing those in the most uncertain contexts deeper into poverty and hunger, with an important impact on the stability of access to adequate, safe and nutritious food for households. Access to food is also under threat for more vulnerable households because of food price fluctuations observed in a range of Pakistani markets since the onset of Covid-19.

We can expect a deterioration in food security.

Food insecurity can lead to different manifestations of malnutrition. The kind of and relative amounts of food people eat, specifically, the quality of their diet, translates into how our body utilises it and is directly linked with health and energy. In Pakistan, access to healthy, balanced diets is a challenge. Shifting to healthy diets can contribute to reducing health and climate-change costs because the hidden costs of these healthy diets are lower. The adoption of healthy diets can lead to a reduction of up to 97 per cent in direct and indirect health costs and 41–74pc in the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Dietary habits in Pakistan require realignment to more balanced, nutritious ingredients, by making a diverse range of foods accessible to the poor and by educating everyone on the negative health consequences of a diet dominated by energy-dense, low-nutrient foods.

On food availability, Pakistan has fared well, with a 2.7pc growth in agriculture in 2019-20 within an overall economic contr­ac­tion of 0.4pc. However, the growth was mos­tly due to livestock and three major crops. This relates to the challenge where only nine plant species in the world account for 66pc of crop production worldwide, despite over 30,000 known edible plants. Pakistan can do better at growing more diverse food.

If the pandemic has laid bare the fragility of agri-food systems, the precariousness of the agricultural labour force, the thin line that separates families from destitution, there are solutions.

This year, we celebrate the food heroes that have continued to grow, sustain and nourish us, and recognise more needs to be done: review the food supply chain in the context of the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investments, and put smallholder farmers at the centre of it; government, civil society and private sector engage in collective efforts to ensure smallholder farmers and off-farm ag-workers, women and men, can access financial resources, knowledge, technology and innovation; organise campaigns and leverage the Pakistan Dietary Guidelines for Better Nutrition to promote healthy eating habits; recognise invisible labour of agriculture workers; provide access to land to women and men farmers; rethink policies and actions to tackle agriculture productivity, climate change and food systems transformation with ambition and urgency to ensure the ‘new normal’ is better; call for and facilitate collective cross-sectoral action, global collaboration to support the vulnerable in times of shocks and crises.

Our future food systems need to ensure affordable and healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for food system workers, while preserving natural resources and biodiversity. This will help go a long way towards achieving zero hunger.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

Participants acknowledged the role of multilateralism, cooperation, and inclusivity in bringing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net zero.

Race to Zero Dialogues convened from 9-19 November 2020 in a virtual format, across multiple time zones, to allow more than 300 speakers from 65 countries to reflect on progress made on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Events focused on: climate and health; industry; transport; oceans, coastal zones, and water; nature-based solutions and land use; energy; regenerative, resilient food systems; built environment and cities and regions; and finance.

The Dialogues drew on the ‘Climate Action Pathways’ report, which provides an overview of the transformational actions needed for systemic transformations within sectors, and highlights synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas to enable an integrated approach.

Some of the key findings and outcomes include:

Climate and health : the launch of Pathfinder Initiative to map healthy climate solutions;

The report titled, ‘Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets,’ lauds the accelerating momentum for net-zero targets, noting that the number of net-zero pledges from cities, regions, and companies has about doubled since late 2019. In total, regions, cities, and companies with net-zero targets now represent over 880 million residents, 24.9 million employees, and 10 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

However, the report warns, nuances in target implementation approaches can determine the extent to which an actor’s target contributes to deep decarbonization. These nuances have implications for the additionality of the impact, the integrity of the actor’s claimed outcome, and the extent to which the approaches support or hinder efforts to solve decarbonization challenges.

The report categorizes the nuances according to whether they target the direct reduction of emissions, claim to neutralize emissions through offsetting, or support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. For example, under the direct reduction of emissions category, the report highlights a broad range of approaches for claiming the neutralization of electricity-related emissions and for supporting the reduction of supply chain and out-of-boundary emissions.

The report analyzes the impacts of different types of renewable energy delivery approaches and the risks and opportunities associated with the claiming of offsets in the post-2020 global governance framework under the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As uncertainties persist related to methodologies for calculating the climate impact of CO2 removal, the report recommends that these methodologies not be considered as equivalent to direct GHG reductions in claiming neutralization and that actors specify targets for emission reductions and emission removals separately.

The report finds that transparency enables accountability, unraveling ambiguity to assist the public in understanding and encourage an actor’s ambition. As transparency enables constructive dialogue about challenges faced, it results in greater solution-oriented ambition than making net-zero claims based in opaque accounting practices, it notes. Conversely, non-transparent net-zero targets can mislead stakeholders about environmental impact, resulting in decisions and behavior that can cause an increase in GHG emissions.

The report concludes by listing ten criteria for net-zero target transparency, including recommendations to chart a decarbonization pathway with interim targets and to commit to a timeline to revise and ratchet ambition.

The NewClimate Institute supports research and implementation of international action against climate change by generating and sharing knowledge on international climate negotiations, tracking climate action, climate and development, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.

In the last year, countries including China, Japan, the EU, and the Republic of Korea, as well as close to 200 companies and the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance were among the actors to pledge or announce significant strides towards net-zero targets.

Some experts are skeptical,"Canada has expressed interest in a new, smaller type of nuclear reactor that proponents say will be critical to help the country reach its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But there is debate among researchers, advocates and other experts on whether these new reactors are necessary to reach net-zero — or whether it's better accomplished by focusing efforts elsewhere.

Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, cautions that any stance on the role small modular reactors will play in Canada's energy future depends on research and data that could still be years away.

""We have a data set, currently, of zero,"" he told What on Earth.

""You can forecast what they might be based on technical assessments ... but it's based on no real data. It's based just on what we hope will come out of different plans.""

Daniel Kammen is a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley. (Elena Zhukova/Submitted by Daniel Kammen)

Small modular reactors, or SMRs for short, are smaller than a conventional nuclear power plant and can be manufactured in a factory before being transported and assembled elsewhere — something proponents say will lower costs.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN organization for nuclear cooperation, considers an SMR to be ""small"" if it generates under 300 megawatts of electricity, compared to traditional nuclear reactors that typically generate about 800 megawatts, or about enough to power about 600,000 homes at once (assuming that 1 megawatt can power about 750 homes).

The federal government called it the ""next wave of innovation"" in nuclear energy technology and an ""important technology opportunity for Canada.""

In October, the federal government announced it was investing $20 million into Terrestrial Energy to help the Oakville, Ont., company develop its design of a small modular reactor.

Last December, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe released a joint statement committing to developing SMRs in Canada. Alberta joined that agreement in August. While the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is currently conducting pre-licensing reviews on several designs, forecasts suggest it could be years, perhaps 2030, before SMRs would be operating in Canada.

(CBC News)

According to the Canadian Nuclear Association's SMR roadmap, the small reactors would help replace energy capacity lost by closing coal plants, help power off-grid projects like mines and oilsands sites, and replace diesel fuel in remote communities.

""We have not seen a model where we can get to net-zero emissions by 2050 without nuclear,"" Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan told The House in September.

""This is a zero-emission energy source.""

Nuclear energy is actually considered a low-emission — not zero-emission — energy source by the International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others .

While the nuclear fission that takes place inside a reactor doesn't emit carbon, greenhouse gas emissions result from the surrounding processes and operations: mining the uranium, building the reactor and its eventual decommission.

""When you look at the entire fuel cycle and you broaden the lens across it, you start to capture a whole host of emissions that are often excluded,"" said Benjamin Sovacool, director of the energy group at the University of Sussex, and a lead author for the IPCC on how to mitigate climate change between now and 2050.

Sovacool said that renewables like solar and wind provide a bigger bang for the buck to lower emissions, and are widely available now, unlike SMRs.

""Nuclear power is like fighting world hunger with caviar, it's like using the most expensive option when there are far more plentiful and nutritious options available when you account for the costs,"" he told What on Earth.

'A real, necessary tool': Nuclear association head

John Gorman, however, is convinced nuclear power is the way forward — and that SMRs are a crucial part of the plan.

He's the president and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Association — but before that, he was head of the Canadian Solar Industries Association.

""When I moved over from the renewable side, I had to do a lot of homework to really look into the technology, its track record, the way that it deals with some of the issues that are of most concern to people,"" he told Lynch.

""I've come to the realization after all of that that really there is no way to net zero without nuclear. And secondly, it just is a really safe, remarkable technology.""

Gorman pointed to decades of North American experience working with nuclear energy, and affirmed the importance of going through the regulatory process throughout development to ensure SMRs are as safe and efficient as possible.

He said the seven-to-10-year estimates for SMRs to become a reality in Canada are ""a blink of an eye in terms of energy planning,"" and that they will become ""a real, necessary tool"" for Canada's net-zero targets.

Kammen isn't convinced that SMRs have quite yet earned a green light.

""You ... have to worry about the end of life and the risk issues that are not a feature of wind or solar,"" he said.,

""A bad batch of solar panels is actually a learning event, whereas a bad batch of components for a nuclear plant can be catastrophic.""

SMRs 'a dangerous distraction': Environmentalist rep

Kerrie Blaise, staff lawyer at the Canadian Environmental Law Association, said SMRs and nuclear energy present ""a dangerous distraction from real climate action.""

Her stance is echoed by more than 25 environment and citizens' groups, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and Equiterre, which released a statement in October .

Blaise said the modular nature of SMRs means that fuel for the reactors — and, eventually, the radioactive waste they produce — will have to be transported more frequently, especially if they are deployed in remote locations like mines and Indigenous communities.

She added that ""the economics don't add up"" regarding arguments that nuclear energy should be ""part of the mix"" along with renewable energy.

""The cost of renewables continues to go down due to incremental manufacturing and installation improvements, while nuclear, despite having had half a century of industrial experience, continues to have costs that are rising,"" she said.

Nuclear power has been declining worldwide for decades, and cost has been one challenge, according to a 2019 report from the IEA, which said ""new projects have been plagued by cost overruns and delays.""

Kammen said he's seen a large amount of private sector investment in SMRs, which could help accelerate development to make it competitive alongside renewables like solar and wind.

But it will be some time, he said, before anyone can guess what ""mix of technologies"" will be best.

""These new nuclear plants need to perform at a cost level that we have not seen. They need to perform at a reliability level we haven't seen.... And then finally, the most critically, these plants have to be demonstrated to be operated safely during their lifetime and for the fuel management at the end of life cycle,"" he said.

""That's a big list of ifs. So I'm rooting for nuclear, but I think that list of challenges is exceedingly long.""

The report finds that rapid breakthroughs in the areas of energy, industry, transport, human settlements, ocean and coastal zones, water, nature-based solutions and land use, and climate resilience are approaching “the tipping points necessary to reach zero emissions by 2050.”

The ‘Climate Action Pathways’ seek to provide a “blueprint” to coordinate climate action by cities, regions, businesses, and investors in the runup to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021. The pathways identify the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in each of the eight sectors considered. They provide an overview of “synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas that assist all actors to take an integrated approach.”

As an example, the transformational actions and milestones needed to achieve zero-carbon economy for ocean and coastal zones include:

Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are ended by 2021, and science-based management is implemented to restore fish stocks in the shortest time possible;

30% of fully and highly protected marine protected areas are designated and implemented by 2030;

Resilience and adaptive capacity of ocean-dependent coastal communities (fisheries and aquaculture) are increased, and vulnerability assessments are conducted by 2025; and

Stable market of zero-carbon fuels is ensured by 2030.

Speaking at the launch, High-Level Climate Champion Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) underscored the need for “a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050” to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. “[I]t is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead,” he said.

The Climate Action Pathways, which complement the Yearbook of Global Climate Action, were unveiled during the Race to Zero Dialogues, running from 9-19 November 2020. The dialogues aim to explore ways to drive the systems’ transformations needed to mitigate climate change and build resilience to its impacts.

The Isle of Wight Distillery’s Mermaid brand has been certified Net Zero as it also marks a year of being plastic-free.

Vodka and gin brand Mermaid was certified as Net Zero by Good Business and is now offsetting its carbon emissions by supporting two carbon-positive projects.

The first project works with The Ocean Foundation, which is an extensive seagrass-growing project to preserve the Jobos Bay Reserve in Puerto Rico. The nature reserve encompasses seagrass beds, coral reefs and mangroves, and is also a habitat for manatees and hawksbill turtles.

The second project supports With One Seed, a community forestry enterprise in East Timor that works to replant forests, as well as combatting poverty and hunger.

Xavier Baker, co-founder and distiller, said: “We’ve always been passionate about protecting both our island and the planet, so net zero is just another stage in our sustainability journey.

“We have ambitious goals and are going to be announcing more initiatives that will give us even greater momentum in this crucial area.”

By Kim Harrisberg

JOHANNESBURG, Nov 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cape Town faces an 80% higher chance of another 'Day Zero' drought by the end of the century if greenhouse gas-emissions keep rising at current rates, research showed on Monday, as the South African city races to safeguard water supplies.

Following a 2018 drought in South Africa that nearly caused Cape Town's taps to run dry, known as Day Zero, officials have been working to avert further water crises that could put lives at risk and destroy livelihoods in the coming years.

Using new high-resolution simulations, researchers from Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated the role climate change could play in future droughts across the globe.

""In the worst-case scenario, events like the 'Day Zero' drought may become about 100 times more likely than they were in the early 20th-century world,"" said lead author Salvatore Pascale, a research scientist at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.

Around the world, stronger El Nino weather patterns and climate change are bringing harsher and more frequent droughts, and already-dry southern Africa has been particularly hard hit.

Cape Town's first ""Day Zero"" was only averted by the city making an aggressive push to conserve water, and officials hope that similar efforts can lessen the impact of future droughts in the country's second-biggest city.

Knowing the risk of drought recurrence, the city is increasing the use of groundwater, building a desalination plant, clearing water-hungry invasive plants and working towards a water reuse scheme, said a statement by city authorities.

""The strategy has already committed to delivering more than 300 million litres of additional supply per day over 10 years,"" Alderman Xanthea Limberg, the city's mayoral committee member for water and waste, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The Stanford study said parts of the world with a similar climate to South Africa, like California, southern Australia, southern Europe and parts of South America could face their own Day Zero droughts in the years ahead.

The climate modelling systems used in the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed a drought as severe as Day Zero could occur two or three times in a decade in southwestern South Africa.

The study also showed that the 2018 drought was made five-six times more likely by man-made climate change.

""I'm sure that many Cape Town residents have forgotten what happened now that lakes and water reservoirs are back to normal,"" Pascale said.

""But this is the moment to rethink the old way of managing water for a future when there will be less water available.""

The scoreboard had flip-flopped between Syracuse and Colorado, the two-time defending champions, multiple times. But the final time, it stuck on Syracuse’s name.

For the first time in 64 years, the Syracuse men’s cross country team were NCAA champions. Five years later, this is the story of how five Syracuse cross country runners won the national championship.

Terre Haute, Indiana

Nov. 22, 2014

After placing 10th the year prior, Syracuse finished fifth in the men’s national championship meet, missing the podium by one spot. It was Knight’s freshman year, but the defeat set up a notable offseason for the Orange.

Justyn Knight, Syracuse runner: I will never forget, I finished 143rd. I remember the exact number. I was in 60th halfway to go, (I) start cramping up, and everyone started to pass me like I was moving in slow motion … I personally felt like I let the team down.

Mark Pryor, former Syracuse runner: At about five miles, Justyn just didn’t have anything left. And he looked at (the alumni), and the look on his face was such despair, and he was like, “Man, I’m sorry.”

Joel Hubbard, Syracuse runner: We had our one off day that year at nationals in 2014, we were fifth. If you had asked us back in August, “How would you guys feel if you got fifth?” we wouldn’t have believed you. And here we were in November 2014 leaving Terre Haute disappointed, without a trophy.

Martin Hehir, Syracuse runner and top-finisher: The first top-10 finish was a motivator for the years to come. Cross country was the priority for us. We missed the podium by one place in 2014, which was the set-up for an awesome offseason.

Philo Germano, Syracuse runner: Colin (Bennie) and I stayed in Syracuse all summer and trained everyday. We put in a lot of miles, and remaining on campus allowed for our minds to stay focused and in the zone of getting ready for race day. We had to speak and work it into existence.

Chris Fox, head coach: From the day that race ended, we started working hard to win in 2015. And that’s what we thought about, and we had an outstanding track season that spring. A good track season is usually a good omen that you’re gonna have a really good fall cross country season.

When we came back in (August), I will never forget our first workout, we went faster than we did in the year prior, not even in our best shape. We were so much stronger. Justyn Knight, former Syracuse runner

Syracuse, New York

Aug. 31, 2015

After a strong offseason, a group of former SU cross country runners show up at practice with a gift. The title-winning season was just beginning.

Jamie Navarro, former Syracuse runner: As we were heading into the season, we wanted to do something for the team to let them know we were supporting them throughout the season. Since nationals were to be in Louisville, we had the idea of getting a Lousivlle Slugger baseball bat engraved with a Syracuse logo. We had local alumni come to present the bat to the team.

Knight: (The alumni) believed in us so much to take time out of their day to come to Syracuse and present us with the Slugger (and) have a talk with us about how much they believed in us. From that point on, it was about doing it not just for ourselves, but the alumni that wore that Orange jersey in the past.

Fox: From Aug. 15 — the day we started practice — until the race in late November, not one person in the top seven missed one day of practice for illness or injury. That is kind of a key to it all. We stayed healthy, and we trained well.

Knight: When we came back in (August), I will never forget our first workout. We went faster than we did in the year prior, not even in our best shape. We were so much stronger.

Chris Lotsbom, assistant editor for Race Results Weekly: Coach Fox had said from the beginning of the season in 2015 that Colorado was the number one all year and the seasoned favorite. From my outside standpoint, Syracuse had the ‘it’ factor in September. They gelled very well.

Sept. 25, 2015 Syracuse headed into the Coast-to-Coast Battle In Beantown two weeks after a second-place showing at an invitational at Penn State. The Orange were searching for their first victory in a 2015 meet. After this meet at Boston College, they didn’t lose for the rest of the season. Knight: We won Boston pretty handily. We won Wisconsin. We won ACCs. We were so used to being underdogs, but the momentum of gathering all these wins really boosted our confidence. Lotsbom: They had the depth needed for the national championship. They really built momentum from September up until the national championship. Colin Bennie, Syracuse runner: There was one Sweet Road workout … it was either the week before the ACCs or the week before regionals that fall. It’s just sort of this sort of historic day in all of our minds … I just remember everybody running way faster than anyone had ever run up at that point of Sweet Road before. I think we all just kind of looked at each other and were like, “Oh wow, we’re ready to roll. If we can do that, then we can do just about anything at this point.” Hubbard: While there was pressure on us, and we were under the spotlight, we never even thought about that. We were having fun. We lived with each other. We ran with each other. Pryor: Syracuse won the ACC Championships, and then we won the regionals. So, it was like a buildup. It was like an anticipation. Everybody kept saying, “Oh man, you’re right, this team is rocking. These guys are winning.” I said, “I told you. I’ve been watching this team for the last five years. They’re going to do it.” Louisville, Kentucky

Nov. 21, 2015 Fox’s squad knew since the start of the season that the goal was to reach the podium in Louisville, and the runners were fresh off a first-place finish at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championship eight days prior. Former SU runners traveled to E.P. “Tom” Sawyer State Park and set-up a tailgate-like atmosphere at the finish line. Navarro: On race day, we were there before sunrise, setting up shop as the runners from all teams started to warm up. Lotsbom: From the get-go, Syracuse’s presence was felt. Talking to them a day before the race, they knew the task at hand, and they were all business in order to run their best race, knowing that Colorado was going to be a top threat to their title hopes. Fox: I don’t really try to do anything on race day except keep everyone calm and just kind of smiling and happy … Our sport is not one where you just give a great speech and turn the game around. It’s one of a long buildup of training and confidence. Knight: Pre-race, I was really nervous … finishing 143rd (the year before) and seeing a bunch of people cross you, that was traumatizing for me … Coach Fox instilled some confidence in me, and I calmed down. Germano: The biggest piece of advice I was told before the race was from a former runner, Joe Allen: “Be patient and do not freak out if you feel like you are drowning in the beginning of the race.” Hehir: The day off, the alumni were there in full force, generations of Syracuse runners. It was the first time I saw someone tailgate a cross country meet. Jennifer Knight, Justyn’s mother: It was my first tailgate experience ever. We stayed all the way to the end. It was fantastic to see how all the camaraderie and the history of the ‘Cuse alumni work together to support the team in the biggest race of the year. Knight: They were so loud, I could hear them during the race … Just seeing our alumni and fans go crazy made us want to win that championship. Hubbard: We all had to have a great day, but somebody had to step up on the unexpected day, and that ended up working out — it ended up being Philo Germano.

Once the race began, SU’s top runners took the lead, with Knight finishing fourth and Bennie and Hehir finishing seconds apart at eighth and ninth, respectively. But it was Germano, the unheralded walk-on, whose race stood out the most. In the last 1K, he passed 13 runners on his way to finishing 39th. Hubbard: (Germano) was 80th or something at the Wisconsin meet that fall, and then he ended up being 39th at nationals. People don’t make that jump usually. If anything, people usually go backwards … For Philo to jump, it was such a remarkable thing, and it was the difference maker. Germano: I thought I was at least in the 100s and began to freak out. I eventually came to a comfortable mindset in the last 2K and started to pick up speed. It was a jolt for me to cross the finish line while passing as many people as I can. Sara Germano, Philo’s mother: When my daughter and I were running to go to the back to find all the runners, I remember running in this big field, and this guy comes up, and he grabs me and hugs me, and it was Coach (Adam) Smith, and he says, “He did it, he did it.” Germano: I am pretty sure Coach Fox came up to me at the hotel and asked, “What the f*ck was that?” I think that summed up how we all felt about the race.

With Syracuse’s top five runners under the tent by the finish line, the scoreboard eventually landed on Syracuse’s name. The Colorado team, standing right next to Syracuse, congratulated the cross country champions on the spot. Long-awaited celebrations ensued. Fox: When they started posting the scores on the scoreboard, it kept changing … For a little bit we won, for a little bit Colorado won, and finally they posted the official score, and we won. Yeah, it was amazing. Pryor: The NCAA took so much time in announcing the winner, and so we’re standing there, and for a long time — for at least an hour — the big scoreboard kept saying that Colorado won. So we’re like, not bad, we came in second … All of a sudden, I start hearing people screaming. And so, I looked at one of my former teammates, and I said, “Wouldn’t it be something if we won.” … Somebody says, “We won.” And I said, “No way.” Chris Getman, former Syracuse runner: I love the fact that they caught some people off guard. It was an upset, but in hindsight, it came from less than a decade, from ground zero to a national championship. It is just unbelievable. Tom Ryan, former Syracuse runner: It was like being at a basketball game in the Dome when it’s overtime against Georgetown … It was that kind of excitement, when everybody’s on their feet, and they win the game at the last second — in overtime. That was the kind of thrill that all of us had when they announced they had won. We planned on something, we built for it for 10 years and we got there. Chris Fox, former Syracuse men’s cross country head coach The team celebrated on the podium with numerous alumni and spoke with Ryan Urie, a member of the 2014 team who was battling leukemia, on FaceTime. That morning, the players took photos with the national championship trophy and the engraved Louisville Slugger bat and waved 6-foot Syracuse flags in celebration. Bennie: Whoever thought to get (Ryan) up on the phone for FaceTime and have him be held in front of the trophy, that was very special. And I know my parents have a picture of us up on the podium like that, and you can see Ryan Urie on the FaceTime, and he’s got a smile from ear to ear … I know getting to share that experience with him probably meant even more than the experience itself just because he shaped … pretty much everyone on that team just as much as we all shaped each other. Knight: Seeing Coach Fox, Smith and (Brien) Bell being so happy because they have been there longer than us, building the program up against critics that said they would never win an NCAA championship, just to see their faces was heartwarming. Fox: We planned on something. We built for it for 10 years, and we got there. Pryor: To Coach Fox’s credit, he had every one of the alumni take a picture with the NCAA plaque. So everyone got to hold the NCAA plaque, which none of us had ever done … Everybody now shared in the memory of Syracuse winning a national title in cross country. Hehir: We carried that trophy all over the city that night. We never fell asleep. Even for a 7 a.m. flight, we were running off the high of winning. We were just obnoxious, carrying the trophy, still cheering. We tucked the trophy in, gave it his own seat.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

Canada is one of the 193 countries that committed to achieving the United Nations’ Global Goals, including Goal 13 for climate action. You can join the Global Citizen movement and call on world leaders to tackle climate change and end extreme poverty by 2030 here.

The government of Canada unveiled its roadmap to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a commitment that follows up on promises made in the Speech from the Throne.

The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which was introduced in the House of Commons by Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Thursday, sets out ambitious measures to reach key climate targets within the next three decades.

If passed, the bill would require the government to answer to Parliament every five years — 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2050 — and to report on progress made on a rolling basis. Each of these targets reflects Canada’s international commitments on carbon neutrality, and achieving them would mean that any carbon emissions produced in 2050 would be completely offset by environmental actions such as planting trees — up to 2 billion, according to the government.

If future governments fail to meet the targets outlined in the plan, they will be required to justify what hindered their achievement and detail how to reverse the trend, although no legally binding sanctions are to be enforced as the proposal currently stands.

The bill also provides for the implementation of an independent net-zero advisory body, which will share “expert advice” with the government on ways to achieve climate goals. It will do so by engaging with Indigenous governments, organizations, civil society groups, provinces, territories, municipalities, and more.

Related Stories Canada Just Announced Its Plan to Tackle COVID-19, Climate Change, Racism, and More

An added annual reporting process will help solidify accountability and transparency among all current and future stakeholders, the government said.

In a press release, Wilkinson has welcomed the bill, stressing its crucial importance in the creation of a safer, greener Canada.

“Reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is what the science says we must achieve, and this 30-year project will require every future government to take actions to grow our economy while reducing emissions in every sector,” he said. “This achievement is necessary to ensure our kids and grandkids can live in a world with cleaner air and water and to ensure our businesses maintain and gain a competitive edge by producing the low-carbon products the world wants to buy, well into the future.”

But critics argue that the plan falls short of their expectations.

In the absence of strong penalties imposed on the government if it fails to meet its targets, opposition parties say the plan is nothing but a smokescreen.

Activists also worry that the current plan will not hold the current government accountable. Groups like Climate Action Network Canada have called for intermediary 2025 and 2030 targets to ensure accountability and avoid backloading climate goals onto future governments, which could end up repealing the bill altogether.

“After five years in power, and a record of unfulfilled emissions reductions commitments, the government has given us more smoke and mirrors,” Green Party Leader Annamie Paul told reporters on Thursday. “There is only talk of accountability about a plan that will be developed at some future date. That's not what we expected, that is not what we need.”

Canada is one of the 120 countries that have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050.

Some provinces and cities, such as Guelph, Vancouver, Hamilton, Toronto, Halifax, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, have already committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Recently, South Korea and Japan, which both sit among the world’s most fossil fuel-reliant countries, have also taken concrete steps towards achieving carbon neutrality within the next 30 years.","The government of Canada unveiled its roadmap to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a commitment that follows up on promises made in the Speech from the Throne.

244,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/cape-town-day-zero-drought-risk-lurking-around-the-corner-study-74260,"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Down To Earth Magazine,Cape Town ‘Day Zero’ drought risk lurking around the corner: Study,"South African cities should prepare themselves for similar drought conditions, warned the study

The human-caused climate change made the ‘Day Zero’ drought in southwestern South Africa — named after the day when Cape Town’s municipal water supply would need to be shut off — five to six times more likely. Such extreme events could go from being rare to common events by the end of the century.

These were the findings of the researchers from Department of Earth System Sciences, Stanford University and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

It was published in journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences November 9, 2020.

Cape Town witnessed its ‘Day Zero’ drought in 2018, where its storage reservoirs catering to 3.7 million people went below 20 per cent level. This triggered an alarm and the city’s municipal unit started imposing restrictions to delay further decrease to 13.5 per cent limit, where the water supplies in the city would have been disconnected.

Winter rains improved the situation to avoid entering the day zero scenario. The city had received less than normal rainfall for three years before. The unplanned water conservation and management practices by the authorities also exacerbated the situation.

The study highlighted that several cities that did not face such drought conditions and may not be ready for the emerging risks. They needed to explore such risks and plan ahead, it said.

To explore such risks, cities should be aware of the reasons and meteorological conditions working as triggers that make these conditions unavoidable.

The researchers developed on a future scenario using the latest newly developed model SPEAR (Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research), which is a global climate modelling system developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.

It was used to project and analyse the seasonal to multi-decadal data, which would fuel the analysis of the probability of the regional climate and extremes.

The model predicted that by the end of the century, the risk of multiyear droughts of extreme nature could hit the region due to the high green-house gas emission scenario.

The study was undertaken with a higher precision model, but it matched the findings of the various studies that have simulated similar findings in the past.

The anthropogenic climate change has been linearly increasing the degree of global warming, which make the drought conditions 1.4 times more likely in the future. It was this reason that made Day Zero five-six times more likely in Cape Town.

Extreme weather conditions would incur severe economic costs and loss of productivity. But better forecasts and planning can avoid catastrophic situations, enabling it to manage better and making it less catastrophic.","Cape Town witnessed its ‘Day Zero’ drought in 2018, where its storage reservoirs catering to 3.7 million people went below 20 per cent level.

(Bloomberg) -- North America’s biggest petroleum pipeline may take several more days to recover from a cyberattack that forced it to halt shipments of gasoline and other fuels, raising the specter for shortages if local reserves run out.Colonial Pipeline said segments of its Texas-to-New Jersey line are being brought back online in steps, easing some of the most immediate concerns that pumps in major population centers up and down the U.S. East Coast could run dry. The question now is whether regional inventories held in storage tanks are enough to satisfy demand while Colonial works on resuming operations.The conduit has been shut down since late Friday, prompting frenzied moves by traders and retailers to secure alternative supplies. On Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation pointed the finger at a ransomware gang known as DarkSide. The pipeline hasn’t suffered any physical damage and no fuel shortages have been detected, a White House official said.Emergency shipments of gasoline and diesel from Texas already are on the way to Atlanta and other southeast cities via trucks, and at least one Gulf Coast refinery began trimming output amid expectations that supplies will begin backing up in the nation’s oil-refining nexus. Airlines flying out of Philadelphia International Airport are burning through jet-fuel reserves and will need to locate new supplies “soon,” a spokeswoman said.Government officials haven’t advised Colonial on whether it ought to pay the ransom, Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger said during a briefing.The national average retail gasoline price rose to $2.967 a gallon on Monday, a 2.4% increase from Friday, according to AAA. The premium for wholesale gasoline in the New York area expanded to its widest in three months.The attack came just as the nation’s energy industry was preparing to meet stronger fuel demand from summer travel. Americans are once again commuting to the office and booking flights after a year in lockdown. Depending on the duration of the disruption, retail prices could spike, further stoking fears of inflation as commodity prices rally worldwide.DarkSide said in a post on the dark web that it wasn’t to blame and hinted that an affiliate group may have been behind the attack. The group promised to do a better job of screening customers that buy its malware.Gasoline futures that initially surged as much as 4.2% in overnight trading surrendered most of those gains on Monday.Convenience-store chains in places like Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, began clamoring for emergency fuel deliveries on Friday afternoon, said Steve Boyd, senior managing director at Houston-based distributor Sun Coast Resources Inc.Landlocked cities face the greates danger of fuel shortages compared with those with access to water-borne deliveries, Boyd said. If the pipeline remains down for many more days, he’s anticipating a “massive surge” in orders. Sun Coast, which operates about 900 trucks, has delivered emergency supplies during 75 major storms over the past 15 years, including during hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017.Although the attack on the Colonial system is “unprecedented,” the conduit ought to be back in service in three to five days, Amrita Sen, co-founder of consultant Energy Aspects Ltd., told Bloomberg TV just hours before the pipeline company announced it’s end-of-week target.Gasoline for June delivery rose 0.3% to $2.133 a gallon at 1:52 p.m. in New York. Futures prices have gained more than 50% this year, helped by the recovery from the worst effects of the pandemic.Tankers BookedPrior to Colonial’s Monday statement, traders were seeking vessels to deliver fuel to coastal terminals. Four vessels were provisionally chartered to send diesel or gasoline from Europe to the U.S. Atlantic Coast, according to Danish oil-product tanker company Torm A/S.Some tankers are also being secured to temporarily store gasoline along the Gulf Coast, according to market participants who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Meanwhile, Total SE scaled back activity in a key unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery because of the Colonial shutown, according to a person familiar with operations.Increased SecurityColonial halted all operations on its system late Friday after suffering a ransomware attack that affected some of its IT systems.The event is just the latest example of critical infrastructure being targeted by ransomware. Hackers are increasingly attempting to infiltrate essential services such as electric grids and hospitals. The escalating threats prompted the White House to respond last month with a plan to increase security at utilities and their suppliers. Pipelines are a specific concern because of the central role they play in the U.S. economy.“It’s an all-hands-on-deck effort right now,” said U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “We are working closely with the company, state and local officials to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren’t disruptions in supply.”The White House pulled together an inter-agency task force to address the breach, including exploring options for lessening its impact, according to an official. President Joe Biden can invoke an array of emergency powers to ensure supplies keep flowing to big cities and airports along the East Coast.Rules EasedSome rules curbing domestic transportation of fuel have been eased to help deal with any shortages. That doesn’t extend to waiving Jones Act, a measure that would allow foreign tankers to help shuffle more petroleum products between U.S. ports.“There are ways to get around this,” said Jeff Currie, global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Importantly, the Department of Transportation has lifted any restrictions around trucking and boat transportation, which means you can use other avenues of transportation to deal with this.”Colonial has the capacity to send about 2.5 million barrels (105 million gallons) a day from Houston as far as North Carolina, and another 900,000 barrels a day to New York.Extortion FeeRansomware cases involve hackers seeding networks with malicious software that encrypts the data and leaves the machines locked until the victims pay the extortion fee. This would be the biggest attack of its kind on a U.S. fuel pipeline.With gasoline inventories ample, pump prices weren’t expected to tick much higher until Memorial Day at the end of May, which is traditionally viewed as the start of the U.S. summer driving season. If the pipeline doesn’t restart soon it will accelerate the move higher.“Atlanta will be one of the earlier sore spots, along with eastern Tennessee, and perhaps the Carolinas,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.The Northeast can secure gasoline shipments from Europe but it will come at an increasing cost the longer the pipeline stays shut. The fuel’s premium to crude in northwest Europe had jumped by more than 5% in intra-day trading earlier on Monday but was still down week-on-week.In the meantime, fuel producers including Marathon Petroleum Corp. are weighing alternatives for how to ship their products to the Northeast.One potential route is the Kinder Morgan-operated Plantation Pipeline, even though it only extends as far north Washington D.C. and has a capacity of 720,000 barrels a day, far short of Colonial’s. Kinder said Sunday it’s working with customers to accommodate additional barrels during Colonial’s outage, and that Plantation is deferring where possible any non-essential maintenance that might otherwise reduce flow rates.While all of the major segments of Colonial’s system remain offline, some smaller so-called laterals connecting specific fuel terminals to delivery points are in service, the company said earlier.Inventories offer minimal cover, ClearView Energy Partners said in a research note. Tankers leaving Rotterdam could take up to 14 days to make the trip to the New York Harbor. The Midwest could theoretically send some of its supplies to the East Coast via rail and barge, but the region’s inventories are tighter than in previous years, ClearView said.“The Colonial outage comes at a critical juncture for the recovering U.S. economy: the start of the summer driving season,” ClearView said. “We therefore think lawmakers could begin a ‘blame game’ immediately, and a sustained disruption that leads to a significant pump price spike could increase prospects of domestic policy interventions.”(Adds White House comments in third, fifth paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","On Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation pointed the finger at a ransomware gang known as DarkSide.

249,https://www.eco-business.com/news/engie-kicks-off-new-singapore-research-project-to-make-net-zero-carbon-happen/,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Engie kicks off new Singapore research project to make net zero carbon happen,"On a small island south of Singapore, a green hydrogen-powered electric vehicle rolls past a solar farm leisurely soaking up the sun’s energy. Towering over the scene is Singapore’s tallest wind turbine, humming quietly as its blades rotate in a gentle, tropical breeze.

What sounds like the next weekend getaway for energy geeks is Singapore’s biggest microgrid at the nation’s Pulau Semakau landfill, commissioned this month by French multinational electric utility company Engie to demonstrate how to generate clean power from multiple sources and test energy-efficient industrial solutions in tropical conditions.

Technology plays a pivotal role in the fight against climate change. But despite the great strides that renewables have made in recent years, some low-carbon solutions needed to power the world’s industries sustainably while curbing energy use have yet to mature.

To fast-track the global transition to a carbon-neutral economy, research and development (R&D) efforts that can build new and better technologies as well as showcase how different solutions can work together and complement each other have, in other words, never been more critical.

Dubbed the REIDS-SPORE project, Engie’s new facility was launched at the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) under Nanyang Technological University’s Renewable Energy Integration Demonstrator (REIDS) initiative, an R&D platform which provides a testbed for Singapore’s ongoing energy research.

Engie’s latest innovation programme run under its local R&D centre ENGIE Lab Singapore will explore solutions for green electricity access in Southeast Asia and the future of urban power distribution, as well as climate-friendlier cooling systems and data centres.

The facility is backed by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and developed in collaboration with Nanyang Technological University and French electrical equipment maker Schneider Electric. Engie hopes the project will contribute to developing more local partnerships.

It joins two ongoing pilots that the company—which invests €190 million in energy research annually—runs in Singapore to study radiative cooling technology and the use of low-temperature, or cryogenic, liquids for energy storage.

Engie’s project is the biggest of the eight potential microgrids under the REIDS initiative, with three already in operation. Ultimately, the REIDS platform plans to interconnect all its decentralised networks to emulate a future distributed energy scenario.

Speaking at SIEW earlier this month, Loic Villocel, managing director of the ENGIE Lab Singapore, said the project arose from the need to improve green energy technologies and meet the world’s rapidly growing demand for electricity. “To make the global switch to clean energy a reality, investing in research and innovation to bring down costs and de-risk emerging technologies is key,” he said.

Across Southeast Asia, renewables are on the rise. Declining costs of key technologies, as well as concerns over emissions and air pollution, have begun to alter the balance of future additions to the region’s energy mix, with recent revisions to power development plans boosting the share of renewables, typically at the expense of coal.

But renewables’ wildly fluctuating power output continues to give Southeast Asia’s energy planners headaches as utility firms struggle to upgrade underdeveloped power distribution networks fast enough to keep up with the clean energy industry’s growth.

Meanwhile, the bloc’s population boom, along with burgeoning incomes and economic growth, is forecast to send energy demand rising by 60 per cent by 2040, with some 45 million people still lacking access to electricity.

Experts say microgrids supported by storage solutions could not only help spur the deployment of renewables but also electrify rural areas faster. They are also often more affordable than centralised energy systems powered by fossil fuels and make more resilient power grids that can be quickly restored to functionality if damaged during a natural disaster.

Forging tomorrow’s energy systems

Engie opened its Singapore lab in 2016 to act as a regional hub for energy innovation and technology, the same year it pledged to slash its direct emissions by 85 per cent by 2050 to align with the Paris Agreement’s objective of capping global warming at 2 degrees Celsius.

The REIDS-SPORE microgrid has been in the works ever since. Initially focused on smart grids, energy efficiency in industries, and smart cities, the company’s research in Singapore has expanded, adding new facilities to study energy-efficient cooling technologies and sustainable data centres.

“ The solutions needed to fight climate change are available today. The next step is to demonstrate through this platform that these technologies work. Dr. Peng Xiao Yang, R&D programme manager, ENGIE Lab Singapore

The project features the tools that Engie believes will help the world innovate its way out of the climate crisis, including wind and solar technologies, an extensive battery storage system and an integrated green hydrogen facility encompassing the fuel’s production, storage, and usage.

Green power produced onsite is used to supply an artificial load, which can be programmed to emulate different end-users. Surplus electricity is funnelled into batteries or converted into hydrogen, storing it for later use, while the microgrid is also backed up with diesel generators.

A smart energy management system optimises the usage of the microgrid’s different assets to lower maintenance costs and ensure reliable electricity supply.

“The REIDS-SPORE project combines today’s green technologies and the carbon-neutral technologies of the future,” said Engie Southeast Asia’s chief executive officer Thomas Baudlot.

“By testing them together, we can optimise how we design and operate tomorrow’s energy systems and build a concrete business case for investing in renewable technologies. And once they mature, we will be fully ready to scale them,” he said.

Green hydrogen—deemed the missing piece in the global clean energy puzzle—has gained global business momentum in recent years as experts emphasise its potential to overcome renewables’ intermittency challenges, but the investment and infrastructure needed for the technology to take off are currently lacking.

“In tomorrow’s energy market, hydrogen will play a key role in decarbonising heavy industry and various mobility sectors, but we need to push research on the topic to cut costs and accelerate adoption,” said Loic Villocel, managing director of the ENGIE Lab Singapore.

The latest additions to the REIDS-SPORE project will support Engie’s efforts to harness its cutting-edge technologies and research expertise to shrink the carbon footprint of two fast-growing, energy-guzzling industries—cooling and data centres—in the tropics and beyond.

Engie isn’t new to cooling solutions. In 2018, the firm announced an S$80 million (US$60 million) investment to set up its centre of expertise for district cooling in Singapore over a five-year period and build new and highly efficient cooling networks across the city-state and the Asia-Pacific region.

District cooling systems deliver chilled water from central facilities to buildings and indoor farms using around 40 per cent less energy than conventional air-conditioning.

In March, Engie clinched a project for the design of a district cooling system that will serve Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and community facilities in Punggol Digital District, Singapore’s latest flagship business park slated for completion in 2023.

In collaboration with JTC, the company is also studying novel radiative cooling technology, which uses high-tech mirrors—or “skycool” panels—designed to cool buildings far more efficiently than traditional air-conditioning by harnessing a peculiar quirk of optics that allows a narrow band of radiation to escape into space.

Besides cooling, the data centre industry’s skyrocketing energy consumption has also moved into the limelight. Even as major tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Apple scramble to power their operations with 100 per cent renewable electricity, governments have begun to pass more stringent standards, piling pressure on operators to clean up their act.

The European Union, for instance, wants to mandate data centres to become more energy-efficient and carbon-neutral by 2030, while Singapore, where data facilities account for 7 per cent of total energy usage, imposed a moratorium on new data centres last year due to concerns over the industry’s carbon footprint.

The freeze, which could last until 2021, is understood to buy time for the government to reassess the market while allowing industry players to come up with new and more sustainable solutions.

Which is why Engie wants to develop energy-efficient data centre cooling techniques and heat recovery solutions to ensure the global digitalisation drive does not end up wrecking the climate.

Dr. Peng Xiao Yang, R&D programme manager at ENGIE Lab Singapore, and lead for the REIDS-SPORE initiative, said: “The energy transition is really about technology and people’s mindsets. The solutions needed to fight climate change are available today. The next step is to demonstrate through this platform that these technologies work.”

Climate scientists now believe their predictions about the rate of the global temperature increase have been too conservative, and stronger and more decisive action is needed to reduce dangerous greenhouse gas emissions.

In this context, putting the emphasis on net zero emissions by 2050 simply helps the conservative parties, which are not moving away from their fossil fuel mates because the political pressure for change is not great enough.

The Climate Reality Check 2020 (CRC) by David Spratt, Ian Dunlop and Luke Taylor of the National Centre for Climate Restoration argue that an emergency response would make climate the number one priority of politics and economics.

They provide accessible data showing that warming is speeding up and that a global 1.5°C warming is likely by 2030–or even earlier. Warming has accelerated over 2010–19 they say, and the next 25 years are projected to warm at a rate of 0.25–0.35°C per decade.

Warming faster

The conservative estimates made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been shattered: the latest generation of climate models suggest 1.5°C may be only five to seven years away–a decade ahead of the IPCC projections.

CRC says the faster rate of warming is the direct result of rising greenhouse gas emissions, as well as declining air pollution and natural climate cycles. These lead to ocean stratification, with a hotter top layer contributing to faster warming.

CRC quotes British Professor of Energy and Climate Change Kevin Anderson as saying the world is currently on a path to 3–5ºC warming by 2100. He warned that a 4°C warmer future is “incompatible with an organised global community”. That sort of temperature rise is “beyond adaptation”, he said, because it will “devastate the majority of ecosystems and has a high probability of not being stable”.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has also estimated that on current international greenhouse emission commitments, the world is heading for 3.4ºC rise from pre-industrial revolution levels by 2100. For Australia, this translates into a hard-to-conceptualise 4.4ºC rise.

Ominously, CRC states that:

Only if the unmanageable is avoided is there a chance to stabilise the system. The evidence from tipping points alone suggests we are in a state of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are acute.… If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping point cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilization.

The Earth is entering the sixth mass extinction event in its history. In this context, and with the movement still very disparate, radical climate activists need to be clear about what strategy will help and what is simply a detour.

2050 targets a detour

Independent MP for Warringah Zali Steggall’s bill for climate action by 2050 fits into the latter category. As climate campaigner David Spratt tweeted on November 8: “For Australia, zero #climate emissions by 2050 has NO basis in the science and is in complete disregard of ANY notion of climate justice.”

Steggall’s bill is attracting broad support because of the major parties’ inaction: it is being marketed as “the plan” to set targets between 2030 and 2050 and, because there are no targets, it fills the vacuum.

SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat. Get our best delivered to your inbox.







The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has just joined the list of corporate, medical and other supporters of Stegall’s bill. Spokesperson Michele O’Neil said on November 9 that it “offers the [Scott] Morrison government a chance to join with the rest of the world in addressing the existential threat posed by climate change”.

But does it?

Climate scientists argue that net zero emissions by 2050 is too late to avoid catastrophic climate change, and especially for the countries of the South.

Steggall’s bill is largely about the creation of a new Climate Change Commission (CCC), which would set shorter-term targets and report on Australia’s emissions and preparedness for climate change. But its five-member commission would have no power to force government to act. It can only advise. The government can ignore it.

O’Neil said “the reality of climate change” means “we must act now to avoid it” and that “workers affected by the changes necessary to meet the 2050 targets” need “a just transition”. The peak union body has dragged its feet on climate change.

O’Neil is rightly critical of the federal government’s inaction. But the ACTU should also criticise the Labor opposition which, so far, has also avoided setting new 2030 targets. The resignation from the shadow cabinet of the fossil fuel promoting resources spokesperson Joel Fitzgibbon may change that. But while Labor supports new coal and gas projects, its climate plan will fall well short of what is necessary.

O’Neil said: “Businesses and working people need policy certainty on climate change.” She is correct.

But Steggall’s bill, which remains silent on new coal and gas, is not the route. Indeed, it assumes that coal and gas exports will continue. Steggall’s bill proposes that the new CCC “must report to the Minister on the effect of Australia’s fossil fuel export emissions”.

Too little, too late

Her push for net zero emissions by 2050 is too little too late, and setting up a longer timetable, essentially aimed at helping corporations adapt, ends up protecting the profits of the fossil fuel producers. Her adaptation push only weakens the movement.

“Adaption is no substitute for deep climate mitigation and restoration because it is not possible for most people and nature to adapt to 3–5°C of warming this century”, CRC said.

This is why Steggall’s bill is totally inadequate. As Green Left said of her bill in February:

It appeals to those who do not have confidence that the emerging climate movement can build up enough power to win its demands, including for no new coal and gas.

If the ACTU was serious about its members’ jobs and climate action, it would be at least championing the Australian Greens’ proposals to quit coal and transition away from gas, while retraining affected workers.

CRC says “zero emissions, even in a decade, coupled with large scale drawdown, is not sufficient to negate the existential risk”.

This means unions and the climate movement need to be bold and step up the pressure on all parties for serious climate action.","2050 targets a detourIndependent MP for Warringah Zali Steggall’s bill for climate action by 2050 fits into the latter category.

Unite said the decision not to place employees on furlough now leaves zero hours workers facing impoverishment, with almost half of the workers also losing their accommodation due to financial hardship.

The union called the response from the university as ""among the most callous received from any employer during this pandemic"".

But Queen's University said it was left with no choice, with no reasonable expectation of some sections of the university being able to reopen in the foreseeable future and no commitment to provide casual hours of work in this academic year, leaving staff no longer eligible for the scheme.

""Queen's flatly refused to avail of government furlough payments under the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to obtain pay supports for casual and zero hours workers at student union facilities,"" said Unite Hospitality organiser, Neil Moore.

""Almost half of these workers are students trying to work their way through college; they can't access income support benefits, leaving them facing a real financial crisis. In a recent survey, 92% told us the loss of this work had affected their studies already.

""Devastatingly, 45% of our members told us they've lost their living accommodation as a result of losing this income. Many are being made technically homeless in the process.

""This action and the dreadful impact it will have is completely unnecessary. The financial supports exist to support these workers while these facilities are temporarily closed.

""Our members are genuinely shocked that Queen's is refusing to lift a finger, at no cost to themselves, to support them.""

Mr Moore added: ""In less than 24 hours, more than 800 signed a solidarity petition calling on Queen's to avail of the government's furlough scheme.""

In a statement Queen's responded: ""The university has successfully moved many of its core functions online but there are some services, critical to the successful operation of the university in normal times, which could not be provided as a result of ongoing restrictions.

""This includes The Speakeasy, the Students' Union Bar, which is not now expected to open during this academic year,"" a spokesperson said.

""The university has utilised the Government's furlough scheme (CJRS) for staff who are considered to meet the eligibility criteria laid out by the HM Revenue and Customs, and has topped up the pay of those impacted to 100%.

""The furlough scheme can only be offered to part-time or casual staff where work has been assigned to them that cannot take place.

""As there has been no reasonable expectation of the Speakeasy reopening and no commitment to provide casual hours of work this academic year, unfortunately, these staff are no longer eligible for the CJRS.""

The statement added: ""The university fully appreciates that this is a challenging time for our community and has taken steps to support students who are suffering financial hardship as a result of the pandemic.

""The university's hardship fund is available to all students in financial difficulties are encouraged to apply for this support. Other opportunities for casual work, whilst limited, are also being offered to students and casual workers wherever possible.""

ADOMANI’s zero-emission electric vehicles are focused on reducing the total cost of vehicle ownership and help fleet operators unlock the benefits of green technology and address the challenges of traditional fuel price instability and federal environmental regulatory compliance.

The Company has developed advanced zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for integration in new buses and medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles. Adomani provide re-power conversion kits to replace conventional drivetrain systems for combustion powered vehicles with zero-emission electric drivetrain systems. The Companies vehicles and drivetrain systems are designed to help fleet operators unlock the benefits of technology that reduces greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide particulate matter and other pollutants, as well as to address the challenges of local, state and federal regulatory compliance and traditional-fuel price cost instability. The Companies vehicles and drivetrain systems can include options for telemetrics for remote monitoring, electric power-export and various levels of grid-connectivity. Adomani zero-emission products may also grow to include automated charging infrastructure and “intelligent” stationary energy storage that enables fast vehicle charging, emergency back-up facility power, and access to the developing, grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs.

On November 12 ADOM announced Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results; Sales, severely impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions and the administrative delays and lack of access to HVIP funds, were approximately $164,000 and $577,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to $5.7 million and $10.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.

The Company has made a lot of progress in recent mont hiring new CEO Phillip Oldridge; a senior executive with over 30 years of proven experience leading teams and delivering results in the electric transportation industries. Mr. Oldridge has been responsible for the introduction of a number of new EV products to the marketplace. According to Adomani previous CEO James L. Reynolds resigned in October and this was not the result from a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to our operations, policies, or practices.

Adomani recently sold an all-electric, zero-emission logistics van to the City of Palmdale, California in July. The EV van will be used to deliver food and supplies to, and collect donations to benefit, residents in the South Antelope Valley Emergency Services (SAVES) program that is dedicated to alleviating hunger among very low and extremely low-income families and individuals in the SAVES service area. The Company also received a purchase order from the Pittsburg, California Unified School District Child Nutrition Services Department for one all-electric Class 5 box truck. It’s expected that the truck will be delivered in early 2021, and will be in service for the District to deliver food to its schools.

Phil Oldridge, CEO of ADOMANI, commented, “We wish Jim well in his retirement. As a result of the significant negative impact the COVID-19 virus has had on our business, combined with the lack of funding that continues to plague us, we have very recently had to make significant cost and headcount reductions in order to reduce cash burn until we are able to generate meaningful revenue again. While we support the government’s efforts to slow the spread of the virus while medical researchers try to create a vaccine, we also need to get the economy, and especially our business, going again, so we hope the relaxation of many of the restrictions happens soon, but that is out of our control. We remain convinced, however, that our biggest obstacle to success has been our inability to date to raise additional capital. Our most significant operating challenge remains the temporary inability for ADOMANI, a licensed California dealer for EV products and HVIP-certified since late October 2019, and our customers to access HVIP funding as a result of what we believe were serious administrative missteps by CARB and HVIP in 2019. The lack of access to HVIP funding has to-date prevented us from being able to deliver product to customers whose orders constitute the bulk of our backlog. We continue to believe that if those issues can be addressed and funds made available to us and our customers, we will benefit in 2021 from additional diversification of both our customer base and our product offerings. However, access to the HVIP funds may not be made available to us and others until ‘early 2021,’ per the HVIP website.

Spike Chunsoft describes the game:

One month after Subaru's new life in another world began, an emissary sent by the royal castle suddenly appears with news that the royal selection has been postponed, but offers no reason as to why. The postponement of this grand event that decides the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica stirs Subaru and his friends into action. They return to the royal capital only to find that a sixth candidate has claimed their stake for the throne. But the Dragon Stone prophesizes that only five candidates would be chosen. With one candidate being an imposter, suspicions are immediately cast toward one woman in particular: Emilia. What answers lie beyond the mysterious web of assassinations, betrayal, and conspiracies...?

Physical copies of the Day One Edition of the game will bundle four exclusive pins featuring Emilia, Subaru, Rem, and a new character. The Collector's Edition will include the pins, a SteelBook case, a soundtrack CD, and an art book with concept art, sketches, and commentary.

From initially re-establishing in 2006 to support the peace process in Mindanao, providing lifesaving food assistance in emergencies and disasters, improving the nutrition of tens of thousands of vulnerable populations, to development programmes that seek to improve the overall quality of life of the people it serves. Throughout all these activities, improving the food security and nutrition of the Filipino people was at the very core and the beating heart of its programming.

In 2020, the President of the Philippines signed Executive Order 101 creating an InterAgency Task Force on Zero Hunger (IATFZH).

The Task Force endeavors to put an end to hunger in the country by 2030, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero Hunger. As a staunch partner advocating zero hunger and informing policies on food security and nutrition in the country, WFP was a natural partner to this undertaking.

Together with other United Nations agencies such as the United Nations’ Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and World Health Organization (WHO), WFP had been selected by the Government to support the Zero Hunger Task Force in developing the National Food Policy and achieve the goals of the Task Force.

The Zero Hunger Task Force, led by the Cabinet Secretary, had set out six key results areas (KRA), each with their working group, disaggregate the priorities and assigned niche experts to ensure that each is on track to be achieved by 2030. WFP is currently providing technical assistance across all six KRAs which are as follows:

1) Review and Rationalization of Existing Policies, Rules, Regulations related to the EO

2) Ensure Available and Affordable food

3) Secure Nutrition Adequacy

4) Secure Food Accessibility and Safety

5) Ensure Resiliency and Food Stability for Emergencies

6) Ensure Information, Education, Awareness and People Participation

WFP’s wide array of experience in the food security and nutrition area will allow the agency to lend its expertise to the Government. In particular, lessons learned from projects – which include the iron-fortified rice pilot, stunting prevention programme, agricultural livelihood support in Mindanao, disaster preparedness and response, integration of food security and nutrition into local plans, and an upcoming social behavioral change communication project – enables WFP to provide extensive, specialized, and well-informed guidance in the development and popularization of the National Food Policy launched during World Food Day, 16th of October 2020.","The Philippine Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger The World Food Programme’s presence in the Philippines is constantly evolving.

The resurgence of hunger is one of the greatest problems we face today. A toxic mix of widespread civil war, poverty, and COVID-19 threatens to bring mass starvation on an unprecedented scale. Sadly, ending hunger and malnutrition is the one UN Sustainable Development Goal on which we have failed to make progress in recent years.

The World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 for “its efforts to combat hunger, for its contributions to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-afflicted areas, and for acting as a driving force to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”

Saudi Arabia has long advocated for global attention to food security issues. At the recent G20 meeting hosted in the Kingdom, members committed to greater investments in agricultural development. At various moments in history when the WFP faced funding shortfalls, Saudi Arabia came to the rescue of those most in need by making significant contributions; in the 1970s, and during the sharp rise in food prices in 2008, the Kingdom made the largest cash donations to WFP by a single donor up to those dates, which helped the WFP implement programs aimed at lessening the impact. In 2019, the Kingdom was the WFP’s fifth-largest donor through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center. Last year alone, the Kingdom invested $440 million in food assistance and agricultural development in 36 countries worldwide, the main focus being support to the WFP in Yemen for the past five years.

While starvation in conflict zones easily draws attention in the media, chronic hunger does not. There are so many drivers behind it: Poverty, discrimination, environmental degradation, and insufficient investment in agriculture. With each passing year, climate change inflicts more harm on farmers as they struggle to cope with rising temperatures and cruel cycles of flood and drought. After harvest, an astonishing 1.3 billion tons of food simply go to waste each year.

Add COVID-19 to the global hunger equation and we could soon see another pandemic — a hunger pandemic as brutally relentless as the virus itself. COVID-19 has taken over 1.7 million lives already. If we allow it to create a second pandemic of hunger and malnutrition, the cost in lives lost will be far more devastating. Hunger and malnutrition are already efficient killers, taking the lives of over 3 million children under 5 each year. We cannot allow the spread of COVID-19 to add fuel to that fire.

The COVID-19 pandemic has eaten into harvests, disrupted supply chains, and decimated the incomes of tens of millions of households. Where food is available, each day more people lack the money to buy it. All told, 270 million people may find themselves in an extreme hunger crisis in 2021, including about 30 million already on the brink of starvation.

What is the way forward? First, we must press all parties to honor the UN secretary-general's call for a global cease-fire, which is consistent with the Kingdom’s policy focused on peace as its strategic choice and one of the most important pillars of its foreign policy. If most hunger stems from politics, we need political solutions. Brokering peace will not only curb outbreaks of hunger in war zones, it will stem the surge of refugees and economic migrants now overwhelming many host countries.

Second, we must position food in the most vulnerable regions by year’s end. This is not just a task for governments. We all must help. If there was ever a time to share, it is now.

Third, we must take a strategic approach to aid working in tandem and with a true spirit of collaboration. “Smart funding” through multiyear and multisector donations can help donors have a broad impact beyond containing emergencies. Better targeting of aid to focus more on women and girls would surely pay off, as they are most often the victims of malnutrition. It is not enough for us to save lives if we do not fundamentally change lives.

Finally, we must build resilience in societies so they can better withstand shocks like COVID-19 in the future. We must start with youth. School closures have ended school meals for 370 million school children around the world and the WFP, Saudi Arabia, and other donors are already providing food assistance to strengthen nutrition and prevent disease among them. We cannot let a generation in the developing world become collateral damage in this pandemic — malnourished and uneducated, with little hope of leading productive lives.

If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is empathy. Even in wealthy nations, families with jobs one day could find themselves relying on government aid or food banks the next. Tens of millions in the developed world today no longer take food for granted and share the worries of the world’s poor in a way we never imagined possible. Perhaps in the pain COVID-19 has thrust upon us, we can finally come together and work toward building a world without hunger.

MANILA – The Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger has concluded a series of consultations from Nov. 26 to Dec. 4 with stakeholders in government and the private sector on the National Food Policy (NFP) which aims to address the priority concerns of hunger and poverty.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, who heads the task force, said the five-part consultation “KUMAIN” series sought for inputs, comments, and suggestions on the government's NFP which was launched last Oct. 16.

KUMAIN stands for the Kasapatan at Ugnayan ng Mamamayan sa Akmang Pagkain At Nutrisyon.

The consultation series was divided into five segments, which were all attended by development partners and international organizations including the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, World Food Program, Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, and the European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines.

Representatives from the academe, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, religious organizations and LGUs also participated.

Nograles said the initiative is intended to address hunger and poverty, improve nutrition among Filipino families, ensure food security, and establish a sustainable system of local agriculture.

""We conducted the KUMAIN consultations thoroughly with as many partners as possible because we wanted a comprehensive and doable set of solutions. We also wanted all stakeholders to actively participate in enforcing the NFP based on their own inputs,” he said in a statement.

He said he was looking forward to having ""a solid collaboration between the public and private sectors in implementing all their plans of action"".

""Hunger and poverty elimination are priorities of the Duterte administration. The NFP is another tangible tool we will use to address these twin priorities,"" he added.

The Task Force was created by virtue of Executive Order 101 which was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte on Jan. 10, 2020.

According to the Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey conducted from Sept. 17 to 20, more than 7 million Filipino households have experienced involuntary hunger at least once from June to August.

The SWS survey showed that families who experienced hunger due to lack of food to eat reached a new record-high of 30.7 percent. This figure surpassed the previous peak of 23.8 percent in March 2012.

La Manna, known for his pioneering waste-free recipes, joined our charity partner With Compassion at their kitchen in Westminster to help prepare the meals to be delivered later that day.

The charity has been supported by our Help the Hungry campaign throughout the pandemic to tackle food poverty in a year that has seen rates of hunger soar across the UK.

“It aligns with everything that I’m doing,” the chef said. “Covid-19 has impacted everyone around the world and it breaks my heart that we have so much food going to waste.”

La Manna and the team spent the morning chopping spring onions and sweet potato for a curry dish.

With Compassion uses fresh ingredients rescued by The Felix Project to produce over 1,000 hot meals a day, which our Help the Hungry campaign will deliver to those in need throughout the Christmas season.

Tori, who volunteers at London Scottish House, supported La Manna’s anti-waste sentiment. “Food waste is such a massive issue, far bigger than a lot of people realise,” she said. “You get food that’s otherwise going to waste and give it to people who really need it—that’s a really amazing thing.”

La Manna then accompanied the campaign to Living Way Ministries in Edgware, where he helped to serve the freshly cooked meals to the surrounding community.

Veronica, another volunteer at the charity, was pleased with the day’s work. “The turnout has been so massive,’ she said. “You can see the appreciation on everyone’s faces.”

La Manna remains hopeful for a future in which everybody has the proper access to food. “No one should have to rely on this,’ he said. “This should already be in place… Everyone deserves a warm, hearty meal every single day.”

This November and December we will be delivering food directly to 1,000 people a day through our partner With Compassion. Please donate here to help us do all we can to ensure no one goes hungry this Christmas.","Zero-waste chef Max La Manna gave our campaign a culinary boost as he joined The Independent to prepare and deliver meals to vulnerable people.

Jagriti Chandra reports how this has affected pregnant women in a pandemic year when hunger and poverty have worsened

Twenty-year-old Afsana’s baby is due in a month. Afsana conceived just 10 days after the nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Afsana and her family of nine live a hand to mouth existence and the pandemic has only worsened their woes. The expectant mother is anaemic, having survived along with her family on just chapatis and red chilli paste on most days.

Afsana’s husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law, the three breadwinners of the family, work at the local stone quarries in Derwala village in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, where they live. They had no work for nearly three months, from April to June. Though work has picked up slowly since then, their daily earnings are as low as ₹150 on a good day. They survive on the wheat supply from the public distribution system. “Only if we go out in the day to work can we buy pulses, sugar and milk for our evenings. There is barely enough to last us a day,” says Mohammad Rafiq Bhati, Afsana’s brother-in-law.

Afsana has already undergone blood transfusion four times. Her eyes are listless. She has been called again to the primary healthcare centre on December 9 for a check-up. The Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, a scheme of the Union Health Ministry, aims to provide quality antenatal care, free of cost, to all pregnant women in the country on the ninth of every month and also a minimum package of antenatal care services to women in their second/ third trimesters of pregnancy at designated government health facilities. However, Afsana’s take-home rations as part of anganwadi services have been irregular. Of the eight months of her pregnancy, she has received 6 kg worth of monthly entitlement (1.5 kg wheat, 1.5 kg rice and 3kg pulses) only for four months. The supply of these, too, has been erratic as anganwadi workers have to wait for the stock to accumulate sufficiently before disbursing it. Though the aim of the programme is to ensure adequate nutrition for expectant mothers, this food has been used by all the members of Afsana’s impoverished and hungry family.

While Afsana, as the expectant mother of her first child, is also entitled to receive a total of ₹5,000 in multiple tranches under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, a scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, she has still not got any benefits. Her sister Ruqsar Bano says no one has come to collect documents or even asked them to submit the papers at the anganwadi centre. “We have completed the paper work. We are waiting for the government to release her claim,” says Rekha Sharma, a local ASHA worker. Afsana, shy and reticent, wishes she had the money to buy vegetables and fruits.

The delivery of nutrition services to the poor in India has been brought to a halt or slowed down due to lack of online data, a problem caused by poor Internet and server issues. This has not only affected the beneficiaries, but also the anganwadi workers. It has also caused frustration among those working towards addressing India’s malnutrition, poverty and health issues. The lack of publicly available nutrition data is not only affecting India’s nutrition goals but is also pushing States into thinking of ways of setting up their own systems to tackle the problem.

In Jhunjhunu, a vague memory

An IT-based nutrition monitoring system called the Integrated Child Development Services-Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jhunjhunu on March 8, International Women’s Day, in 2018. Under this system, anganwadi workers log the details of the beneficiaries and daily activities to enable monitoring at the district, State and Central levels for improvement in the quality of delivery of services. However, in this village, ICDS-CAS is only a vague memory for most.

“Two years ago, we were given tablets and smartphones. But when we had Internet issues, those were taken away,” says Rekha. She and her team of one anganwadi worker and one anganwadi helper have been working overtime, about eight to 10 hours a day, conducting surveys on COVID-19 patients and ensuring social distancing at Panchayat elections, among other duties. A phone may have helped teams like hers at the block and district levels fill the gaps in programme implementation.

The ICDS-CAS was the mainstay of Poshan Abhiyaan, approved by the Union Cabinet in December 2017 at a budget outlay of ₹9,000 crore. Half of this was to be funded by the Indian government and the other half through a loan from the World Bank. Poshan Abhiyaan strives to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women and lactating mothers by reducing undernutrition, bringing down anaemia, and increasing birth weight. As the aim of Poshan Abhiyaan is to reach 10 crore beneficiaries at 14 lakh anganwadis, the government set up the ICDS-CAS to ensure swift tracking and effective implementation.

Under the ICDS-CAS, anganwadi workers are provided mobile phones, and anganwadi supervisors, tablets. Anganwadi workers enter details of daily activities, including photo evidence of the opening of anganwadis; attendance of children; details of food, weight and height; etc. These are then monitored at five levels — first by the anganwadi supervisor and then at the block, district, State and Central levels. The assessments and feedback from these levels are provided to the workers. Service delivery is thus tracked and informed decisions taken based on the assessments.

Plugging gaps in Churu

Churu, a district located three hours from Jhunjhunu, paints a different picture. It is among the nine districts where the ICDS-CAS has been implemented. The use of technology and the monitoring of activities through mobile phones allow block-level supervisors to extend support to anganwadi workers and plug gaps from time to time.

Sunita is full of praise for the local anganwadi in Gajsar village in Churu. “Food was being delivered regularly. We often ask when they will open the anganwadi so that the children get hot meals and remain busy,”” she says. Before the lockdown, the Rajasthan government also attempted weekly menus which included milk, fruits, and a mixture of rice and lentil, but this was discontinued during the lockdown.

Sunita’s immediate neighbour Amina Bano, who has a six-year-old grandson Shoaib, says, “We are happy with the anganwadi as children get to learn some numbers and alphabets.”

Here, the efficient monitoring system ensures that if there is a lag in ration supply at the anganwadis, programme supervisors at block levels are alerted and supply is restored. Smartphones distributed to anganwadi workers also help to alert them when vaccinations are due. They are also able to maintain a list of the malnourishment levels of the entire village population. The phone helps them identify children at risk of being malnourished as well as those already stunted or wasted. Those at risk of being malnourished are highlighted on the app in yellow and those already stunted/wasted are marked in red after the anganwadi workers log in the height and weight details of the children. Sanju Devi, the local anganwadi worker, shows her phone: two of the 20 children registered with the anganwadi where she works are in the red category and need special interventions.

Internet issues

However, server issues and Internet problems plague the system here, too. Also, smartphones which were given to the workers to simplify their tasks have doubled their work. Workers are now expected to note down details not only in their phones but also in registers.

In Churu, the server has been down for over two months. Since the ICDS-CAS platform is common for the whole country, this means that monitoring activities across more than 26 States where the ICDS-CAS is running have been hampered.

“For the past two months, they have been logging details in their phones as well as in registers, so there is duplication,” says Mohammed Mushtaqeem Khan, District Co-ordinator, National Nutrition Mission. “They usually use the phone to upload photos of children attending the anganwadi. Photos can’t be misused as they are uploaded directly on the app and can’t be saved in the phone’s gallery. This avoids a situation where an anganwadi worker clicks photos for the entire week on the same day. We also use the photos to do surprise checks and contact the beneficiaries and their parents to receive feedback. The technology has helped the parents become more aware too. They often use these occasions to tell us if they have been receiving less than what they are entitled to get.”

The collapse of the system also means that the anganwadi workers are the hardest hit. “The anganwadi workers’ incentives have been delayed at a time when the pandemic has resulted in their work increasing manifold. The system helps automatically calculate an anganwadi worker’s incentives through the activities logged in by her. But since that is not possible now, they haven’t received their incentives for the past two months. The State government is devising a new parameter to overcome this problem,” he says.

Experts say on the condition of anonymity that the server crash is a result of the government’s lack of preparedness to deal with a massive amount of data (nearly seven lakh out of 14 lakh anganwadis where the ICDS-CAS have already been implemented) and cloud storage and managing the entire architecture including hardware and software. The technology support has alternated between the National Informatics Centre and Tata Consultancy Services in the recent past, while it was earlier handled by the U.S.-based Dimagi.

Lack of data

Even before the server problem, unavailability of data from an expensive technology system set up primarily to improve service delivery caused anger among implementation partners, researchers, nutrition advocates and public health experts. This happened at a time when warnings were issued about the likelihood of an additional 10,000 under-five deaths per month globally and of 6.7 million more children suffering from wasting, a strong predictor of mortality, due to the pandemic.

“The strength of India’s future will be determined by the health and nutrition of its babies today. The government deploys significant resources and hundreds of thousands of front-line anganwadi workers across the country, who work every day, including through the pandemic, to reach some of India’s more vulnerable citizens. As an example, Poshan Abhiyaan disseminates over 10 nutrition-related messages across more than 20 platforms. But what is the reach of platforms and messages? Have pregnant and lactating women’s nutrition behaviours changed over time? How has all of this been changing during the pandemic? It is very important to track progress, understand gaps, and acknowledge and reward heroic efforts. Without live information systems like the CAS, many key decisions will be made without robust evidence,” says Divya Nair, Director, IDinsight.

“The less said about ICDS-CAS, the better. The data have not been available, and we can’t use the software tool the way we would like. So, we use our application called Sampark, where we log the data of children, mothers as well as the status of welfare schemes such as PDS, BPL, labour cards accessible to beneficiaries...,” says a representative of the Madhya Pradesh government.

Dr. Vandana Prasad, a public health expert, Joint Convenor of the People’s Health Movement-India (Jan Swasthya Abhiyan) and a member of the Steering Committee of the Right to Food Campaign agrees. She says, “ICDS is important because it caters to the entire life cycle of pregnant women and lactating mothers, adolescent girls and children between the age of six months and six years, by making direct interventions. It also provides a platform for delivering health services. Data are critical to any programme, especially nutrition programmes. During a pandemic we need more data, not less. Data are critical as people are at a higher risk now, they are severely vulnerable. All public data need to be made public. Data must be open for evaluation so that there are no cover-ups.”

The problem of lack of access to data is also faced by State governments. Many States, including Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, are known to have written to the Centre raising their concerns about unavailability of data for programme implementation and review.

“The guidelines for a supplementary nutrition programme allow States to decide what food they would like to distribute, but the ICDS-CAS is a common application for the entire country which doesn’t allow us the flexibility to record and monitor data as per the specifics of our scheme. We have written to the Centre raising this issue and demanded that all data be put in the public domain so that there is transparency and accountability. If we want the data of the past two or three months, for instance, to study the impact of our interventions, we don’t have them,” says Rajasthan’s Women and Child Development Secretary, Krishna Kant Pathak.

“There are no data available. We have requested the Central government for access, but beyond their templated dashboard, nothing is available to us. We haven’t even received a response from the Centre,” says Annapurna Garu, Joint Project Co-ordinator, National Nutrition Mission.

When the scheme was designed and being implemented, it was driven by a spirit of co-ordination and co-operation, explains one of the chief architects of the Poshan Abhiyaan at the Centre, on the condition of anonymity. “We often wrote letters and communicated over the phone to address the problems expressed by the States. Data, too, were always discussed at meetings where different non-government stakeholders were present as well. It is not true that data were meant to be kept under lock and key because of privacy issues. There are enough ways to mask the identity of the beneficiaries,” he says.

Need for convergence

States demand not only the Centre’s co-operation but also harp on the need for convergence between the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Women and Child Development’s ICDS through a common data portal. “There is a need for convergence. The Pregnancy, Child Tracking and Health Services Management System, for example, can give us data about a woman becoming pregnant. We can then use this to transfer their entitlements through the Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana, a maternity benefit scheme,” says Pathak.

Since the Centre has failed to do this, the Rajasthan government is now planning to launch an AAA app or the ‘Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Anganwadi and ASHA’ app, to ensure that all three of them are connected through the same tool. Andhra Pradesh, too, says that a pre-existing app called NutriTask, which was put aside after the ICDS-CAS was conceived, may now be revived.

Ironically, a month before the launch of Poshan Abhiyaan, the Union Women and Child Development Ministry had written to the State Chief Secretaries to ensure a “single point of impact for all nutrition-related schemes” through the ICDS-CAS and advised them to “phase out State-/ UT-level initiatives to enable a synergised approach, avoid replication, and achieve the overall goals of the Mission.” But three years later, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction as several States are keen to develop their own software modules.

“The accountability system is enormously centralised and top-down and is focused on surveillance of anganwadi workers. This is risky during a crisis like a pandemic or a flood because it means that the local community is not taught to take ownership of nutrition services and trained to monitor service delivery. To me if you want accountability, you could have a mother’s group that can monitor whether or not an anganwadi is functioning, whether the supplies are there, whether an anganwadi worker is providing those supplies to children or not. Local mothers’ groups and panchayat committees can play not just an inspectorial role, but also a supportive role,” says Jashodhara Dasgupta, social researcher on gender, health and rights, and convener of the Feminist Policy Collective.

The ICDS-CAS harps on accountability of the person at the ground level instead of addressing other systemic issues, she says. “Anganwadi workers are treated as voluntary workers as they are considered to be part-time workers, and they live close to the houses they monitor. They are underpaid, overworked and deprived of social protection. So why are we so hooked to their accountability when there are inadequate budgets, delays in disbursal of cash benefits, lack of data, etc.? The entire system is intent on policing her,” Dasgupta says.

“There is a strong case against centralisation of data systems. The systems must be flexible and in tune with local interventions. They must also be available to the front-line workers as well as at the local level for analyses and execution of corrective measures, and not just to programme developers. After all, it is an anganwadi worker who can take corrective steps immediately. Data systems should also be built with local participation and consensus. The Centre can facilitate setting this up locally and providing a supportive role to ensure capacity building for effective use of data,” Prasad contends.","The supply of these, too, has been erratic as anganwadi workers have to wait for the stock to accumulate sufficiently before disbursing it.
Under the ICDS-CAS, anganwadi workers are provided mobile phones, and anganwadi supervisors, tablets.

In their updated NDCs, Switzerland and Costa Rica commit to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform (Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay) and the UK issued a joint statement, encouraging countries and stakeholders to continue reform and ensure the COVID-19 economic recovery is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

UK Submits First NDC

The UK’s NDC, submitted on 12 December, represents an increase from its previous contribution to the EU’s intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to amount to a 53% reduction on reference levels. According to the UK’s independent statutory body, Climate Change Committee, the country’s new target aligns with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways towards a 1.5°C goal.

By raising ambition, the UK signals its leadership role as co-host of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in 2021. In 2021, the UK will also preside over the Group of Seven (G7), and COP 26 co-host Italy will hold the Group of 20 (G20) presidency.

The UK intends to meet its NDC mitigation targets through reducing emissions domestically, and reserves the right to use voluntary cooperation, such as through the use of emissions trading systems and emissions reduction or removal units. The UK’s NDC encompasses emissions and removals from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The scope of the NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and shipping. The communication covers the following sectors: energy (including transport); industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); and waste.

The NDC informs of institutional structures and updates on policy measures, including an amendment to the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2019, committing the UK to a legally-binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Act also introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, and established the Climate Change Committee to provide advice.

The NDC highlights the UK’s progress on climate action policy areas linked to the SDGs, including:

In the area of food security and policy, the UK is phasing down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including in refrigeration equipment for food storage and distribution, in line with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.

Addressing ocean and marine environment, the UK will introduce a sustainable fisheries policy, giving consideration to climate change in marine planning, building ecological resilience at sea, and protecting natural carbon stores through the UK’s network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

Regarding terrestrial biodiversity in England, the government will publish a new strategy for nature following agreement of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), expected in 2021.

To promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, the UK supports a sustainable food system, and has a resources and waste strategy to move towards a more circular and sustainable economy.

The UK’s Clean Air Strategy aims to tackle air pollution, noted as the top environmental risk to human health in the UK.

The UK describes its adaptation actions in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Switzerland Submits Updated and Enhanced NDC

Switzerland’s updated NDC, communicated on 9 December, states its enhanced ambition is in line with IPCC recommendations to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 40-50% compared with 2010 levels by 2030, to limit global warming to 1.5°C . The country commits to climate neutrality by 2050, which is an increase on its previous objective of a 70-85% emissions reduction by 2050.

The NDC describes Switzerland’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which corresponds to an average reduction of at least 3% over the period 2021-2030. Switzerland anticipates to reach GHG emissions reductions of at least 35% by 2025. The NDC also represents a “progression” in terms of, inter alia: a 25% increase of the domestic share of emissions reduction, from 60% to at least 75%; and compensation of imported “grey” emissions through additional emission reductions abroad, not counted towards Switzerland’s emissions reduction objectives.

The NDC anticipates Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) from cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 “will partly be used.” It informs of Switzerland’s bilateral agreements with Peru and Ghana that govern the transfers of mitigation outcomes and their use, and define the method for corresponding adjustment.

The NDC does not include emissions from international aviation and navigation, although Switzerland’s domestic emissions reduction targets incorporate emissions from national aviation and navigation. According to the NDC, a part of emissions from international aviation is covered by the Swiss emission trading scheme (ETS) as well as by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

In the energy sector, the NDC notes Switzerland’s Energy Strategy 2050, with the objective to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. The country, it states, needs to replace the share of its nuclear energy, given the government’s decision to gradually phase out nuclear energy. The NDC also notes that, according to Switzerland’s seventh national communication to the UNFCCC, around three-quarters of Switzerland’s GHG emissions result from fossil fuel use.

The NDC informs of a 2019 popular initiative, calling for a constitutional article to stipulate a ban of fossil fuels as of 2050. Switzerland emphasizes it is actively reviewing its remaining fossil fuel subsidies, and is engaged in Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (FFFSR) – an informal group of non-G20 countries working to build political consensus on the importance of fossil fuel subsidy reform.

Besides energy (including transport), Switzerland’s mitigation commitments cover industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste. Switzerland’s adaptation actions are described in its Adaptation Communication submitted in parallel to the NDC.

Costa Rica Communicates NDC Update

In its NDC update of 11 December (in Spanish), Costa Rica announces it is enhancing its climate ambition and will submit a more specific communication by the end of 2020. The update highlights Costa Rica’s goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and commitment to a maximum budget of net emissions in the 2021-2030 period of 106.53 million tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).

The submission briefly updates on Costa Rica’s legal and institutional framework for climate action, including the country’s 2018 National Adaptation Policy, and the 2019 National Decarbonization Plan presented as a long-term strategy. Costa Rica informs of an enhanced mitigation commitment to an absolute maximum of net emissions by 2030 of 9.11 million tons CO2e, an improvement on the previous maximum of 9.37 million tons CO2e. This target, according to the submission, is consistent with the country’s long-term strategy and the trajectory towards the 1.5°C goal.

Highlighting the need to close social gaps and strengthen economic and environmental resilience in the country, Costa Rica notes its adaptation actions will be outlined in its forthcoming Adaptation Communication.

UK, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Issue Joint Statement

On 10 December, Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform and the UK issued a joint statement, stressing the importance of a green recovery from COVID-19, without which “there is a risk that fiscal stimulus packages will further entrench the use of fossil fuels.” The statement recalls the principles outlined in the group’s 2015 communiqué, and welcomes renewed political commitments to reform made since 2015 by the G7, the G20, the Vulnerable Twenty (V20), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders, among others.

The statement recalls the principles that shall inform practical action:

Communication and transparency about the merits of subsidy policies;

Ambition in the scope and timeframe for reform; and

Targeted support to ensure the most vulnerable groups are protected as reforms are implemented.

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for pushing a coronavirus relief measure that contains a 100% tax deduction for business meals—a gift to corporate executives—but nothing for the tens of millions of people across the U.S. who are struggling to afford food for themselves and their families.

""Mitch McConnell's 'new' Covid relief bill gives CEOs a 100% tax deduction for a 3-martini lunch, but ZERO to the 26 million who don't have enough food to eat,"" the Vermont senator tweeted. ""Yes. The Republicans l-o-v-e corporate socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the rest. Ain't gonna happen.""

On Tuesday, as Common Dreams reported, the Kentucky Republican began circulating a purportedly ""targeted"" coronavirus stimulus proposal that would grant corporations sweeping immunity from coronavirus related lawsuits without providing a federal boost to unemployment benefits, another round of direct payments, or any aid to state and local governments.

""Let's be clear about what Covid-19 'liability protections' would mean: letting corporations off the hook if they decide they care more about making a quick buck than keeping workers safe""

—Sen. Ron Wyden

The plan also omits nutrition assistance amid a worsening nationwide hunger crisis; according to Census Bureau data, 26 million U.S. adults reported in late October and early November that they did not have enough food to eat.

McConnell's proposal was immediately dismissed as a non-starter by many Democratic lawmakers, who characterized the plan as woefully inadequate to address the twin public health and economic crises ravaging the nation.

""This is an insult to the millions of workers and businesses that are losing their livelihoods because of this crisis,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. ""This proposal doesn't come close to giving Americans the help they desperately need to stay afloat.""

With a possible government shutdown just over a week away and time running out to secure a coronavirus relief agreement before the end of the year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday threw their support behind a new bipartisan, bicameral compromise proposal as the ""basis"" for negotiations.

Unlike McConnell's plan, the bipartisan proposal would provide a $300-per-week federal boost to unemployment insurance, a key lifeline that 12 million Americans are set to lose on December 26 without congressional action. The bipartisan group of lawmakers also called for a liability shield for corporations that would reportedly be more limited than the one McConnell is pushing, though specific language has not yet been made public.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Wednesday was among those raising concerns about the bipartisan compromise package, specifically citing the corporate liability protections as a key sticking point.

""Let's be clear about what Covid-19 'liability protections' would mean: letting corporations off the hook if they decide they care more about making a quick buck than keeping workers safe,"" Warren tweeted Wednesday.

For decades now, India has been grappling with the issue of hunger and inadequate nutrition. Hence, it was no surprise when the Global Hunger Index, 2019, ranked India at 102 out of a list of 117 countries fighting hunger.

Economists and policymakers consider hunger an outcome of overpopulation and poverty. And while these are contributing factors, another culprit lurks in the form of dilapidated infrastructure, inadequate storage and overflowing dumpsters – the creation and improper treatment of food waste.

According to the United Nations Development Programme, almost 40% of the total food grown in India annually goes to waste. In other words, we waste close to half of what we produce. Wastage does not begin with tossing leftovers or scraps into the dustbin after a hearty meal. It is a complex, multifaceted concern that involves looking beyond households and restaurants, and into wastage at the very source of the supply chain.

From crop failure, to post-harvesting processes, storage, distribution, etc., gaps need to be addressed to solve the problem of food wastage. The good news is that there are several purpose-driven companies working on future-forward solutions to this issue.

One such effort is led by DBS Bank India, which works with several companies and social enterprises to fight food wastage at the source. With the goal of doing more and better with less, here are a few organisations whose innovations are enabling a world with zero food-waste .

Kheyti Tech

Through its ‘Greenhouse-in-a-Box’ (GIB) social innovation, a low-cost modular greenhouse, Kheyti helps farmers increase their yield and the predictability of the total production by a considerable margin.

GIB is designed to fit in small areas, which enables its use by even smallholder farmers. This greenhouse creates a favorable microclimate which reduces food spoilage due to extreme weather and other environmental risks. Further, it reduces pest attacks, which minimises crop damage and food wastage. All these features eventually help farmers grow seven times more food using 90% less water, as compared to cultivating in open fields.

As an example, Kheyti Tech shares how farmers have benefitted, especially in cucumber cultivation. Average yields increased to 3-8 tons in the greenhouse, as compared to an open field average of 430 kg on a 463 sq metre plot of land. This greenhouse helps farmers earn upto ₹1,00,000 additional profit/year using just 1/10th acre of land and 2 hours of time/day. Today, 300 farmers in Telangana use Kheyti’s greenhouse. They plan to reach 3,000 farmers by the end of 2022.

“DBS Foundation’s Social Enterprise Grant was instrumental in piloting our business model. DBS Bank India is actively engaged towards ensuring that its social enterprise partners succeed. They conduct capacity building sessions, webinars, and connect the ecosystem of social enterprises. This has helped Kheyti in actualising our mission of serving small farmers,” the Kheyti team shares.

Krishi Naturals

An agri-social enterprise, Krishi Naturals, focuses on providing services to promote organic farming. The enterprise also takes an indirect route to influence the ‘zero food waste’ mission.

One of their recent triumphs has been around dairy farming with their brand Girej. Their techniques helped increase the milk yield of indigenous cows by 16-20%. With milk and ghee alone, they are impacting over 300 farmers, helping them increase their income by 18 to 20%.

They credit their impact potential to continuous support from the DBS Bank.

“DBS has always been a continuous source of support in terms of both capital as well as non-capital assistance. In 2018, Mr Shurojit Shome, CEO, DBS Bank India had mentored us, so that we learnt how to diagnose problems and adapt to sudden changes in the market, especially post Covid-19. Apart from that, we also got a seed fund and fellowship support from DBS Bank India under the DBS-TISS Social Entrepreneurship Program,” says Krishi Naturals.

Swani Spices Pvt Ltd.

With the group company established in 1864, Swani Spices’ mission is to create a customer-centric, environmentally friendly, and sustainable enterprise that delivers value throughout the supply chain.. Keeping with this vision, their backward integration program, with the involvement of farmers, and other such processes are all Rainforest Alliance certified for Sustainable Agriculture & independently Organic Certified. The company started an initiative with the ‘Land to Lab’ concept to bridge the gap between rural agriculture, technology, and agricultural science back in 2006.

A client of DBS Bank India, Swani Spices has taken various steps to contribute to the cycle of food production sustainably, ensuring minimal to no wastage along the way. These steps include initiating sustainable farming across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal, Uttrakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan etc ; other than compositing and water conservation to improving livelihoods of more than 3000 farmers.

One of their initiatives to enhance yields was the soil testing and re-enrichment programme called “Samriddhi”, which translate to “Prosper” in Sanscrit. Using their soil analysis reports, Swani helped farmers rebalance nutrients in the soil with the help of customised ingredients. Such programmes also ensure nitrogen from the natural elements are absorbed in the soil and not released into the atmosphere, thus contributing positively to a sustainable environment.

Ecozen

A technology company, Ecozen focuses on enabling the Farm-To-Fork value chain for perishable food items with three core offerings – Ecotron, Ecofrost and Eco-Connect, which work across the production, management, and marketing of perishable Agri commodities respectively.

Started in 2010 by three IIT Kharagpur alumni, they work towards eliminating all the pain points across the Farm to Fork value change, at various stages.

“In the pre-harvest stage, only 48% of the net sown area is irrigated in India leading to reduced output. And in post-harvest, 40% of the food is wasted between the field and the end customer due to infrastructural gaps in the cold chain, leading to wastage of Rs 1.7 trillion worth of fruits and vegetables (annually). While the current solutions are mostly based on traditional energy sources, they are also operationally inefficient and negatively impact farmer income. So, we are solving these problems through renewable energy that is not only making the supply chain more efficient but also creating environmental and social impact,” explains the founders of Ecozen.

By creating 16,800 metric tonnes of solar cold storage capacity, so far, they have generated 404 million kWh of clean energy which is equivalent to lighting up 100 million houses for a day, while also abating 590,000 tons of CO2 emissions. In the process, they have reduced 12,740 metric tonnes of food wastage (the equivalent of serving 1,300 people for a lifetime) and have benefitted almost 35,000 farmers along the way.

DBS Bank’s support through grant will help the company in impacting more farmers and reduce food wastage while keeping the environment clean. The grant will be used by Ecozen to expand their Ecofrost solution geographically and eliminate value chain bottlenecks in highly perishable goods. “The grant is a validation of our efforts and product offering. Food Loss is a key issue in all developing countries and we at Ecozen are striving to build solutions to prevent this. The DBS funding will help us to reach out and collaborate with like-minded businesses and organizations working towards tackling food loss,” adds the team.

S4S Technologies

A food-tech company, S4S Technologies provides an array of services, like a quality check of the produce, secondary processing at its ISO grade factory and dehydration of perishable fruits and vegetables using solar dryers — all meant to eliminate food wastage in the supply chain. This saves around 20% of the food usually wasted in the post-production process.

The DBS Foundation gave S4S a grant in 2019 to expand its food-preservation offerings to several parts of the country, reducing wastage and enabling farmers to earn better livelihoods.

S4S’s technologies have been helping farmers reduce costs by processing the food right at the farm. Their solar-powered food-dehydrators have successfully increased the shelf-life of produce from a few days up to a year — without the use of any chemicals or preservatives.

With the help of these dryers, farmers no longer need to fear unsold produce. Instead, they can dehydrate the fruit or vegetable and wait till demand increases and ensures a fair price.

The silver lining to the food waste problem is that there are many similar enterprises working on the ground to tackle the range of issues, using technology to enhance food security. With the right support from stakeholders and purposeful organizations, they could help India fight a problem that has seemed insurmountable for so long and accelerate our movement towards zero food waste.","From crop failure, to post-harvesting processes, storage, distribution, etc., gaps need to be addressed to solve the problem of food wastage.

According to a 2020 survey by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), foods that are ‘minimal processed, traditional’ matter to consumers. Such foods are most valued by consumers in Portugal, Greece and Lithuania, who associate them with ‘sustainable food’.

In another survey​, undertaken by L.E.K Consulting, consumers said the most important claim when purchasing food and drink was ‘no artificial ingredients’, followed by ‘no preservatives’. In fourth place was a preference for the ‘all natural’ claim.

Yet according to research professor at Ghent University Andreja Rajkovic, processed foods are not wholly deserving of their bad reputation, and should not be perceived unilaterally as either ‘friends or foes’.

Rather, at the European Food Information Council’s (EUFIC) Processed Foods Symposium last week, the microbial food safety expert argued that certain processed foods more than merit their place in today’s society.

What does food processing bring to the table?​

At a personal level, Rajkovic himself opts for a minimally processed, clean label diet.

However, acknowledging that adhering to such a diet requires both time and money, his professional opinion supports food processing where appropriate. In fact, Rajkovic argues that food processing brings a great number of benefits to society.

Amongst the positive reasons for processing food, the research professor counted its ability to reduce food spoilage, extend shelf-life, and increase food safety.

In this respect, processing food also helps reduce food waste, he explained. “A large proportion of food produced never actually gets eaten, but is thrown away – either through the processing [stage] or during household storage.”​

Processing can also be used as a tool to modify the flavour, texture, aroma, colour or form of food. It can transform an ingredient, or a matrix of ingredients, into something that is ‘palatable, eatable, and appealing to the consumer’, Rajkovic told delegates.

“Try to convince kids to eat broccoli and it will take you probably 20 servings before they start to ‘sort of’ like it. Try to give them ice cream, and it will take one or two times before they start liking it.​

“So [in this instance], you could do something to help healthy broccoli consumption.”​

Processed foods also align with the requirements of modern life, the food safety expert continued, referencing the importance of convenience in today’s consumers. “No processing and no ‘smart additions’ won’t work for today’s food choices.”​

The business of food processing should also be perceived as a benefit. In Europe, the food industry employs close to 5m people and boasts a turnover of €1.2trn, which would be significantly impacted without the processing of food and food ingredients.

And finally, food processing enables innovation in the sector, said Rajkovic. “The idea that you can modify food and create a new processes and products – and [in turn] bring something back to society – also turns society into engaged, employed personnel. And I think this is also very important to keep in mind.”​

Processing done right​

There are multiple instances where food processing has benefited human health. These examples, however, appear to receive less media attention in the ‘processed foods’ story.

During Rajkovic’s presentation, he referred to the processing of grains – including sorting, trimming, cleaning, cooking, baking, frying and roasting – which can help reduce the amount of mycotoxin contamination.

Aflatoxins are one such kind of mycotoxin. Produced by certain moulds growing on agricultural crops, naturally occurring aflatoxins are classified as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). “Processing, therefore, takes something away from [the cereals] which we know is cancerogenic,” ​stressed Rajkovic.

Another example of food processing welcomed by health-conscious consumers – and in particular, those focused on calories and saturated fat intake – concerns low fat spread.

“One of the things in the modern world that we run away from is dense calorie intake,” ​explained the research professor. “We want to use fat-reduced products so that we put lower amounts of dangerous fats in our body, such as saturated fats.”​

One-hundred grams of conventional butter contains 80% fat and 737kcal. However, consumer demand for lower fat alternatives has prompted a ‘healthier’ response from manufacturers, Rajkovic told delegates.

The resulting low fat spread has half the calories of generic butter and just 35% fat. Of course, this ‘healthy’ alternative is processed. Emulsifiers are required due to the increased water activity in the product and additives are included to ensure long shelf-life and microbial food safety.

“There are good reasons to add stuff. Organic acids lower the pH and also work as an antimicrobial agent. Food preservatives and antioxidants inhibit microbial and chemical…spoilage. [And] fortifiers raise the nutrient levels in food,” ​we were told.

“If you don’t do that, a lot of people in the world won’t have enough Vitamin D or Vitamin C etc. So, there are things that sensibly need to be added.​ ​

“If you don’t add, we are going to have a very fast growth of pathogens,” ​he said. “The processing and additions of things are meaningful sometimes, if you know why we are doing it.”​

A holistic approach​

Rajkovic’s professional opinion is that processed foods needn’t be considered through a black and white lens. And moving forward, the consumer ‘definitely’ needs key elements from industry and government.

These include ‘clear’ information on the risks and benefits of processed foods. Consumers also require policy ‘which is both protective and based on scientific evidence’, but which Rajkovic stressed is ‘not conservative’ – so that it ‘does not stop development’.

In such policies, respect for food, health, and environment should be present, as well as consideration for food waste. Climate change, obesity, and hunger should all be part of the equation, he continued.

The research professor also advocated for a ‘holistic’ approach to health. This should include lifestyle, exercise, sleep and stress. “This is an important aspect.” ​","Rather, at the European Food Information Council’s (EUFIC) Processed Foods Symposium last week, the microbial food safety expert argued that certain processed foods more than merit their place in today’s society.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

The United Nations calls on countries to swiftly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a just and equitable world in the decades ahead. You can join us in taking action on related issues here

Countries have to speed up their efforts to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid severe effects of climate change, according to the United Nations.

Right now, around 115 countries accounting for roughly 50% of global emissions have pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. China, the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, has committed to reaching this point by 2060.

The UN is calling on all countries to make similar net zero commitments to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

But while pledges like these are key for generating global climate action momentum, they need to be backed by concrete plans and clear financing mechanisms, according to the UN.

In other words, countries must lay out exactly how net zero goals will be executed and then fully fund these plans, an undertaking that will require global cooperation. Wealthy countries will have to invest in adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change, but stand to face the harshest consequences from it, through the UN’s Green Climate Fund that calls for $100 billion in annual funding.

“No such bold commitments have yet been made to mobilize the finance necessary to achieve the net zero commitment by 2050 nor, more broadly, the SDGs,” António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, recently said in a speech calling on countries to increase climate commitments.

In the midst of a global pandemic, worsening climate disasters, dwindling natural resources, and growing protest movements calling for climate action, Guterres said that countries have a unique opportunity to chart a new, bolder path forward.

Countries can outline this path through their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are due as part of the Paris climate agreement.

Achieving net zero emissions is not just about avoiding doomsday scenarios of extreme storms and droughts, higher temperatures and rising sea levels.

It’s mostly about achieving a more just, equitable, and joyous world.

Getting to Net Zero

“Net zero emissions” doesn’t mean that emissions from human activities will be fully eliminated. Instead, it means that human-related emissions — from vehicles, agriculture, energy production, and so on — will be reduced to a level so low that they can be offset by efforts to absorb and otherwise remove emissions from the atmosphere. In this way, the grand total of emissions in the air would not increase.

And that’s critical because countries are rapidly running out of the remaining global carbon budget — the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be released if countries want to achieve the Paris climate agreement. As of 2018, countries had a 50% chance of staying under the 1.5 degrees Celsius level if they collectively emitted less than 580 gigatons of carbon dioxide going forward.

Since countries annually release around 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and were expected to reach 50 gigatons annually by 2030, they were on track to all but lock in temperature increases beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted economies around the world, leading to an unexpected decline in emissions. While scientists believe that emissions will rebound after the pandemic, many countries have vowed to recover economically by investing in climate action initiatives such as green infrastructure, clean energy production, and sustainable agriculture.

As a result, the next decade could feature ongoing emissions reductions that could put the world back on track to achieving the Paris climate agreement.

In fact, the UN argues that countries can only stay within the safe zone of temperature increases if emissions decline by 7.6% annually by 2030 and then zero out by 2050.

This can only happen if countries truly seize the moment to reimagine and restructure their economies and, more broadly, their societies.

What Net Zero Looks Like

A net zero world involves every aspect of human society.

Most immediately, it means that countries will generate their electricity from clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. The International Energy Agency reports that 90% of new electricity generation added in 2020 came from clean energy sources and that the next decade will feature explosive renewable energy growth.

Countries also have to make their buildings and homes energy efficient. All the technology exists to make this happen — from smart heating and cooling systems to solar paneled roofs to improved insulation — but countries have to mobilize the resources.

Transportation systems have to be transformed in multiple ways. First, gasoline-powered cars have to be phased out and replaced with electric vehicles. Second, countries have to modernize their public transportation systems to ensure that citizens have reliable alternatives to cars that are less environmentally intensive.

Agriculture is another major source of emissions that has to be addressed. Countries can do this by investing in smallholder rather than industrial farmers, advocating for regenerative agriculture that restores soil, promoting plant-based diets that have less of an impact on the environment, and producing more food on less agricultural land.

Agriculture is one of the leading causes of deforestation and environmental degradation. Getting to net zero emissions requires countries to expand forested areas, swamplands, peat bogs, and other natural ecosystems that absorb emissions from the atmosphere, the UN says.

Transforming society in these ways has benefits far beyond avoiding catastrophic temperature increases.

By phasing out coal, oil, and natural gas, air, water, and food pollution will decrease worldwide, improving the quality of life of billions of people. Transforming agricultural systems to focus on sustainability means that people will have greater access to healthy foods and more food sovereignty. Making homes more efficient means that energy bills will be lower for consumers. On a global scale, these projects will generate millions of good-paying jobs, while also promoting the tenets of climate justice, a philosophy that strives to ensure equitable and just livelihoods for all.

A world of climate justice would mean that everyone has access to clean water, air, and food, safe and dignified shelter, meaningful work, and the ability to cultivate community — all core aspects of the UN’s Global Goals.

270,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/five-years-since-the-paris-agreement-the-race-to-net-zero-is-on/,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Five years since the Paris Agreement: The race to net zero is on,"As 2020 comes to a close, the date is fast approaching for all parties to the Paris Agreement to submit their updated commitments, or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), that specifically delineate how each country will meet the common climate goals within the United Nations framework.

Due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, COP 26 climate talks were postponed to 2021, and instead, a series of virtual events including the Climate Ambition Summit was held on 12 December 2020, where countries were given the opportunity to provide updates on their adjusted NDCs.

Much has happened in recent months. While the Republic of Korea did not show very ambitious NDC targets earlier this year, President Moon Jae-in announced net zero ambitions for 2050. Likewise, China made a net zero pledge for 2060. The European Union announced enhanced ambitions to cut emissions by 55 per cent from the 1990 level by 2030.

Many other states made commensurate pledges to tackle the climate crisis. A race to resilience was also launched by mayors, community leaders and insurance companies committed to safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of four billion vulnerable people by 2030, which aligns in particular with the priorities of small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs).

While these commitments are positive and more ambitious than earlier NDCs, they are still not ambitious enough to meet the 1.5-degree target and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change. United Kingdon Minister Alok Sharma has called out the world leaders’ failure to show necessary levels of ambition.

Reflecting on priorities ahead of next year’s COP 26, Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) will continue supporting its members’ and partners’ NDC enhancement and implementation through climate and carbon finance mobilisation. However, a key area of focus in 2021 will be to build synergies between climate solutions and green recoveries post-Covid-19.

It is critical to ensure that the unprecedented economic stimulus packages result in lasting shifts toward green development pathways with an explicit focus on employment potential and other socio-economic co-benefits.

The tens of trillions mobilised to recovery efforts provide a big and perhaps last chance to solve the unprecedented challenges as leverage vanishes with rising debt levels and dried-up public funding.

Green recovery packages must be put to work to decarbonise the economy. Renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy, especially when taking account of the extended costs of our reliance on fossil fuels so far.

Circular economy options can drastically reduce waste, and alternatives to fossil fuel are available in the bioeconomy, and nature-based solutions hold tremendous untapped climate mitigation potential with employment and adaptation co-benefits. New technologies are pushing opportunities. Hydrogen can take up where renewable energy cannot reach, and artificial intelligence can push energy efficiency and effective production.

These are trends moving us in the right direction. Explicit focus is required to highlight the economic multipliers and social co-benefits of climate action.

In our collaborative Green Growth Programme with the government of Indonesia, we are promoting nature-based solutions that help halt deforestation, restore carbon-rich wetlands and soils, improve land productivity and water security, and deliver improved livelihoods as well as enhanced climate mitigation and adaptation actions.

Continued and improved investments in biomass-based and solar energy-based electricity generation will bring more and higher quality jobs, food security and climate resilience.

In Vietnam, GGGI works with the government to enhance its NDC ambitions through promoting sustainable urban cooling, energy efficiency digital solutions and increasing green investments with innovative financial instruments such as carbon financing or green bonds through collaborating with the government of Luxembourg.

To verify the employment potential of renewable energy, GGGI’s employment assessments in countries like Indonesia, Rwanda and Mexico show that renewable energy,

Solar PV in particular employs more people per unit of investment compared to fossil fuel-based technologies. A global solar-powered irrigation program, including Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Uganda will improve livelihoods, food security and climate resilience.

While supporting several governments with their NDC revision processes into 2021 with the NDC Partnership and others, technical analysis incorporating employment potential and safeguarding of poor and vulnerable communities is key.

GGGI is supporting several SIDS countries in this regard—Saint Lucia is using a modelling approach to explore how reforming fossil fuel subsidy and taxation schemes can lower fossil fuel consumption while ensuring that vulnerable populations are not negatively impacted. In Antigua & Barbuda, GGGI is developing programs to ensure the inclusion of all segments of the population are included in the transition to renewable energy.

Focusing on green recovery packages and climate action simultaneously means a more effective integration of NDCs and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

While the Covid-19 pandemic has placed emphasis on the socio-economic aspects of climate action, and the importance of assessing and including long-term health and vulnerabilities of the local communities into planning processes, the notion that we must marry sustainable development and climate ambitions have been made evident by the successes and failures of climate action to date.

As the world recovers with the introduction of vaccines, and business and economic activities resume, a change in trajectory towards a green recovery should be at the centre of focus. Looking ahead to COP 26 in Glasgow next year, it is essential that the world does not bounce back to business as usual.

273,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/chinas-path-to-net-zero/,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,China’s path to net zero,"China is aiming to halt the rise in its carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. If it succeeds, the country will have gone, in less than 40 years, from being the world’s largest CO 2 emitter to bringing its emissions into balance.

China is far from being the only country to have declared its intention to reach net-zero CO 2 emissions within that time frame – over 120 countries are actively discussing achieving that goal even sooner, by 2050 – but it is the most important one by far.

In fact, President Xi Jinping’s announcement of China’s 2060 commitment at the recent United Nations General Assembly was doubly significant, given that the 2015 Paris climate agreement is being actively challenged by leaders of major governments, and undermined by inaction elsewhere, partly as a result of Covid-19.

“ To reduce the risk of further havoc, there is no alternative: China and the world must urgently make the transition to carbon neutrality.

But is China’s ambition credible? Although Xi did not elaborate in his speech on how the zero-carbon goal will be reached, China has a track record of delivering on major initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency, renewables, pollution reduction, and poverty alleviation.

But Xi’s carbon-neutrality pledge is on a very different scale and must be fulfilled in a different global context.

A recent report by the Group of Thirty, an international association of leading global thinkers, aims to help countries accelerate their transition to a net-zero economy.

Above all, the G30 stresses that achieving carbon neutrality requires extensive collaboration between government and the private sector, with public policy at the core. Invoking recent innovations in fiscal and monetary policy, the report argues that effective communication and so-called forward guidance can make policy frameworks more predictable.

Specifically, the report calls on governments to phase out explicit and implicit fossil-fuel subsidies, and advocates border-adjustment taxes to prevent countries and firms from undercutting each other by not reflecting carbon costs in their pricing.

Although it is unclear how widely these levies will be applied, part of the proceeds should go to low-income countries to help them access the opportunities offered by the transition to carbon neutrality. The job creation resulting from green and sustainable growth must benefit them, too.

Furthermore, corporations need to have clear green transition plans and publish regular progress reports that boards actually review.

Significant investments are needed to strengthen financial institutions’ capacity to assess the climate impact of investments and shift resources from laggards to companies leading the low-carbon transition. Within financial and non-financial firms alike, incentives must reflect net-zero objectives.

Governance is critical. As the G30 and others have suggested, governments must ensure independent policy reviews by establishing mechanisms such as Carbon Councils, modeled on fiscal and monetary-policy councils.

Likewise, special board committees can ensure that private-sector lending and investment decisions properly account for climate risks. Transparency regarding these risks will encourage peer review and allow markets to identify leaders and laggards. Ongoing work to develop appropriate accounting standards should help to increase the quality and thus the value of disclosure.

Companies will incur costs by moving first, before competitors have implemented carbon prices and the price of alternative fuel sources has come down. But the benefits are greater.

Many institutional investors already face pressures to incorporate climate and other sustainability goals in their investment criteria, while regulators are increasingly accounting for climate-change risks. First-movers can benefit from these trends.

The same principle applies to countries. Over time, peer pressure to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions will increase, and national strategies will have to converge.

Early movers can spread their adjustments over a longer period and avoid the costs of disruptive last-minute changes. But all economic actors must move together, and governments will need the support of the private sector in making the transition.

Every day of delay will add to the eventual stock of “stranded assets” once carbon prices have fully adjusted.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) should be at the forefront of these developments. Many are leading by example. The recent statement by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank’s President, Jin Liqun, that he will not consider projects related to coal-fired power generation sent an important signal in a region where CO 2 emissions are still rising.

The bank also set a target to reach or surpass a 50 per cent share of climate finance in its investments by 2025. All of the MDBs can further leverage their joint capital and clout to reduce risk, ensure the use of state-of-the-art green technologies, and accelerate the policy shift toward climate-change mitigation and adaptation.

We still do not know the most cost-effective and just pathway toward achieving a zero-carbon economy, but there is no lack of potential solutions.

Xi has launched one of the most important policy initiatives of the last 40 years. His approach reflects a key feature of Chinese reforms since the 1970s: announce a bold vision and then figure out how to realise it through structured experimentation and careful iterations – or, as Deng Xiaoping famously said, “crossing the river by feeling the stones.”

But, as China’s leaders are acutely aware, climate change is already flooding Chinese rivers and pulling away stones, while other countries, including the United States, are battling historic wildfires in the midst of a pandemic.

To reduce the risk of further havoc, there is no alternative: China and the world must urgently make the transition to carbon neutrality.

The affected children — whose families were torn asunder under the Trump administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” border policy — have now been without their parents for at least two years.

Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, which is part of a court-appointed “steering committee” that’s been working to reunite separated families, said in the court filing that the parents of at least 295 of the still-separated children have been deported to their countries of origin.

“Our efforts to locate them … are ongoing,” the ACLU said of the parents who have yet to be found.

The Trump administration — in the same filing saying it can't find the parents of 628 kids — asked the judge if it can give less frequent public updates ""given the relatively low number of separations."" https://t.co/p0waFOX8lC — Jacob Shamsian (@JayShams) December 3, 2020

The ACLU also noted that the Trump administration had only recently provided the steering committee with potentially useful information from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an agency under the Justice Department. That information included “phone numbers that had not previously been disclosed.”

ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said the Trump administration should’ve provided this information “at least a year ago.”

“We’ve been asking them for any additional information they have forever and we only finally got this information after outcry that parents still could not be found and the issue reached the presidential debate level. This is information we should’ve gotten a year ago, at least a year ago,” Gelernt told CNN.

“We hope we can find a significant number of parents and children through this information. But make no mistake about it: Not only has the Trump administration not been helping us, but it’s now clear they failed to disclose information in their possession,” he added.

The Trump administration requested in the filing to be allowed to update the ACLU on a quarterly basis rather than monthly, “given the relatively low number of separations.”

President-elect Joe Biden has repeatedly lambasted Trump and his administration for separating at least 4,200 children from their parents in 2017 and 2018 ― and for not doing more to help reunite the families that remain separated.

“Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal,” Biden said during the second presidential debate.

Biden has vowed that on his first day as president, he will create a federal task force to reunite separate families.","The affected children — whose families were torn asunder under the Trump administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” border policy — have now been without their parents for at least two years.

Transcript

Hey kids, what starts with suh, ends in punk, and has been splashed onto the computer screens of lonely single gamers the world over? That’s right, Cyberpunk. The hot new immersive sim conveniently if unimaginatively named after its genre. The genre of choice for people who hate capitalism but love looking like a member of Dead or Alive after they stepped on a landmine. I say immersive sim, I feel that description hinges on the game being in some way immersive. I was playing the Steam version, which might more accurately be termed a “buggier than a party sub that got left on the floor of a motel bathroom” sim. The bugs were ceaseless. Mostly non-game breaking animation fuckups and voice lines not playing, but every now and again I’d have to reload a save because I accidentally crossed a cutscene trigger while grabbing an enemy, and I’d come back from the loading screen with my head jammed up their arse like the result of some Cronenberg-esque teleportation accident. It’s a shame, because when I looked up at the dizzying neon towers of Night City, and the crowds of NPCs where no two are the same and they’re all uniquely dressed in some way like a cross between a character from Lazy Town and a cenobite, I thought to myself “Man, this game would probably be really immersive if my trousers hadn’t just turned invisible again.”

But as you know I hate to harp on a game having bugs these days when the developers might eventually patch them all out, in this case given I’d estimate about ten years and an industrial quantity of crab shampoo. Let’s focus on the stuff the game meant to do, like the lovely titties and the working its developers half to death. Cyberpunk is set in the high-tech dystopian sprawl of Night City – and it’s still called that during the day, which strikes me as a bit of an oversight – and the main character is V, of Vendetta fame, a jobbing mercenary on a quest for the big time. After a heist on a corpo stronghold goes cyber-tits up V finds themselves with six months to live and a piece of classified tech jammed in their bonce which makes them hallucinate the ghost of Keanu Reeves. Who in this world was a legendary freedom fighter who died in a blaze of glory sticking it to the man and was also a hard-drinking rock guitarist that everyone wanted to fuck and probably had a really big knob. Bit laughable, really, it’s like what used to happen whenever Gene Simmons got cast in a film and was given any amount of creative control.

Honestly Keanu Reeves seems a bit miscast as a dangerous supercool bad boy rocker, I tend to think of him as the human equivalent of an affectionate labrador with slight facial paralysis. Anyway, V’s task is to continue being a gigging mercenary while seeking a way to purge their brain of Keanu thoughts before their consciousness gets overwritten and they start seriously considering signing onto the The Day The Earth Stood Still remake. So, Cyberpunk is an immersive RPG with an emphasis on the RP part of the G where you must balance your stats and perks across ranged combat, melee combat, stealth and hacking gameplay. In my experience this wasn’t so much about picking a specialisation as it was picking one thing to really suck at. By the end of my game I had high stats in everything except tech. So my V was a super strong gun-toting tank who was also a stealthy ninja, and a master hacker who could instakill a good amount of the enemies just by looking at them funny and thinking about it, but who was absolutely useless at mending DVD players. Even the non-facetious tech skills didn’t seem terribly useful. Like crafting. I didn’t craft Jack fucking Thompson in this game and still ended up with fifty spare health kits and more bullets than John Lennon’s corpse.

As I say, though, this was by the end. Earlier on it was easier to be intimidated by the sheer depth of upgrades and unfriendly interface. Incidentally, if one more triple A game has me navigate its menus by moving a mouse pointer with the gamepad, I’m going to lock it in a basement and only feed it when it’s caught a fly with a pair of lead salad tongs. The first time I opened the map and the visual space was crowded with icons like teenage boys around a hole in a shower room wall I felt a little overwhelmed, but it turned out that, much like the working class in the eyes of American politics, there’s a lot of Cyberpunk 2077 that’s really not worth worrying about. I was baffled as to why the map has a special icon for food vendors. There’s no hunger meter and as I said I was cleaning health kits out of my armpits, why the fuck would I want to buy food? Is it just for the people who want to roleplay as Michelin travel guide writers? And I was initially impressed by the vast range of perks and cyber enhancement slots available for building your character, but after a certain point a lot of those didn’t offer enough benefit to be worth the bother, either. Would you like a robot foot with +5% defense against verrucas? Well, I do hate wearing a rubber sock at the swimming pool so hacking off a limb does sound like a perfectly level-headed alternative.

Better move on, looks like I’ve hit the “backhanded compliment” layer of this review trifle. Cyberspooge 1969 is well-written enough, the way it structures its story around V’s personal struggles gives us a strong focus while the background details subtly trickle in the necessary exposition and worldbuilding like a nice quiet room heater. But it’s the little touches of atmosphere that make it for me. My favourite moments were when I’d finish a gig and find myself waiting for my summoned car on the side of the road in a bad part of town at night. The cars hurrying by, sirens in the distance, to my left a pack of neon punks daring each other to snort a line of aquarium gravel, and I’d think, man, this is really bringing back fond memories of trying to cab home from Fortitude Valley at one in the morning. Until I’d notice one of the punks T-posing or Cronenberging with a vending machine and get pulled out again. “Oh right I’m just playing a video game that’s about as stable as a relationship counsellor’s waiting room in an earthquake test centre.” I did wonder why CD Projekt Red only unlocked my review copy like, the day before general release.

I mean, this thing had more hype than Michael Stipe. What were you afraid of, lads, some people getting turned off by the bug reports and the game only making NINE billion squillion dollars? Cyberpunk is barely holding itself together with all its content and disembodied organs of developers that were ritualistically sacrificed to it, and the end result is a game that could seriously benefit from some editing. For every well-designed open-ended mission with multiple approaches there’s one that just forces you into combat or ends anticlimactically because the target clipped through a bus shelter. So I’d say this is the triple-A horse plop plops syndrome again. The result of too many people working on the game who were trying to look busy. Sure, there’s a theoretically nice plate of steak fries here but it’s partially buried in potato peelings and I don’t understand why you peeled so many more potatoes than you actually needed, nor why you literally enslaved a few people to get them all peeled in time. Also, not to make a fuss, but I ordered a salad.","This week on Zero Punctuation, Yahtzee reviews Cyberpunk 2077.

278,https://www.eater.com/22179009/frittata-perfect-meal-easy-cooking-freezing-leftovers,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Eater,A Frittata Is the Perfect Meal for the Cook Who Has Zero Energy,"Welcome to Ask Elazar, a column in which Eater staff writer Elazar Sontag answers your highly specific and pressing cooking questions.

I’m due to give birth soon, so if I can muster up enough energy in these last few weeks pre-baby, I’m hoping to make a few easy freezer meals to eat post-birth. Can you recommend a meal that (a) would freeze well in a large batch, (b) would be low-effort enough for a pretty uncomfortably pregnant/exhausted person to handle, and (c) doesn’t include beans because I hate beans? Thank you!

It must be so exciting slash nerve-wracking slash aahhh!!! to be preparing to welcome a baby into the world during this endlessly difficult and bizarre year. I have very little experience when it comes to new babies, but 2020 has made me something of an expert in stretching meals as far as they can stretch. I hope I can help with that one little piece of this puzzle.

If you’re a soup person, this would be a great time to make a (beanless) soup, and freeze it in quart-size mason jars. But when I’m feeling exhausted and just want to defrost something, most soups don’t feel quite substantial enough. So while some folks have embraced all sorts of broths and beans this year, I’m here to sing the praises of big-batch frittatas.

The nice thing about a dish like this is that you need little more than eggs — actually, you could make a deliciously plain frittata with just eggs, salt, and fresh herbs — and from start to finish it won’t take more than an hour to make. A big slice of frittata and a strong cup of coffee makes for a lovely breakfast, and you can also put together a bang-up dinner around a defrosted and re-crisped slice of the one-skillet dish alongside something green. If you’ve got the energy, throw together a little salad of radicchio and frisée, for instance, with a mustardy dressing. Or you can eat slices of warm frittata on crusty bread with goat cheese or a little pesto — the store-bought stuff is perfectly good in this case. Actually, any number of jarred sauces will improve a slice of frittata. You can’t go wrong with a dash of hot sauce, some salsa, a squeeze of ketchup, or a big spoonful of good grainy mustard.

You can make adorable mini frittatas in muffin tins, but as cute as that is, I prefer to make a big frittata in my 10- or 12-inch cast iron skillet. In a pan this size, you can fit a full dozen eggs, plus ham, sausage, bacon, or vegetables For a family of two or three people, this’ll make for a meal straight out of the oven, plus plenty of leftovers to store in the fridge or freezer.

To get started, you’ve got to build the base of your frittata, which is as simple as whisking 10 to 12 eggs in a metal bowl, along with a tablespoon (or a three-finger pinch) of salt. This is also normally when you’ll add about a third of a cup of milk, cream, creme fraiche, or cream cheese, and maybe a big handful of shredded cheese — when I’m planning to freeze a frittata though, I prefer to leave my egg base free of dairy. I love the bouncy, not-as-creamy consistency of an egg-only frittata, and I’m wary of the texture a dairy-full frittata might take on when frozen. If your frittata isn’t destined for the freezer and you’re going full-on dairy, spinach and goat cheese is one of my favorite pairings.

Since you’re anticipating a much-needed break from cooking when your baby is born, think about buying a few dozen eggs plus plenty of add-ins like sausage or bacon, fresh herbs, and vegetables (if you’re adding meat, it’s important to cook it before adding to the eggs), and play around with flavor combinations to make two or three different frittatas. When it comes time to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Set a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat, and tilt in a tablespoon or two of olive oil to coat the pan. Pour the egg mixture in, and leave the pan on the burner until the edges of the frittata have begun to set, then carefully slide it into the oven on a middle rack. Bake until the eggs are set all the way through, wobbling the tiniest bit in the center when you shake the pan. This should take about 30 to 35 minutes, depending how much you’ve loaded your eggs with meat and vegetables. If you’re not quite sure about doneness, slide the tip of a paring knife into the center of the frittata, and if no raw egg bubbles up or is left on the knife, pull your pan out of the oven.

Freezing a frittata is just as simple as making one: Once the eggs are cooked, let the frittata cool to room temperature before you turn it out of the pan onto a cutting board, or divide it into slices in the pan, removing each slice individually. Wrap slices in plastic wrap or wax paper, pop each slice into a freezer-friendly zipper-lock bag, and label each one with a permanent marker. I like to note the add-ins prominently on the baggie, along with the freeze date, so I know how long it’s been in there — to ensure your frittata tastes just like it did when you made it, aim to go through your freezer stash within two-ish months. If you’re really planning ahead, you can even turn one of your frittatas into a bunch of ready-to-heat breakfast sandwiches.

To reheat your breakfast, lunch, or dinner (eating frittata three times in one day is totally acceptable), let a slice defrost fully in the refrigerator, then unwrap and bake it, until it’s warm all the way through and starting to crisp on the surface. In the time it takes for your slice to warm, throw together your salad, saute some potatoes, cook off a few sausages, or just lay on the couch, feeling supremely satisfied that you thought to make this dinner a month ago.","If you’ve got the energy, throw together a little salad of radicchio and frisée, for instance, with a mustardy dressing.

For effective implementation of traffic rules, the police have introduced ‘zero tolerance traffic junctions’ from Saturday, where erring motorists will face more police personnel and stringent action for not following the rules.

Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, accompanied by Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, N. Kannan, inspected the new arrangement for free flow of traffic around Thiruvanmiyur bus terminus.

All encroachments on the arterial junction were removed and street vendors were pushed into the market premises. Vehicles parked on the road blocking normal flow of traffic were also removed.

“Zero tolerance junctions, where additional police personnel will be deployed, are going to be declared from Saturday. Motorists should follow all traffic rule such as adhering to signals, wearing helmets compulsorily and using seat belts. They should not use mobile phones while driving. They should not violate the stop line. In the first phase, we have selected four areas — Spencer’s junction, Anna Arch, Madhavaram roundtana and Thiruvanmiyur bus terminus.”

“For the first week, we will advise the public, instead of booking cases or issuing challans to the violators straight away, and ask them to follow all road rules. After this, we will start enforcing rules,” he said.

“Only after perfect implementation of zero tolerance, will we extend the programme to other areas. Each and every resident of the city should follow the rules to ensure safety to everyone and create a sense of safeness among the community,” Mr. Aggarwal said, appealing to the public to cooperate with the traffic police for successful implementation.

“The impression on any city will be formed depending on the traffic movement. In a few cities of the country, people follow traffic rules and regulations properly. Such cities always have a special image,” he added.","Four places will have increased police presence, stricter rule enforcementFor effective implementation of traffic rules, the police have introduced ‘zero tolerance traffic junctions’ from Saturday, where erring motorists will face more police personnel and stringent action for not following the rules.
“Zero tolerance junctions, where additional police personnel will be deployed, are going to be declared from Saturday.
Motorists should follow all traffic rule such as adhering to signals, wearing helmets compulsorily and using seat belts.

All the vehicles at Spencer Plaza signal could be seen stopping behind the Stop Line on Wednesday.

Policemen at the junction were picking up the motorists without helmets to the side of to tell the erring drivers to follow the traffic rules for their own safety. It is one of the four 'zero traffic violation junctions'.

Anna Arch, Madhavaram Roundtana and Thiruvanmiyur junction are the other three. At these junctions, 10 police personnel from traffic wing and 10 more from Armed Reserve and Tamilnadu Special Police are deployed everyday from 6 a.m to 10 p.m to educate motorists about traffic rules and road safety.

To make it comprehensive, the grids have been painted and CCTV cameras have been made functional. Signboards are put up to teach motorists and pedestrians the rules they should follow at these junctions. Later this week, the city police will stop advise and start levying fine.

City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal has inspected these junctions everyday since the introduction of the project last Saturday and has given various instructions to improve the road traffic system, sources said.

Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, N.Kannan told The Hindu, “The objective is to ensure compliance of traffic rules voluntarily. Previously one or two policemen will be posted at these junctions and they were unable to nab the hundreds of violators. Now we have more strength in the junctions to identify violators. We are not punishing them at these junctions though we are taking punitive action at other places. We are trying to make the violators realise the mistake and giving them an opportunity to correct themselves.”

“After a week's time, We will begin penalising the violators who cross the zero violation traffic junctions and thereafter will extend similar junctions to other areas,” he said.

Triple riding youth

Viewing the menace of triple riding and rash driving by youngsters seriously, Chennai Traffic Police along with law and order police will nab the revellers/ violators who create ruckus on city roads.

Mr. Aggarwal has issued necessary instructions to law and order police to take strict action against youth who indulge in triple riding revelry. A senior police officer said, “Sometimes, the youngsters with colored hair are found creating nuisance on public roads without bothering about other road users. They are also found involved in criminal activities and have escaped in high-end vehicles. Now, both law and order and traffic police have been instructed to nab such errant bikers.”","Policemen at the junction were picking up the motorists without helmets to the side of to tell the erring drivers to follow the traffic rules for their own safety.

Should Zimbabweans continue to die of thirst standing in water?

In other words, must our people persistently suffer want standing on soils that only require us to open their windows for deals to be clinched to end hunger?

The windows in point here are successive rows of evenly spaced holes dug in a field and into which you (yes, you) the farmer drop two grains of seed maize.

You wait for germination to occur, nurse the plants into fruition and you are home and dry with surfeited family bellies and fill the granaries, ogled by sluggards at home and abroad.

The Pfumvudza/Intwasa method of farming popularised by our Second Republic is not an entirely new way of growing food as individual farmers particularly in rural areas have used it on some small holdings, namely vegetable gardens and realised bumper harvests.

The zero-tillage agricultural methodology comes handy particularly in regions where recurrent droughts spawned by global warming have wiped out crops and pastures and left cattle used as drought power dangerously crony to put under yoke, what with the hardy animal, the donkey, now a scarce resource.

Zimbabwe may not in a long time again become a bread basket on the African continent, as it once was soon after independence, courtesy of the peasants’ hard work.

But that is no great deal in light of a Western imperialist economic embargo which has left our economy augmented by global warming and aggravated by Satan’s Covid-19 global pandemic which has decimated economies around the globe.

When our people have enough food on the dinner table and a surplus to fall back on in times of need, the Government will use the scarce foreign currency available not on food imports but to grow the economy further.

It is important to note however that for zero-tillage agriculture to succeed, its supervision is of prime importance, and this means that crops, such as small grains which are germane in particular ecological zones should be grown there instead of peasant farmers going the whole hog on maize.

In this regard, while colonial Rhodesian regimes may have been racially oppressive against blacks, they did ensure effective supervision of food production by posting agricultural demonstrations to rural areas where they lived in accommodation similar to those provided in urban areas so that the specialists put lavish urban lifestyles behind their backs and instead put their shoulders to the wheel, as it were, by making sure in loco that Africans grew more food for themselves without looking to the settler regimes for food supplements.

That way the foreign rulers were certain that they would skim and savour the cream of our abducted motherland without the natives bearing angry red eyes at them.

The same type of supervision of farmers should be stepped up under devolution.

Unfortunately, however, modern technology appears to some of our leaders to also enjoy supervisory control of farmers to the extent that messages on Pfumvudza/Intwasa encoded in music played on radio are expected to serve as a magic wand.

That countless numbers of school going children in rural areas missed out on radio lessons broadcast during the current coronavirus lockdown because some people encoded in cushy offices in urban areas believed erroneously that the music on Pfumvudza/Intwasa would cascade down to even the remotest parts of the country, when they ought to have made sure in the first place that the parents of these children out there in the sticks owned radio sets.

What a tragic irony this is for our educators.

Be that as it may, zero-tillage agriculture has come in handy to our nation to the extent that workers in towns also growing food under Pfumvudza/Intwasa in peri-urban areas may invest incomes otherwise set aside to buy food into projects that help to grow the economy.

But while the Government may genuinely be averse to promoting a dependency syndrome among it’s people the powers that be might however wish to organise mechanised traction on hire for a modest fee and/or a restocking or livestock feeding programme for organized communal farmers whose draught power suffered the effects of global warming onslaught so that everyone in the country contributes to growing our economy.

That way our leaders will no doubt bask in the yap yap hoorays of the people and enjoy another mandate yet.

Or who does not wish to be raised shoulder high in the hearts of their counterparts?","The zero-tillage agricultural methodology comes handy particularly in regions where recurrent droughts spawned by global warming have wiped out crops and pastures and left cattle used as drought power dangerously crony to put under yoke, what with the hardy animal, the donkey, now a scarce resource.

""Regrettably I think another 11 or 12 turned up yesterday despite our fairly extensive communication program to encourage people not to return to Victoria from NSW, but nevertheless they're doing their 14 days of isolation in our hotel quarantine program,"" Victoria's testing commander Jeroen Weimar said.

Mr Weimar said while it would not be the Christmas those travellers would want, they have no choice but to isolate after arriving by plane from a hot zone.

State health authorities performed more than 19,000 tests yesterday, and advised that testing sites will remain open even during public holidays, however some may be scaled back until the new year.

Mr Weimar urged people to Victorians to continue getting tested despite the Christmas break, with testing sites opening up at popular holiday spots such as Torquay, Lorne and the Mornington Peninsula.

""The virus doesn't stop for Christmas; we don't stop for Christmas,"" he said.

""If you've got symptoms on Christmas Day, go and get tested on Christmas Day.""

There are just 10 active cases currently in Victoria, all of whom are in quarantine or self-isolation.

Currently, residents from Greater Sydney and the Central Coast are unable to travel into Victoria.

Anyone from these zones found trying to enter Victoria in breach of this order will be subject to 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine.

The rest of New South Wales, including the overwhelming majority of regional city centres, must hold a valid permit or exemption. Some border towns do not apply.

Meanwhile, an infected teenage girl who returned to Melbourne from Sydney's Northern Beaches continues to isolate while her close contacts have all returned negative test results.

Working in close co-operation with the Qatar Football Association (QFA), the Qatari Authorities, especially the medical teams, and the Local Organising Committee (LOC), the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) conducted 12,139 tests between November 9 and December 19, 2020 and no positive tests were recorded among those in the bio-secure bubble.

The strict application of the ‘AFC Match Operations Protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic' proved extremely effective during the AFC Champions League which was won by Ulsan Hyundai FC of Korea Republic in last Saturday's final at the Al Janoub Stadium - watched by the AFC President Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa along with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

The introduction by the AFC and the LOC of a stringent set of health protocols, taking guidance from the key operational principles applied to all local football events in Qatar, also allowed spectators up to 30% of the stadium capacity the opportunity to witness the Continental club showpiece ‘live'.

And a further 10,000 Rapid Antigen tests were conducted to ensure that the spectators could attend the exciting final with confidence. All the tests carried out returned negative results.

The AFC Champions League (East) also enjoyed another milestone when the first women Medical Officers - Dr Zohreh Haratian and Dr. Bahar Hassanmiraei, from Iran, Dr Janis Ann Figueroa Espino-De Vera, from the Philippines and Dr. Liesel Geertsema of New Zealand were appointed in an AFC men's club competition as part of the nine-strong AFC Medical team.

'The efforts and diligence of multiple stakeholders across several months, coupled with the implementation of seamless health and safety protocols, enabled the safe resumption of football with thousands of supporters in the stadium in spite of the challenges posed by Covid-19.

286,https://www.zerohanger.com/21-questions-for-a-collingwood-magpies-members-forum-afl-2020-2021-71365/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Zero Hanger,21 Questions for the Collingwood members forum,"The Collingwood Football Club has heralded their seventh annual members forum, to be held on the 14th of December.

The club proclaims they will step supporters through their “strategy”, and shed light on their “short and medium term ambitions”.

Now maybe it’s the cynic in me, but will the debrief be that they wanted to go to the draft to replenish their list, that they couldn’t get market value for outgoing players due to a lack of leverage, but they have a good young list and are looking at a quick turnaround to get right back into contention?

And, hallelujah, let’s agree everything is well at Collingwood?

Even when it isn’t?

The Forum will be virtual, due to COVID-19. Fair enough. But the supporters I talk to are all of the same opinion that questions will be Dorothy Dixers.

For those who don’t know what this means, here’s the Wikipedia definition:

“In Australian politics, a Dorothy Dixer is a rehearsed or planted question asked of a government Minister by a backbencher of their own political party during Parliamentary Question Time.”

This cannot be an exercise in futility.

It mustn’t be.

Somebody told me to let this go. The problem here is this is not just about one thing. That one thing (the trade period) is just the cherry on top of a black and white sundae reeking of sour dairy.

To let this go is to accept poor governance.

To let this go is to excuse poor decisions.

To let this go is to celebrate mistakes.

Let this go?

So … what? Next time anything happens, we all scratch our heads and profess we don’t know how [INSERT ISSUE] could’ve happened? But it’s okay because we trust it won’t happen again – yet again?

In any form of life, the only way you learn, the only way an organisation can improve, is when the individual or group is held accountable.

Then they either get better, or get better people involved.

And if they don’t, they get left behind.

This is why it’s not as simple a case as “let it go”.

There are genuine issues here that need to be addressed.

While the focus is obviously going to be on Collingwood’s 2020 trade period, other questions have also accumulated.

Also, some of those questions from the past have a direct bearing on how and why things are happening now, or why the things happening now can’t be considered outliers.

It would be easy to dismiss me as the lone dissenter. While some have resigned themselves following the trade period, others are still angry and restless. Take a look at the message forums. Take a look at social media.

This is the biggest groundswell of dissatisfaction I’ve seen and experienced at Collingwood in many, many years – in decades.

So instead of glibly trying to skirt past the problems, instead of expecting a cult-like acceptance that there’s nothing to see here, let’s pull it all out into the light for thorough examination, demand some accountability, and from there work out the best way to move forward.

If supporters still want to bury their heads in the sand, or profess that everything’s going swimmingly, that’s fine. That’s your prerogative.

But for the rest of us, let’s LEARN.

I had a list of these queries over two months ago. They were general questions about the state of how Collingwood was faring. Now, following the trade period, they’ve grown and exploded into a much-more comprehensive and searching collection.

I want to make these questions public – to permeate the public consciousness, so either supporters take these questions with them and inundate Collingwood; the club learns of their existence and addresses them; and/or these questions become ingrained as the standard and a failure to answer them implies they’re being avoided.

1. The Salary Cap

Collingwood missed finals 2014–17. They had a whole swath of premiership players depart. The incoming players of note were Daniel Wells, Chris Mayne, Taylor Adams, Brodie Grundy, and Jeremy Howe. The only notable draftees were Grundy, Jordan De Goey and Brayden Maynard.

With the lack of success and quantity of outgoing players during this period, how is it the salary cap became so tight?

In the last two years, Collingwood have traded, delisted, or retired (among others) James Aish, Adam Treloar, Tom Phillips, Jaidyn Stephenson, Ben Reid, Travis Varcoe, Tom Langdon and Dayne Beams.

It’s astonishing so may names have now exited, and queries remain.

While we are still paying part of Adam Treloar’s salary, are we still also paying part of Tom Phillips’, Jaidyn Stephenson’, Dayne Beams’ and Tom Langdon’s? If so, how much? And for how long?

Is there anybody else we’re still paying?

The counter might be every club flirts with paying the full salary cap. Fine. But just recently, the AFL advised clubs to cope with salary cap cuts by back-ending contracts. The clubs responded angrily.

Michael Gleeson wrote a piece about this in The Age, where one list manager – who wanted to remain anonymous – commented, “We will have 18 Collingwoods next year with everyone forced to push the problem down the road. We have worked for years to get our cap under control and keep it under control – as have other clubs – and the AFL advice is to blow it up again.”

Does this not show how atypical this problem is, and how incongruent it is with good management?

What Collingwood did wasn’t a strategy.

It’s folly to normalise it or rationalise it as “hard decisions had to be made”.

The club should’ve never let themselves get into this position in the first place.

It was a bungle.

No other club has gone through a similar purge. Yes, players have left other clubs, but usually to pursue opportunities elsewhere, e.g. Joe Daniher, Orazio Fantasia and Adam Saad all wanted to leave Essendon. Essendon tried to keep them but couldn’t.

At Collingwood, these players wanted to stay. Collingwood drove them out due to the bulging salary cap.

The Magpies now sit as a cautionary tale.

That, in itself, is damning.

2. Back-Ending

Have we retained players simply because we back-ended contracts, and thus became financially obligated to them?

Here’s a simpler way of putting it: are there players who, on performance, we would’ve cut, but we couldn’t because we’d back-ended and back-ended until they became entrenched within the salary cap, and thus had to remain on the list?

If so, this directly impacts Collingwood’s ability to re-sign and pursue talent because they’re obligated to contracts, rather than to players.

3. Graeme Allan

Collingwood had a proven football manager in Neil Balme. Who made the decision to appoint Graeme Allan in 2017? Was it a committee decision? Or was it a captain’s call? Balme then left the club – with good reason too given Allan’s recruitment squeezed Balme out of his own position.

Is it true Allan was appointed with the mandate to get Collingwood in the finals “no matter what” to mollify supporter unrest at that time?

Who gave him such power to make grandiose free agent acquisitions? Were they even done in accordance with the senior coach? Buckley’s response to Chris Mayne in that first season would suggest not.

In the case of Wells, who’d be 32 when the new season started, did Collingwood truly believe that he could play another three years given his injury profile? As it is, just how many 35-year-olds are running around in the AFL?

Why were the club not more judicious in their decision-making?

Or did desperation overrule good sense?

Is desperation the best way to run a club?

4. Dayne Beams

By Nathan Buckley’s admission, Collingwood’s salary cap was tight. This did not just occur overnight. It would’ve been building, and it definitely would’ve been evident as little as two years ago.

Who then decided squeezing in Dayne Beams was a good idea?

Was this the football department’s decision? Or was it a captain’s call? Or was it a politicised decision, i.e. the return of the prodigal son, to prove the cultural growth at Collingwood, and that a player who’d allegedly left (in part) due to his relationship with coach Nathan Buckley was willing to play under him again?

Did the club perform due diligence on Beams? This would seem unlikely given all the red flags that would come up in just the next six months.

Given Collingwood had all the leverage in this deal, why did they surrender so much? Did they consider hard-balling Brisbane?

Compare the way the Bulldogs dealt with Collingwood in regards to Adam Treloar, North Melbourne with Collingwood in relation to Jaidyn Stephenson, and Hawthorn in securing Tom Phillips, with how Brisbane handled Dayne Beams’ exit.

Good on Brisbane, the Bulldogs, North Melbourne and Hawthorn in getting the best value possible for their clubs.

5. The Trade Exodus

If we accept back-ending as a methodology to keep a list together, why did we not trade out players earlier — particularly following the 2018 Grand Final when their value would’ve been at their highest?

Why did we not trade out when we had command of the situation?

Why did senior figures (Ned Guy, Geoff Walsh, Mark Anderson, Nathan Buckley and Eddie McGuire) all sell different stories as to the motivation of what was happening in the trade period?

Buckley unequivocally admitted that the salary cap was an issue. Both Guy and Walsh insisted the salary cap wasn’t an issue.

While I’m sure all this could be massaged into the claim it might’ve been a little bit of everything so everybody was telling the truth, the reality appears that some of these people outright lied to us.

I’m surprised this isn’t a bigger issue.

6. The 2020 Trade Period

It truly seems that when Kim Ravaillion signed with the Queensland Firebirds, Collingwood saw an opportunity to convince hubby Adam Treloar to go to Queensland. The Gold Coast Suns were the only likely destination, given Brisbane were focused on Joe Daniher. The Suns had a juicy pick 5 in the offing. Treloar didn’t want to go.

How much of the narrative surrounding the Treloar deal – from the “hard to coach” comment, concerns about his ability to perform at an elite standard in 2021, and the leadership group wanting him out – truly came from Collingwood?

If Collingwood are/were truly concerned about Treloar’s mental health in 2021 with his wife interstate, did they just dump the problem onto the Bulldogs? How is this synonymous with a club being conscious about player welfare? Doesn’t it actually recontextualise Collingwood’s earlier claim (fearing Treloar could not perform at his best while his wife was in Queensland) as hypocritical?

Was there ever a possibility that we would not go ahead with any of these 2020 trades and retain these players? The truth is it seems they were always destined to go, so opposition clubs just waited until the deadline, and then forced Collingwood to take scraps.

Examining the transactions, Collingwood traded Stephenson, Atu Bosenavulagi and pick 39 for picks 26, Pick 33, and a future fourth-rounder.

Collingwood then traded Adam Treloar, 26, 33 and 42, for pick 14 and future second-round selection.

Effectively, they traded Treloar, Stephenson, Bosenavulagi, Pick 39, and Pick 42, for pick 14 and a future second-rounder – five selections for one low first rounder, and (given the Bulldogs are expected to play finals) a low second rounder.

I’m unsure how anybody justifies that as good trading.

Mason Cox renegotiated his contract. Was this put as an option to the outgoing players? Or even to the club as a whole?

7. Contract Management

Given the mess the salary cap management has been, how can we have confidence in the incumbents to manage it successfully in the future?

With all the shuffling and juggling going on, are we entirely sure we’re clear of any salary cap breaches?

Do we map out the salary cap over a prolonged period, so we know roughly the way it should look year after year for a period of – for example – five years?

Do we take into account what we believe re-signings will cost, who might get a sudden bump, etc.?

Or are we just winging it?

8. Jaidyn Stephenson

Stephenson won the Rising Star in 2018. His statistical return in 2019 is better than his debut year. Granted, he did something stupid with his gambling indiscretion – but lots of young players are guilty of stupid acts.

In 2020, he had glandular fever and struggled to navigate the compromised season and hub-life.

Why was he suddenly considered expendable?

We have seen other players be wayward in their early years, and then blossom into champions, e.g. Dane Swan.

If Stephenson caused off-field issues as is rumoured, how severe were these that the club concluded he was not only irredeemable, but grossly depreciable in terms of trading out?

Isn’t it the club’s responsibility to cultivate and redeem Stephenson given their investment in him? Did they not consider that a normal season might help ground him and refocus him?

Or is the truth that the coaching staff could not find a way to connect to Stephenson, and thus out he went?

9. Height

This club has relied on Moneyball options for key positions — Mason Cox, Brodie Mihocek, Lynden Dunn, Jordan Roughead, etc.

Why have we not invested in genuine height outside a handful of picks?

Or why have we not targeted height in trading, e.g. focusing on Steven May instead of Dayne Beams?

10. Indigenous Players

Why does Collingwood have such a poor record recruiting Indigenous players?

11. Heritier Lumumba

How is Collingwood dealing with Heritier Lumumba?

12. Gameplan



In 2018, we played daring, exciting football. Between 2019–2020, it seems we employed the stodgy, unadventurous, vulnerable gameplan from 2014–17.

At the very least, we’re seeing the same quirks – poor decision-making, skill errors, devolving ball movement, easy opposition goals on the counter-attack, etc.

Either we’re foolishly trying to still make this particular gameplan work, despite the overwhelming evidence it’s unsustainable, or this isn’t the way we want to play, which means the coaches are unsuccessful in communicating the way they do want to play.

Which is the case?

Also, is it true that after implementing a direct and quick approach in their thrilling upset win against the Eagles in the Elimination Final, that Collingwood decided to revert to the short, chipping, indirect gameplan for the Semi Final against Geelong?

If so, is it true senior members at Collingwood had robust disagreements about it which disheartened the playing group and led to the insipid effort (or lack thereof) in that final?

13. Ruck–Midfield Relationship

The lack of rapport between ruck and midfield was an issue as far back as the 2018 Grand Final. It remained a constant throughout 2019. It was then highlighted in the 2019 Preliminary Final. And it remains an issue to this day.

When will this be successfully addressed? Surely it shouldn’t take three years to work out midfield synergy. Who is responsible for this department?

14. Coaches

Given our lack of success with this coaching panel, why have we not made changes? E.g. why have we not pursued somebody like Luke Hodge or Sam Mitchell as assistants?

With no disrespect intended to Robert Harvey and Brenton Sanderson, shouldn’t we get an injection of fresh ideas coming through the place?

Why do we not recruit a specialist ruck coach for Brodie Grundy, Mason Cox, Darcy Cameron and Max Lynch, instead of using a player who was a pinch-hit ruckman in Anthony Rocca?

Why have we appointed a midfielder (Harvey) to be the defensive line coach? We saw how dramatically we improved in the one year (2018) when we had an injection of fresh ideas.

If Collingwood struggle next year, would we be looking at wholesale changes? Or will Buckley be backed in to oversee another rebuild?

What’s a pass mark? Is there a fail mark?

15. The Presidency



Eddie McGuire was voted into power at the end of 1998. He was brilliant in guiding Collingwood back to respectability, and overseeing their growth into a Victorian powerhouse. But everybody has their time, and several issues have marred the second half of his tenure.

Is one of the motivations behind his longevity to become the longest-serving Collingwood president, which would mean he overtakes Harry Curtis (twenty-six years: 1924–1950)?

(As an aside, it should be highlighted that Collingwood won 6 flags in the first twelve years of Curtis’s reign, and zero in the next fourteen years. They played in the finals on only four occasions from 1940–1950, and appeared in no grand finals.)

Does McGuire have any plan to relinquish power? Or does he intend to rule until they pry Collingwood from his cold, dead hand?

We have seen some unpardonable gaffes, e.g. what he said about Adam Goodes, Caroline Wilson and Cynthia Banham. Any other employee in any other industry would’ve been immediately terminated. We have afforded him considerable leeway.

This year, McGuire passionately demanded that the next player to commit a COV-19 related breach should be punished stringently.

That next player was Collingwood’s vice-captain, Steele Sidebottom.

Not long after, McGuire then double-downed with another rant.

His senior coach (Buckley) and senior assistant (Sanderson) then committed the next indiscretion.

While McGuire should be commended for insisting on high standards of governance within the AFL given the seriousness and threat of COVID-19, does he not realise how public declamations impact Collingwood?

Also, is it true that following Sidebottom’s suspension, senior figures at Collingwood had strong words about the suspension’s length, and felt that McGuire’s COVID-rant had backed them into a place they could not appeal the length of the suspension?

Allegedly, in the early 1990s when then-president Allan McAlister made a series of gaffes, the committee gagged him.

Have the committee had similar concerns with McGuire?

Even Caroline Wilson pointed out on Footy Classified that McGuire’s episodes affect Collingwood. Rather than address this seriously or constructively, McGuire jokingly walked off set.

Can McGuire himself not see how disruptive all this is?

16. The Presidency and the Board

As far as the president and the board go, why do we not have fixed terms, so that there’s always new ideas and new hunger coming through?

17. The Football Manager / Geoff Walsh

Did Geoff Walsh retire? Or was he the sacrifice – an attempt to appease the masses following the debacle of the trade period?

18. Only the Best

We are a club whose motto is “Only the Best”.

But in which departments can we truly boast that we have the best personnel? It seems a lot of appointments come internally. Are we that fortunate that we have the best personnel readily available at all times? If they are the best, why didn’t they have those jobs in the first place?

Given we’re a wealthy club, why don’t we simply pay the tax that comes from exceeding the soft cap and appoint whoever we need to find whatever advantage we can?

Fitness, medical and – now – list management/trading are three areas that have question marks.

If we want to be the best, shouldn’t the best take care of our most precious assets?

19. The Plan

Brendan Gale famously set down Richmond’s plan years ago. Other clubs have similar (but less publicised) blueprints.

We seem to improvise and adapt. Certainly, a fire sale couldn’t have been in any of our planning.

While we profess a short- and medium-term plan, what is it?

What is our blueprint moving forward?

What is our expectation for 2021?

Where does Collingwood foresee itself by 2025 and 2030?

20. Social Media

Why are the club’s social media messages so tonally incongruous to the current landscape?

For example, deep into the trade period, the club changed their Facebook banner to a picture of Scott Pendlebury (AFL captain), Steph Chiocci (AFLW captain) and Geva Mentor (Collingwood netball captain), with the slogan “Made by Many”.

It’s an odd message to be selling while driving players out. Supporters responded with unsurprising vitriol. This should’ve shown the club what a foul-up this was.

But, on the final day of the trade period, the Twitter account asked supporters what they expected from the day – just hours before Collingwood exited four players.

Again, supporters responded angrily.

Collingwood sent out memorabilia to the members proclaiming, “TOGETHER FOREVER”.

Um, what?

Do you honestly not realise how much this jars with the collective feeling at the time?

21. Members

How many members have cancelled following the trade period?

While some of these cancellations can obviously be attributed to COVID-19, and not knowing what 2021 will look like, does the club read the genuine displeasure that is now rustling through the supporter base?

Will 2021 memberships in any way be discounted given a 2020 membership was effectively just a donation to the club?

While the membership department is now operating with a skeleton staff, I know various members who’ve complained about how they’ve been treated in the past.

They feel the membership department is prompt and eager when they want money, but hard to contact or get an answer from if it’s another query.

Conclusion

While there’ll always be on and off-field issues in football, does the club understand how shaken Collingwood supporters are?

This is not just about one player.

And it’s not just about one block of time (the trade period).

This has built over the last decade.

In 2017, many of the supporters were disillusioned with how Collingwood were moving forward, and had found the previous five years – repeatedly missing finals, constant injuries, list management queries, off-field indiscretions, etc. – disenfranchising.

The grand final appearance in 2018 was a bandage over all this, but 2019 ripped that bandage off, and 2020 rubbed salt into the wound.

Some supporters have “gotten over it”, or resigned themselves, but they haven’t really, because they expect the club to emerge constructively and positively, but because they know nothing will really change and there’s no point arguing.

Others are still dissatisfied.

Outside of blind patriotism and the typical calls for unity, given everything that’s happened, why should we have confidence in the incumbents moving forward?

In the last decade, these questionable decisions have occurred over and over and over.

The genuine tragedy isn’t that they’ve happened.

But that they could again.","The Collingwood Football Club has heralded their seventh annual members forum, to be held on the 14th of December.
That one thing (the trade period) is just the cherry on top of a black and white sundae reeking of sour dairy.
While the focus is obviously going to be on Collingwood’s 2020 trade period, other questions have also accumulated.
Given Collingwood had all the leverage in this deal, why did they surrender so much?
ConclusionWhile there’ll always be on and off-field issues in football, does the club understand how shaken Collingwood supporters are?"
