Here's what a new mom revealed,"Childbirth experience might differ from women to women but the tremendous labour pain and discomfort is more or less the same for all. But, some Australian mothers are claiming that there is a simple technique that can reduce 'mental pain' and discomfort throughout the process.

The simple technique is 'hypnosis' – new mother Eva and Australian lifestyle hypnotist, Mark Stephens, recently revealed its benefits on Today.

Both of them claim that the technique helps in reducing stress and pain of childbirth. ""Hypnotism gets rid of the fear that you have of the birth and prepares you, especially mentally, for the arrival of the baby,"" the first time mother said.

According to Mark, ""It's about learning how to meditate and changing the idea of pain into a feeling and changing the idea of a contraction into a wave.""

Eva claims that this technique helped with her contractions reducing her 'mental pain'. Mark explains: ""As each wave comes along breathe with that so in between those waves (contractions) it's a mindful breathing, a mindful meditation.""

Mark further explained that when contractions come along women should be breathing deeply. Once they are 'deep into this state' their 'body releases serotonin and endorphins while also reducing the cortisol and adrenaline'.

Eva shared her experience saying: ""My last one [contraction] I would call a tsunami, which my son learned to ride into the world so we really loved that experience."" She believes that this technique helped in reducing her pain by 80 percent.

Mark says that use of visualisation techniques can be helpful and said that during the process mothers should have happy thoughts or think about a happy place.

""Obviously your doctor is the professional in the room and their main objective is to bring about the safety of the mum and the bub so you need to listen to them, but this technique can make you feel calmer,"" Mark noted.

However, he also adds that it might not work for everyone but believes that every mother could benefit from learning relaxation techniques, breathing and meditation.","But, some Australian mothers are claiming that there is a simple technique that can reduce 'mental pain' and discomfort throughout the process.

Material scientists at The University of Manchester, working in collaboration with universities in China, have created a ‘durable and washable, concrete-like’ composite material made from antibacterial copper nanoparticles. They have also developed a way of binding the composite to wearable materials such as cotton and polyester, which has proved a stumbling block for scientists in the past.

Bacterial infection is a major issue in hospitals across the UK and has been rising due to its spread on surfaces and clothing. E. coli infections alone killed more than 5,500 NHS patients in 2015 and Government estimates put the cost of such infections to the NHS at £2.3 billion this year alone.

Precious metals, such as gold and silver, have excellent antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, but their commercial use in textiles is prohibitive due to extremely high costs. That means copper is the material of choice for researchers as it has very similar antibacterial properties to gold and silver but is much cheaper. That’s why material chemists are focussing their attentions on exploring the possibility of using copper as the ultimate antimicrobial agent.

However, prior to this breakthrough, techniques for binding copper to materials like cotton for medical and antimicrobial textile production had limitations. Now, using a process called ‘Polymer Surface Grafting’, the research team has tethered copper nanoparticles to cotton and polyester using a polymer brush, creating a strong chemical bond.","Doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals could soon be wearing uniforms brushed with tiny copper nanoparticles to reduce the spread of bacterial infections and viruses, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), at hospitals.

Icosapent ethyl reduced triglycerides and other inflammatory and atherogenic markers in patients with reduced kidney function, persistent high triglycerides and either diabetes or elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein who were treated with statins, according to data presented at the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meetings.

Treatment with icosapent ethyl (Vascepa, Amarin) 4 g per day did not raise LDL and had no negative effect on renal function.

“Residual cardiovascular risk remains in some patients despite optimized statin therapy and may necessitate add-on therapy to reduce this risk,” Krishnaswami Vijayaraghavan, MD, FACC, FACP, FNLA, FHFSA, medical director of the congestive heart failure program at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital in Phoenix, told Cardiology Today. “Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, lowers plasma triglyceride levels without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and has potential beneficial effects on atherosclerotic plaques. The mechanistic behavior of the EPA agent icosapent ethyl is fascinating. Animal studies have shown that EPA reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In clinical trials utilizing a wide spectrum of plaque imaging modalities, EPA has shown beneficial effects on plaque characteristics. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease receiving statin therapy suggest that EPA may decrease plaque vulnerability and prevent plaque progression.”

Triglyceride reduction in diabetes

Harold M. Szerlip, MD, FACP, FCCP, FASN, FNKF, chief of the nephrology division and director of the nephrology fellowship program at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, and colleagues analyzed data from the ANCHOR trial of 198 patients with increased CVD risk who were treated with statins and had triglycerides between 200 mg/dL and 499 mg/dL even with LDL levels between 40 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL. In this analysis, patients also had diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 for more than 3 months.

Patients were assigned 4 g per day of icosapent ethyl (n = 98; mean age, 63 years; 57% men) or placebo (n=100; mean age, 63 years; 54% men).

Triglycerides decreased by 19.7% in patients assigned icosapent ethyl without increasing LDL compared with patients assigned placebo (P < .0001). This treatment also significantly improved other potentially inflammatory and atherogenic parameters.

At baseline and 12 weeks, respectively, serum creatinine was 0.9 and 0.9 mg/dL, eGFR was 75.4 and 79.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, and albumin was 4.5 and 4.5 g/dL for icosapent ethyl 4 g per day. All percentage changes vs. placebo were not statistically significant.

EPA increased by 611.7% in red blood cells and by 676.2% in plasma in the icosapent ethyl group vs. placebo (P for both < .0001).

“At the present time, physicians should be aware of the data and understand the increased risk that their patients with reduced renal function and diabetes have,” Szerlip told Cardiology Today. “All necessary interventions to decrease their cardiovascular risk burden should be employed. These interventions include a healthy diet, exercise, weight reduction, smoking cessation, stringent BP control as per our new guidelines, statin use and blood sugar control.”

Triglycerides and high-sensitivity CRP

In a separate presentation, Vijayaraghavan and colleagues analyzed data from 152 patients from the ANCHOR trial with increased CVD risk who were treated with statins and had triglycerides between 200 mg/dL and 499 mg/dL even with LDL levels between 40 mg/dL and 99 mg/dL. Patients also had elevated high-sensitivity CRP greater than 2 mg/dL at baseline and an eGFR less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 for more than 3 months.

In this analysis, 72 patients were assigned 4 g per day of icosapent ethyl (mean age, 63 years; 58% men) and 80 patients were assigned placebo (mean age, 64 years; 50% men).

Triglycerides decreased by 16.9% in patients assigned icosapent ethyl compared with those assigned placebo (P < .0001). This decrease did not affect LDL and resulted in an improvement in other potentially inflammatory or atherogenic parameters.

Icosapent ethyl 4 g per day did not produce significant changes from baseline to week 12 in serum creatinine, eGFR, albumin, or blood urea nitrogen. At baseline and 12 weeks, respectively, median serum creatinine was 0.9 and 0.9 mg/dL, median eGFR was 72.4 and 78.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, median albumin was 4.5 and 4.4 g/dL, and median blood urea nitrogen was 18 and 18 mg/dL for icosapent ethyl 4 g per day. All percentage changes vs. placebo were not statistically significant.

Compared with placebo, icosapent ethyl increased EPA by 622% in red blood cells and by 662.7% in plasma (P for both < .0001).

“The clinical implications of these data are meaningful, so far as a health care provider would want to address the larger picture of stabilization of a vulnerable state of higher cardiovascular event risk in the [chronic kidney disease] population with increased inflammatory background,” Vijayaraghavan said in an interview. – by Darlene Dobkowski

Germany is not one of the countries where wages rose most but it did have the largest reduction in wage inequality. Our analysis shows that the German minimum wage policy introduced in 2015 significantly lifted the wages of the lowest-paid employees, particularly the lower-skilled, younger ones or those working in services.

Wages and wage inequality are a topic of intense debate among academics and policymakers in Europe. Before the crisis, discussion centred on wage growth below productivity levels and widening pay differentials across the workforce.

More recently, it has turned to big wage declines in some European countries that were severely hit by the crisis and the sluggish recovery of wages overall. But analysis of the most recent micro-data from the EU-SILC survey, for 2015, shows a reversal of negative trends in many EU Member States.

Wages rise and wage inequality falls

Average real wages increased in more than two-thirds of EU countries in 2015 but there were substantial differences across the region (see first column in table below). Wages grew in most eastern European countries and, indeed, to a much greater extent than in most western European countries, where wage growth was rather subdued or even negative, especially in Mediterranean countries; exceptions to this trend were Denmark, Germany, Ireland and France. Similarly, wage inequality declined in around two-thirds of EU countries (see final column in table), although there is no significant association between the changes in average wage levels and in wage inequality levels.

Three main patterns emerge from the analysis:

Strong wage growth (4%–12%), mainly due to wages improving more among the lowest-paid employees (quintile 1), causing a fall in wage inequality. We see this pattern in much of eastern Europe – the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania – although not in Bulgaria, especially, nor Hungary, where wages grew more robustly among the higher-paid. More moderate wage growth (1%–3%), mostly due to wage increases among the highest-paid employees, leading to hikes in wage inequality. This is apparent in Denmark, Ireland, France, Italy and Finland. Wage declines or stagnation (growth of 1% or less) alongside falls in wage inequality generally, mainly due to wage reductions among the highest-paid (Quintile 5). The table shows this pattern in most countries from Croatia downwards, most significantly in Sweden and the UK.

Germany is similar to the second group of countries because real wages grew significantly (3.5%), although below the rates of eastern European countries. But growth over the wage distribution is completely different in this case: wages increased disproportionately among the lowest-paid employees (by almost 20% in wage quintile 1), which explains why Germany registered the largest reduction in wage inequality among all EU countries in 2015.

Change in average real wages by wage quintile and change in wage inequality, EU Member States, 2015

Note: Countries are ranked by the magnitude of the wage growth.

Source: EU-SILC

Impact of Germany’s minimum wage policy

The marked increase in wage levels among the lowest-paid employees in Germany can only be explained by the introduction of a minimum wage in 2015. This was a major policy decision aimed at fighting the rising numbers of employees not covered by wage floors and the growth of low-paid work in the country. Our analysis of the data shows this policy decision introduced a significant break in the wage dynamics of the German labour market, where wage inequality had expanded in 2014.

Some groups within the workforce benefited more from this development than others. As the figure below illustrates, wage gains were significantly higher among the youngest and oldest age groups; employees with lower educational attainment; female employees; part-time employees; employees working in smaller companies; and employees in low-skilled occupational categories (blue-collar especially but also white-collar to a lesser extent). In terms of economic sector, employees working in services benefited greatly. For instance, those working in arts, entertainment and recreation saw the highest wage boost, although employees in other service sectors – including information and communication, and real estate, professional and administrative activities – also saw substantial gains. Increases among employees in construction and retail, though lower, were still higher than average.

The main reason why the relative wage increase among these groups of employees was much higher is because they are more typically found at the bottom of the wage distribution, which is where the minimum wage policy had the biggest impact. This explains why when we look at wages growth specifically among employees in the bottom quintile – comparing the levels of the blue dots in the figure – the disparities according to employee characteristics (age, education, gender and so on), although still present, tend to become more modest. For example, the relative disparities between employees of different age groups in wage quintile 1 (blue dots) are less than those between age groups in the total population of employees (green bars).

Moreover, the beneficial effects of the minimum wage policy on real wage growth and the wage cohesion of the German workforce seem to have come at no significant price. Employment data show the employment prospects of those employees who have benefited more from the introduction of the minimum wage have not deteriorated, proving that fears about the potential dis-employment effects of the policy were exaggerated. The German unemployment rate has indeed gradually declined from above 5% in 2014 to less than 4% in 2017, the lowest rate among EU-28 countries after that of the Czech Republic.

How hard? For the first time since statistics began being kept, reports Spa! (June 26), the total number of gang members in the country dropped below the 20,000 figure.

On May 28, quasi-official broadcaster NHK went so far as to air an installment of its ""Close-up Gendai Plus"" evening news program titled ""Impoverished Gangs.""

""Yakuza who have been hurting financially have been tying up with han-gure (members of non-designated crime groups, such as hot-rod gangs),"" a retired gang leader from the Tokai region commented after seeing the NHK program. ""But arrangements like those are only found in the big cities like Tokyo and Osaka. The yakuza in rural areas don't have other groups to fall back on for income. Of course, there are groups that manage to do all right by shamelessly going to extremes without any qualms at all.""

""Still, I was surprised when a fellow gang member told me he's been pilfering from farms,"" he related.

In this particular instance, the 37-year-old gangster, named Uemura (a pseudonym), began stealing agricultural produce from about three years ago. As his colleague tells it, ""Up to then he had been overseeing operations of food carts at local shrine festivals or involved in various construction work. But the authorities began putting pressure on the shrines and construction companies shun any ties with yakuza.

""Anyway he got into stealing watermelons. During the daytime, he would send out younger gang members to case out promising patches, and then they'd return at night to see what sort of security, if any, was in place. Then they'd hit the ones that didn't have tight security.

""But even if they stole 100 melons, the most they could get for them was only about 300,000 yen. The damn things were heavy, and the ones that got damaged were unsellable. On top of that, while in the fields they'd get stung unmercifully by swarms of mosquitos. My former mate later told me, 'Okay, next time we'll be targeting melons and tomatoes.'""

Last summer, however, an incident occurred. As the gangster's colleague related, ""The farmers formed a roving neighborhood watch group that made the rounds at night. Some houses found ways to block off cars to keep them from driving away. The other guys I work with took off, but they grabbed me and five of them really clobbered me. Then when they saw I was tattooed they said, 'What? You're a yakuza?' I refused to tell them my name or gang affiliation, because having that come out would create even more trouble. The posse members weren't looking for trouble either, so they made me promise I would never do it again, and then sent me on my way with two watermelons.""

With revenues from their traditional shinogi (ways of generating income) on the decline, Spa! notes that yakuza have taken to other types of activities, not necessarily involving breaking the law.

Fanatic hobbyists fascinated by yakuza, for example, can now bid on authentic ""yakuza merchandise"" -- items bearing a gang's crest such as ashtrays are being offered via online auction services. After all, some of the big gangs have warehouses full of the stuff. Bidding on a wall calendar is said to start from 3,000 yen; and according to a reporter for a tabloid magazine covering gang activities, the going rate for a business card bearing the name of a gang's godfather might sell for as much as 30,000 yen, and an album full of old gang-related photographs 100,000 yen.

""I know of some hoods in Osaka who will arrange to sell stuff out of a shuttered store on a shopping street, which they can rent for practically nothing,"" the aforementioned reporter notes. ""They will stock it with stolen cosmetics and other merchandise and peddle it to foreign tourists at bargain prices.""

According to Spa!, other jobs undertaken to make up for financial shortfalls include fortune telling, fake ""artists"" who claim to be selling their own works and employment as security guards.

The Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) said it was the most rapid drop in stillbirths since records began.

Neonatal death rates in twins (where a baby dies within the first 28 days of life) have also fallen by a third, the figures show.

The report, carried out by experts from several universities in the UK, shows that between 2014 and 2016, 305 babies’ lives have been saved.

Twins are still more than one and a half times more likely to be stillborn and more than three times more likely to end with a neonatal death than single babies.

The ratio of mortality rates for stillbirths overall has remained fairly constant over time in terms of baby’s sex, ethnicity, gestational age and birth weight, however, there has been a statistically significant reduction in the rate of stillbirth in twins over the period from 11.07 to 6.16 per 1,000 total births.

Most neonatal mortality rates have also either remained static or showed a small reduction over the three years, but the reduction in neonatal mortality rates for twin pregnancies was statistically significant reducing from 7.81 to 5.34 per 1,000 live births.

Keith Reed, the charity’s chief executive, said: “This is a proud day for Tamba.

“In 2014, Tamba set a strategic plan that aimed to cut poor outcomes in multiple pregnancies. I’m delighted to see that the plan has achieved such a positive outcome.

“This appears to be the fastest recorded drop in stillbirths among any population on record.”

Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive of Sands, said: “It’s welcome news that the rate of baby deaths has fallen in the four years since MBRRACE-UK has been reporting.

“It’s particularly good to see an almost halving of twin stillbirths from 2014. It’s saddening, however, that today’s report shows there was little change in the rate and overall number of babies who died between 2015 and 2016. It’s still the case that almost 15 babies died every day in the UK either before, during or shortly after birth in 2016.

“Today’s report reminds us too that the wider societal picture is important. Poverty, inequality, ethnicity all increase a woman’s risk of losing her baby, as do smoking and obesity. This is MBRRACE-UK’s 4th annual report and, between the lines, it iterates once again that until we have a healthier, better informed, and more equal society, some women will remain at greater risk than others.”

A stillbirth is defined as a baby delivered at or after 24 weeks showing no signs of life, irrespective of when the death occurred.

The report was carried out by carried out by Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK (MBRRACE-UK), a collaboration led from the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford with members from the University of Leicester, University of Liverpool, University of Birmingham, Bradford Institute for Health Research, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, and a GP from Oxford.

Minister for mental health and inequalities, Jackie Doyle-Price, said: “There is nothing more devastating than losing a child, so it is encouraging to see the rate of stillbirths in twins has nearly halved.

“This is positive progress towards our national maternity ambition to halve the rates of stillbirth, neonatal deaths and maternal deaths in the NHS by 2025.","A charity has welcomed news that the twin stillbirth rate has been reduced by almost half.

It was a meeting that brought together agents of change, a group of couples who had had a series of domestic fights and were counseled under a project known as Indashyikirwa implemented by various anti Gender Based Violence (GBV) activists, namely, Rwanda Men’s Resource Centre (RWAMREC), Rwanda Women Network and Care International.

Around 11am when the baby started to feel uncomfortable in the meeting room, Nkundibiza took him out for fresh air.

He put the baby on his back, something akin to taboo for a man in Rwanda. People in the conference hall were surprised, because seeing a man carrying a baby, while the wife was attending the meeting was extraordinary.

However, Nkundibiza was not the type of man who believed in strapping a baby on his back until three years ago.

“I was raised being told that a man doesn’t do domestic work,” he says.

His friends, especially those older than him always tell him that he was bewitched by his wife but gradually the community is seeing the fruits of men helping with domestic work.

During their 13-year marriage, the couple has been at its happiest only three years ago when Nkundibiza started helping his wife with domestic work.

“What I can tell other men is that it does not cost anything to help your spouse with household work and taking care of children which includes changing diapers,” he said.

Clementine Nyirantegerejimana, Nkundibiza’s wife said in the community where they live, it’s not normal to find a man who helps his wife with domestic work.

“Before we started counseling, he couldn’t even hold the baby when it was crying even when I was doing other things. He could say children belong only to me,” she narrates.

Whenever we would come back from farming on our piece of land, he would storm off to drink and return at night demanding for food and would quarrel if it wasn’t ready, she reveals.

“He didn’t beat me but he hardly consulted me on decisions that affected our family,” Nyirantegerejimana says.

After attending training together under the Indashyikirwa project, they were given a list of household chores women do in everyday life, which are taken for granted as they don’t generate any income, she adds.

“After realizing all this, he decided to change and since then when we come from farming, we both go home and do chores at home. For example, if I’m preparing a meal, he can bath the children and take them to bed, if I’m out fetching water, he is also looking for fire wood.”

Their financial welfare has also become better due to better communication. The couple now owns two plots of land and two cows.

Clementine Nyirantegerejimana speaks to the media about how the ‘men engage’ program has helped her family. courtesy.

Women don’t report domestic abuse

ImmaculéeIngabire, the Chairperson of Transparency Rwanda said many women face various forms of violence but rarely report as they fear the reaction of society.

Most of the times, GBV victims are the ones who feel ashamed, and they don’t even want other people to know the situation they live in, she said.

“It’s because of the mindset and culture, that most women have been raised in being told by their parents and communities that they should learn to be patient and obedient to their husbands even when there is abuse,” she said.

Ingabire said everything concerning legal framework on Gender Based Violence is there, however the problem is still related to mentalities and behaviour.

“We really need behavior change and it is a process, you can’t expect to end the GBV in one, two or three years,” she said.

Ingabire urged the government to always take up from where the anti GBV projects end, in order to sustain what they have done to reduce violence in households.

“There are anti GBV committees, they should really be trained and then stay there to continue what those people were doing,” she said.

“I’m sometimes frustrated when I see projects like this ending, and their impacts end as well. It’s like nothing has been done. I’m sure next year, if nothing is done to sustain what has been done, the situation will be even worse,” she added.

David Museruka, the Executive Secretary of RWAMREC, an organisation which aims to address issues of negative masculine behaviors and gender inequalities said one of the challenges they faced when they were implementing the project was that it takes long to change a person’s mindset.

“We need to partner with government institutions and put it into planning in order to continue with these anti GBV activities especially when we are not there,” he said.

More than 2,500 people including couples have been trained and are expected to train others at the household level within seven districts in 14 sectors covered by

Mary Barikungeli, the Executive Secretary of Rwanda Women Network, said the outcomes of the projects are obvious, as men have been engaged and they have been changed to be the anti GBV agents.

“We have a place called Safe Space where women report various problems they face which the organisation bases on to develop an approach to address them. We chose a way to converse with men and women in order to help them find problems they have, and suitable solutions as well. That’s why even men have been engaged and changed,” she said.

Ingabire urged the government to always take up from where the anti GBV projects end, in order to sustain what they have done to reduce violence in households.

Ash is sometimes seen as a secondary danger in volcanoes when compared to more visual hazards, such as lava and pyroclastic flows. However, ash can have a major impact on human lives and infrastructure, such as the 2010 eruption of the Icelandic volcano, Eyjafjallajökull, which brought international aviation across Europe to a standstill.

This research, which is being published in Scientific Reports, uses a new kind camera, developed at The University of Manchester, to measure the flow and speed of ash falling out of a volcanic plume.

The researchers measure how ash particles interact with sunlight and, specifically, how they change the polarisation of sunlight, in a similar way to how polarised sunglasses work. This wouldn’t have been possible without the development of the new “AshCam” which is the first camera of its kind in the world.

During a volcanic eruption heavy ash fall can lead to building collapse, potentially injuring or killing those inside. Plus exposure to ash can cause irritation to the nose, throat and eyes, as well as aggravating pre-existing health conditions such as asthma.

But ash is also a major danger to other critical human infrastructure, including electrical, water and transportation networks, especially air travel – such as the 2010 Icelandic eruption.

Chair in Volcanology at The University of Manchester, Professor Mike Burton, said: “Volcanic ash is a primary product of an explosive volcanic eruption which generally poses a threat to human health and infrastructure.","Manchester-based Volcanologists have developed a method and camera that could help reduce the dangers, health risks and travel impacts of ash plumes during a volcanic eruption.
