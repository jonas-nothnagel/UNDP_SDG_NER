The Challenge

The current water and sanitation situation in Zimbabwe faces many challenges around capacity, behaviours and the lack of investment in these sectors during and after the economic crisis of the last decade.

Access to clean water is a basic right that is important for the survival of humanity, yet it can be one of the hardest resources to attain.

Data from the 2012 National Population Census shows that 25 percent of households do not have any type of toilet facility.

The availability of proper sanitation facilities is much higher in urban than in rural areas.

Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014 reports that the national open defecation rate is at 31,7 percent. This, affects rural areas in particular, where 44 percent of the population practices open defecation.

Solutions and achievements

During 2018, UNICEF continued to increase access to water by drilling new boreholes and rehabilitating defunct pipe water schemes and boreholes in rural focus districts with a strong focus on solar power.

The urban WASH programme saw a two-fold increase in water production across 14 small towns alongside rehabilitation of sewer systems.

Sustainability of water supply systems was strengthened through the development of a national public-private strategic framework.

The framework seeks to bolster the role of the private sector, with UNICEF supported pilots to improve monitoring and operations.

UNICEF also supported system strengthening around monitoring, as well as operation and maintenance using community participation.

This included linking community residents in rural areas via SMS to the web-based rural WASH information management system.

Improving Sanitation

The Government, with support from UNICEF and other partners, has approved a gender-sensitive Sanitation and Hygiene Policy. The policy aims to create an open defecation free Zimbabwe by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

To achieve this, the demand-led Sanitation Focused Participatory Health and Hygiene Education (SafPHHE) has been adopted and is being implemented in the 45 UNICEF-supported rural districts.

Hygiene Promotion

Hygiene promotion remained a key component of the UNICEF WASH programme.

Under the Participatory Health and Hygiene Education (PHHE) initiative, 432 sanitation action groups and 388 health clubs were supported to provide hygiene messages to rural children and families.

UNICEF also works on the critically important issue of Menstrual Hygiene Management which can greatly impact on the health and education of adolescent girls and is currently commissioning a large-scale formative study to better guide large scale MHM programming moving forward.

Capacity Building in the WASH Sector

Work continues to enhance national capacity and partnerships for improved WASH service delivery.

A national community-based management strategy is now in place to facilitate community management of operation and maintenance of water systems.

UNICEF strongly believes in system strengthening to ensure Government, development actors and communities can work together better to improve the lives of the most vulnerable in Zimbabwe.

One such platform is a regular WASH partner forum for sharing of information and knowledge.

Currently, UNICEF is supporting the Government on a Joint Sector review to help streamline accountabilities in the sector, produce costed investment plans to meet SDGs and mould a common vision for WASH in Zimbabwe.

UNICEF

UNICEF’s water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) team works in over 100 countries worldwide to improve water and sanitation services, as well as basic hygiene practices.

Last year, UNICEF’s efforts saw 45 million reached with improved water supplies, improved sanitation for 22 million and 50 000 communities become open defecation free.

Children are particularly vulnerable; UNICEF responds and provides emergency relief to those in need.

UNICEF WASH team in Zimbabwe supported Government in 2018 with response to drought, cholera and typhoid outbreaks and co-chairs an Emergency Strategic Advisory Group with Government on WASH in Emergencies.

Approximately 300 000 people in cholera outbreaks have been reached by UNICEF.","Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014 reports that the national open defecation rate is at 31,7 percent.

Here's why","CLOSE Are you an avid coffee drinker? Make sure you've got a clean coffee machine. Buzz60

If you're an avid coffee drinker, you’re probably making multiple trips to the kitchen to get your fix. But have you ever thought about how dirty your home or office coffee maker can get after all those uses?

Whether it’s the single-serve Keurig, espresso Nespresso machine or a traditional coffee maker, it’s important to keep these appliances clean to prevent the growth of bacteria, yeast or even mold.

Lisa Yakas, senior product manager of Consumer Products at NSF International, formerly known as the National Sanitation Foundation, says that these appliances are relatively harmless as long as clients follow the manufacturer’s cleaning directions.

However, without routine cleaning, they can get pretty grimy.

Mold and yeast like to grow in your coffee maker

Yakas points to the water reservoir – the part of the coffee maker that stores water – as one of the dirtiest parts of the kitchen if not cleaned on a regular basis.

A NSF International study of kitchen products in 2011 found that 50% of the sampled reservoirs in coffee makers had mold or yeast.

“It wasn’t on their radar,” Yakas said of the families involved in the study.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, food borne yeast and mold can be a source of sensitivity for people with allergies and may even cause infections.

Yakas recommends to always empty out the unused water in the reservoir and leave the lid off to let it dry out.

“Some of these organisms like these moist and damp places, that’s where they like to grow,” Yakas said. “If you eliminate that moisture altogether… then you eliminate their conditions to grow.”

Her motto is “keep it dry and keep it clean.”

Other places germs appear in and around your coffee maker

Chuck Gerba, professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, said coffee break rooms have more bacteria than restrooms in most office buildings.

If the office has a coffee pot, Gerba says the first thing that gets germiest is the coffee pot handle. However, on a single-use machine, he says the top of the machine where the people place the plastic pod has the most germs.

“When you use the machine, it could get in your coffee,” he said.

Gerba also said that another big source of germs are coffee cups, especially if they’re shared amongst co-workers. A 1997 study he co-authored examining office coffee cups found that E. coli and even fecal matter were found in some of the cups.

Are beards dirtier than dogs?: 'Significantly' more germs hide in men's beards, study finds

Leave your shoes at the door: Science says they're covered in poop and could make you sick

According to Gerba, the sponges that people were using to clean out their cups were actually contaminating them. If the office has a dishwasher, he recommends using it.

“Dishwashers work great because you have a high temperature and it dries out,” he said.

However, if the sponge can’t be avoided, Gerba says it’s important to wipe the coffee cup dry with a paper towel instead of using a cloth or letting it dry out on a rack.

Yuck: Sponges left in sinks become fecal germ bombs

How to clean your coffee maker: Keurig, Nespresso, Black & Decker, Mr. Coffee

Both Gerba and Yakas say that the heat from the coffee maker can kill most germs, but it shouldn't replace ritual cleaning or descaling, which should happen every one to six months depending on the manufacturer's recommendations.

“While it’s possible the heat of coffee brewing might kill some microbes, why take a chance?"" Yakas said. ""We think it’s best to go to the source and keep the coffee maker clean.""

So, here's how to properly clean your coffee maker according to the product's manufacturer:

Keurig: Turn off the Keurig and empty out the water reservoir, removing the filter. Pour Keurig descaling solution into the reservoir. After pouring the entire solution in, fill the empty bottle with water and add that into the reservoir. Power the Keurig back on, place a mug, perform a cleansing brew using 10 oz. brew size and then pour out the contents of the mug. Repeat until the ""add water"" light comes on. Let the Keurig sit for about 30 minutes (with the power still on) and then rinse out the reservoir thoroughly. Fill the reservoir with fresh water and perform at least 12 cleansing brews.

Nespresso: Rinse and clean the water tank before filling it with fresh water and then put the water tank in place. Rinse the cup support and place a container of at least 0.5 liters under under the coffee outlet. Then open the machine head, let the used capsule be ejected, and empty and rinse the capsule container. Close the head and turn lever until in the ""locked"" position. Push the button three times within two seconds, the button should start blinking quickly. It will take less than two minutes for a flow to come out, then the cleaning procedure will run automatically for five minutes for three cycles. The company urges that consumers to not use any cleaning agents or vinegar in the process. The company offers their own descaling products to use instead.

Wiping fungi on your face?: Your makeup bag is a cesspool of germs, study says

Before you swipe: Credit and debit cards have more germs than cash and train station urinals, study says

Black & Decker: The coffee maker will indicate when it's time for a cleaning cycle. Fill the reservoir with equal parts white vinegar and cold water, then place a paper filter into the filter basket and close the cover. Press the auto clean button on the control panel. About half of the liquid will pour into the pot right away, but the second half will take about 30 minutes. When the process is done, the pot should be full and the coffee maker will automatically shut off. Before brewing coffee again, run another cycle with just cold water.

Mr. Coffee: Some traditional coffee makers aren't programmable with a cleaning cycle, in which it's recommended to clean your coffee maker with the vinegar solution every 40 to 80 uses. Instead of using the auto clean button, turn on the coffee maker until the carafe is three cups full. Turn if off and wait 30 minutes, then turn it back on and brew the rest.

Gerba said that vinegar will clear out most of the mold and yeast, but it’s not considered to be a disinfectant by the U.S. Environmental and Protection Agency and doesn’t get rid of all the bacteria that can make a person sick.

That’s why Yakas recommends taking out each removable piece of the coffee maker and cleaning it by hand. Some coffee maker parts are dishwasher safe.

Current water scenario is that the Saline water in oceans, seas and groundwater make up about 97% of all the water on Earth. Only 2.5–2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75–2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5–0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers. We are only left with 0.003% of fresh and unpolluted water from the total water available globally.

The demand for water has increased by more than 300 percent in the last 50 years, while the supply remains the same. With the imminent threat of exhausting the world’s supply of freshwater, LiquiPro, an indigenous Atmospheric Water Generator has been created to tackle water problems and provide safe and pure drinking water. It uses the air-to-water technology which replicates the natural process of condensation by simulating a dew point, which allows it to make water continuously, even in humid conditions as low as 30%.

LiquiPro is able to cater to all kinds of water requirements from 20 litres of water per day of 400,000 litres of water per day. Our systems can be used in industries, construction sites, hydroponic farms, hospitals, hotels, residential buildings, rural areas, educational institutes and many more. Our water generator requires no water source, can work off the grid, does not waste any water and yet provides clean potable water as per requirement.

Working Principle of Atmospheric Water Generator by LiquiPro

The Atmospheric Water Generator utilizes the moisture content in the air to create the purest form of drinking water through a patented 4-step filtration process. The machine’s optimum performance ideally requires a minimum humidity level of approximately 30%. Not just that, it also performs well in an air-conditioned environment, acting as an effective dehumidifier.

The Process

Once the air is filtered through a patented air filter process, a condensation unit receives the humid airflow from the evaporator. The condensation unit then converts the water vapour into water. This process is known as Atmospheric Condensation. Once the water is generated through this process, it is then purified via a 4 step filtration process.

What is unique about LiquiPro’s Filtration Process?

Unlike other water purifiers, the water produced by the LiquiPro’s Atmospheric Water Generator is purified using a 4-step filtration process that features advanced water and air filters to create the purest drinking water possible. This includes an anti-static air filter, a water-dust filter, a pre-carbon filter, a sediment filter, an ozone filter, an RO membrane and a TCR filter.

Water Solution by LiquiPro

LiquiPro Is Where The Water Crisis Ends

LiquiPro’s cutting edge technology supplies clean drinking water to those who may never have had it, those who may temporarily need it and those who are living under the threat of losing their supply.

It can generate 30 to 10,000 liters of water per day.

Resilience

A new way to supply and deliver water

LiquiPro will lead the way in smart city infrastructure, by facilitating decentralization of the municipal water supply and infrastructure, and provide a sustainable, resilient and renewable water resource that is reliable, safe and effective.

sub- for menstrual hygiene need clean toilets and better facilities.

Respected sir,

Our honorable prime minister run a campaign “clean India ” which was very important to us and this should be .in this clean India movement roads ,streets should be clean but also in this movement one thing which should also be clean that is toilets like public toilets, govt school toilets ,bus stand , hospital ..most of these places are unhygienic , spitting tobacco walls , mud , lack of water , no sanitizer and no dustbin…. Hygiene toilets are very important to our country’s women….and especially their menstrual hygiene… Menstruation is a natural ,normal biological process experienced by all adolescent girls and women ,yet it is not spoken about openly causing unnecessary embarrassment and shame.Unfortunately, there are more dark realities around menstruation.

In part of some country especially in villages women are unaware about menstrual hygiene.Common outcomes of unhealthy menstruation can be dermatitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can be fatal if the kidney is damaged, genital tract infection, alteration in the pH balance of vaginal secretions, bacterial vaginosis, all leading to increased susceptibility to cervical cancer.

Of the 166,064 rural women aged 15-24 years surveyed for the National Family Health Survey, 2015-16 (NFHS-4), 51.8% relied on materials such as old fabric, rags, sand, ash, and hay to manage menstruation.

In some areas misconceptions are spread in many parts about the menstruation… For some girls menstruation can be barrier to education ..for many girls as lack of effective sanitary products restricts girls involvement in educational and social activities... In some part of our area clean water and toilet facilities are often inadequate..in addition , traditional culture make it difficult to discuss menstruation openly…this limits women and adolescent girls access to relevant and imp information about the normal function of their own body ..this directly affects their health , education, and dignity… Many young girls and women of menstruating age live in poor socio economic environment..many of women and girls live in lack basic access to safe water and lack adequate to basic sanitary conditions…these lack of safe accessible water, sanitation and hygiene is particularly troubling during menstruation and child birth…. At this time they need a safe environment that offers protection and guidance to ensure their basic health , well being and education opportunity. In schools for girls we should provide them clean well hygiene toilets with some facilities like sanitizer or soap , water and dustbin not even in schools also in public toilets… Girls and women in the workplace often miss work because they don’t have access to sanitary materials and places of employment in some states don’t provide resources for women or even have “proper toilets.”

In different part of our country women are facing different problem in menstruation some of like in schools lack of toilets and lack of facilities in toilets , some myths like we cannot worship to the GOD in menstruation time and some of the place women has to live in different place in menstruation time .they cannot cook and cannot do other house hold work..this is a high time they need a education about menstruation and give them pads and refuse them using clothes.. educate them about menstrual hygiene ..and most importantly provide them better facilities in toilets which is very important to women and girls in menstruation time .there should be a policy change in the country to deal with the issues around mental hygiene and suggested that the age limit of beneficiaries should be increased from 19 years to 45-50 years and free hygienic biodegradable sanitary pads should be made accessible to everyone through the ration distribution scheme for menstruating women living below the poverty line.

there should be strict policies and laws to deal with the cases of period shaming in schools, colleges, offices, factories, and other places.

considering the specific sanitation and hygiene requirements of adolescent girls and women, state governments and district administrations have a responsibility for putting in place the following.

The framework highlights the essential elements of a menstrual hygiene management programme that should be integrated in to other government schemes.

Your respectfully

Twinkle","sub- for menstrual hygiene need clean toilets and better facilities.
Hygiene toilets are very important to our country’s women….and especially their menstrual hygiene… Menstruation is a natural ,normal biological process experienced by all adolescent girls and women ,yet it is not spoken about openly causing unnecessary embarrassment and shame.Unfortunately, there are more dark realities around menstruation.
At this time they need a safe environment that offers protection and guidance to ensure their basic health , well being and education opportunity.

New Delhi: The grave problem of air pollution and its health hazards are now well established. To battle against one of the biggest global environmental challenges, air pollution, across the country, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) was launched by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on January 10, 2019. Now, to further strengthen India’s determination to curtail air pollution and support NCAP which aims to reduce the PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations by 20-30 per cent by 2024, a Clean Air Project (CAP) has been launched in four Indian cities.

On Wednesday (January 29), at the World Sustainable Development Summit 2020, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) along with Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) announced CAP India to improve air quality. The project has been initiated in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow and Kanpur and Maharashtra’s Pune and Nashik and will be implemented in partnership with the city authorities.

Talking about how the four cities were identified for the implementation of CAP, Dr Sumit Sharma, Director, Earth Science and Climate Change Division, TERI, told NDTV,

In order to select the cities, the SDC carried out a scoping study with the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC). A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was performed to identify two to three Indian states based on the on-going initiatives on tackling air pollution and their continuing challenges. MCA was performed on the basis of severity and sources of air pollution, population density and associated health impacts, economic standing of the state, readiness or preparedness of state in terms of policies/regulations or acts, institutional capacity, etc. On the basis of MCA, the scoping study identified the states of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra and later the cities.

By the end of the project in September 2023, the CAP India programme aims to have three major outcomes – improved data measurement and analysis on clean air; enhanced capacities of city and state authorities to implement clean air policies and action plans; increased public awareness for clean air action.

Implementation Of CAP India

To start with, secondary and primary data collection will be done to formulate emission inventories. Advanced monitoring equipment will be placed for the generation of real-time source apportionment results. State of the art air quality simulation models will be used to ascertain source contributions and also to identify key strategies for control. In consultation with the local agencies, key strategies will be identified for pilot demonstration of technologies for control of emissions. Parallely, the team will also work on capacity building and creating awareness in schools, colleges, media, and industries, said Dr Sharma.

Along with introducing new methodologies and monitoring equipment, the team will work towards strengthening existing action plans based on scientific studies. The team also plans to suggest revision in protocols for source apportionment, data collection and design of monitoring networks.

For the execution of CAP India, a consortium of national and international organisations including Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), and International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has been formulated. On the other hand, for carrying out the research for the project, a team of Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), IIT Kanpur, IITM (Pune), and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has been constituted.

The reason behind involving international organisations like PSI, IIASA and EPFL is that they will bring international experience and state-of-the-art methodologies for assessment and implementation of strategies to control air pollution.

CAP India Programme To Strengthen NCAP

Explaining how the CAP will support NCAP and cities in achieving their respective action plans to meet the target of NCAP, Dr Sharma said,

The CAP India project will help the cities to meet the targets of NCAP by strengthening their existing air quality management plans based on the advanced source apportionment studies, by prioritising the immediate measures and by developing a framework for ensuring the timely implementation of the plan.

NCAP has already completed one year and so far, the number of non-attainment cities has increased from 102 to 122, cities have submitted their action plans and funds have been released to some cities. Speaking at the event, Arvind K. Nautiyal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, spoke about the progress made under NCAP and said,

Air knows no boundaries. Under the NCAP, state pollution control boards are key stakeholders to address city-level sources of air pollution. We are implementing waste management rules, promoting clean mobility/electric vehicles, and finding alternatives to crop burning to improve India’s air quality.

New Delhi: On Friday (December 27), king of Bollywood, Shah Rukh Khan, took to twitter and thanked all ‘Swachhata Warriors’ – sanitation workers of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for keeping the city of dreams, Mumbai, clean. In his tweet, Shah Rukh Khan wrote, “Thank you for all the hard work to keep our city clean, Mamas and Papas. Love the film…” In his tweet, the Bollywood star was referring to a short film shared by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), on their official twitter handle, earlier this month. The film narrates the story of Kantilal Babriya, one of the sanitation workers at BMC, currently working as a sweeper.

The video was shared by BMC, thanking Mumbaikars and ‘swachhata warriors’ who are ready to do anything to keep Mumbai clean and reinstate the idea of ‘Swachh Mumbai.’ BMC shared the video with a caption, “Thank you Mumbaikars, for joining us every day to inch closer to the #SwachhMumbai of our dreams. Thousands of our #SwachhataWarriors work relentlessly to make Mumbai clean, healthy, beautiful, and sustainable. And to get there, we’re committed to do #AnythingForMumbai !”

In the video, a girl, apparently the daughter of the sanitation worker Kantilal Babriya, recites the daily work cycle of sanitation workers who sweep the roads and put their hands in the dirt, in order to ensure that the city is spic and span.

In the video, the girl says,

They get their hands dirty so that every morning of every Mumbaikar is clean. They say, keeping Mumbai clean will help in keeping diseases at bay.”

The heartwarming video takes the audience through the life of sanitation workers, how they too have a family, festivals to celebrate with friends and family, but no matter what day it is, they continue with their job.

The girl adds,

We all celebrate festivals, but post that they (BMC workers) take care of Mumbai. This is not just the story of Kantilal but 46,000 sanitation workers like him, who keep Mumbai clean, under all conditions.

Towards the end, the girl requests Mumbaikars (citizens of Mumbai) to take some responsibility of maintaining cleanliness and asks to segregate wet and dry waste at source. This one small step by Mumbaikars will help ‘swachhata warriors’ in keeping the city clean.

Even the government, under its Swachh Bharat Mission, is promoting waste segregation as it eases down the process of waste management and recycling. If the waste is segregated well, little to no waste will make its way to the landfills. While dry waste like paper and plastic can be recycled. wet waste involving vegetable and fruits peels can be composted.

Also marking the five-year milestone of Mission Innovation, the report aims to provide input for discussions on the future role and priorities of the initiative.

The report titled, ‘Mission Innovation Beyond 2020: Challenges and Opportunities,’ is based on interviews with senior Mission Innovation officials and stakeholders, as well as an evaluation of the initiative, which was published in May 2019. Among key findings, the evaluation concluded that Mission Innovation members invested an additional USD 4.6 billion annually in clean energy innovation, and were hence on track to deliver their primary commitment to double investments in clean energy innovation within five years.

The publication contains an in-depth review of the current energy innovation landscape, including the various “supply-push” and “demand-pull” mechanisms for accelerating systemic energy transitions. The authors note that while the global community has been successful in driving cost reductions in key technologies such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) over the past decade, the rate of progress in innovation is still insufficient to deliver affordable and widely available solutions across all sectors of the economy to meet energy access, climate change and energy security goals.

Some of the key messages contained in the paper include:

Public and private investments in clean energy innovation are increasing slowly, with approximately USD 23 billion in public sector investments and up to USD 55 billion in private sector investment in 2018. However, the paper notes, this still accounts for a small share of total research and development budgets. In particular, public investment in energy innovation as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at half the level it was in the late 1970s.

Trends of rising energy access, electrification, digitalization and net-zero targets in some countries are shifting innovation priorities, with major challenges including providing grid flexibility, integrating and adapting technologies, reducing energy demand and demonstrating and scaling solutions for harder-to-abate sectors.

Coordinated experimentation can reduce costs and risks, increase confidence among innovators and investors and build larger market niches, but there is a need for alignment of priorities as well as building trust in international partnerships, and for adopting efficient delivery mechanisms to achieve impact.

One of the key challenges highlighted in the report is the length of time that it takes for innovations to reach significant market shares. The authors note that energy innovations have some of the longest incubation times due to low levels of private investment in research and development, long asset lifetimes and lack of a “premium” product. The report suggests that system-wide approaches, coupled with a “socio-technical transition,” may be required to realign technologies, behaviors, businesses, markets, rules and infrastructures. Among essential steps in this, the paper notes the importance of developing a clear and long-term vision, increasing skills, strengthening networks, investing in demonstrations, nurturing markets and building user acceptance.

Among Mission Innovation successes highlighted in the May 2019 evaluation report are an estimated 100 innovations “that will avoid 2 gigatonnes CO2 emissions per year by 2030,” and 59 new international collaborations supporting clean energy innovation. The report also showcases a selection of 50 “breakthrough solutions” funded by public investments that hold promise for achieving significant impact, ranging from basic research to demonstration of viable technologies. Some of the featured innovations include:

Testing the use of blockchain-powered distributed energy and water systems in Australia to assess how cities can use this technology for the integration of renewables;

A demonstration of how to deliver wind energy in isolated off-grid sites with permafrost and variable wind conditions in Canada;

Installation of 4,000 micro solar domes across several states in India, each of which can provide up to 17 hours of 60-watt-equivalent lighting for poor urban areas and remote communities;

Development of an all-solid-state battery that has achieved a power density three times as high as conventional lithium-ion batteries, based on Japanese-funded research on superionic conductors; and

Conversion of whole biomass residues to aviation fuels using an innovative aqueous reforming process developed in China that is also expected to generate income for local corn farmers.

Business Reporter

The City of Harare and Clean City Private Limited yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will allow the two parties to collaborate in service delivery to Harare residents.

Areas of collaboration under the MoU include refuse collection, dump-sites clearance, repair and maintenance of City of Harare refuse trucks along with construction and management of waste facilities in areas identified by both parties.

The two entities will also embark on joint community health initiatives, including waste management awareness campaigns, with the objective of reducing waste and water borne diseases – including cholera and typhoid – that have plagued the city in the recent past.

The tie-up between the two parties represents a Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPPs are seen among development experts as key in delivering sustainable solutions to the many challenges bedevilling the local authorities and national economies at large.

Speaking at the signing ceremony held at the Town House in the capital, Clean City Africa CEO Lovemore Nyatsine, said waste management had become an area of major public health and environmental concern, with city residents battling the scourge of mounting refuse, poor sanitation, lack of clean water and mushrooming garbage dumps, among other health hazards.

“At Clean City we believe that addressing such challenges in our society requires a collaborative approach and effort from all of us – the private sector, local governments (the city council), residents and everyone – because at the end of the day, we are all affected by the adverse health and environmental effects of uncollected refuse and the breakdown of infrastructure, which give rise to diseases and other perils,” said Mr Nyatsine.

He said although many residential areas in Harare continued to experience heaps of uncollected refuse and illegal dumps, there was need to come up with new models and fresh approaches to deal with how communities can enjoy clean and safe environments.

“Together, we can create clean neighbourhoods, health communities, clean streets and public areas but we need bold ideas and fresh thinking to tackle these issues,” said Mr Nyatsine.

Clean City has in the past played a pivotal role in fighting the outbreak of cholera and in mobilising communities to keep their environments clean.

Mr Nyatsine lauded the Mayor of Harare, Clr Herbert Gomba for his leadership in working to bring the partnership to life.

He also commended Harare City Councillors for their commitment to see effective service delivery restored to the city through their support of the partnership.

Clr Gomba hailed the partnership between Clean City and Harare City as an answer to residents’ outcry over the menace of litter and refuse, erratic baggage disposal and the attendant risk of disease outbreaks in the city.

“This partnership will contribute to a clean and healthy city for our residents and it will also help create employment and grow the economy of the city,” said the Mayor.

He thanked the Econet group and Cassava Smartech (the parent company of Clean City) for being proactive in offering sustainable service and solutions to the City of Harare.

He committed to work tirelessly with any willing corporate partners to restore Harare’s Sunshine City status.

Clean City has already started collecting refuse in the greater part of Harare’s northern and eastern suburbs as well as parts of the southern suburbs, covering more than 280 000 households.

The company has also decommissioned more than 300 dump-sites.

Clean City was launched last year with the goal of providing sustainable, technology-driven waste management services in urban areas in partnership with local authorities and other private players.

It has more recently expanded into Clean Water delivery services, among other services.

ISLAMABAD: Three stakeholders came together on Saturday to begin a joint drive to clean up Rawal Lake that will continue today (Sunday) and tomorrow (Monday).

The drive was launched by Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) and the Punjab Irrigation Department. They removed four truckloads of garbage from the on the first day.

In August last year, the ICT and MCI had collected debris and other garbage from the shore and shallow waters of the lake to protect aquatic life and clean the environment.

There are several authorities involved in Rawal Dam’s affairs. Safeguarding aquatic and wildlife around the dam is the responsibility of the ICT administration, the land around the lake comes under the administrative control of the Capital Development Authority and MCI and a major portion of the water is the property of Punjab.

Keeping the lake clean has been a challenge because the departments involve shift responsibility on to the others, and there is no structured coordination in this regard.

Cleanliness drive by ICT, MCI and Punjab Irrigation Department to continue until tomorrow

The dam is maintained and operated by the Punjab Irrigation Department, but the major beneficiary of Rawal Lake is Rawalpindi’s Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), which is supplied 23 million gallons of water daily from the reservoir.

Another beneficiary is the ICT Fisheries department, which has the power to award fishing contracts.

An official from the Punjab Irrigation Department said: “70pc of the Rawal Lake catchment area is in Murree, which is in Punjab, and around 30pc of the catchment is in Islamabad territory.”

Water is supplied to the National Agricultural Research Council (NARC) for its research farms according to the same ratio for agricultural purposes. The National Institute of Health and farmlands that mainly grow fodder for the Presidential Guards are situated close to the lake on Banigala Road.

An MCI official said that the municipal areas of Islamabad caused negligible pollution in the shape of solid waste or sewerage flowing into the lake, and it was therefore not their responsibility to clean the lake.

Sewerage and garbage flow into Rawal Lake from Murree tehsil and the Bhara Kahu area, and the Punjab Irrigation Department has complained that garbage should not flow in natural water courses.

The Bhara Kahu area falls in the jurisdiction of ICT, while the Rawalpindi Municipal Waste Company is responsible for collecting and disposing of garbage from Murree city. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for keeping a check on the quality of water in the lake.

Twin cities to work together on price control

The local administrations of the twin cities announced on Saturday that they would work together to frame a strategy to control the prices of essential food items and to work on the Clean and Green Pakistan initiative.

The decision was made during a joint meeting of the price control committee at the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner’s office held to discuss price controls and ways to remove the disparity in the prices of essential commodities between the twin cities.

Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Saifullah Dogar and Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat chaired the meeting, which was attended by market committee, food department and union representatives.

Mr Shafqaat said that joint efforts were made to lift litter from the embankments of Rawal Lake, and such activities should be increased in the areas between the twin cities.

He said the prices of vegetables, fruit and other essential food items would be controlled at the I-11 fruit and vegetable market so traders would sell with minimal profits and people would be able to buy goods at reasonable prices.

Joint action was taken in and around Rawal Dam to remove illegal structures and solid waste, Mr Shafqaat added.

He said: “The Punjab Irrigation Department and its organisations, such as the Small Dams Organisation, need to be activated to control pollution in Rawal Lake. The Islamabad administration will provide support to all of them in this regard.”

Mr Dogar said the Rawalpindi administration would provide its support to joint efforts under the Clean and Green Pakistan programme.

He said the Rawalpindi and Islamabad administrations were working to keep prices of essential food items at the I-11 market low, and that they monitored the auction of fruits and vegetables so they are sold at reasonable prices.

Traders and other departments’ representatives were on board to keep prices stable in the market,

Editors Note: As we note below, it’s still unknown whether or not UV Sanitizers and UV-C can kill Covid-19, and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently released an advisory confirming this. They also note that direct contact with UV-C or looking into the light can cause injury. The UV Sanitizers below feature lids with a locking mechanism or the light is only activated when the cover is confirmed to be closed. You can see the full advisory from the FDA here and further analysis from CNN Business here.

When was the last time you cleaned your TV remote? That may seem like a strange question, but we rarely, if ever, disinfect our household items and tech. The HomeSoap makes the process quick and easy by sanitizing anything you can fit inside it in just 10 minutes. It does so by neutralizing common harmful microorganisms with UV-C light.

At $199.95, the HomeSoap can keep large tablets, phones, keys, baby bottles and virtually any similarly sized item free of germs. And with the HomeSoap’s sizable sanitizing bay, you can disinfect several items at once.

Keep reading to find out more.

Design and features

At about the size of a small desktop computer, the HomeSoap gives you a lot of space for sanitation. To be exact, it’s 15 inches deep, 6 inches wide and about 11 inches tall. Its interior measurements are only about 2 inches less for each dimension. The outer shell of the HomeSoap is a matte plastic. Interestingly, there’s a slight bulbousness to the sides, making it look like the sides are thin pillows. On the door is a lightning symbol that glows while the HomeSoap is active. Above the door is a circular button that you can use to switch between manual and automatic mode. It’s also the pause/start button in manual mode, where you can choose the duration of your sanitation cycle.

The HomeSoap comes in white or black, and it looks handsome in either. When you open the door on the front, you can see the sanitation bay, which is quite spacious. It’s coated in a somewhat reflective gray plastic and contains eight UV-C bulbs that run along the sides like thin pillars. Inside this space, just above the entrance, are USB-A and USB-C ports for charging your devices while they’re inside. Flip it around to the back and you’ll see the port for plugging in the device.

On the bottom of the HomeSoap are six microsuction feet that keep it firmly planted where you place it. It could get annoying to use if it slid around every time you opened the door or put items inside. And these feet don’t leave any residue, since they operate on the suction of many tiny air pockets rather than adhesives or rubber. To clean them, all you have to do is rub them with water and let them dry.

Is UV-C effective?

The HomeSoap sounds great in theory, but what’s behind the technology and the promise that UV-C light will be effective?

For starters, it’s been shown that mobile phones are about 18 times more bacteria-ridden than public restrooms. This is likely because they often rest in our warm, dark pockets all day, we constantly touch them and we may not clean them as well as we should. But even if you regularly clean your phone, think about other tech and items in your house. Have you given your TV remote or headphones a good scrub lately? How about the family tablet? Chances are they are not nearly as clean as they could be with the HomeSoap.

UV-C light has been proven to be effective at killing or neutralizing bacteria and other pathogens. That is, even if it doesn’t kill them, it prevents them from reproducing. This occurs because it attacks their DNA, effectively destroying up to 99.99% of germs like MRSA and the flu virus. MRSA is an antibacterial-resistant strain, but it can’t stand up to UV-C light.

This incredible disinfecting power is why places like labs and hospitals have been employing it for a long time. However, our cells aren’t immune to UV-C light. It can cause eye damage when observed by the naked eye, and can damage skin if it’s exposed for some time. Fortunately the HomeSoap’s lights can only be on when the door is closed. If you want to see the benefit of UV-C light yourself, Discovery channel aired a video where it put one of the products to the test.

All in all, there’s good reason to believe the HomeSoap can do the job.

Using the HomeSoap

The HomeSoap couldn’t be simpler to use. Just plug it in and insert any item or items you want to sanitize. Then close the lid and wait 10 minutes for the sanitation cycle to complete. Closing the door automatically starts the process, and the lightning bolt on the door will glow until it’s complete. To switch to manual mode, just hold the circular button above the door for three seconds, at which point you can tap it to start and stop the cycle. After it’s finished, just remove your freshly sanitized items and go about your business.

The HomeSoap is a rather large device, so it may be hard to find space for it, at least on tables or higher surfaces. I ended up placing it in the corner of my kitchen counter, after some rearranging. Once those microsuction feet contacted the granite, the HomeSoap became a regular appliance, right next to my toaster. Naturally, it was often the talk of my family and visitors, some of whom had to be convinced it was safe to use, while others had to be convinced it worked at all.

It’s hard to keep track of just how many different things that I and others put in the HomeSoap.

We’ve inserted tablets, headphones, earbuds, a multitude of mobile phones, landlines, TV remotes, a Nintendo Switch and many other items. Though the results aren’t visible, it’s reassuring to know that you’re taking a well-sanitized item out. And a major part of the convenience is being able to insert multiple items at the same time. As long as you give them enough exposure to the UV bulbs, you could pop in a handful of your favorite tech items all at once. But for some, 10 minutes may be too long to go without social media, which is where manual mode came in handy. I can’t be certain how effective the HomeSoap is when run for, say, four or five minutes, but I’m sure it’s at least enough time for decent sanitation.

I think the HomeSoap makes a great staple in the household. My family and I got a lot of use out of it, and even though I’m not a germaphobe, it feels good to keep things clean. And I believe that keeping so many commonly used items free of germs is likely to prevent at least some sickness. We touch our TV remotes every day, put our headphones near our face and put our mobile phones right on our faces. It could be especially beneficial to those who are more prone to illness.

Bottom line

It doesn’t get any easier to sanitize your hard-to-clean items than the HomeSoap. With its powerful UV-C bulbs, huge sanitizing bay and 10-minute sanitation cycle, you could disinfect all your handheld tech in less than half an hour. And with manual mode, you can cut down that time.

At $199.95, the HomeSoap can be the go-to disinfection station for your entire household. Check it out on Amazon, or directly from PhoneSoap’s website.

We have become immune to this sight and don’t do anything about it. The footpaths are littered with fruit wastes, banana peels, cigarette butts, chips wrappers, and juices packs. Now with the onset of winters, orange peels and peanut shells have joined the over increasing garbage on our side roads. This garbage belongs to the trash bin and not conveniently thrown out of the vehicles, pedestrians as well as families who visit public places and leave their food garbage there.

Time and again, awareness campaign about littering, sensible disposal of garbage are hammered through media campaigns. They are even printed on the packs and wrappers yet our people instead of looking for a dustbin nearby would go to the corner under the tree or footpath and toss the litter conveniently, shrugging off their social responsibility.

To change this mindset and bring about a behavioral change in public to achieve a sustainable and safe environment in Pakistan, the present government recently launched an app for people volunteering to make a change in the cities by initiating certain activities that can be reported online along with details and pictures. This Pakistan Clean Green Index (CGPI) is a composite index of five pillars of Clean Green Pakistan Movement i.e. safe drinking water, total sanitation, liquid waste management & hygiene, solid waste management and plantation.

The purpose of CGPI is to rank the cities based on greenery and cleanliness and providing a healthy competition among cities. The CGPI comprises of more than 35 indicators for ranking the cities. The overall sum of scores for five pillars will provide the final score of Pakistan Clean Green Index for each city. Though these activities are to be instilled in children at a grassroots level the website also provides detailed instructions for universities, colleges and schools on how to inculcate values of the programme. Awards, creation of steering committees and rankings to promote healthy competition will be organized for schools, colleges and universities.

The official website of Clean Green Pakistan indicates a positive response from people and students who are taking part in the growing effort as they are actively participating in different hygiene activities, can plant trees, can register as a champion and participate or initiate awareness sessions of cleanliness and sanitation of their respective cities.

Minimum three months data shall be required from participating cities against the proposed indicators. The ranking will be announced periodically. After six months performance of the competing cities will be assessed against set indicators. Those with prominent progress will be recognized at the provincial and federal level.

To bring the city on top of the cities ranking, an active participation of every member of the society is needed to bring the city to at par with international standards of cleanliness taking all the relevant stakeholders on board, otherwise this CGP initiative would become a challenge for us.","Now with the onset of winters, orange peels and peanut shells have joined the over increasing garbage on our side roads.

Residents in several neighbourhoods in Alexandria, Egypt have been forced to wade through smelly water full of rubbish since their area flooded in early January. They say they are exhausted by the authorities’ repeated empty promises to find a solution.

Wastewater mixed with rainwater flooded the streets of the El Falaki neighbourhood.

Polluted water has flooded the entrances of certain buildings.

On social media, Alexandria residents have been calling on the government to finally start to implement proper drainage and sewage systems in the neighborhood - a promise that authorities have been making for years.

After floods in 2015, the governor of Alexandria announced that 75 million Egyptian pounds (equivalent to 4.42 million euros) had been allocated for the construction of a proper sewage and drainage system.

Ahmed Alchaeur, who lives in the El Falaki neighbourhood, said that he is sick of hearing the authorities make empty promises to improve local infrastructure, which he says they’ve been making since 2008. He says his neighbourhood is currently sitting in a pool of polluted water, which he worries may destroy the foundations of local buildings.

For years, we’ve been living in inhumane conditions. The sanitation project in El Montazah should have been finished years ago. There are some roads that are now flooded because of construction that’s been going on for years. The governorate allocated 40 million Egyptian pounds (2.26 million euros) to improve sewage systems in our neighbourhood. However, each time we bring in the contractors who were employed by the city to lay the pipes, they claim that there is no way they can connect the pipes in our neighbourhood with the main system in Alexandria.

This meeting between El Falaki neighbourhood residents and local officials in April 2019 led to renewed promises to start renovations on the sewage system.

We’ve been living in this situation since 2008. The pipes spew out polluted water into our streets. This is a threat to the health of the local population, especially as polluted water running through our neighbourhood might seep under our buildings. It’s a tragedy for many people living in El Montazah. Each time, it’s the same promises but there is never a solution.

Ali Sabri, who lives in the El Falaki neighbourhood, says that the authorities hired a private company to work on the sewage system. But the company says it hasn’t been able to find a way to connect local sewage pipes with the wider network. During the rainy winter months, life gets even more difficult for residents. Sabri is calling on the authorities to put an end to what he says is an unbearable situation.

For years, we’ve been calling on the authorities to find a solution to connect our neighbourhood to the general city-wide sewage system. In 2019, we held several meetings with local representative Aboul Abbas Tourki who assured us that this construction work was moving ahead and that all the obstacles that stood in the way of its progression would be removed, but for the time being, we haven’t seen the results.

The streets of the El Falaki neighbourhood are flooded with a mix of rainwater and wastewater during the winter months. Residents are calling on authorities to urgently find a solution to the crisis.

The France 24 Observers team reached out to the Alexandria government but, thus far, haven’t received a response to our queries.

The monarch who built the opulent Palace of Versailles and transformed France into a military powerhouse stuck with a hygienic routine that was rigorous for the times – after a daily rubdown from his servants, he rinsed his hands in scented water and, every other day, wiped his face with a moistened towel.

Residents of the Homowo electoral area in Tema Newtown have been urged by the Assembly member elect to work together towards keeping the area clean and healthy.

Mr Enoch Afutu, who was speaking to the Ghana News Agency, said “the issue of sanitation is a very difficult challenge in Tema Manhean and we all have to come together in to address and solve this issue.”

He suggested that residents could on their own accord come together to clean filth in their immediate environs without necessarily waiting on the community leaders to organize clean up exercises.

He said it was unfortunate that many of the residents were not ready to volunteer to engage in communal labour after contributing to the worsening insanitary conditions.

According to him, when sworn into office, he and his team would encourage behavioural change among residents and subsequently get them involve in clean-up exercises as they observe good sanitation practices.

He however stated that one big challenge of organizing communal labour in the area was the unavailability of cleaning equipment and therefore pleaded with the Tema Metropolitan Assembly (TMA) offer then such tools.

Mr Afutu also noted that irregular emptying of refuse skips was a major challenge to sanitation in the area.

Residents end up pouring their refuse on the ground, saying the two skips were not enough for the large population in Abonkor, Manhean and Apantumo all within his electoral area.

He suggested that all the Assembly members for Tema Newtown should team up and organize clean up exercises every fortnight while they push for more skips, which would be regularly emptied, to prevent the outbreak of communicable diseases in the town.

Mr Geoffery Akorli, a member of the community, also called for urgent and lasting solution to the sanitation issues in the area saying it was possible to keep the area clean as he recalled that Manhean last stop also known as Apan tumo which was once a place full of refuse was now clean through the hard work of some residents.","Residents of the Homowo electoral area in Tema Newtown have been urged by the Assembly member elect to work together towards keeping the area clean and healthy.

The exercise was supported by three local non-governmental organizations – Campaign to Promote Civic Education (CPCE), Eco Warriors Movement (EWM) and Green stewardship International (GSI).

The organisations provided sanitation equipment, including rakes, wheel barrows, gloves, pickaxes, head pans, cutlasses, spraying machines, dustbins, weedicides, nose masks, shovels, and spades among others.

These items, estimated to cost about GHC300,000.00, were supplied free of charge for the conduct of the exercise aimed at promoting environmental cleanliness and instilling communal spirit among the residents.

The sponsors together with Mr. Emmanuel Agyei Anhwere, the Member of Parliament (MP) for the area, who donated five pairs of Wellington boots and the community members in the early hours of Tuesday, swooped to the streets to sweep, clear gutters and tied up the clinic and market places.

Addressing the gathering later, Mr Otuo Acheampong, the President of Eco Warriors, challenged Ghanaians to inculcate the habit of cleaning their surroundings as a personal responsibility to ensure cleanliness at all times.

He called on community members to engage in communal labour as a good sanitation and development tool, which he said would “spark a restoration action” in the youth through awareness creation, advocacy and action-led approach.

He was of the view that a youth-driven project would restore degraded landscape and mitigate climate change by an integrated and inclusive approach.

“This would help create the awareness of the state of the environment to trigger the innate desire of humanity to restore, preserve and conserve nature for posterity,” he said.

He advised that people should not wait on their district assemblies to contract sweepers to clean their communities, stressing: “It is your civic responsibility to keep this community clean”.","The people of Hiawu Besease in the Atwima Nwabiagya South Municipality marked this year’s Constitution Day with sanitation activities to keep the town clean as inhabitants swarmed onto streets, desilting gutters and clearing bushes.

Just hours after a million people crammed into Times Square to watch the New York's iconic ball drop signal the beginning of a new decade, efforts to clean up the colorful aftermath were near completion.

More than 200 sanitation officials worked through the early hours to rid the streets of millions of pieces of confetti, trash, and discarded novelty New Years themed items, including 2020 glasses and 'Happy New Year' top hats.

Despite the mammoth undertaking, by Wednesday morning much of the scene appeared back to normal, with the roads cleared and traffic flowing back through Broadway as if the pandemonium of hours before never occurred.

In addition to the estimated one million revelers stood under the lights of Times Square last night, millions more watched live on television as 2019 came to a close.

A deafening cheer rose from the crowd as the dazzling 12-foot diameter ball covered in 2,688 Waterford Crystal triangles finished its descent at the stroke of midnight, marking the start of the new year on the East Coast.

Later celebrations in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Anchorage, Honolulu and elsewhere marked the march of midnight across the U.S. time zones.

In Times Square, an estimated one million revelers were showered with 3,000 pounds of confetti as they watched performances by rap-pop star Post Malone, K-pop group BTS, country singer Sam Hunt and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.

For some, being part of a spectacle viewed by millions was worth a trip around the world and a long day spent waiting in a locked-down security zone with not much to do for hours.

'We often watched this in the TV and see this and we totally want to be a part of it,' said Mathieu Plesotsky, 25, visiting from Hesse, Germany.

Plesotsky arrived in Times Square at 1pm with his girlfriend and bopped along to the performers while waiting for the ball to drop. 'We've just stayed, stand, tried not to pee, danced to the Village People,' he said.

Eric and Aileen Sanchez-Himes brought their son and nephew from Framingham, Massachusetts, to experience what they consider a 'bucket list item.' Eric packed granola bars and water in his coat in case they got hungry. They arrived at 10.30am.

'I grew up in New York, in Brooklyn and the Bronx and I've never done this and this was the first time for us and what better year than 2020 to do this,' Aileen said.

Despite the mammoth undertaking, by Wednesday morning much of the scene appeared back to normal, with the roads cleared and traffic flowing back through Broadway as if the pandemonium of hours before never occurred.

In one of the globe's most-watched New Year's Eve spectacles, the crowd counted down the last seconds of 2019 as a luminescent crystal ball descended down a pole.

'It was a dream, I wanted to do it so this year a lot of people helped me to get here so I´m here, and I´m thankful for that,' said Mariemma Mejias, 48, who flew to New York for the festivities from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The fun was evident, but some important global issues were driven home as well.

Spotlighting efforts to combat climate change, high school science teachers and students pressed the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to the new year.

Ever since the NYPD tightened security and began cracking down on public drinking years ago, Times Square on New Year´s Eve has been an endurance contest as much as a raucous celebration.

Many people arrive before noon to get a spot close to the action. Alcohol is banned. Spectators enter through a security screening gauntlet to enter pens they cannot leave, including to use the bathroom, if they hope to return.

The weather can be brutal.

When revelers rang in 2018, it was only 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 Celsius). For the dawn of 2019, rain poured throughout the evening, leaving puddles on the performance stages.

The weather seemed perfect Tuesday, until it wasn't. Rain, which wasn't in the forecast, briefly drenched the crowd just before 8:30 p.m.

Still, the celebration was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many.

Amanda Camacho, 25, from Heredia, Costa Rica, said she and her mother spent their evening in the security pens 'talking to people and meeting people and sharing,' Camacho said. 'We met people from Korea, we met people from Guatemala that were actually here just for New Year´s Eve, so it has been pretty cool.'

While giddiness was expected to prevail at the televised event, some important global issues will be driven home, as well.

Billions celebrate New Year's across the globe

Sydney and Auckland became the first major world cities to let rip with huge firework displays, after a handful of remote Pacific island near the international date line had already flipped the calendar to 2020.

Organizers in Sydney decided to go ahead with their show despite calls for it to be cancelled amid wildfires that have brought swathes of devastation across the country, killing at least 12 and destroying dozens of homes.

There were also fraught scenes in Hong Kong as the state marked the start of the New Year amid pro-democracy protests, as Beijing and Singapore celebrated at the same time.

It came ahead of huge celebrations in Brazil and America. About 3 million people welcomed 2020 at Brazil's iconic Copacabana beach as almost 34,000 pounds (15,420 kilograms) of colorful fireworks went off for 14 minutes after midnight.

Rio de Janeiro holds one of the biggest New Year parties in the world, with music, drinks and religious rituals on the shores. Many dress in white in a traditional sign of their hope for peace. About 2,000 policemen are working to ensure party-goers are safe. Authorities say only minor incidents have been reported so far.

Many locals and tourists are expected to stick around Copacabana until Wednesday's sunrise for their first dip of the year in the ocean, expecting to wash away their troubles from 2019. Summer in Rio often brings high temperatures early on.

The party in Sao Paulo, Brazil's metropolis, took about 2 million people to Paulista Avenue, the city's main road. Nearly all the 6,000 pounds (2,720 kilograms) of fireworks used there were silent so pets did not get too bothered by the noise.

People flocked to temples and shrines in Japan, offering incense with their prayers to celebrate the passing of a year and the the first New Year's of the Reiwa era.

Under Japan's old-style calendar, linked to emperors' rules, Reiwa started in May, after Emperor Akihito stepped down and his son Naruhito became emperor.

Although Reiwa is entering its second year with 2020, Jan. 1 still marks Reiwa's first New Year's, the most important holiday in Japan.

'We have a new era and so I am hoping things will be better, although 2019 was also a good year because nothing bad happened,' said Masashi Ogami, 38, who ran a sweet rice wine stall at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo, drawing a crowd of revellers.

Thousands of South Koreans filled cold downtown streets in Seoul ahead of a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall to send off an exhausting 2019 highlighted by political scandals, decaying job markets and crumbling diplomacy with North Korea.

Dignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight included South Korean Major League Baseball pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and Pengsoo, a giant penguin character with a gruff voice and blunt personality that emerged as one of the country's biggest TV stars in 2019.

The annual tolling of the 'peace bell' at Imjingak park near the border with North Korea was canceled due to quarantine measures following an outbreak of African swine fever.

More than a million people descended on a hazy Sydney Harbour and surrounding areas ahead of the ringing in of the new year despite the ongoing wildfire crisis ravaging New South Wales, Australia's most populous state.

The planned 9 p.m. fireworks over Sydney's iconic landmarks was delayed by 15 minutes due to strong winds, but revelers clearly enjoyed themselves in a desperately needed tonic for the state.

New South Wales has copped the brunt of the wildfire damage, which has razed more than 1,000 homes nationwide and killed 12 people in the past few months.

Some communities have canceled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney Harbour's popular display was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban that is in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.

New Zealand's major cities greeted the new year with traditional fireworks. In Auckland, half a ton of fireworks burst from the Sky Tower above the city center.

Work to clear the streets of Los Alcázares after the December flood was scheduled to finish this week

The heavy rain and snow brought by Storm Gloria to Murcia on Monday and Tuesday may have moved away from the Region, and the sun may be shining brightly on Wednesday morning in many parts of the Region after a foggy start to the day in and around the regional capital, but it will be hard for many residents of Los Alcázares and other towns on the shore of the Mar Menor to enjoy the return of more stable weather to the area.

For the third time in just over four months the streets in Los Alcázares were flooded on Tuesday, and even now that the water is receding a thick coating of mud once again covers road surfaces and the floors of many basements and ground floor premises.

Around 60 millimetres of rain were recorded in many parts of central and eastern Murcia in just four hours on Tuesday morning but again, as was the case in the flooding of early December, it was not until after the rain had all but died out that the accumulation of water in the Campo de Cartagena made its way down “rambla” floodwater channels towards the Mar Menor – in the case of the Rambla de la Marrana, via the centre of Los Alcázares.

The 112 emergency services call centre reports having dealt with 1,025 incidents related to heavy rain and snow since Sunday and on Tuesday as many as 114 of them were in the municipality of Los Alcázares as the floodwater began to rise again, a scene which is now distressingly familiar to residents. Another 66 calls were received from each of the municipalities of San Javier and Cartagena, indicating that yet again it was those living in the Mar Menor area who suffered the worst flooding, but in a scenario horribly reminiscent of those experienced in the gota fría storms of September and December 2019 it was Los Alcázares which bore the brunt of the rush of runoff water towards the lagoon.

Unsurprisingly, the residents of the town are at their wits’ end. Summing up their feelings, Mayor Mario Pérez Cervera stated during the afternoon that the town is “tired of the administrations wishing us the best of luck while they offer no solutions”, and expressed the view that what is happening in Los Alcázares is not that ramblas are bursting their banks, but that the ramblas no longer have a natural course to follow.

Since the disastrous flood of December 2016 the residents have suffered five episodes of torrential rain and flooding, Sr Pérez Cervera points out, and the anxiety among the locals is palpable every time it starts to rain.

As of Tuesday evening 43 streets in Los Alcázares were closed to traffic by flooding and around 100 people were engaged in the tasks of pumping out floodwater and re-opening the roads. As usual, one of the worst affected areas was around the municipal sports complex, although it is too early as yet to estimate the cost of repairing the damage caused and cleaning up the town. Ironically, it was only this week that the clean-up following the December flooding was scheduled to be completed.

by Agencies

The City of Harare and Clean City Private Limited today signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOU) that will allow the two parties to collaborate in service delivery to the city.Areas of collaboration under the MOU include refuse collection, dumpsites clearance, repair and maintenance of City of Harare refuse trucks along with construction and management of waste facilities in areas identified by both parties.The two entities will also embark on joint community health initiatives, including waste management awareness campaigns, with the objective of reducing waste and water borne diseases – including cholera and typhoid – that have plagued the city in the recent past.The tie-up between the two parties represents a Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPPs are seen among development experts as key in delivering sustainable solutions to the many challenges bedeviling the local authorities and national economies at large.Speaking at the signing ceremony held at the Town House in the capital today, Clean City Africa CEO Mr Lovemore Nyatsine said waste management had become an area of major public health and environmental concern, with city residents battling the scourge of mounting refuse, poor sanitation, lack of clean water and mushrooming garbage dumps, among others other health hazards.""At Clean City we believe that addressing such challenges in our society requires a collaborative approach and effort from all of us – the private sector, local governments (the city council), residents and everyone – because at the end of the day, we are all affected by the adverse health and environmental effects of uncollected refuse and the breakdown of infrastructure, which give rise to disease and other perils,"" said Mr Nyatsine.He said although many residential areas in Harare continued to experience mounds of uncollected refuse and illegal dumps, there was need to come up with new models and fresh approaches to deal with how communities can enjoy clean and safe environments.""Together, we can create clean neighbourhoods, health communities, clean streets and public areas, but we need bold ideas and fresh thinking to tackle these issues,"" said Mr Nyatsine.Clean City has in the past played a pivotal role in fighting the outbreak of cholera and in mobilizing communities to keep their environments clean.Mr Nyatsine lauded the Mayor of Harare, Clr Herbert Gomba for his leadership in working to bring the partnership to life. He also commended Harare City Councilors for their commitment to see effective service delivery restored to the city through their support of the partnership.For his part, the Mayor of Harare hailed the partnership between Clean City and Harare City as an answer to residents' outcry over the menace of litter and refuse, erratic baggage disposal and the attendant risk of disease outbreaks in the city.""This partnership will contribute to a clean and healthy city for our residents and it will also help create employment and grow the economy of the city,"" said the Mayor.He thanked the Econet group and Cassava Smartech (the parent company of Clean City) for being proactive in offering sustainable service and solutions to the City of Harare.He committed to work tirelessly with any willing corporate partners to restore Harare's Sunshine City status.The Mayor also urged the media to help raise public awareness about the benefits and public healthcare dividend of keeping the city clean.Clean City has already started collecting refuse in the greater part of Harare's Northern and Eastern suburbs as well as parts of the Southern suburbs, covering more than 280 000 households. The company has also decommissioned more than 300 dumpsites.Clean City was launched last year with the goal of providing sustainable, technology-driven waste management services in urban areas in partnership with local authorities and other private players.It has more recently expanded into Clean Water delivery services, among other services. It uses a mobile platform to connect households and workplaces with private waste collection firms, using the Vaya Africa App.","PPPs are seen among development experts as key in delivering sustainable solutions to the many challenges bedeviling the local authorities and national economies at large.Speaking at the signing ceremony held at the Town House in the capital today, Clean City Africa CEO Mr Lovemore Nyatsine said waste management had become an area of major public health and environmental concern, with city residents battling the scourge of mounting refuse, poor sanitation, lack of clean water and mushrooming garbage dumps, among others other health hazards.

This project was supported by the Pulitzer Center

The wheels are still attached to the house trailer that Pamela Rush calls home, but the 49-year-old mother of two is trapped. A lifelong resident of Lowndes County, Alabama, she lives off disability checks, struggling to pay the bills on a ninth-grade education. It’s hard to attribute her situation to any one cause—she was born in one of the poorest counties in one of the poorest states and, like the rest of the county’s mostly African-American population, she wrestles with the legacy of slavery and systemized discrimination. Just down the road from her home are the sharecroppers’ quarters where she was born.

Yet the most immediate source of Rush’s troubles is immediate: the puddle of sewage that has collected in her backyard, brewing with human feces. Whenever the toilet inside is flushed, the waste travels through a 10-ft. pipe straight to her backyard. Thousands of the county’s residents are in the same situation. Local government won’t pay to build infrastructure to connect them to proper wastewater-disposal lines, so they’re left to deal with the myriad problems caused by living in sewage that bubbles up into showers and bathtubs. A 2017 study of county residents found that 34% of participants suffer from hookworm, a parasitic infection contracted by walking barefoot on soil contaminated by fecal matter; among the issues associated with the disease is slow development in children. Charlie Mae Holcombe, 71, who lives in the area, said that the lack of sanitation accounts for the allergies, asthma and heart problems pervasive in the county. “Everyone’s dying,” she tells photographer Matt Black. Hers is one of dozens of stories Black gathered as he documented America’s water crisis for over a year.

For most Americans, water does not get a second thought. It flows at the turn of a knob, at a cost that is all but negligible. This is as it should be. Being essential to life, clean water is a right under international law and U.N. declarations. Yet in the U.S., it’s far from guaranteed. More than 30 million Americans lived in areas where water systems violated safety rules at the beginning of last year, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Others simply cannot afford to keep water flowing. As with basically all environmental and climate issues, poor people and minority communities are hit hardest.

In Denmark, S.C., local officials added the untested chemical HaloSan to drinking water, intending to combat rust-like deposits but leaving residents to deal with a slew of unexplained skin ailments. Suspicious of the water, Eugene “Horseman” Smith and his wife Pauline Ray Brown have collected samples for a decade, sharing them with scientists and an attorney. “Denmark is like a third-world country,” says Smith.

In Inez, Ky., residents still battle the remnants of millions of gallons of toxic sludge, replete with arsenic and mercury, that leaked into the water two decades ago. Locals face liver and kidney damage, as well as increased risk of cancer.

It’s a public-health problem, the root of which varies from place to place—old pipes silently poisoning entire cities with lead, industrial sites leaking the carcinogenic industrial chemical known as PFAS into the waterways, uranium seeping into groundwater from where it’s been mined. But the downstream effects are strikingly similar: damage to health that exacerbates the trials of poverty and a frayed social safety net. These in turn become years wiped off life expectancy and points lost from IQ scores.

In the Navajo Nation, where more than 300,000 people reside in a territory that stretches across parts of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona, residents unknowingly drank and played in water that uranium mining had made extremely hazardous. “Growing up, they didn’t talk about how dangerous it was,” said Melissa Sloan of Tuba City, Ariz., before she died in December of kidney cancer. “I drank the water; I bathed in the water.”

A striking number of people, including babies, show traces of uranium in their blood. Infections develop in those who dare to shower. Summer Wojcik, a triage nurse at Utah Navajo Health System, says health care providers ask patients with infections if they have access to clean water. If not, they may keep them in a health care facility for a few days, to improve the odds of healing. “You’ll hear those types of stories all over—infections, cancers,” she says. “We have got to get fresh water for these people.”

Beyond the diseases, contaminated water helps account for social decay. Residents on a desperate quest for safe water routinely drive for hours to buy and stash it. Jeremiah Kerley, 61, says he hitchhikes to Flagstaff to sell his plasma. “It’s a source of income,” he says. “I use that to pay for our water.”

For those without it, water amounts to an ongoing crisis. But no great urgency is felt in Washington, D.C., or in state capitals. Laws may be out of date, and existing rules ignored, but as an “issue,” water seems to sprout up only when a seemingly one-off event like the Flint water crisis captures public attention.

But Flint is not a one-off event. In Michigan, officials put an entire community at risk to save money, then lost a bet that the risks would go unnoticed. Similar wagers are placed by politicians and policymakers across the country. “Legal standards are often compromises between what the data shows in terms of toxicity and risk, and how much it’s going to cost,” says Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization.

The odds are getting worse. A 2017 report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation’s drinking-water infrastructure a rating of D, and assessed that the U.S. needs to invest $1 trillion in the next 25 years for upgrades. The alternative is more erosion, not by water but by the damage that occurs in its absence.

In Inez, Ky., where the local riverway has been contaminated since 2000 by a giant runoff of coal-mining by-products, water bills have skyrocketed, and yet the residents say the problem hasn’t been fixed. The tap produces what one resident called “fishy water.” But local police made news when they arrested a resident for refusing to pay for water. “They’ve destroyed the waterways to mine coal,” says Nina McCoy, an Inez resident. “We’re all fighting our little fires, and we’re not realizing that the fire is coming from above, and it’s raining down on us.” —With reporting by Kara Milstein

Feb. 19, 2020 With a series of quick, practiced strokes, Aïchatou Hamidou clears the area around a newly built latrine with a long broom made from dry grass. After the trash and waste are swept into a tidy pile and safely disposed of, she unties the brightly patterned red handkerchief over her nose and mouth and adjusts the unmissable royal blue smock designating her as a member of the WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) team.

Hamidou is the leader of the WASH team in Kobiteye ‒ a refugee camp of more than 6,000 in Chad near the border of Central African Republic (CAR). She’s one of 24,000 refugees who are living in Kobiteye as well as two other government-built camps and a few dozen small villages in the area near the city of Goré.

A campaign of deadly attacks on nonnative Central Africans living in CAR ‒ like Hamidou, whose parents were Chadian — caused thousands to flee into nearby countries where they have no family or support.

These three camps are the site of one of MCC’s planned centennial projects ‒ a partnership with Secours Catholique et Développement (SECADEV; Catholic Relief Services) that provides WASH support, namely, making sure everyone living here has access to safe, clean water.

When the camps were first built in 2013, builders dug open-pit wells, which can easily become breeding grounds for unsafe bacteria and disease, especially when there are not enough latrines to properly support the population. MCC and SECADEV have begun work with leaders in these camps to install new sealed handpumps that draw water that isn’t polluted by waste from much deeper underground.

But contamination isn’t the only concern with the water supply in Kobiteye. Although the new pumps are a significant improvement, there simply aren’t enough pumps to draw water for everyone in the camp. The WASH team found that residents of the camp have access to 17 percent less water on average than the United Nations minimum standard for refugees in emergency situations.

In the sweltering heat, a lack of safe water often leads to arguments around the wells, says Hamidou. It’s not just the lack of water, but the feeling of hopelessness many refugees here live with. There are very few opportunities to earn any income, and nearly all other international relief has dried up.

Nevertheless, the wells that have been built have made a difference. “SECADEV brought real change to our community,” says Hamidou. “They came and taught us how to deal with conflict better, so there’s much less quarrelling at the wells now. And more latrines and pumps mean people are living with better water and more hygiene.”

MCC is already working in Kobiteye and the other camps, Danamadja and Djako, but thousands of refugees in surrounding villages are still in dire need of WASH support.

In recognition of its century-old roots of helping displaced people, MCC wants to expand on this work and reach more people. With increased support, SECADEV will be able to expand its work to the refugees who don’t live within the camps.

This is one example of how your gifts to the New Hope in the Name of Christ centennial fundraising campaign will meet urgent needs and support special projects for people on the move. You can donate to New Hope at mcc.org/new-hope.

This is the reality for 16 percent of people in rural Tanzania who have no electricity. More than 70 percent of the country’s 57 million people do not have clean and safe water.

The UNDP-supported solar-powered Off Grid Box houses all of the hardware needed to produce electricity and clean, safe water in one shipping container.

Carbon neutral

“The box converts the sun’s rays into renewable electricity and can power commercial and local grids or it can be stored in power banks—a family kit—that can be transported to homes for later use,” says UNDP Project Manager Emmanuel Nnko. “The box can also capture rainwater and the electricity is used to filter and sterilize untreated water to provide up to 1,000 litres of drinking water per day.” The box is also carbon neutral.

Twelve Off Grid Boxes have been installed by UNDP in Tanzania in three districts of Bunda, Ikungi and Busega. They serve about 24,000 people who previously had no electricity. They’re also being used by health centres and schools, meaning, among other benefits, students can study longer.

Improving living standards

Safe, clean water will improve living standards and health. Around the world, waterborne diarrhoeal diseases, are responsible for two million deaths every year, the majority occurring in children under five.

The financial benefits are also very tangible. Before the Off Grid Boxes were installed, households were spending up to US$1.30 a day on bottled water. Now they spend between about 43 cents a week. Households that were spending 86 cents a week on kerosene for lighting now pay just 17 cents, which includes mobile phone charging.

Women, who shoulder a disproportionate responsibility for household fuel and water collection as well as food preparation, are also benefitting. “The project is changing lives as people had to walk so far to get water,” says Mr Kanyelele. “Now people do not have to waste so much time travelling, they can spend more time with their families, and they have more time to start a business.”

It is expected that the project will also stimulate a wide range of economic activity -- everything from the sale of electronic devices, to hair salons, to local cinemas, to poultry farming and crop processing.

Huge potential

And the potential for the Off Grid Boxes is huge given that the electricity generated is consumed at only 30-40 percent of their capacity. It is planned to deploy a ‘pay as you go’ business model in Tanzania, run by women entrepreneurs. Users will pay 9 cents to recharge batteries, get purified water and wi-fi. There is also potential for other community business models including the sale of the clean water generated by the box in local shops.

Tanzania’s Ministry of Health has also indicated that they are interested in deploying Off Grid Boxes to health centres throughout the country to provide a reliable source of clean, safe water and electricity to the centres.

Tackling climate change

The project will also help to address the impact of climate change, which has had a pronounced impact in the Lake Victoria region. “In the dry seasons, you have low flows in the rivers that feed into the lake, and a lot of drought. There is little water,” says hydrologist Pamela Agaba. “The negative effects of climate change disproportionately fall on marginalized and rural communities within the Lake Victoria Basin.”

“Thanks to the project, people are now much more comfortable. I hope that villages suffering from the same problems will be inspired to do the same,” says Mr Kanyelele.



The Off Grid Box project has been implemented by UNDP’s Country Office in Tanzania thanks to investment from UNDP’s Country Investment Facility. It offered UNDP County Offices the opportunity to make catalytic, innovative investments in new areas of growth and business development.","The UNDP-supported solar-powered Off Grid Box houses all of the hardware needed to produce electricity and clean, safe water in one shipping container.

A group of 250 global brewers have pledged to collectively improve clean drinking water access for 100,000 people in Africa, by raising £250,000+ to invest in infrastructure.

The pledge, co-ordinated by Scottish social enterprise Brewgooder, will see each brewery release a limited-edition, small-batch beer to mark World Water Day 2020, on 20 March.

Profits raised from the sales of the beers will go directly into a charity pot, and brewers will raise additional funding by hosting ‘Global Gathering’ events. Brewgooder estimates that each participating brewery will raise at least £500 through these channels, bringing the global total to £250,000+.

The funding will be used by Brewgooder to support its clean water projects throughout the 2020-2021 financial year. These projects include well rehabilitations, new borehole construction, sanitation systems and water mapping.

Brewgooder’s clean water projects are currently located across Malawi and have, to date, positively impacted the lives of 65,000 residents. The organisation estimates that the Global Gathering campaign will enable a further 100,000 people in Malawi to access clean drinking water.

The brewers taking part in the initiative collectively represent 24 nations, including the US, Hong Kong and Australia. But the UK is best-represented among the cohort, with 150 brewers signed up, including BrewDog.

“The Global Gathering shows what the craft beer community is capable of when we collaborate and use our shared passion to make a positive impact - it’s the beginning of a worldwide movement,” Brewgooder founder Alan Mahon said.

“There are far too many people in developing countries who have their ambitions, dreams and potential limited by lack of access to a safe source of water. By providing clean, accessible water, we can help kids grow up healthier, stay in school longer and build better lives.”

World Water Day

On World Water Day 2019, the UN reiterated its assertation that more than one-third of the global population is currently based in water-stressed regions or nations.

Similarly, The World Resources Institute (WRI) estimates that a quarter of the world’s population is based in areas affected by “extremely high” water stress.

The situation is only expected to be exacerbated by global megatrends such as population growth, urbanisation and temperature increase.

On a global scale, it seems that very little action is being driven by the private sector to alleviate or reverse this trend. CDP’s World Water Day 2019 report revealed that there has been a near 50% rise in the number of companies that have reported higher water use and withdrawals over the past three years. This was despite improvements in water efficiency investments just one year prior.

But several large brewers, dependent on water for their business, have shown ambition to take a leadership position on the issue.

Heineken, for example, has produced a dedicated water sustainability strategy called ‘Every Drop’ and deadlined at 2030. It commits Heineken to maximise water circularity in water-stressed areas; to treat 100% of its wastewater worldwide; and reduce average water usage from 3.2 hectolitres per hectolitre of production (hl/hl) to 2.8 hl/hl in water-stressed regions and 3.2 hl/hl on a global average – down from 3.5hl/hl.

Similarly, Carlsberg is working towards a 2030 “zero water waste” target after reducing its total water consumption by 12% between 2015 and 2018, while Diageo – the owner of Guinness - recorded a 44% improvement in water efficiency between 2009 and 2018, putting it in a position to update its already industry-leading Water Blueprint. The new framework is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation for All, and builds on its 2020 goal of replenishing the amount of water used in its final products across its water-stressed areas of operation.

UK-based brewers regarded as leaders in the sustainable water space include Glasgow-based Tennent’s and Southwald-based Adnams. Adnams won edie’s Sustainability Leaders Award for Water Management in 2019 after undertaking full water life-cycle analyses for all products and using this information to develop a context-based approach, taking in quality, quantity, location and timing of its water cycles.

34,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/uzo-abuda-works-to-bring-clean-water-to-nigeria/,"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Uzo Abuda Works to Bring Clean Water to Nigeria,"SEATTLE, Washington — Uzo Abuda is an African American actress with a fairly impressive filmography. She is perhaps best known for portraying Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren in Orange Is the New Black; however, she has also played such diverse roles as Glinda from The Wiz Live! and Bismuth from Steven Universe. What is often less well known is that Uzo Abuda works to bring clean water to Nigeria.

Uzo Abuda’s First Trip to Nigeria

Uzo Abuda was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. During her early years, she never thought twice about being able to access clean water by turning on a faucet. However, when she was eight years old, her parents took her to their country of origin, Nigeria, for the first time. Abuda was surprised to learn that the majority of the population had to drink from rivers that were polluted with things like human and bovine fecal matter. The family had to bring bottled water and budget how much could be consumed each day. Families who could not afford bottled water set out oil drums to catch rainwater, but usually had to resort to drinking from the local polluted river anyway.

The situation that young Uzo Abuda observed is far from unusual in Nigeria. Despite the fact that Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa, around 80 percent of Nigeria’s population lacks access to clean drinking water. As a result, the vast majority of Nigeria’s population is vulnerable to waterborne illnesses, including Cholera, Hepatitis and Typhoid.

Uzo Abuda Works to Bring Clean Water to Nigeria

As an adult, Uzo Abuda works to bring clean water to Nigeria in any way she can. In 2019, she paid a personal visit to Nigeria to convince five local governors to help her. Armed with statistics that showed the plight of the locals, she went to convince the governors to spend more than $42 million to provide Nigerians with clean drinking water.

Abuda’s efforts were part of a National Geographic documentary series called Activate: The Global Citizen Movement . This six-part series showcased the work that celebrity activists in the Global Citizen Movement were doing to combat poverty and inequality and bring about a more sustainable way of life. The series featured Abuda alongside other celebrities like Usher, Hugh Jackman and Priyanka Chopra Jones. Abuda’s episode, “Clean Water”, premiered on October 10, 2019.

Uzo Abuda’s Impact

Members of Global Citizens United have taken 145,000 actions to support this particular effort, including contacting Nigerian leaders and asking them to prioritize clean water. The episode shows that Uzo Abuda’s efforts with the Global Citizen Movement are paying off. Nigeria’s Edo State announced the first major change to end open defecation by 2025. This is a major source of contamination in rivers. It plans to do this by ensuring that everyone in Edo State has access to proper toilets and general sanitation and hygiene. One of the early steps to accomplishing this is providing clean water.

Later, at Nigeria’s Global Citizen Movement event, Cross River State promised to be the first state in the country, and in West Africa as a whole, to completely eliminate open defecation. This announcement inspired other states, such as Ondo State, to follow suit and announce its own plans to provide its citizens with clean drinking water and sanitation. The African Development bank allocated $124.2 million to Ondo State for the Urban Water Sector Reform and Akure Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Nigeria.

Uzo Abuda went to great lengths to show the world how bad sanitation is in Nigeria. Most of the Nigerian people, especially those in rural areas, lack access to clean drinking water. As a result, many of them die from preventable waterborne diseases. However, Uzo Abuda works to bring clean water to Nigeria by convincing the government to get involved. Her work is showing results.

(Photo : Seven New Technologies that Create Clean Water for a Thirsty World )

Every person around the world needs roughly 20 to 50 liters of water - safe and clean water - in a single day to drink, bathe, and cook with. About 20% of people on earth lack access to clean and safe drinking water. Moreover, the majority of humans who have access to it generally have to endure lengthy round trips - sometimes of up to 6 or even 8 hours - in order to actually transport water back to their home.

The lack of accessible water has sparked a desire for scientists and benefactors worldwide to come up with various and creative ways of creating clean water for our thirsty world for years to come. In this article, we'll discuss seven new technologies that people with no access to clean water can hope to rely on in the near future. If you want to know more about the status of your drinking water, you can check this BOS post for more information regarding water quality and politics.

1. Zero Mass Water

Zero Mass Water started a project named the Source Hydropanel and uses solar power to create drinking water - up to ten liters a day, which is enough for the basic needs of two to three people. The system behind the solar panels is rather simple and yet extremely efficient and resourceful: solar energy is used to heat up a sponge-like material in order to create condensation, which accumulates over time and is then collected into a reservoir. The tank's water is filtered, while minerals are added in order to improve taste and hygiene. This entire ""solar system"" can be connected to a tap or fountain, thus providing easy access to safe, ready-to-drink water.

2. Fog Harvester

Set in the Moroccan desert, the Fog Harvester, which is the largest of its kind in the world, makes use of huge mesh fences in order to trap fog and turn it into clean, safe-to-drink water. The harvester has a surface of over 600 square meters and mainly utilizes the fog that blankets the Aït Baâmrane region for roughly half a year.

In terms of statistics and results, the Moroccan fog harvester can produce up to 17 gallons of safe drinking water per a single square yard of mesh fence. The water is then delivered to local residents using a solar-powered pump system.

The Drinkable Book

A more creative way to create clean water is The Drinkable Book, a technology created by Carnegie Mellon scientists in partnership with the Water is Life non-profit. This actual book is a filtration tool as well as an educational one, and every single page contains sanitation and water advice. This information is printed on scientific coffee filter paper that can be used to purify water and kill up to 99.9% of bacteria. All you do is tear out a filter, slide it into the custom filter box, and pour contaminated water through, resulting in clean, drinkable water. The amazing fact here is that just one book can last up to four years for a single person - that's four years of clean, safe-to-drink water.

Portable UV Water Purifier

While a lack of water is a huge concern in drought-affected places around the world, there are also plenty of places surrounded by water - it's just contaminated and undrinkable. That's why researchers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have created a tiny UV water purifier. This piece of technology is a simple black rectangular device - half the size of a postage stamp! - and is able to cut water purification down from taking 48 long hours to some mere 20 minutes! This is because it uses the full energy spectrum instead of just UV light. Even though this particular device is not yet ready for mass production, it's expected to reach the areas most in need of quick drinking water in the very near future.

Solar and Wind Powered Water Filtration

As mentioned above, polluted water is even more common of a problem than a lack of water. That's why Innovative Water Technologies created a system to filtrate water - namely, the SunSpring Hybrid - which can provide a community with up to 20,000 liters of clean water in a single day and lasts ten or more years. It's solar and wind powered, plus completely portable. This device is helping developing countries clean their contaminated waterways and allowing their people to enjoy clean and safe drinking water once again.

The Warka Water Tower

In a rural Ethiopian village, this incredible invention is able to pull clean water from thin air! The Warka Water Tower is based on the same general principle as the fog harvester, except that it takes the form of a huge cylinder made from bamboo and wrapped in recycled mesh. A canopy skirted along the tower creates shade for the locals as they funnel off the condensed water created at the tower's base. This device allows entire communities to have safe, accessible water available to them.

LifeStraw

LifeStraw might be the most famous piece of technology to have revolutionized how people in less developed areas drink clean water. Created by Vestergaard, LifeStraw is a portable drinking straw capable of filtering dirty water and making it entirely safe to drink. The straw can purify up to 1,000 liters and removes up to 99.9% of parasites and bacteria! Moreover, the company also developed high-capacity water purifiers out of steel that are meant for emergency situations and emergency response teams.

The Bottom Line

As you can see above, there are quite a few solutions being developed that provide clean water to drought-affected areas as well as to areas with polluted water.

With Indonesia scoring low in health and hygiene by international tourism standards, the government is focusing on the quality of public toilets and sanitation facilities at tourist hotspots, an official has said.

The Public Works and Housing Ministry's human settlements director general, Danis Sumadilaga, said on Wednesday that issues regarding hygiene, health, sanitation and clean water at tourist destinations across the country were given ""top priority"" status during a meeting at the Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Ministry.

Indonesia ranks 40th overall out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum (WEF) Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019, improving from 42nd in 2017 and 50th in 2015 in the biennial index. However, it ranks 102nd in health and hygiene.

“We should improve hygiene and health, as well as improve clean water and sanitation. It was identified that hygiene and the condition of toilets remain a great concern in some areas at several tourist destinations,” Danis said, vowing to take the issue seriously.

“We will work to make them [sanitation facilities] better, especially public toilets. We will also build clean water access,"" he said.

The ministry is currently installing clean water systems and waste management facilities at several tourist destinations.

""For example, we are now building a waste incinerator in Labuan Bajo. And we are developing clean water systems in several areas,"" said Danis.

President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo has expressed hope that the tourism industry would play a greater role, particularly by creating jobs and raking in foreign reserves for Southeast Asia's largest economy.

The government has introduced five ""super priority"" tourist destinations as its core tourism development program, which includes building infrastructure from roads to energy. The five super priority destinations are Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Borobudur Temple in Central Java, Labuan Bajo in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), Mandalika in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and Likupang in North Sulawesi.

Chairwoman Elly Hutabarat of the Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies (ASITA), who has been campaigning for a ""total facelift"" in hygiene to attract more tourists, has voiced concern over the quality of sanitation facilities at tourist destinations on many occasions.

“Hygiene and cleanliness is essential. This is a basic issue but if we fail to attend to it, it could [rebound] on our tourist destinations,"" she said in January. ""We should learn how to provide international standard sanitation facilities at our tourist destinations.""

Elly expressed her hope that the government would put more effort into hygine and health at tourist destinations by ensuring that public toilets and restaurants were of international standards.

""Because I'm sorry to say [that] right now, the cleanliness of many sanitation facilities at tourist destinations in Indonesia has yet to meet international standards,"" she said in October last year.","Read also: Quality first, numbers second: Stakeholders discuss tourism development in 2020“We should improve hygiene and health, as well as improve clean water and sanitation.

For 25-year-old Jummai Musa and her 30-year-old husband, Samaila, the reality of Nigeria’s water crisis hits extremely close to home. In their community of Rewianku, Plateau State, accessible clean water is hard to come by. As a result, they are forced to use water from a nearby stream to bathe, wash clothing and kitchen utensils. This has taken a heavy toll on the health of their two-year-old daughter, Safiyah, who has contracted a skin infection that community doctors have traced to the stream. As she talks about her daughter’s condition, Jummai explains that the itching makes it difficult for her to sleep.

With the under-five mortality rate at 127 out of 1,000 infants, this little girl’s condition, though worrying, is not isolated in its occurrence. In the community, Jummai and Musa’s daughter is not the only one suffering from a waterborne skin disease. Several other families, who also use the stream as their source of water, have been put in a precarious position. For them, the problem is not solely the lack of access to clean water, but also inadequate sanitation facilities; these two issues, which often come hand-in-hand, have put the residents of Rewianku at a greater risk of waterborne diseases.

Access to potable water is a basic human right. In Nigeria, however, only 67.3% of the population has access to clean drinking water services, according to data available on Takwimu Africa. In rural areas, this figure reduces to 56% because basic water services are unavailable. Globally, a basic water service is drinking water that comes from an improved source (piped water, boreholes, packaged water, protected wells, etc.), which takes no more than 30 minutes for a round trip to and from the source. However, for many communities, the only access to water often comes from unsanitary sources.

The challenges around water access and sanitation in Rewianku are a reflection of the wider challenges of access to clean water access in Nigeria. According to World Bank estimates, there are 123 million people without the basic household toilet and 60 million people are without clean water close to home. For Nigeria, addressing these challenges is a top priority to achieve the SDG 6 target of clean water and sanitation for all. The Nigerian government has come up with a National Plan of Action that aims to address water sanitation and hygiene in order to achieve 100% basic water access by 2030.

For residents of Rewianku, their access to clean water has reduced significantly in the last 20 years. Although the community once had other basic water sources, after years of use and constant repairs, they have been left with only a faulty borehole. The government has made commitments to resolve this problem within the community but in the meantime, Rewianku residents have resigned themselves to sourcing water from the nearby stream. “If that water can cause skin diseases, imagine what it is doing to our internal organs,” says Samaila Musa. As open defecation is the norm in this community, Samaila’s concerns are well-founded. Data from UNICEF have shown that over 56 million Nigerians defecate in the open because of the lack of access to adequate sanitation facilities including toilets with running water.

Despite the seeming insurmountable challenges, Rewianku has not been left completely alone in its fight for clean water access. Not-for-profit organisation, WaterWide, works within and alongside the community, as well as its key stakeholders, to help put an end to its water and sanitation challenges. Waterwide works across Nigeria tracking government and international aid organisations’ spending and involvement in WASH services. For WaterWide, creating avenues for communities to keep their governments accountable is crucial to receiving better public services. To support its citizen engagement efforts, WaterWide also develops advocacy campaigns through which it seeks to influence policy-decisions and practices. In Rewianku, the NGO launched the campaign #WaterRewianku to create awareness about the community’s water issues, while being a driver for government action.

Active citizen engagement ensures governments fulfill their commitments to the people. Citizens can only make their governments accountable when they have access to information. Governments can only make informed decisions about budget allocation and spending when they have access to information. Donor organisations and other development actors can only make good investment decisions when they have access to information. It is this crucial role of providing actionable insights situated within the appropriate political and economic context that platforms like Takwimu Africa and other platforms, continue to play, providing actionable insights for development actors like Waterwide and communities like Rewianku.

38,https://ny.curbed.com/2020/2/20/21144943/new-york-water-combined-sewer-overflow-dep-plan,"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Curbed NY,NYC has a plan to clean its sewage-filled waterways. Does it go far enough?,"Every time it rains in New York, millions of gallons of sewage-laced stormwater flows into the city’s waterways. Instead of being diverted to a wastewater treatment plant, what goes down your toilet ends up floating along rivers, canals, beaches, and waterfront parks. All told, more than 20 billion gallons of feces-polluted water is flushed out onto the city’s coastline every year.

This deluge is the result of New York’s antiquated combined sewer overflow (CSO) system, which was first introduced in the 1800s. About 60 percent of the city is still hooked in to this system, which allows stormwater from the streets to be combined with raw sewage; whenever a rainstorm overwhelms the sewers, that gross mixture flows into waterways around the five boroughs. The coast of New York City is lined with 460 outfall locations, each one discharging millions of gallons of sewage into New York Harbor every year.

To help curb this problem, and to try and bring the city into compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has been working since 2012 to create a series of 11 Long Term Control Plans (LTCP), which would impact sewage overflows around all five boroughs. Nine have already been approved and advanced, bringing more than $3 billion dollars of investment to badly polluted waterways like the Flushing Creek and Newtown Creek, where floating human waste is a common sight.

This January, the DEP held a public meeting to announce its recommendations for the last and largest of its plans, the Citywide/Open Waters LTCP. This was intended to improve the health of more than 100 miles of the city’s waterfront, stretching along the Harlem, Hudson, and East Rivers; the Long Island Sound, the New York Bay, the Kill van Kull, and the Arthur Kill. There are 314 CSO outfalls on the shores of these waterways, dumping out 11 billion gallons of polluted stormwater every year.

The DEP has been working since 2016 to determine how to minimize sewage overflows into these enormous bodies of water, utilizing a complicated cost-benefit analysis. The agency is now recommending five different measures as part of the Citywide/Open Waters plan, which would decrease CSO discharges by 241 million gallons a year, at a cost of $72 million. The plan would impact nine specific CSO outfall locations: three in Manhattan, three in Brooklyn, two in Queens, one in Staten Island, and none in the Bronx.

“We ended up looking at over 100,000 permutations of potential projects. So that’s a lot of alternatives that were looked at, compared to the five that were presented,” Mikelle Adgate, a senior advisor for strategic planning at the DEP, said during the January meeting. “It has been a massive undertaking for the agency.”

Despite the years of work that went into this plan, advocates who had gathered to hear the DEP announce its plan summary were not impressed. Representatives from Riverkeeper, the SWIM Coalition, the Billion Oyster Project, and many others have been following the LTCP process for years, providing feedback and insight into the waterways they represent. After hearing the limited scope of the city’s Citywide/Open Waters plan, many of the attendees stood up to publicly express their frustration and dismay.

“In terms of this plan and how we are looking forward, it feels to me like it’s barely a drop in the bucket,” said City Councilmember Brad Lander, whose district includes the Gowanus Canal and a section of the East River. “We are talking about something like more than 11 billion gallons of CSOs entering the open waters each year, and this plan—to reduce that by 241 million gallons—is not even a three percent reduction. And $72 million, when what is going in to Gowanus is going to be over a billion dollars, is not a serious effort on all our parts. We’ve got to do better.”

“I hate to be blunt about it, but there has been a lot of years building up to this, there’s been a lot of other plans, a lot of disagreements about other plans, but when you look at this plan, being for the largest portion of the city’s waterways, for half of the CSO volume in the city… it doesn’t add up,” said Lawrence Levine, the director of urban water infrastructure at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It’s hard to take it with a straight face, to be honest.”

The five recommended proposals from the Citywide/Open Waters plan would impact a disparate array of CSO outfall locations, including off-limits parts of the Brooklyn waterfront, a private beach in Queens, and a section of Manhattan’s Riverside Park that has relatively few overflow problems. Tracking these down is a bit like an toxic Easter egg hunt; every outfall in the city is supposedly marked by a bright green and yellow sign, warning the public to avoid using the water for fishing, swimming, or boating during rainstorms. In reality, many of these signs have gone missing or are hidden on remote coastlines.

In the DEP’s recommended plans for New York Bay, four CSO outfalls would be impacted, three of which are located in areas that are closed to the public. One is underneath a Con Edison power plant in Vinegar Hill; another is inside a gated Port Authority facility at the foot of Atlantic Avenue; and a third is located on an abandoned stretch of waterfront in Tompkinsville, between a homeless camp and a collapsing boardwalk. The fourth outfall is situated underneath a bike path on the Belt Parkway.

It is difficult to understand how improving these four specific outfalls would provide a direct benefit to the city’s fishermen, boaters, and swimmers, as mandated by the Clean Water Act. There are many other outfall locations on the New York Bay—some of which are located inside busy waterfront areas, such as Bush Terminal Park and Brooklyn Bridge Park—but the plan does not suggest improving these. Overall, the DEP’s plan would reduce sewage overflows into the New York Bay by just 148 million gallons, which is only a 4.8 percent decrease from the estimated 3 billion gallons that flow into the waterway every year.

Along the entire 16-mile length of the East River, there are 139 sewer outfalls that pump out more than 5 billion gallons of contaminated stormwater every year. The Citywide/Open Waters plan would impact just two of these, reducing sewage overflows by 86 million gallons—a decrease of just 1.7 percent. The outfalls the DEP has chosen are located on two remote, little-known bodies of water: a private strip of waterfront in Malba, where discharges into Powell Cove would be reduced by 86 million gallons a year; and a partially accessible public beach in Beechhurst, where the plan would reduce discharges into Little Bay by 42 million gallons a year. The plan would have no impact on the numerous CSOs in densely populated neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Long Island City, and Astoria, making the dream of safe swimming in the East River seem like a remote possibility.

Along the Hudson River, the DEP has chosen a plan that would improve just three outfalls, all located in Riverside Park on the Upper West Side. Although the Hudson River sees 725 million gallons of polluted discharges a year from 52 outfalls, the stretch of waterfront targeted by the DEP is responsible for relatively few of those. The plan here would result in an annual decrease of only 10 million gallons of discharge into the Hudson, while increasing overflows into the Harlem River by three million gallons a year.

Most of the neighborhoods and waterfronts—including several of the city’s most polluted bodies of water—that were part of the DEP’s study will not see any new projects to reduce sewage overflows. The agency didn’t recommend any projects for Kill Van Kull or the Arthur Kill, two of the dirtiest waterways in New York. In fact, when asked about the agency’s decision not to advance any plans for these waterways, the DEP seemed unclear about why it had even bothered to consider them in the first place.

“In terms of the Arthur Kill, that’s actually not even a CSO tributary. We looked at it, but that’s not part of the CSO program.… We were trying to be comprehensive to the Citywide/Open Waters. We just have to be sampling there,” said Keith Mahoney, the director of water quality planning at the DEP. “For the Kill van Kull, we looked at probably 100 different scenarios, but we couldn’t find anything that worked there.”

The DEP has also not selected any recommended alternatives for the Harlem River, where 65 CSO outfalls pump out 1.9 billion gallons of tainted water every year. Instead, the agency signed on to the NYC Parks Department’s plans to daylight Tibbets Brook, a creek located north of the waterway. By its estimate, helping to daylight the brook would reduce CSO overflows into the river by 228 million gallons. However, the Citywide/Open Waters plan would not improve CSO outfalls in neighborhoods like Inwood, Harlem, or Highbridge, which have numerous waterfront parks.

According to the DEP, New York City’s waters are the cleanest they’ve been in 100 years, and CSO discharges have been reduced by 80 percent since the 1980s. Billions of dollars are now being invested by the agency, as well as the state and federal government, to clean those polluted waterways; billions more are being invested into preparing for the impacts of sea level rise and climate change, which will include more rainfall and storms. At a time like this, the city needs a much bolder plan to address the 11 billion gallons of raw sewage that flows into its open waters, and not just the proverbial drop in the bucket.

The DEP will submit the Citywide/Open Waters LTCP to the state government for its approval in March. Public comments can be submitted to the DEP at ltcp@dep.nyc.gov until March 2nd, 2020.

The southernmost CSO outfall in the Citywide/Open Waters plan is located on the waterfront of Bath Beach, under a bike path next to the Belt Parkway. It looks out onto the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

The outfall, named OH-015, is marked with the DEP’s standard CSO warning sign. In 2016, 749 million gallons of sewage overflows were dumped into Gravesend Bay here, according to a map of the city’s CSO outfalls created by Riverkeeper.

On a sunny day, the site looks like just another part of the coastline. The DEP’s plan for New York Bay would reduce the amount of overflow here by 90 million gallons in a typical year.

The DEP’s plan for New York Bay also includes Outfall PR-013, which is located at the dead end of Victory Boulevard in Tompkinsville, 100 yards from a public swimming pool.

The outfall is not marked by a DEP sign, and is located on an abandoned stretch of waterfront next to a collapsing boardwalk.

The structure that appears to be the outfall is in poor condition, its concrete cracked in half. In 2016, 43 million gallons of sewage overflows were reported here during 33 different overflow events.

The DEP’s plan for the New York Bay would reduce the amount of overflow here by 43 millions gallons in a typical year. The crumbling shoreline is currently inaccessible, although hundreds of apartments are located nearby in the Bay Street Landing community.

The DEP’s plan for the East River would impact two outfalls. The first is TI-003, which is located on the waterfront of Malba, looking over the Whitestone Bridge.

The outfall here is a concrete and stone structure that empties into the heart of Powell’s Cove. In 2016, 62 million gallons of sewage overflows were reported here during 57 overflow events.

The DEP plan would reduce overflow into the East River by 86 million gallons in a typical year, which would improve the health of this small private beach. Eight homes have been built on the sparsely populated waterfront.

The northernmost CSO outfall included in the DEP’s plan is TI-023, which is located in Beechhurst’s Little Bay Park, next to the Throgs Neck Bridge. The sign marking it is hidden behind a low wall.

In 2016, 90 million gallons of sewage overflowed into Little Bay, polluting the park’s beach, which is littered with debris and black sediment. The DEP’s plan for the East River would decrease overflows here by 42 million gallons in a typical year.

The Little Bay outfall is a large concrete structure, which at low tide is tall enough to walk through. On a recent dry day, a constant stream of clear water flows out of this structure and into Little Bay.

The outfall goes inland, deep underneath the nearby community, and is lined with oysters, barnacles and mussels. On a rainy day, millions of gallons of sewer water, street trash and feces would flood out of this structure and into the East River.","After hearing the limited scope of the city’s Citywide/Open Waters plan, many of the attendees stood up to publicly express their frustration and dismay.

Due to geographic conditions, there is very little potable water in this region and people are forced to travel long distances to access clean water for their daily needs or rely on rain and river water, which can sometimes be contaminated.

UN-Water estimates that worldwide 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and by 2050, the world’s population will have grown by an estimated 2 billion people, pushing global water demand up to 30 percent higher than today. One in four primary schools has no drinking water service, with students using unprotected water sources or going thirsty.

For those who have no access to clean water, water-related disease is common with more than 840,000 people dying each year from water-related diseases. UN-Water notes that more than 700 children under 5 years of age die every day from diarrheal disease linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation.

The five new boreholes will provide clean water, reduce outbreaks of waterborne diseases and eliminate the need for traveling hours each day in search of water. More than 20,000 poor children and families will benefit from this life-saving project.

“Water is essential for life, and it’s critical that Salesian programs around the globe have access to safe, clean water for the health and safety of those we serve,” said Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco. “Improving water and sanitation facilities brings a sense of dignity to communities and promotes proper hygiene and safe drinking water. This also reduces the number of waterborne illnesses that can affect those in our schools, keeping them away from important study time.”

According to UNICEF, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and the ninth most populous country in the world. With an estimated population of 150 million, one in every five Africans is a Nigerian. The country has been undergoing explosive population growth and has one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By United Nations estimates, Nigeria will be one of the countries responsible for most of the world’s total population increase by 2050.

While Nigeria has the second strongest economy in Africa, it also has extreme rates of poverty with 100 million people living on less than $1 a day. About 64 percent of households in Nigeria consider themselves to be poor while 32 percent of households say their economic situation had worsened over a period of one year, according to UNICEF. Poverty still remains one of the most critical challenges facing the country and population growth rates have meant a steady increase in the number of people living in conditions of poverty.

Muscat: Almost the entire population of the Sultanate was provided drinking water services in a controlled and safe manner during the 2014-2016 period, according to a new report from the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI).

According to the report, the percentage of the Sultanate’s population who have access to clean and safe drinking water sources rose by 3.8 per cent during the period of 2014-2016.

While 98 per cent of the urban population and 99 per cent of those in rural areas were provided drinking water services in a controlled and safe manner during the same period, the report revealed.

The National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI) recently released the fourth of its series of issues of (Towards the Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 2030), with each issue addressing 1 of the 17 goals of the plan.

This fourth issue highlights the sixth goal of sustainable development that focuses on ‘Clean water and hygiene’ in Oman.

The sixth goal ensures the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation services for all and includes 8 targets that are measured by different indicators.

According to the report, the first target of the sixth goal of the 2030 sustainable development goals is to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all 2030.

The percentage of the Sultanate’s population who have access to clean and safe drinking water sources increased by 3.8 per cent during the period of 2014-2016, while 98 per cent of the urban population and 99 per cent of those in rural areas were provided drinking water services in a controlled and safe manner during the same period.

As for the target of achieving the goal of universal access to proper sanitation and hygienic services by 2030, the report showed that 99 per cent of the country’s population benefits from well managed sanitation services in the year 2014, with about 99.2 per cent of them in the urban areas and 98.4 per cent in rural areas.

The report stated that there was a Zero effect of wastewater on the environment and human health in Oman, as it is being treated by 100 per cent safety methods. The target of improving the quality of the water has also been achieved by reducing pollution, preventing the disposal of hazardous wastes and chemicals, minimizing the leakage of hazardous wastes and chemicals, reducing the proportion of untreated sewage to half, and using recycled materials.

The report also highlights the purpose of achieving a significant increase in the water-use efficiency across all sectors, and ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply of fresh water in order to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity by 2030. The rate of pressure on water consumption, which is represented by the rate of withdrawal of fresh water supply across all major sectors in the Sultanate, reached 128 per cent in the year of 2018, which is considered as medium to high level.

As for the target of implementing an integrated management of water resources at all levels by several means, including trans-boundary cooperation by 2030, and based on the questionnaire conducted by the United Nations on the implementation of an integrated management for water resources, the index shows that the current status of the Sultanate is among the level of low to medium, reaching 38 per cent.

The Sultanate has implemented specific programs on communication, education and public awareness with regard to the protection and restoration of ecosystems related to water resources, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes, by the year 2030.

The importance of clean water is essential for obvious reasons. Clean water ensures that we do not become ridden with disease, it allows us to clean ourselves, our homes, and even our pets. Clean drinking water is an entirely different ball game that requires a high level of sanitation and inspection in order to maintain our health at an optimal level.

Understanding the general well being of the public and how water treatments and sanitation systems aid to this huge responsibility is not one that many know much about. Often times clean water can be taken for granted, especially in developed countries. Many times, people might not even know where their water is coming from, all they know is that it is indeed clean and safe to drink. Merus is a great source for help with maintaining clean water standards for the public to use and consume in their homes is truly a thankless job.

Listed below are some of the ways that water treatment helps solve common water problems.

Coagulation and flocculation is the first step in ensuring the proper sanitation of our water. Drinking water typically comes from freshwater lakes, rivers, wells, or even streams. Within these different water sources you will find various amounts of organic materials and sediments that translate to sand, bacteria, dirt, amongst other non-drinkable materials have to be removed.

To begin the process of cleaning the cities drinking water, treatment begins by adding coagulants to force the non-drinkable particles and sediments in the water stick together, or congeal. The water and sediments in the water do this in something that is called a flocculation basin. In this area, the coagulants are mixed for a period of time before moving to the next step in treatment.","Clean Water is Serious Business!

What this means is that, in the not-too-distant future, something as simple as a minor cut could develop into a life-threatening infection.

Up to 2 million people are infected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year. Antibiotic resistance could cost 10 million lives and as much as US$8 trillion each year by 2050 if the problem isn’t challenged.

In Ghana, there are already a great number of deaths every year from infectious diseases, such as diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections. Lack of clean water and sanitation is the main cause. But it is hygiene that breaks the chain of infections and helps prevent them. And levels of domestic hygiene are influenced by a number of economic, educational and other factors.

We believe that understanding domestic hygiene practices better would help to prevent bacterial infection at home, reducing the need for treatment with antibiotics and thus reducing resistance.

I have been working with a group of scientists on design research work that crosses into specialist medical areas, in this instance antimicrobial resistance. In a recently published paper we present our findings based on work we have been doing in Ghana on a project called Dust Bunny, an international design-led research project. The project combines design research and microbiology to provide an informed assessment of practices in domestic cleanliness and to help with the design of novel solutions that reduce infections in the home.

The research has involved academics from a range of disciplines. These have included design, microbiology, epidemiology and social science. This meant that we were able to combine design innovation research methods with microbiology (which includes the study of bacteria).

Our findings show that although household dust is a low risk to health with respect to infectious disease, it provides a pool of antibiotic resistance that could compromise future infections and could cause disease in people who are already suffering from infectious or non-infectious diseases.

Where science and everyday practice meet

Design research is a process that seeks to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and test innovative solutions. Its ability to engage real people, understand everyday problems and implement the “right” solution, not just the “newest technology”, makes it a bridge between disciplines.

The reason it’s important to find out more about home hygiene is that cleaning can actually spread bacteria. Cleaning cloths, towels and mops can spread infection to other rooms unless they are cleaned regularly. When pathogens (disease-causing bacteria) are present in the home they can infect younger and older family members and people who have an existing health condition, making them ill. In Ghana over 15,000 people (2,250 children under five) die each year from poor hygiene alone.

One of the challenges in the fight against bacteria is that they aren’t visible to the naked eye. It’s difficult to clean what we cannot see.

This is where design innovation methods can help. Working directly with households through methods such as observation, taking photos and making videos, following the household activities through a typical day, and storytelling, can help to develop a deeper understanding of the different ways people keep their homes clean. By engaging with households across different socio-economic groups, locations (city centre, suburbs and informal settlements) and building structures (apartments, detached houses, compound houses and so on), design innovation can create a more complete picture of the role of local traditions, culture, religious practices and individual perceptions on home cleanliness and hygiene.

This field helps to bridge the gap between advancements in science, technology and engineering and everyday contexts.

Microbiologists typically collect dust samples from random households and analyse them to find out how many and what type of bacteria are found in a house. The design research approach helps them to get a sample that represents different socio-economic groups, locations and building structures. This saves money and time.

Design methods help the people who are participating in research to understand the impact of home cleaning on the health of their families. They can then develop more effective cleaning strategies that take into account the type of bacteria found across different homes.

In the Dust Bunny project we worked closely with household participants to design new cleaning practices suitable for different types of homes. We didn’t give standard instructions that overlooked local traditions and circumstances. People are much more likely to adopt new ways of doing things if they have been actively involved in their design.

There are creative ways to visualise and explain microbiological results in simple ways. People don’t have to be highly educated to understand what the bacteria in their homes mean for their health.

The way forward

The insights gained from combining design and microbiology suggest that there are still challenges in working across disciplines. The function of design in specialist medical areas is not always clearly understood.

But it does provide information about behaviour and how to promote best practices for public health. It can also improve targeting of microbiological sampling at the household level.

The Dust Bunny project is piloting these methods in Ghana and engaging with communities and scientists. This has captured both scientific and media attention. A video documentary was broadcast on Ghana Today Television in June and July 2019.

The team followed up the new cleaning practices with another round of microbiological analysis and interviews with households. It is currently analysing the findings from these.

The key message is that citizens can do as much as scientists to fight drug-resistant bacteria and keep homes healthy.","We believe that understanding domestic hygiene practices better would help to prevent bacterial infection at home, reducing the need for treatment with antibiotics and thus reducing resistance.

Wetlands protection is needed for Right to Clean Water in Zimbabwe – Human Rigts Watch has said.

Dewa Mavhinga, the Southern Africa Director with the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch, has called upon Zimbabwean authorities to take urgent action to protect and stop the ongoing and unprecedented degradation of wetlands, particularly in the capital, Harare stating that they are important for several reasons.

“They breakdown harmful pollutants such as chemicals from the water hence filtering the water and using the chemicals as fertilizer for vegetation growing on the wetland,” he said, noting that wetlands are natural sewage systems, filtering out waste and running clean water into rivers.

On February 2, Zimbabwe joined the rest of the world in commemorating World Wetlands Day amid concerns about the government’s poor protection of wetlands.

Despite Zimbabwe being a party to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which seeks to protect and preserve wetlands, Dewa says enough is not being done to educate citizens, policymakers, local and national government authorities on the importance of wetlands and on strengthening mechanisms for their protection.

According a local environmental group, Harare’s only water source – Lake Chivero has been greatly affected by illegal construction on wetlands that feed into it.

Poor urban planning and insufficient regulation, coupled with lack of appreciation of the importance of wetlands, has resulted in the destruction of Harare’s wetlands.

Water filtration systems can remove impurities and contaminants found in tap water, including lead, chlorine, and bacteria. Some remove more than others. Check out our top picks for the best water filters — no matter the situation.

Can we all just agree that we are over bottled water? Okay good.

If you're all about eliminating single-use plastic from your life, but your tap water is straight up undrinkable, this task gets a bit difficult. But relax: We can fix that.

Water filters and purifiers remove contaminants and impurities from water to make it more suitable for drinking and cooking. This allows you to utilize a reusable water bottle and fill it with clean water that you actually feel good about drinking.

Filters can take the place of hundreds of plastic water bottles, which helps you be more eco-friendly and reduce the amount of plastic in landfills. Filtration systems are also lifesavers in areas where tap water is unsafe to drink, as long as they remove the proper contaminants like lead. Some even take away the sulfur taste and smell from well water, which is amazing.

Should you filter your tap water?

It depends. If you experience a chlorine odor or taste, you might want to run your water through a filter. If you live in an area with threatened or compromised water supplies, absolutely yes you should filter your tap water — you do not want to be drinking lead or mercury or bacteria. As mentioned, if you have well water and have been living off bottled water or drums of water, you can actually get a filtration system and make your tap water drinkable.

Unsure or nervous about your water quality? Test it! This can help you determine if you should invest in a filter. More on that below.

What type of water filter is best?

There are a few different types of water filters, and they're each best for different purposes.

Water filter pitchers and dispensers: This is the easiest water filtration option because all that's required of you is filling up the reservoir and letting the water filter down into the container. These types of filters are easily stored in the fridge or on the counter. Pitchers and dispensers are often best for people who don't need a ton of filtered water at once. They usually don't purify water, so they're also best for city water that doesn't have viruses or bacteria in it.

Faucet mounts: A faucet water filter allows you to dispense filtered water directly from your sink to your glass. They attach onto your faucet and typically last longer and filter out more impurities than pitchers do. They tend to look a bit bulky, but on the other hand, they don't take up any space in the fridge.

Under sink filtration systems: Under-the-sink water filtration systems are a bit more heavy duty and are typically for water that needs quite a bit of help. For instance, if you have well water, one of these systems can make it drinkable and get rid of its rotten egg smell and slightly brown color. Complete filtration systems will do the best job cleaning and purifying water compared to just running water through a single filter into a container.

Do water filters really work?

In a word, yes. You can actually test your water a couple different ways and see what difference a filter is making. Testing for pH levels is one route, and you'll want to make sure your water is about a seven to 10.

Another test is for measuring total dissolved solids (TDS) or salt, metal, or minerals in the water. These are your leads and chlorines and other similar contaminants. TDS is measured in milligrams per unit volume or also referred to as parts per million (ppm). Ideal drinking water is 0 to 50 ppm, acceptable levels range from 50 to 140 ppm, and average tap water falls between 140 and 400 ppm. Essentially, the higher the number, the more metals and minerals you have in your water.

The best way tell if a filter is making a difference is to measure the levels in your unfiltered tap water versus the levels in water from your filter. Sometimes if a filter is old or not installed properly, your numbers will actually be higher in the filtered sample. That is a problem and you should either swap out the filter or consult the product manual to see what could be the issue.

What should I look for in a water filter?

Before you look for a water filter, look at your water. What sort of contaminants are in it? If it's pretty standard stuff like chlorine, mercury, and pesticides (yes those are standard contaminants — tons of systems violate the Safe Drinking Water Act), you can get away with a pretty basic filter like a Brita pitcher.

If you've got more extreme stuff in your water like lead and bacteria, a reverse osmosis water filter or faucet attachment might suit your needs better. If you have lead in your water, make sure that you get a filter that is certified by the National Sanitation Foundation to ensure that it will actually, safely remove lead.

While some of the filters rounded up here list out a scary number of contaminants and impurities they can handle, not all of these things will be in your water. You might only have chlorine in your water and don't need to be concerned about lead. See if you can get your hands on an official water report to accurately know what's contaminating your water so you can find the best filter for your situation.

After doing hours of research and reading tons of reviews, we've come up with X picks for the best water filters. But first, a couple of pro tips: First, be sure to run the water through the filter a couple of times before you start drinking so that any activated carbon (the main ingredient in many of these filters) can work its way through. Second, you'll want to keep extra replacement filters on hand so that when the indicator says its time to change, you're ready to go.

Español

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is issuing a Safety Communication to inform patients and health care providers that devices claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices or accessories (such as masks, tubing, headgear) using ozone gas or ultraviolet (UV) light are not legally marketed for this use by the FDA in the U.S., and as such, their safety and effectiveness for use with CPAP devices and accessories is unknown. CPAP devices are often prescribed for home use to patients with obstructive sleep apnea, a condition where an individual’s airway becomes blocked during sleep causing breathing to intermittently stop and start. CPAP devices use air pressure to keep airways open during sleep.

To ensure the safe and effective cleaning of CPAP devices and accessories, the FDA is recommending that consumers and health care providers follow the cleaning instructions provided by the CPAP’s manufacturer, which normally include regular cleaning with soap and water.

“The FDA has identified several manufacturers that are marketing ozone gas or UV light-based products claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize CPAP devices and accessories in the home,” said William H. Maisel, M.D., M.P.H, director of the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Exposure to high levels of ozone gas may worsen a patients’ existing chronic respiratory diseases or increase the chance of a respiratory infection. UV light-based products could cause burns, eye damage or increase the risk of skin cancer due to over exposure. The FDA has contacted manufacturers of products making these claims and asked them to submit data demonstrating their safety and effectiveness.”

The FDA has received 11 reports from 2017-2019 from patients experiencing cough, difficult breathing, nasal irritation, headaches, asthma attacks and other breathing complaints when ozone gas-based products were used to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories. The FDA has not received any adverse event reports for UV light products claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize CPAP devices and accessories.

Ozone is a gas that can be used to kill harmful bacteria. However, for ozone to be effective in killing harmful bacteria, it must be present at a concentration far greater than what is considered safe for humans. Although products claiming to clean, disinfect or sanitize CPAP devices that use ozone gas claim that they are designed to keep ozone gas inside the machine and its accessories, leaks can occur at tubing connections, filters or through containers used to house CPAP accessories. When leaks occur, ozone gas in the room where the devices are used may temporarily rise to unsafe levels especially if the room is small or not well ventilated.

Additionally, if the CPAP machine or accessories are used without first allowing fresh air to circulate through the entire CPAP system to remove any remaining ozone gas, this could lead to someone inhaling ozone gas, which could cause breathing problems.

Direct exposure to UV light may cause injury depending on its wavelength, intensity and exposure time. Additionally, the UV light may not be able to penetrate all components of CPAP devices and accessories, like the plastic tubing, masks and connectors, which could lead to inadequately disinfected components that may be unsafe for people to reuse.

While these devices claiming to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP machines and accessories have not been FDA cleared or approved for marketing in the U.S., the FDA conducted its own preliminary lab testing on several of those illegally marketed products. The testing demonstrated ozone-using disinfection devices generated ambient levels of ozone above limits considered safe for human exposure. Ozone levels were also high in CPAP machines and tubing even after waiting the amount of time recommended by the ozone-based device manufacturer after a cleaning cycle. The FDA’s studies also showed the power of the UV light and time during which CPAP masks and accessories were exposed to this light varied considerably among UV cleaners. If CPAP components are exposed to insufficiently strong UV light or processed for an insufficient amount of time, the CPAP components could be inadequately disinfected leading to safety and performance issues.

The FDA has contacted manufacturers of the ozone gas and UV light products that claim to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories. Each manufacturer was informed that based on their product’s intended use and technological characteristics, FDA review and clearance or approval is needed and that data would need to be provided to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

The FDA will continue to monitor reports of adverse events associated with the use of ozone gas or UV-based CPAP devices that claim to clean, sanitize or disinfect CPAP devices and accessories and update the public should new information become available.

The FDA encourages individuals to report adverse events related to the use these devices to the FDA.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

So it's not surprising that phones can harbor lots of bacteria and germs. Some experts estimate that phones contain 10 times the number of germs found on a toilet seat. But using disinfectant to give your phone a scrub-down can damage screens. So can plain soap and water cut it when respiratory viruses from the flu to coronavirus are going around? Here are the best ways to keep your phone and hands clean.

Killing the germs

Currently, there are 761 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and 23 deaths. To put that in perspective, the common flu infected an estimated 35.5 million people here last year. According to the CDC, cleaning products such as soap can kill flu viruses on surfaces. But standard soap may not be enough to clean your devices when it comes to coronavirus, now called COVID-19. It is currently unclear how long coronavirus lasts on surfaces, so the CDC suggests cleaning and disinfecting ""frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe"" for preventing the spread. The Environmental Protection Agency released a list of antimicrobial products that can be used to disinfect surfaces infected by COVID-19, including common household cleaning products like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Lysol Brand Clean and Fresh Multi-surface Cleaner.

Save your screen

The problem? Chemicals found in household cleaners and even soap can damage the screen on your device. Disinfectants wear down screens' ""oleophobic coating,"" which is designed to keep them fingerprint- and moisture-free, according to Apple's website. For that reason, Apple used to say that you should avoid cleaning products and abrasive materials that could affect the coating and make your iPhone more vulnerable to scratches. Samsung suggests that Galaxy users avoid using Windex or window cleaners with ""strong chemicals"" on screens. But on Monday, Apple updated its cleaning suggestions, stating that you can use 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, to ""gently wipe the hard, nonporous surfaces of your Apple product, such as the display, keyboard, or other exterior surfaces."" However, you shouldn't use bleach or submerge your devices in cleaning products, according to Apple's website. And while UV-C light cleaners won't harm your phone and research shows UV-C light can kill airborne flu germs, ""UV-C penetrates superficially, and the light can't get into nooks and crannies,"" Philip Tierno, a clinical professor in the department of pathology at New York University Langone Medical Center, told NBC News.

So what do you do?

Wiping your phone or cleaning it with soap and a little water, or preventing your phone from getting dirty is generally a good idea, Emily Martin, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, tells CNBC Make It. But phones are always going to be hotspots for germs because you hold them right up to the areas where infectious diseases can enter, like the eyes, nose and mouth, Martin says. Also, people tend to carry their phones everywhere with them, including the bathroom where most contamination happens.","But using disinfectant to give your phone a scrub-down can damage screens.

Don Bosco High School was launched in direct response to the need for education for youth in the southwestern part of Nkhotakota. The school started with 88 students and six teachers. Today, Don Bosco High School has 378 students across four grades educated by 20 teachers. More than half of the students are from the local community, but the school does board 160 students.

“The biggest challenge the school faced was the chronic lack of regular water supply for both our boarding and day students,” said Father J. Czerwinski. “Although the school is near a large lake and connected to the town water source, there were still acute water shortages every day. The town supply is very erratic and unreliable. This caused problems for our students including a lack of proper hygiene, a health hazard, and no water for cooking and drinking.”

Fr. Czerwinski added, “Because of that, we turned to Salesian Missions for the help and assistance, and through donor funding we were able to drill the borehole and add a solar pump to solve our water challenges.”

UN-Water estimates that worldwide 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and by 2050, the world’s population will have grown by an estimated 2 billion people, pushing global water demand up to 30 percent higher than today. One in four primary schools has no drinking water service, with students using unprotected water sources or going thirsty. In addition, UN-Water notes that more than 700 children under 5 years of age die every day from diarrheal disease linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation.

In response to this crisis, Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco, continues its “Clean Water Initiative” to make building wells and supplying fresh, clean water a top priority for every community in every country in which Salesian missionaries work.

In Malawi, more than 50 percent of the population lives in poverty and the majority of households have women as the head of the household, according to the World Bank. Located in southeast Africa, Malawi is a landlocked country bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the east, south and west.

Agriculture is a central part of Malawi’s economy but land distribution is unequal and crops are highly vulnerable to the region’s frequent droughts. Few houses have piped water and less than one in 10 Malawians has access to electricity. Water is collected from wells or streams and most people cook over an open fire. Malawians deal with hunger and malnutrition on a daily basis. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, 45 percent of the country’s children under age 5 are stunted due to a lack of adequate nutrition. Many children also lack educational opportunities and have few options for improving their circumstances.

This newest drain cleaning technology — OXYWAVE — is a quat-free solution to remove biofilm and sanitize drains, floors and walls. It is ideal for use on previously cleaned, hard, non-porous food contact surfaces in dairies, wineries and breweries.

Madison Chemical is a chemical formulator providing cleaning, sanitation, and maintenance products for the food and beverage processing industries headquartered in Madison, Ind.

How Oxywave works

Utilizing the power of peracetic acid and Perafoam, OXYWAVE attacks and eliminates biofilms and destroys microorganisms. This foaming-sanitizing solution provides 360-degree contact along the pipe walls for maximum sanitation.

It will not damage concrete or stainless steel in diluted form. In addition to open and closed drains such as those found in breweries, OXYWAVE is ideal for doorway foaming systems to prevent cross-contamination.

This fast acting sanitizer/disinfectant kills bacteria, mold, fungus and yeast. It is tolerant of water hardness, can be used in hot or cold water and is less affected by organic soil load than either chlorine or quaternary sanitizers.

How to use it

Prior to sanitizing food contact surfaces, remove gross food particles, then wash with a detergent solution, followed by a potable water rinse. Sanitize with a concentration of 1.0 to 6.1 oz OXYWAVE diluted in 6 gal of water (0.13 – 0.79% v/v concentration or 82-500 ppm active peracetic acid).

At this dilution, OXYWAVE is effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocyotogenes. Use immersion, coarse spray or circulation techniques as appropriate to the equipment. All surfaces should be exposed to the sanitizing solution for at least 60 seconds or more if specified by governing code. Drain any excess solution. Do not rinse.

Exact dilutions and temperatures are dependent upon the specific nature of the application. Standard operating procedures may need to be developed for specific concentration and temperature.","Madison Chemical has debuted a two-part drain cleaning program that cleans drains without scrubbing.

The famous three-day Dusi Canoe Marathon race is scheduled to start on Thursday from Camps Drift in Pietermaritzburg, and will finish at Durban’s Blue Lagoon on Saturday.

But according to a statement by the Duzi uMngeni Conversation Trust (Duct), the state of Msunduzi River is diabolical at the moment.

The issue of poor water quality in the river has been a hot topic for a while now with paddlers worried about their safety after 66% of participants in last year’s race suffered “Dusi Guts”.

To avoid more “Dusi Guts” this year, Duct, in partnership with S-Cubed Sports, have sourced a private sponsor, Euro Steel, to purchase much-needed equipment — three high-pressure cleaner nozzles and four truck batteries to aid the Msunduzi Municipality Sanitation Branch ahead of the race.

“The very high E. coli count in Duzi water is relatively easy to determine, and the higher the E. coli count, the more likely that the water is carrying enough pathogens to be dangerous,” said Sanele Vilakazi from Duct.

“The most commonly reported symptoms of E. coli infection are stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and fever. Raw sewage spills into the Duzi River are at an all-time high and we are hopeful that this donation will bring about the much-needed change to the current situation.

“The Msunduzi River from the Camps Drift moving downstream is showing high levels of pollution.”

The donation comes after Duct raised concerns for the health and safety of race participants as sewer leaks and block­ages along the river racecourse were polluting the water.

“This is all in an effort to improve the very poor water quality numbers of the Msunduzi River, which continuously records high faecal pollution counts from results produced by Umgeni Water,” said Vilakazi.

“These four batteries and nozzles will get the municipality’s honeysuckers and sewer rodding trucks up and running again. Their fleet of trucks will be mobile again. The nozzles will assist the sanitation unit in the quick and effective unblocking/maintenance of sewers.”

However, chairperson of the Dusi committee Shane le Breton downplayed the Duct statements and said everything would be fine before the race starts on Thursday.

“That has been miscommunicated,” said Le Breton.

“Duct themselves, what they do is they work together with the municipality to identify sewer manholes that are broken and overflowing. So, what happened last is that we had a meeting with the [Msunduzi] mayor and deputy mayor to highlight the issues of this manhole through Duct and the mayor and the deputy mayor have given us full support to clean just before the Dusi.

“From that meeting, they have started with one of five manholes which were identified that cause the issues which can affect the race. If we can get those manholes completed prior to the race then we should be fine.”

Meanwhile, Umgeni Water has promised to add another significant contribution to the race with a release of water from Henley and Inanda dams to the river before the Dusi Canoe Marathon.

“An estimated 800 megalitres will be released over 26 hours, ending at 10 am on February 27. This will raise the level of the Msunduzi River so that canoeists are able to move through it with ease during the race.

“It will also flush the river, thereby improving river water quality,” said Umgeni Water’s Shami Harichunder.","With the Dusi Canoe Marathon just five days away, the raw sewage spills into the Msunduzi River are at an all-time high, causing a serious hazard to hundreds of paddlers’ health.

1. Q Why do I have to wash my hands frequently?

A The virus is spread via droplets, and hands may touch surfaces contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus to yourself.

Washing your hands with soap and water will get rid of the virus if it is on your hands.

2. Q Should I just wear gloves?

A You can do so, but this is not practical. Also, if your gloves are dirty and you touch your face, you can still transfer the virus to your face.

3. Q Why must I cover my mouth or nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing?

A The virus spreads via droplets. Covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing prevents the spread of germs and viruses.

If you sneeze or cough into your hands, you may contaminate objects or people that you touch.

4. Q Masks can protect us. Why do the Government and the World Health Organisation say we should wear masks only when we are sick?

A Dr David Carrington, a clinical virologist at St George's, University of London, told the BBC that surgical masks for the public are not foolproof because they are too loose, have no air filter and leave the eyes exposed.

Also, you may touch your mask with dirty hands, for example, when you remove or put on a mask when eating or drinking. The longer you wear one, the less effective it becomes, especially if it becomes damp from your breath.

Wearing masks may give a false sense of security, and people may become lax about personal hygiene, such as washing their hands frequently.

Instead, people are advised to wash their hands thoroughly and regularly throughout the day and to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

5. Q I would rather wear a mask anyway, so when should I do so?

A Wear a mask if you are unwell and need to go out to see a doctor, or if you are taking care of someone suspected of having the coronavirus.

If it makes you feel better, you can wear a mask if you are going to ride the MRT or be in a cab for a while, said Professor Wang Linfa, director of the emerging infectious disease programme at Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) Medical School. ""If you're worried about getting the virus in the MRT, then you can wear a mask, but if you're walking on the streets, there's no need to,"" he said.

If you want to wear a mask, make sure you wash your hands before putting it on, and every time you touch it, as you could transfer germs from your dirty hands to the mask.

Also make sure that you are wearing the mask properly. It should fit snugly against your face with no gaps to allow the viruses to get through. Change the mask when it becomes soiled or damp, as this reduces its effectiveness.

You will have to be prepared to wear masks for at least a few weeks, as the coronavirus problem is not likely to disappear any time soon.

6. Q Besides washing my hands regularly, what else can I do to protect myself?

A You can avoid sharing personal items with others. For instance, don't share utensils and drinking glasses at mealtimes.

7. Q How about touching doorknobs and lift buttons?

A Doorknobs and lift buttons are ""high-touch"" points, which means that many people would have touched them in a short period of time. So it is possible to get infected by touching a dirty doorknob or lift button.

This is why health experts keep emphasising the importance of hand hygiene. You can wash your hands or use a hand sanitiser after touching these spots, and before you eat, for instance.

Some people use a tissue to press lift buttons, while others use a pen with a cap, a tip that Prof Wang said he learnt from social media. Remove the ink cartridge before using it, and cap it afterwards.

8. Q Will I catch the virus if I go near an infected person who does not have any symptoms?

A Dr Carmen Dolea, head of the International Health Regulations Secretariat at the World Health Organisation (WHO), said there is no such thing as a truly asymptomatic patient.

Even if the patient is not showing symptoms like coughing or sneezing, he may still have clinical symptoms like fever. ""For somebody to transmit the virus, they have to have some kinds of symptoms,"" she said in a recent video.

Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, chief health scientist at the Ministry of Health, said the risk of asymptomatic transmission is still unclear, though it is possible that a patient could be shedding viruses through a sniffle or his hands, which have come into contact with respiratory secretions.

Prof Tan suggested reducing hand contact by not shaking hands, and by using other forms of greeting. ""Clean your hands frequently, especially after you touch a lot of surfaces,"" he said.

Most importantly, people who are sick should stay at home, avoid crowded places and wear a mask if they need to go out, as this reduces the risk for everyone else, he said.

9. Q What is the safe distance to keep from an infected person?

A The WHO advises a distance of at least one metre.

If someone infected with the coronavirus coughs within one metre of you, you could breathe in the virus through the droplets in the air.

GOING OUT

10. Q Is it safe to use public transport and to take taxis or private-hire cars?

A Private-hire car and taxi companies are providing masks for their drivers and encouraging them to disinfect their vehicles frequently.

Drivers have been advised to wind down their vehicles' windows when ferrying passengers with flu-like symptoms, and after every completed trip, to improve ventilation in their vehicles.

They have also been advised to take their temperature twice a day, once before starting work and at another time in the course of the day.

Trains and buses will be disinfected more regularly, especially touch points such as grab poles, overhead handles and seats.

Surfaces at MRT stations as well as bus interchanges will be cleaned and disinfected.

11. Q In a cab, should I or the driver wear a mask?

A You should, if you're unwell.

Surgical masks have been given to cab and private-hire car drivers, but these are for them to offer to passengers who are unwell.

Prof Wang suggested that passengers wind down the window for a while, avoid touching anything, and sanitise their hands after exiting the cab.

12. Q Is it safe to go shopping?

A While it is good practice to avoid crowded areas where possible, shopping activities can still continue if proper hygiene standards are followed closely.

Malls have stepped up measures to regularly disinfect common areas, and have made hand sanitisers available to shoppers.

Some malls have also ceased all public events, such as workshops and mass exercise activities.

13. Q Is it safe to stay in a hotel?

A Yes, hotels have stepped up sanitation measures, including thorough cleaning of common areas.

14. Q Is it safe to fly? Is the plane cabin air clean?

A The air inside modern airplanes is as clean as in hospital operating rooms, as the air is changed many times through high-efficiency particulate air filters that remove 99.97 per cent of airborne microbes, including viruses and bacteria, according to the International Air Transport Association.

However, passengers are at risk when there is a sick person on board, especially when the person is seated close to them. Transmission is also possible through objects such as toilet door handles that the sick person has touched.

The best thing to do in a plane cabin is to practise proper hand hygiene and coughing etiquette, and to keep a distance from people who are coughing or have other respiratory symptoms, said Dr Dolea.

AT WORK

15. Q Should I stay away from work?

A Employees with a recent travel history to China are placed on a 14-day leave of absence, where they are to remain at home as much as possible, avoid crowded places and minimise contact with others.

All staff who are feeling unwell are advised to rest at home and to seek medical assistance.

Companies have also split up their staff so that they work at separate sites to reduce the risk of cross-infection.

If you are sharing a workspace, you may want to clean shared work surfaces, including tables, phones, keyboards and computer screens.

AT HOME

16. Q Should I close all my windows to prevent a spread of the virus?

A No. Infectious disease experts suggest keeping windows and doors open to ventilate rooms. This will reduce the spread of diseases.

Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader for infectious diseases at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: ""Enclosed spaces, where they are less humid and cooler, could help to spread respiratory diseases.""

Prof Tan said most studies indicate that viruses ""don't persist well in hot, humid environments"".

""Hot and humid, meaning over 30 deg C, and with humidity levels of over 80 per cent,"" he said.

17. Q How can I disinfect my home?

A Wear a surgical mask and disposable gloves, and use a bleach solution or an appropriate disinfectant to clean all surfaces.

Use disposable cloths or rags to wipe toilet surfaces and frequently touched areas. Refrain from using a spray, as this could create splashes that can further spread the virus.

Keep the windows open for ventilation, and avoid touching your face and eyes at all times.

PROTECTING THE YOUNG AND OLD

18. Q What can the elderly, children and others who may have weaker immunity do?

A Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

Dr Edwin Chng, medical director of healthcare provider Parkway Shenton, said that these people should avoid unnecessary visits to clinics and hospitals as far as possible. This is to reduce exposure to bugs, as those with a weaker immune system are more susceptible to infections.

They should stay indoors as much as possible, and avoid crowded areas and people who are unwell. Finally, they should wear a surgical mask if they are unwell, and practise good hand hygiene at all times.

19. Q Children have weaker immunity. Shouldn't they wear masks?

A Masks are generally not needed for people who are well, including children, said Associate Professor Thoon Koh Cheng, head and senior consultant of the infectious diseases service at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. He said a child can wear a well-fitted child-size mask when he has a fever, cough or runny nose, or when he is recovering from an illness.

To be effective, change the mask regularly, or when it is soiled or wet. Wash hands with soap and water after disposing of the soiled mask properly into a bin, he said.

20. Q What precautions should I take to protect my children if they are ill?

A The advice for unwell children is the same for adults. People who are unwell should seek medical attention promptly, stay at home to rest and avoid crowds, said Prof Thoon.

21. Q What are the chances of children getting the virus?

A Prof Thoon said there have been fewer cases of children infected with the virus compared with the adult population. ""Based on what we know so far, if the virus infects a healthy child, he or she should make a good recovery with good medical support,"" he said.

22. Q If there is a suspected or confirmed infection at a pre-school, should I pull my child out of the school?

A Dr Piotr Chlebicki, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Alvernia Hospital, said there is no need to do anything, unless the infected person had spent time playing with all the children in the classrooms.

JABS AND MEDICATION

23. Q Can we use antibiotics to prevent and treat this coronavirus?

A Antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are effective only against bacterial infections.

24. Q Should I get a flu jab?

A A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the coronavirus. There is currently no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses.

However, people have been rushing to get flu jabs to prevent them from getting influenza in this outbreak. Most clinics here have run out of the Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines due to overwhelming demand, said Dr Chng. He added that the Southern Hemisphere flu vaccines are expected to be available in Singapore by the middle of next month.

Flu vaccines are updated twice a year in accordance with the Northern and Southern Hemispheres' winter seasons. Flu tends to strike year-round in Singapore, unlike in temperate countries where it tends to peak at the start of winter.

25. Q Will I risk an infection by going to a buffet dinner?

A There is currently no evidence that the coronavirus is associated with the consumption of food. Food at a buffet that is kept warm, above 60 deg C, is safe to eat as the heat would render the virus not infectious, said Professor William Chen, the Michael Fam chair professor and director of Nanyang Technological University's Food Science and Technology Programme in a recent AskST column.

It is not the food but the group environment of a buffet that may result in a higher risk of transmission, as the disease is spread through close contact with infectious people as well as contact with the virus on a surface and then touching your face.

Here are five steps to sanitise your home:

1. Prepare your cleaning tools

Wear a surgical mask, disposable gloves and a bleach solution or appropriate disinfectant with indication of effectiveness against coronavirus

Keep the windows open for ventilation, and remember to avoid touching your face and eyes.

2. Start to clean surfaces

Prepare the disinfectant or bleach solution, and mop the floor of your residence from one end to another.

Use disposable cloths or rags to wipe toilet surfaces and frequently touched areas, such as handles, doorknobs, armrests, switches, etc.

Do not use a spray pack to apply disinfectant as it may create splashes which can further spread the virus.

3. Wash fabrics

Use a washing machine and detergent to wash fabrics, such as bed sheets, pillow covers and blankets.

4. Finishing up

Repeat mopping the floor of your residence from one end to another, but avoid going from uncleaned areas to cleaned areas, to avoid dirtying the cleaned area.

With your gloves and mask on, throw all used cloths, as well as other waste, into a double-lined plastic trash bag.

Remove gloves and surgical mask, then wash your hands with soap and water. Separate clean-up waste from other household waste.

5. Ensuring personal hygiene

Shower and change your clothes, then air and ventilate your home.

Remember to avoid sharing household items, and wash used items thoroughly with soap and water.

As the virus can survive on surfaces of different materials for at least 2-3 days, potentially contaminated surfaces should be sanitised thoroughly. You should avoid hosting visitors in the home until your residence is sanitised.

To uncover the harsh reality for Somalians, Albert Mbaka, energy researcher at the Centre for International and Security Affairs, spoke with Guled Wiliq, the CEO and founder of Power Offgrid Somalia, on the inspiring local activity geared to advancing change.

In Somalia, businesses and rural communities have had to dig deep into their pockets to invest in generators and to meet monthly fuel costs in order to have access to power. This plight motivated Guled Wiliq to join the ranks of entrepreneurs playing a significant role in enabling access to power. This Somali American, practising in the US in engineering and real estate investments, has a professional background in civil engineering and a master’s degree in water resources management.

Let’s start by painting a picture of the Somalia energy landscape.

In 1966, in Mogadishu – the capital and most populous city of Somalia – only 11% of its residents had access to electricity and less than 1% had access to water. Today, those figures have risen marginally with approximately 30% having access to water and electricity.

In 1988, the un-subsidised electricity tariff was $0.25/kwh while inflation was 92% vs. today’s $1.5 to $2/kwh. Currently, the Somalia government has no national electrification policy in place including waiving taxes on solar products such as solar pumps and solar panels. The national development plan NDP-9 developed by the Ministry of Planning and Investments failed to prioritise electrification investments and has yet to publish data and roadmaps to achieve the SDGs.

An unsustainable 94% of Somalia’s population use charcoal and wood for cooking, which causes high indoor pollution resulting in the deaths of 5,000 people a year, making it the #2 killer in Somalia. The country sorely needs concrete electrification policies based on holistic local solutions, which are focused on energy for growth and evidence-based with proven track records, using a public-private partnership (P3) approach to finance Somalia’s four infancy sectors: namely energy, agriculture, fisheries and water infrastructure.

As the founder of Power Offgrid Somalia, what was your inspiration behind its formation?

I formed the company while in the US and seven years after President Obama launched the Power Africa Initiative – a programme aimed at increasing access to reliable, affordable and sustainable power in Africa through its $2.5 billion pledge, which partially contributed to my inspiration to start Power Offgrid in Somalia where 85% of the population don’t have access to electricity. [Ed: see page 68 for an update on Power Africa]

In the US, where I currently reside, my daily electricity consumption is between 90 to 125kwh per day, which is equivalent to what an average person in Somalia making less than $2/day will consume in 2-3 years. Some people may call it energy-poverty, but I call it an energy-trap stemming from poor governance, lack of policies, lack of technology, lack of human capacity development, and corruption. I was purposely driven by the desire to come out from this trap; hence the inspiration to bring the know-how, investment, new innovations to fill the developmental gap that could lift the economy out of the 18th century into the 21st century, and halt youth migration and high unemployment by providing greentech job opportunities through renewable energy.

To date, what has been the impact of introducing off-grid solutions in Somalia?

The company has played a major role in disrupting Somalia’s energy sector. We introduced the first-ever asset and innovative equity financing pay-as-you-go solar system – affordable for last-mile households, pastoralists, small enterprises and farmers – using a solar electric system and highly efficient portable solar bucket pump with a pump rate of 2,500 litres per hour (L/h).

In general, due to the high upfront cost, affordable off-grid renewable energy services in Somalia are non-existent, other than projects funded by NGOs as aid freebies which are unfortunately not a sustainable solution. We have installed more than 170kW of solar systems for residential and commercial use, powering over 3,500 households. In Jowhar City, we have also enabled more than 15,000 people with access to safe water and sanitation.

Another achievement is the shift of 70 farmers from primitive rain-fed and expensive diesel pump irrigation to smart-climate irrigation. These farmers now use our local innovative in-house built Kakud Solar irrigation with a pump rate of 30,000 L/h, which increased their irrigated area by 80% and expected income growth close to 70% – improving food security and increasing women participation in farming by 30%. These efforts have reduced 250 tonnes of CO2 carbon emission.

Tell us about your innovative business model, Goat4Solar.

In Somalia, the livestock population is 40 million versus 15 million people. Realising the hidden capital opportunities, Power Offgrid found an innovative process to beat the challenge of access to capital by exchanging goats for solar power: Goat4Solar (aka Goat4kWh). It’s a unique model specifically for the last mile agro-pastoralist in Somalia who don’t have cash in hand or is unable to access financing institutions (banks) that could provide loan services.

The opportunity is ideal for nomads to exchange their assets (livestock) for capital to use as down payment for a Pay-Go solar system. It is even suitable for enterprises such as a cold-chain for ice cream, battery mobile charging hub business, or solar pumps for irrigations.

Is solar power the main solution for clean energy access in Somalia?

I don’t really believe solar is the only solution for energy access in Somalia. In fact, our sister company, Jiko Biogas, diversifies our energy investment portfolio by tapping into animal and food waste, converting it into renewable natural gas for clean cooking and electricity.

With the international community and donors spending close to $1 billion annually on aid – if just 3.5% of the funding were used effectively through P3 and grants for electrification purposes, 50% of the population that need a 50-100W solar panel could be powered in five years. This will result in a reduction of people who have no access to electricity from 85% to 40%.

However, for Somalia to achieve specifically SDG7, investing in a smart, diversified and hybrid energy solution is a must. The energy mix must include biogas, natural gas, decentralised hybrid wind grids, bio-grids, and mini-grids to increase energy access both in rural and urban communities at an affordable rate.

Somalia has the highest potential to harness wind energy of up to 45TW in East Africa. Power Offgrid has already introduced wind power in the productive sector in Mogadishu for small enterprises and is currently planning to install 10-50kW wind-grid for cold-chain projects within coastal cities to boost the fishery and dairy farming industries.

As an investment entrepreneur in off-grid solutions, what advice do you have for entrepreneurs on how to reduce investment-related risks?

Make sure you recruit or hire somebody better than you, at least technically. Understand your customers’ problems and find your customers before they find you, because by the time they find you it’s too late. Spend 80% of your time doing research and experimenting to collect data to get information needed and analysis to make smart decisions. At the start, prepare to be the doer-of-all marketing, financing, recruiting, training, and volunteering.

In order to reduce the risk, be flexible and diversify your business model. In our example, we did several things: introduced biogas; allowed farmers/nomads to exchange their assets (livestock or their harvest) as payment for our solar systems; we used farmers’ idle land for poultry, beekeeping (honey), and brick manufacturing to generate additional income to finance our business.

That's the view of Rosemary Cloete-Anderson, chairperson of the Emfuleni Tourism Association and MD of Stonehaven on Vaal, a garden restaurant in the area.

Cloete-Anderson was speaking this week after a visit by human settlements, water and sanitation minister Lindiwe Sisulu to the Vaal River to assess projects to clean up the system.

Cloete-Anderson said the deterioration of the wastewater infrastructure in the system, which consists of three wastewater treatment works, 44 pump stations and 2,600km of water networks, had led to an apparent moratorium on new developments in the area.

“What that means is that any new development that is applied for that entails a significant amount of effluent discharge has not been approved,” she said.

This meant there were applications that had been approved by the council but could not go ahead because there was insufficient wastewater infrastructure to cope with any more effluent entering the wastewater system, she said.

Some of these developments included hotels on the river, 30,000 student beds, a glass-bottling factory, a brewery and retirement homes.

Cloete-Anderson said an alterative for developers was to establish their own “package plants”.","The billions needed to fix sewage-treatment infrastructure and for maintenance of the Vaal River system would be an investment with the potential to transform the Vaal into a vibrant economic hub.

The amount of sulfur in the air, largely from coal-fired electricity production, which falls to the ground in rain and is naturally “fixed” in soils, before being utilized by wheat plants once was adequate to produce desired sulfur levels in wheat and flour, said Dr. Guttieri, who is with the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture based at Kansas State University in Manhattan. But in 2003, the line was “crossed” where more sulfur was being removed through harvest than was being fixed in soil from the atmosphere, she said. Sulfur also is available through crop residue, she said.

Sulfur deficiency looks much like nitrogen deficiency in the field, she said.

“Low sulfur really affected protein quality,” Dr. Guttieri said.

Research from Kansas State showed flour deficient in sulfur had lower farinograph results (dough and gluten qualities, especially water absorption) than flour with adequate sulfur.

Dr. Guttieri said flour with low sulfur also may test high for asparagine, an amino acid that with certain sugars forms acrylamide in the baking process.

While adding sulfur to fields has shown mixed results, apparently mostly depending on the amount of organic matter and sulfur already in the top two feet of the soil, it appears about 10 lbs per acre of sulfur added in granular form (versus liquid) has the most beneficial results in fields that have less than 20 lbs of available sulfur, she said.","KANSAS CITY — “Cleaner” air from reduced coal-fired electricity generation has affected wheat yields and baking quality of flour milled from wheat grown on sulfur deficient soils, Mary Guttieri, Ph.D., said at the Wheat Quality Council’s annual meeting held Feb. 19 in Kansas City.

Speaking to the News Ghana during the exercise, the Country Manager, Lucozade Ghana, Mr Mensah Seneadza, noted that their motive is to help clean the environment and also imbibe in the people the culture of cleanliness.

He noted that the exercise is going to be done every single day by way of investing in sustainable processes such as investing in bins and supporting other organizations that are already into sanitation, cleanliness and plastic waste management.

“ More so, the theme was chosen to show love and appreciation for Mother Earth for loving and giving mankind all that we enjoy, indicating the reciprocal love we have for Mother Earth,” he explained.

Adding that, the company has a plan of ensuring that 100% of its packaging will be recycled as it has already started.

The Zimbabwe Netball Association didn't want to register the splinter league as a professional outfit because, according to their constitution, they run the professional league, which is the Super league.

However, the Super League is no longer in existence after all the clubs, except Harare City Netball Queens, defected to the functional RANL which has better sponsorship from Glow Petroleum.

""According to our papers we will be registered as amateur. If the general council see the need to change the name, then a decision will be made to approach the relevant offices,"" said Gukurume.

But RANL, which held their annual meeting on Saturday, are optimistic of a good season this year which will commence on February 29.

""We resolved that we engage agencies that can assist us in carrying out random doping so that we run a clean sport,"" said Gukurume.

During the annual indaba, which reviewed last season and the progress made so far ahead of the new season, a sports consultant, Brian Moyo, helped shape the RANL brand into a business model. Some clubs struggled to fulfil fixtures due to transport challenges but the league believe they have addressed the problem

On their failure to get recognition from ZINA, Gukurume said they were closely monitoring the situation.

(CNN) — Right now, almost 780 million people live without access to clean water, and more than 2.5 billion need improved sanitation. That’s according to the World Health Organization. March 22 is World Water Day, an annual UN observance spotlighting something so basic — and yet so scarce for so many. There are some simple things you can do at home that can help care for the global water supply.

Support organizations making an impact

Here are organizations you can support that are making a difference where water is insufficient around the world:

WaterAid promotes clean water, reliable toilets and good hygiene. Through logistical, educational and policy work, the organization has provided more than 26 million people with clean water and reliable toilets since 1981.

Charity: Water has a unique approach to investing in their water projects. This non profit organization works with local partners to implement sustainable, community-led water projects whose donors are always connected to their impact

Water.org focuses on providing funding so communities can maintain access to clean water and sanitation. The nonprofit organization was founded by actor Matt Damon and engineer Gary White.

Keep water clean

It starts at home, and it’s not just about the water coming out of the tap; it’s also about the water sent down the drain or into the ground. Here are some ways to help keep water clean.

• Never flush expired or unwanted medicine down the toilet or drain

• Fix any leaks from cars and collect oil by putting liner on driveway

• Pick up after your pets to prevent waste entering drains, spreading bacteria

Conserve at home

It’s an easy concept to understand: Don’t waste water. But just because it’s simple doesn’t mean people do it. Using water more efficiently in daily life can go a long way.

• Turn off faucets when not in use

• Shorten the length of showers

• Use low-flow toilets

• Water plants by hand rather than hose

But what if you don’t have access to clean water?

Over the past 40 years, many nations have made great progress in treating wastewater, providing residents with clean drinking water and enhancing water supplies to grow needed food and fiber. But as a researcher focusing on water resources management and policy, I know there is still far to go.

More than 40% of the world’s population lives in regions where water is becoming increasingly scarce, and that figure is likely to rise. Every day, nearly 1,000 children die from preventable water- and sanitation-related diseases.

Life without clean water

Water use has increased worldwide by about 1% annually since the 1980s, driven by population growth, economic development and changing consumption patterns. At the same time, water supplies are increasingly threatened by climate change, overuse and pollution.

For example, in 2019 residents of Chennai, India, had to queue up for water delivered by tanker trucks because the city’s reservoirs were empty. Persistent drought, worsened by climate change, had virtually exhausted local supplies. The city, which is home to 7 million people, still faces severe shortages, and may exhaust its available groundwater within a few years.

In rural Mexico, some 5 million people lack access to clean water. Women and children are tasked with collecting water, taking time that could be spent in school or on political engagement. Meanwhile, men decide how water rights are allocated.

Residents of Flint, Michigan, whose trust in the safety of their drinking water has been gradually restored after a notorious case of lead contamination, were advised in August 2019 to boil water as a precaution against impurities after a pipeline rupture reduced pressure in the city’s water lines. The advisory ended after sampling indicated that there was no danger of contamination, but the city is still replacing lead and galvanized steel water delivery pipes to prevent further lead exposure.

Today, with coronavirus present on every continent except Antarctica, washing hands is a difficult challenge in many developing countries. Clean water and soap are often in short supply, and many slum dwellers live in homes without running water.

Systems under stress

According to the United Nations, rising demand for water in the industrial, domestic and agricultural sectors signals that people are starting to live better, thanks to progress in harnessing fresh water for growing food and fiber and for public consumption. However, experts note three areas where progress is lagging.

First, more than 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. These problems are directly attributable to rising water demands and the intensifying effects of climate change. They also worsen mistreatment of women, who bear much of the burden of providing scarce water to families.

Second, while many countries are spending money on improving access to water – often by privatizing supplies, which enriches global engineering firms that build infrastructure – access to clean water remains inadequate. Nearly 800 million people worldwide lack updated sanitation. In many instances primitive latrines release human wastes directly to the environment, contaminating streams and rivers. Worldwide, over 80% of wastewater from human activities remains untreated.

Third, in every country water infrastructure is deteriorating, and people are disposing of drugs, personal care products and other common household goods into public water systems. These combined trends add persistent, hard-to-treat contaminants to water supplies and threaten public health worldwide.

Water as a leadership test

These problems are daunting, but progress is possible if water agencies and government officials engage the public, heed evidence-based advice from experts and exercise political leadership.

As a first step, governments need to focus on long-term planning and coordinated responses. The problems facing Chennai, rural Mexico, Flint and countless other places usually generate early warning signs, which public officials often ignore due to a lack of political will or sense of urgency.

In Cape Town, South Africa, where residents faced a water shortage in 2017 similar to Chennai’s, it had been clear for years that the city’s water infrastructure could not handle growing demands. A government-sponsored study published in 1998 had recommended building a wastewater reuse plant as a hedge against future drought, but the plant was never constructed. Flint’s water crisis escalated over some 18 months while public officials closed their ears to residents’ frequent complaints about the smell and taste of their water.

The good news is that many large cities, including Los Angeles and Sao Paulo, Brazil, have begun to heed climate change warning signs. In response, public officials are initiating innovative water alternatives that conserve water, reuse wastewater and harvest rainwater.

Second, it is important to recognize water problems as environmental justice challenges. The U.N.‘s International Hydrological Program now promotes water equity, recognizing that the burdens of protracted drought, water stress and contaminated supplies fall disproportionately on women, the very young, the frail and destitute, and oppressed indigenous minorities, who often are forced to migrate elsewhere when conditions become intolerable. Here in the United States, cities and states are pledging not to cut off water supplies to households that fail to pay their bills during the coronavirus crisis.

Finally, I believe that building or restoring public trust is critical for addressing these problems. The experience of cities that have weathered drought, such as Melbourne, Australia, shows that governments need to weigh and address community concerns, and to foster trust and confidence in the agencies charged with implementing solutions. In my view, the best way to build that kind of trust is by courageously meeting today’s water crises head-on.

A natural resource that covers 71% of the Earth’s surface and makes up to 60% of our bodies, water contributes to life around the world, including providing food, income, and wellbeing. Yet, the global water crisis is commonly misunderstood! This World Water Day, Food for the Hungry experts in water, sanitation, and health (WASH) have joined together to help you dispel some common myths about clean water, and give you a better understanding of the work we do with water around the world.

1. Myth: People who drink dirty water are already immune to its effects.

FALSE. Water can be contaminated by a wide variety of disease-causing microbial agents including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms. While the human body can become resistant to some of these agents, many of them will overwhelm anyone’s immune system. Whether you live in the United States, Argentina, Nairobi, or Cape Town, you’re susceptible. Just 100 years ago before the advent of water treatment systems, outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever, and other serious waterborne diseases regularly occurred throughout North America and Europe. This made hundreds of thousands of people, sick and sometimes killed tens of thousands of people. Children are even more vulnerable. Unfortunately, regular exposure to dirty water did nothing to prevent the spread of these deadly diseases. Parasites and diarrheal diseases rob young bodies of important nutrients and impede physical and cognitive development with effects that last a lifetime.

2. Myth: In poor countries, it is the lack of water that kills you.

NOT ALWAYS TRUE. Many waterborne diseases are not due to a lack of water, but due to the consumption of unsafe water. This predicament is not limited to poor countries. Many countries, including the United States, must continue to work to ensure the drinking water supply is uncontaminated. Contaminated water sources cause diarrhea. Diarrhea then causes dehydration to varying degrees. Cholera, a waterborne disease caused by human water contamination containing the vibrio bacteria, is the extreme case where the body massively and quickly dehydrates, often leading to death.

3. Myth: Any water is better than no water.

FALSE. The Millennium Development Goals aimed to ensure that everyone had access to an improved water source. At the time, “improved” meant that the source was protected but not necessarily free of contamination. For instance, a nearby spring could be cleaner than a downstream river where others wash their animals or clothes, but still contaminated with disease. As a result, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals now aim to ensure that everyone has access to an improved and safe water source. As mentioned above, it’s not just about access to water but sustainable access to clean water.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, households in three administrative groupings have long not been able to access the 914 hectares of land in the Nyalugana valley. FH undertook an effort to drain the swamp and install canals throughout the valley to adequately channel water to prevent further flooding of the plain. Approximately 13,000 households gained access to land after the completion of this project, making it one of the largest land reclamation efforts in the area ever undertaken!

4. Myth: If people tried harder, they’d be able to find water.

FALSE. We think of the earth as a water-rich environment and we are conditioned to think so by being able to turn on our taps and getting as much as we need at any time. Unfortunately, the truth is that fresh water is a rare resource across much of the earth. In fact, 785 million people worldwide lack access to an improved water source. In many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the water collection process spans hours. Usually, girls and women bear the brunt of walking miles to the next clean water source. On average, they walk 3.7 miles every day to fetch water! In turn, this has a direct effect on their ability to attend and remain in school and engage in income-generating work.

5. Myth: Water is free in poor countries.

JUST THE OPPOSITE! Due to the scarcity of fresh, safe water, especially in impoverished countries, the cost of water is much higher as a percentage of income. Because building water systems for free is an unsustainable solution, internal and external actors like FH work with local engineers, local water management committees, and local leaders (including women!) to ensure that functioning water systems are easily accessed by those who need it the most—and people are charged a fair price for the service.

6. Myth: People shouldn’t live in places where there is not enough water to support them.

UNREALISTIC. Personal mobility is not a luxury that everyone has. Often, many people are forced to live in places where there are diminishing resources have diminished because they can’t go anywhere else. Even in the United States, we don’t always intentionally move to clean water sources when we think about moving to a new city. Ultimately, fresh, accessible water is a rare resource. It’s a myth that people can simply identify and move to where there is fresh, clean water. Water availability and accessibility can also shift dramatically over time, even short periods of time.

7. Myth: Having clean water is more important in preventing waterborne diseases than having sanitation facilities and good hygiene practices.

FALSE. Most waterborne diseases are caused by the ingestion of fecal waste, with human waste by far being the most dangerous. Drinking clean water is one way to break the transmission route but there are several other ways that waste can be transmitted and ingested. Clean water and sanitation go hand in hand. Even the simple act of teaching handwashing can go a long way in reducing disease.

8. Myth: Rainwater is safe to drink because it hasn’t been contaminated yet.

FALSE. According to the Centers for Disease Control, rainwater is not as pure as we assume it is. Rainwater can carry varying contaminants from the surfaces on which it lands. In fact, rainwater can carry bacteria, parasites, viruses, and chemicals that make humans sick. It has even led to disease outbreaks such as cholera after certain humanitarian disasters. In many countries where FH works, households use rainwater for day to day activities, including farm activities and animal husbandry.

The Rajput family could opt for something more basic — soap and water — to achieve hand hygiene. But sometimes there is no clean running water in their neighborhood, which sits next to open sewage canals and mounds of garbage in the heart of New Delhi, India's capital. ""The kind of water we have access to has the potential to cause more diseases instead of warding off the virus if we use it to wash our hands,"" Rajput said.



Experts say keeping hands clean is one of the easiest and best ways to prevent transmission of the new coronavirus, in addition to social distancing. But for India's homeless and urban poor who live in thousands of slums across major cities and towns, maintaining good hygiene can be nearly impossible.



About 160 million — more than the population of Russia — of India's 1.3 billion people don't have access to clean water.



That could leave impoverished Indians like Rajput and his family at risk during the virus outbreak.

""It could prove disastrous for people who don't have access to clean water,"" said Samrat Basak, the director of the World Resource Institute's Urban Water Program in India.

With India being the world's second-most populous country, and having weak health care facilities and growing concerns that there may be an undetected communal spread of the virus, the risks associated with the lack of clean water aren't being overstated. UNICEF said last week that almost 20% of urban Indians do not have facilities with water and soap at home. What could make things worse, experts say, is that social distancing is nearly impossible in many Indian cities that are among the world's most densely populated areas.

So far, the government has apparently been able to keep a lid on community transmission of the virus. Authorities have confirmed 147 cases and three deaths, all linked to foreign travel or direct contact with someone who caught the disease abroad.



While the coronavirus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and people with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover.



India's government has made fervent appeals to the public to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. India also was one of the first countries to essentially shut its borders and deny entry to all but a select few foreigners. But in a country as big as India, community transmission is all but inevitable, experts say.



""Clean water is the first line of defense,"" said V.K. Madhavan, India chief executive at WaterAid, a global advocacy group for water and sanitation. ""If there is no access to clean water, the situation could worsen.""



India's clean water problem isn't new.



Hundreds of thousands of people wait in line every day to fill buckets from government water trucks. Hospitals and schools struggle with clean water supplies. People are forced to wash utensils and clothes in dirty water.



About 600 million Indians face acute water shortages, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.



The water crisis hits the poor particularly hard since wealthy people can pay for water from private sources that those living in slums can't afford.



The mortality rate due to inadequate or unsafe water is also high. About 200,000 people die each year in India from diseases related to unclean water. Insufficient water also leads to food insecurity.

""When clean drinking water runs out, people will have no choice but to rely on unsafe water,"" said Dr. Anant Bhan, a global health researcher. ""It could expose India's huge population to extreme vulnerability.""



Government promises to provide clean water to many Indians have so far failed despite efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have been internationally lauded.

""Access to clean water is a basic human right,"" said Madhavan. ""No one should fear losing their life because they couldn't practice the first line of defense, which is hand washing.","About 160 million — more than the population of Russia — of India's 1.3 billion people don't have access to clean water.

The city, which is home to 7 million people, still faces severe shortages, and may exhaust its available groundwater within a few years.

In rural Mexico, some 5 million people lack access to clean water. Women and children are tasked with collecting water, taking time that could be spent in school or on political engagement. Meanwhile, men decide how water rights are allocated.

Residents of Flint, Michigan, whose trust in the safety of their drinking water has been gradually restored after a notorious case of lead contamination, were advised in August 2019 to boil water as a precaution against impurities after a pipeline rupture reduced pressure in the city’s water lines. The advisory ended after sampling indicated that there was no danger of contamination, but the city is still replacing lead and galvanized steel water delivery pipes to prevent further lead exposure.

Today, with coronavirus present on every continent except Antarctica, washing hands is a difficult challenge in many developing countries. Clean water and soap are often in short supply, and many slum dwellers live in homes without running water.

According to the United Nations, rising demand for water in the industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors signals that people are starting to live better, thanks to progress in harnessing fresh water for growing food and fiber and for public consumption. However, experts note three areas where progress is lagging.

First, more than 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. These problems are directly attributable to rising water demands and the intensifying effects of climate change. They also worsen mistreatment of women, who bear much of the burden of providing scarce water to families.

Second, while many countries are spending money on improving access to water — often by privatizing supplies, which enriches global engineering firms that build infrastructure — access to clean water remains inadequate. Nearly 800 million people worldwide lack updated sanitation. In many instances primitive latrines release human wastes directly to the environment, contaminating streams and rivers. Worldwide, over 80 percent of wastewater from human activities remains untreated.

Third, in every country water infrastructure is deteriorating, and people are disposing of drugs, personal care products, and other common household goods into public water systems. These combined trends add persistent, hard-to-treat contaminants to water supplies and threaten public health worldwide.

These problems are daunting, but progress is possible if water agencies and government officials engage the public, heed evidence-based advice from experts, and exercise political leadership.

As a first step, governments need to focus on long-term planning and coordinated responses. The problems facing Chennai, rural Mexico, Flint, and countless other places usually generate early warning signs, which public officials often ignore due to a lack of political will or sense of urgency.

In Cape Town, South Africa, where residents faced a water shortage in 2017 similar to Chennai’s, it had been clear for years that the city’s water infrastructure could not handle growing demands. A government-sponsored study published in 1998 had recommended building a wastewater reuse plant as a hedge against future drought, but the plant was never constructed. Flint’s water crisis escalated over some 18 months while public officials closed their ears to residents’ frequent complaints about the smell and taste of their water.

Progress is possible if water agencies and government officials engage the public, heed evidence-based advice from experts, and exercise political leadership.

The good news is that many large cities, including Los Angeles and Sao Paulo, Brazil, have begun to heed climate change warning signs. In response, public officials are initiating innovative water alternatives that conserve water, reuse wastewater, and harvest rainwater.

Second, it is important to recognize water problems as environmental justice challenges. The U.N.‘s International Hydrological Program now promotes water equity, recognizing that the burdens of protracted drought, water stress, and contaminated supplies fall disproportionately on women, the very young, the frail and destitute, and oppressed indigenous minorities, who often are forced to migrate elsewhere when conditions become intolerable. Here in the United States, cities, and states are pledging not to cut off water supplies to households that fail to pay their bills during the coronavirus crisis.

Finally, I believe that building or restoring public trust is critical for addressing these problems. The experience of cities that have weathered drought, such as Melbourne, Australia, shows that governments need to weigh and address community concerns, and to foster trust and confidence in the agencies charged with implementing solutions. In my view, the best way to build that kind of trust is by courageously meeting today’s water crises head-on.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Dharam Singh Rajput can’t afford to buy hand sanitizer, which could help ward off transmission of the coronavirus in his community.

The Rajput family could opt for something more basic — soap and water — to achieve hand hygiene. But sometimes there is no clean running water in their neighborhood, which sits next to open sewage canals and mounds of garbage in the heart of New Delhi, India’s capital. “The kind of water we have access to has the potential to cause more diseases instead of warding off the virus if we use it to wash our hands,” Rajput said.

Experts say keeping hands clean is one of the easiest and best ways to prevent transmission of the new coronavirus, in addition to social distancing. But for India’s homeless and urban poor who live in thousands of slums across major cities and towns, maintaining good hygiene can be nearly impossible.

About 160 million — more than the population of Russia — of India’s 1.3 billion people don’t have access to clean water.

That could leave impoverished Indians like Rajput and his family at risk during the virus outbreak.

“It could prove disastrous for people who don’t have access to clean water,” said Samrat Basak, the director of the World Resource Institute’s Urban Water Program in India. With India being the world’s second-most populous country, and having weak health care facilities and growing concerns that there may be an undetected communal spread of the virus , the risks associated with the lack of clean water aren’t being overstated. UNICEF said last week that almost 20% of urban Indians do not have facilities with water and soap at home. What could make things worse, experts say, is that social distancing is nearly impossible in many Indian cities that are among the world’s most densely populated areas. So far, the government has apparently been able to keep a lid on community transmission of the virus. Authorities have confirmed 147 cases and three deaths, all linked to foreign travel or direct contact with someone who caught the disease abroad.

While the coronavirus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and people with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover.

India’s government has made fervent appeals to the public to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. India also was one of the first countries to essentially shut its borders and deny entry to all but a select few foreigners. But in a country as big as India, community transmission is all but inevitable, experts say.

“Clean water is the first line of defense,” said V.K. Madhavan, India chief executive at WaterAid, a global advocacy group for water and sanitation. “If there is no access to clean water, the situation could worsen.”

India’s clean water problem isn’t new.

Hundreds of thousands of people wait in line every day to fill buckets from government water trucks. Hospitals and schools struggle with clean water supplies. People are forced to wash utensils and clothes in dirty water.

About 600 million Indians face acute water shortages, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.

The water crisis hits the poor particularly hard since wealthy people can pay for water from private sources that those living in slums can’t afford.

The mortality rate due to inadequate or unsafe water is also high. About 200,000 people die each year in India from diseases related to unclean water. Insufficient water also leads to food insecurity.

Full Coverage: Virus Outbreak

“When clean drinking water runs out, people will have no choice but to rely on unsafe water,” said Dr. Anant Bhan, a global health researcher. “It could expose India’s huge population to extreme vulnerability.”

Government promises to provide clean water to many Indians have so far failed despite efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have been internationally lauded.

“Access to clean water is a basic human right,” said Madhavan. “No one should fear losing their life because they couldn’t practice the first line of defense, which is hand washing.” ___ Associated Press journalist Shonal Ganguly contributed to this report.

The article has been edited to address health and safety concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2014, amid the Ebola outbreak, doctors and nurses did not have reliable, accessible safe water in places like Liberia. The same is true now for medical professionals in developing countries. Many of them are caring for the sick in under-resourced and overrun healthcare facilities amid an unprecedented health crisis. In areas reported to be affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), doctors and nurses lack reliable, accessible safe water.

To aid them in their life-saving work, Water Mission is equipped and positioned to assist doctors and nurses by:

ensuring they have water that is treated (with chlorine) and safe for drinking, handwashing, and disinfecting;

encouraging medical staff to store and transport water in a manner that prevents recontamination; and

promoting coronavirus-specific hygiene information amongst medical staff, patients, and community members.

What We Learned from the Ebola Outbreak

In 2014, at the height of the Ebola epidemic, Water Mission began partnering with UNICEF to provide safe water treatment systems to hospitals, healthcare centers, and Ebola treatment units in Liberia.

The J.J. Dossan Memorial Hospital, which served more than 150 patients a day, was a tragic example of the way that patients and staff at under-resourced healthcare facilities around the world suffer from the lack of safe water.

“Patients or family members had to leave the hospital and retrieve dirty water at their homes or from a distant borehole,” Dr. Obiazi Francis, a general physician at the hospital, told us. “We had very little water and the storage tanks were moldy and unclean — so we couldn’t use them for cooking or drinking, let alone patient care. We were extremely limited in the [medical] treatment that we could really provide.”

A 2015 World Health Organization and UNICEF study on 54 low- and middle-income countries found that 38% of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in healthcare settings were unimproved, or lacked water source protected from outside contamination. Of the 62% with improved water sources, water samples collected from the sites still tested positive for fecal contamination.

This lack of safe water created a dangerous environment for patients susceptible to additional infections spread by contaminated drinking water, unsterilized instruments, and limited handwashing facilities. According to a study published in The Lancet, healthcare-associated infection is the most frequent result of unsafe patient care worldwide. As these studies illustrate, poor water quality in healthcare facilities can negatively impact the health of sick patients and increase the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.

What We Can Do to Combat the Coronavirus

In this unprecedented global health crisis, we cannot take risks, especially as we collectively try to protect the most vulnerable among us: the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

The good news is that simple water treatment solutions are available and can be incorporated into healthcare facility water supplies. Water Mission uses several safe water solutions, such as the Potable Water Chlorinator, that can treat water with chlorine. This treated water can then be used to:

eliminate the risk of most life-threatening waterborne diseases;

maintain hygienic conditions of facilities; and

help stop the spread of the coronavirus through frequent handwashing, an important way to prevent infection and fight COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

But water treatment solutions such as the Potable Water Chlorinator are only as effective as the systems set to routinely test and monitor water quality. Water quality testing can be done with simple, low-cost products, which can easily be obtained and conducted by healthcare facility staff after some basic training. This training allows healthcare providers to test their own water and ensure it continues to be safe to consume and use.

During the Ebola outbreak, we partnered with healthcare workers and provided them with safe water, allowing them to care for and protect 19,500 patients, minimizing further infections. Today, we can have this same, if not increased, effect on the global effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

“Now, all of the wards have abundant water for all of our needs. It’s changed our ability to serve and treat patients. We can actually bathe our newborns, properly cook our food with water, and offer a drink of water without fear of the patient getting sicker,” Dr. Francis told us after a safe water system was installed at his hospital in 2014.

In our response to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, we are providing safe water and hygiene solutions in healthcare settings. We are confident that with these resources, we can support doctors and nurses in caring for the sick, bringing health and hope amid so many uncertainties.

Join us in our global response to COVID-19.","In 2014, amid the Ebola outbreak, doctors and nurses did not have reliable, accessible safe water in places like Liberia.

But do our poor have adequate access to clean water for washing?

Around 1.9 billion people worldwide use non-potable, contaminated water. What does that do to our disease prevention strategies and measures?

New Delhi, March 21-22, 2020: “On the occasion of World Water Day, and at a time when the entire world is fighting with its backs to the wall against the coronavirus pandemic, we believe it is appropriate to ask a very pertinent question. Do we have enough access to clean and safe water, considering the fact that hand-washing has emerged as one of the most effective ways of controlling the spread of this virus?” says Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hand-washing – in addition to social distancing -- is the easiest and most effective way of preventing transmission of the new virus. In India, a campaign has been kick-started on the subject, with celebrities roped in to increase awareness on washing hands.

But there remain genuine concerns that nations in the Global South – consisting of low and middle-income countries in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, including India – may not have adequate access to clean water necessary for hand-washing.

A 2014 WHO report – Preventing Diarrhoea through Better Water, Sanitation and Hygiene -- says around 1.9 billion people in the world use non-potable or faecally-contaminated water for drinking, cleaning and other related activities. As per the Indian government’s own submission in the Lok Sabha in 2018, diarrhoea is the leading killer among water-borne diseases, causing about 60 per cent of all deaths.

Hand-washing using clean water and soap, therefore, is a critical preventive measure in the current scenario. CSE has analysed what this means in the Indian context. According to Suresh Rohilla, senior director-water and wastewater management, CSE: “Going by the WHO’s prescribed measures, to get a germs-free hand, a person takes 30-40 seconds for one proper hand-wash, using approximately 4 litres of water with the tap flowing consistently (and 2 litres when the tap closed while scrubbing and rinsing). Assuming each person in these days of COVID-19 needs to wash hands at least 10 times in a day, a family of five would need 100-200 litres every day just for hand-washing!”

And, even assuming that one does not leave the tap running when one rubs hands with soap, the water consumption will be high, but necessary.

Adds Narain: “There is another concern – the increased use of water will naturally lead to generation of more wastewater. Keeping in mind the fact that 85-90 per cent of all water used in a household gets discharged as wastewater, the more water we use, the more sewage we discharge. This, when we know that the bulk of wastewater is not intercepted, nor treated or cleaned. This means that we are adding to the pollution challenge of our waterbodies. It will mean higher cost to clean this water for drinking and it will mean more dirty water, which in turn, means more bad health.”

But this is why we must make the connection on this World Water Day – access to clean water is our fundamental right, says Narain. The good news is that water is a replenishable resource. We need to harvest every drop of water, recharge groundwater, protect waterbodies and then also ensure that every litre of wastewater is treated and cleaned. “We must ensure that we return water – and not waste -- to our rivers,” says Narain.

According to Narain, this decade is our make-or-break decade – on one hand, we will see the revenge of nature as climate change impacts get aggravated, which means more variable rainfall and more droughts and floods. On the other hand, we will have more water scarcity and more pollution if we do not get our water management right, which in turn will add to economic distress and livelihood insecurity.

“But we can get it right. This is what we must remember,” says Narain. “We need to be water wise; changing diets so that crops we eat are water-prudent; and invest in water efficiency in homes, factories and fields. Today, we know what to do and now we must make the management of this resource our single biggest obsession.”

Narain points out that the coronavirus pandemic teaches us that we are as weak as the weakest link in the chain – the contagion needs us to ensure that everybody has access to public health so that nobody is left out and nobody can be the carrier of the virus. “Providing access to clean water is the biggest preventive health measure we can take – and this is why, on World Water Day 2020, we must make this connection. For all our sakes,” she adds.

The theme for 2020 is “Water and climate change”, and how the two are inextricably linked. The official functions that mark such days — the release of reports, speeches by experts and people-centric activities — will be muted this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Nevertheless, there isn’t a more appropriate time to underline the importance of water and its availability because there is a link between bad public hygiene and the spread of diseases. First, to avoid the spread of diseases, India has to ensure clean and adequate water for all. Second, there’s an express need to invest more in water conservation efforts to ensure long-term availability of the resource, given its indiscriminate use and the larger context of the climate crisis. And, third, the State and citizens must continue with the current push to improve general cleanliness and hand-washing even after the current coronavirus outbreak subsides. And for that, citizens will need an assured supply of not just water, but good quality water.

The scale of the water challenge, however, is humongous. A 2017 World Bank report said about 160 million of the country’s 1.3 billion people don’t have access to clean water and that 21% of communicable diseases are linked to unsafe water and the lack of hygiene practices. The government’s think tank, NITI Aayog, says 600 million Indians face acute water shortages. Even India’s public health infrastructure, which probably is the first port of call for the poor, often lacks adequate water and sanitation facilities. Barely 18% of rural households have access to piped water. Last year, the Centre said that at least 189.7 million rural habitations are getting less than 40 litres per capita per day, which is the norm while implementing rural water supply schemes for providing potable water.

Or take hand-washing. As the number of coronavirus cases detected in India rises, health professionals have suggested frequent hand-washing as a precautionary measure. But getting people to do this may not be easy as many households across the country do not have adequate hand-washing facilities, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

The enumerators could find a designated place for washing hands in about 97% of households surveyed, but not all of them with adequate cleaning facilities. Water was not available in 14% of these households at the place where hands were washed. In urban areas, the share of such households was only 6% compared to 18% in rural areas. To be sure, among the households that had water, about 19% had no cleaning agent such as soap, ash, mud or sand.

The Centre has been focusing on water conservation and trying to ensure piped water to households under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). However, there is a question of resources. The allocation for JJM in the current financial year is ~11,500 crore, compared to ~10,000 crore last year.

The water challenge is only growing. Twenty-one Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad, will run out of groundwater by 2030, affecting 100 million people, says a NITI Aayog report. Many villages too face a severe water crisis, leading to a development crisis, and it is also forcing people to migrate.

As the coronavirus episode shows, India doesn’t have the luxury of time to tackle the related challenges. Since building mega water conservation and distribution projects take time and funds, it is imperative that the State increases its push for small-scale, decentralised efforts to ensure a safe and healthy life for every citizen.

The views expressed are personal","First, to avoid the spread of diseases, India has to ensure clean and adequate water for all.

In fact, much of the region is generally considered to suffer from what’s called “economic water scarcity,” which means that investments in water resources and relevant human capacity are not substantial enough to meet water demands in an area where the population does not have the financial means to make use of an adequate water source on its own.

According to the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Water scarcity or lack of safe drinking water is one of the world’s leading problems. This issue affects more than 1.1 billion people globally, meaning that one in every six people lacks access to clean and safe water.

Nevertheless, there is a solution for Africa; “Genesis Water Technologies combination of process engineering services, treatment systems, and specialized water treatment medias are a solution to clean water in Africa both for safe drinking and for the sustainable reuse of wastewater to combat the effects of water scarcity and climate change,” says Nick Nicholas Application Eng./Technical Director at Genesis Water Technologies, Inc.

The day provides an opportunity to advocate sustainable use and management of freshwater resources and focus attention on access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene.

Water, whose scientific name is hydrogen oxide, is an essential commodity to sustain life on earth, which is a unique planet in the solar system. From outer space the earth looks blue in colour which denotes the fact that water is the predominant component of our planet.

Unlike most countries in the world, Uganda has been blessed by God with abundant freshwater resources, including Lake Victoria, Lake Albert, Lake Kyoga, Lake George and River Nile, the longest river in the world.

I wish God could bless Uganda with decent, honest, incorruptible and selfless leaders of integrity who are committed to spearhead collective efforts of Ugandans geared towards making the best use of our beloved country’s God-given resources.

The decision to observe March 22 annually as World Water Day was proposed in Agenda 21 adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. World Water Day was observed for the first time in 1993.

The theme for this year’s World Water Day is: “Water and Climate Change” and how the two are inextricably linked, which is quite appropriate and timely because adapting to the water effects of climate change will protect health and save lives. In addition, using water more efficiently will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The United Nations has been involved for decades in addressing challenges and problems arising from increasing demand for water worldwide to meet domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural needs of billions of people and member states.

In this regard, the world organisation convened the United Nations Water Conference in 1977 at Mar del Plata, Argentina. United Nations member states, including Uganda, agreed in a plan of action adopted at the 1977 conference that “all peoples, whatever their stage of development and social and economic conditions, have the right to have access to drinking water in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs.”

According to the United Nations, “the human right to water is indispensable for leading a life of human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realisation of other human rights.”

How much has government of Uganda done to achieve the above objectives and goals which Uganda supported at UN conferences?

The UN General Assembly launched an “International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990) which focused attention on this critical resource for all human beings.

It is estimated that, as of today, 20 per cent of global population face water shortages and that figure is expected to rise to 30 per cent by 2025; most of the water deficient countries are found in the third world, especially in Africa and Asia.

The causes of water shortage include, inefficient use, degradation of water by pollution and over-exploitation of water reserves.

The UN system has played a leading role in efforts to achieve sustainable development of finite and fragile freshwater resources. FAO, for example, has promoted the efficient use and conservation of water resources in order to achieve food security.

Water is life

Although the Scripture teaches that human beings are made of dust, my nephew who is a renowned medical doctor tells me that almost 70 per cent of the human body consists of water which underscores the important role of water.

Against this background, Parliament should, in my opinion, urgently double or even treble the budgetary allocation to the line ministry of Water in order to ensure that every Ugandan enjoys the right to clean fresh water in sufficient quantities.

I would like to give credit to National Water and Sewerage Corporation for the commendable work done since NWSC was established by Gen Idi Amin in 1972, by Decree No 34, towards fulfilling its mission: “To sustainably and equitably provide cost-effective quality water and sewerage services to the delight of all stakeholders, while conserving the environment.”

A lot remains to be done, including reducing substantially the unit price of water, especially for domestic use. Most Ugandans cannot afford clean water supplied by NWSC. Water should, in my opinion, not be taxed because it’s a human right and a basic need of all Ugandans.

But upholding those standards was a pipe dream for some rural communities as they had no running water, said Dr Jo Barnes, a retired epidemiologist.

Barnes was critical of the government for not investing enough in water and sanitation facilities to such communities.

She said it frightened her that clean water, which provided a key line of defence against the virus, was inaccessible to many South Africans.

“Some people in rural areas are already suffering with other deadly diseases which makes them even more vulnerable to Covid-19.”

Barnes said water provision could not be done overnight, especially when the country was in the middle of a health crises. “It takes time. I think we have not done enough.”

Among the hard-hit areas were Ugu District on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, Zululand and uMkhanyakude Districts in the northern parts of the province. In those area, communities relied on tankers and boreholes for their supply of water.

Ntsiki Ntuli, a ward councillor for the Bhobhoyi area, on the outskirts of Port Shepstone, feared that the virus would spread faster once it got to their area.

For many years, water supply has been a challenge for this community. Poor infrastructure and a growing local population has compunded the problems.

“For now, we are trying our best to follow the instructions given by the minister about hygiene. Thus far, we have no reported cases of coronavirus infection, but we are worried about how we will contain it, once it arrives.”

Ntuli acknowledged the efforts by the district and provincial government, especially the more regular water tanker visits and the set-up of JoJo tanks as another water source for residents.

Sizwe Ngcobo, mayor of Ugu District, a water-scarce area, said they were expecting grants from national and provincial governments to plug their problems.

“We do have challenges, but with government assistance, we will soon announce our solutions.”

Mandlenkosi Vilakazi, an induna in Jozini (in the far north of KZN), hoped that the pandemic would spur the government to fast-track the development of basic services.

Vilakazi said they were already battling with health challenges such as malaria and diarrhoea.

The area boasts Jozini Dam and has several wildlife attractions. However, most communities have no access to running water.

“We heard on radio about the virus, and we were told to wash our hands often. But we think carefully before use water because it is very scarce.

“Maybe this pandemic will make the government realise that we also need water like other people.”

Vilakazi is doubtful about the quality of water they are able to collect at times from streams because those sources were also used by livestock and other animals.

Lungi Matshali, the spokesperson for the KZN Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, which handles national disaster issues, said financial resources had been released to prevent infection.

She said municipalities would apply emergency procurement procedures to ensure the delivery of essential services that may be required to contain the spread of the virus.

“Each municipality has its disaster contingency fund, which will be now used to provide required services.”

Matshali said funds from the National Treasury were also expected and they await an announcement from the minister.

“For now, all the municipalities have been given the approval to access their contingency funds,” she said.

The homeless and those living in slums have also been hit hard. Gurugram has had an abysmal record of public service delivery, especially of clean water and waste disposal. With everyone locked themselves at homes and advised to practise precautionary measures like washing hands and maintaining personal hygiene sanitation, lack of drinking water and waste management has made the prevailing situation even worse.The most vulnerable of all are those living in congested unauthorised colonies. Thousands of them have been denied the first line of defence — washing hands, waste disposal and sanitisation —to stem the spread of novel virus. The have-nots pose the risk of not only getting infected but also amplifying disease.According to the 2011 census, there are over 30,000 slums in the city. Many don’t even have metered water supply. Usually they manage their water needs with the help of tankers, but that supply chain has also been disrupted now.A look at the congested dirty lanes of Nathupur mandi, Naharpur Rupa, Ghasola, Khandsa among others is enough to suggest that the slums in these areas are potentially the hotbed for virus transmission at the community level. For instance, a resident of Nathupur mandi claimed that water is a luxury for them as they don’t have not been provided with the supply. They cough up a lot of money for drinking water sold by private packaged water distributers.“Many times, we go out without taking bath. Washing hands, that too so many times, is not just possible,” said a woman. The situation of homeless is even pathetic. Earlier, when shops and metro stations were open, they used to take water from these places and fulfill their minimal needs. Now, even that’s a challenge. For instance, many vagabonds and manual scavengers who live in makeshift shanties along Golf Course Extension Road are staring at troubled times.“I come from Kolkata and live with my family in a shanty. We clean the drains of the city but don’t have access to basic amenities. I want to go back home but even train services have been cancelled. We are scared,” said Gopal Das, a migrant from Kolkata, who said he cleans at least 10 sewage drains every month.","GURUGRAM: As the city went into a lockdown mode, several residential colonies are grappling with erratic supply of potable water and waste disposal mechanism.

The National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) said in a press release that challenges utilities face include falling revenue from declines in usage from commercial and industrial users, restoring service to delinquent ratepayers who cannot afford their bills and halting shut-offs for non-payment.

The public clean water sector is pushing Congress to include $12.5 billion in aid for these utilities as part of a future stimulus bill.

Water associations issue joint statement on coronavirus

“As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 response, the nation’s public clean water agencies are at the front lines of ensuring Americans have reliable, critical clean water services,” said Adam Krantz, NACWA’s chief executive officer. “Since the threat of the pandemic emerged, utilities have been reviewing and implementing their emergency plans to ensure continuity of operations.

“Utilities around the country are also suspending water shut-offs and restoring connections for water and wastewater service to delinquent accounts, accepting a financial loss in restoring those accounts because of the critical role sanitation plays in getting a handle on the coronavirus.

“At the same time, utilities are prioritizing keeping their workforce – many of which are essential positions that cannot be performed remotely – safe and protected. And, they are working to ensure they have the resources in place to continue operating for however long the pandemic may last.”

Krantz added that the impact of coronavirus for clean water agencies will be “enormous.”

Strains on utilities include lost revenue from households less able to pay their bills, and from the sudden drop-off in industrial and business water demand. NACWA said it conservatively estimates the impact to clean water utilities nationwide of lost revenues due to coronavirus at $12.5 billion. This is a low-end estimate, NACWA said, assuming an average loss of revenue of 20 percent which is well within the range of what individual utilities are already projecting.

Some utilities are anticipating closer to a 30 or 40 percent loss in revenue. This estimate is based on the substantial historical utility financial data NACWA has on file through its Financial Survey and recent reports from NACWA members on the decrease in usage they are observing in their systems over the last few weeks.

EPA: Tap water safe to drink amid coronavirus outbreak

Another major strain will be the cost of writing off customer debt owed to the utility and reinstating service. NACWA said without federal assistance, the loss of revenue from forgiving customer debts and providing services without payment during the pandemic will ultimately be passed on to water customers in subsequent years and lead to future rate increases.

NACWA said it estimates the impact to clean water utilities nationwide of forgiving outstanding customer debt and ensuring all households retain clean water services at $336 million. This is a conservative estimate, based on normal-year levels of arrears on clean water agency books. A single utility member anticipates a $65 million loss in revenue for the year if they don’t use shutoffs, underscoring the potential impact to individual communities. NACWA added that these costs come in addition to emergency operational costs that utilities will undoubtedly incur throughout the duration of the pandemic.

“Clean water agencies provide life-sustaining services that protect public health and will work through this crisis alongside other first responders in our communities,” Krantz said. “Utilities are closely tracking CDC and EPA guidance, and current disinfection conditions in treatment plants are expected to be sufficient to protect public health. Federal assistance targeted to addressing the burden on ratepayers and making utilities whole for doing their part to ease the pandemic – maintaining and restoring access to services – is critically needed at this time.”","While Congress debated the specifics of a major stimulus package last week, public clean water utilities continue to provide essential water services to their communities around the country despite the financial uncertainties.

Accra, Sunday 22 March 2020 “The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the LORD will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them” Isaiah 41: 17 (NIV). The global need Access to clean water, dignified sanitation and appropriate hygiene are fundamental to socioeconomic development and the well-being of vulnerable children, their families, and communities. Unfortunately, one in three people in the world lives in a country with limited access to clean water.

It is estimated that by 2030, nearly half the global population could experience water scarcity, with demand outstripping supply by about 40 percent. The water situation in Ghana While we recognize the government’s effort at increasing access to this precious resource, we note with dissatisfaction that, over 6 million people in Ghana still lack access to safe water. Women and children still travel long distances in search of non-existent clean water, while many schools and healthcare facilities lack sustainable access to clean water and dignified sanitation.

This has negative implications for maternal and child health, learning, nutritional outcomes, productivity and the general well-being of children and their families. World Vision For believers in a better world for children, World Vision lives and works with communities to co-create solutions that last. We believe that nothing can be more important to child wellbeing than access to safe water.

This is why we have made substantial investments in people and equipment to become the largest non-governmental provider of clean water in the developing world, reaching a new person with safe water every 10 seconds.

Our call to Action On the occasion of World Water Day 2020, World Vision joins practitioners in safe water delivery and indeed all Ghanaians, in calling on the Government of Ghana to do the following:

 Prioritize and increase investments towards universal access to safe water We are concerned that the current levels of investment in safe water does not match the ever-increasing demand, and if current trends continue, we may not address the shortfall anytime soon.

It is worrying that at a time Ghanaians needed water the most to practice appropriate handwashing as a means to combat the spread of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, there are widespread water shortages across the country resulting in acute rationing.

We urge all Ghanaians to make judicious use of water at this time, ensure strict self-discipline, adhere to prescribed social distancing and practice enhanced hygiene (handwashing with soap under running water, use of alcohol-based sanitizers, avoiding handshakes and all forms of body contact) as a preventive measure to contain the disease.

 Take immediate steps to address water quality challenges The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2017/18) indicates that close to eight in every ten households had E-coli (faecal contamination) in their drinking water, while close to half of the water sources were affected.

While the microbial contamination remains a major area of concern, a recent study conducted in collaboration with the University of North Carolina also reveals the importance of enhanced focus on trace metal contamination of boreholes. The National Drinking Water Quality Framework (NDWQF) and Water Safety Planning need to be fully implemented to assure citizens of their health and safety.

 Address the regional disparities in access to safe water, paying special attention to areas with access below the national average It is quite problematic that while access to basic drinking water in Greater Accra is 98%, it is only 50% in Northern Region (MICS 2017/18). The Upper East, Upper West, Western and Eastern Regions are also below the national average in terms of access to safe water.

 Bridge the inequalities in basic water access There is a clear wealth disparity in basic water access, with the wealthy nearly twice as likely to have access than the poor. Additionally, urban dwellers are more likely to have basic access than those in rural areas (MICS 2017/18).

 Arrest the effects of climate change and the wanton pollution of water bodies on sustainable access to safe drinking water Government should have the will to take bold and decisive steps to ensure that we win the fight against illegal mining (Galamsey) in order to preserve our sources of water and promote increased access.

Our Pledge

World Vision Ghana is committed to prioritizing, increasing investments and partnering with Government, Development Partners, private sector, NGOs and other stakeholders to ensure that every child everywhere and their families have access to clean water. Our vision for every child, life in all its fullness; our prayer for every heart, the will to make it so.","Unfortunately, one in three people in the world lives in a country with limited access to clean water.

“You seen that one with the tombstone up there?” seven-year-old Timothy Easterling asks, looking toward the grass just uphill from his home. “That’s my papaw.”

Timothy’s grandfather Chet Blankenship died in 2016, at age 69. Blankenship lived on land he and his family have long owned at the end of a road atop Bradshaw Mountain in McDowell County, West Virginia. His hand-painted tombstone sits in the grassy patch above the family homes.

Blankenship’s daughter Melissa Easterling now lives in the house next door with her husband, Chauncy Easterling, who grew up on a nearby ridge. They live together with their son Timothy, and usually one or two foster children.

Chet Blankenship died from kidney failure soon after his family started noticing odd colors and smells in their well water. After he died, they got their water tested, and learned that arsenic was among the contaminants that had seeped into their well. The National Institutes of Health links high arsenic exposure to a range of kidney diseases.

The family can’t prove that the arsenic in the water caused Blankenship’s death, and they can’t get firm answers about the contamination in their well and the mining and drilling activity that surrounds their property. But Timothy’s memories of his grandfather reflect the family’s anxiety about the water they depend on.

“One time Chet used it and then he got so sick he just gave up and died, didn’t he?” he asked his mother.

Melissa gently corrected him. “Honey, he didn’t give up. It just — he had to go.”

Timothy thought for a moment, then quietly chimed back in, “He used to be my papaw.”

The Easterlings live in the central Appalachian coalfields and much of the land has been mined for miles in every direction. Water runs through the collapsed network of former mines, which may house industrial waste, as well as byproducts from the gas wells that tapped into the methane associated with coal seams.

There are many possible sources of contamination but the family doesn’t know which company might be to blame, or how to hold one accountable to fix the problem, or at least pay for them to get connected to a clean water system. State environmental officials deny there is any evidence connecting the bad water to the mining or drilling nearby. Adding to the family’s frustration, they’ve been asking for a connection to the nearby public water system for years, only to hear that there’s not enough money.

For decades, public water systems in the US have been consistently underfunded, affecting both water access and water quality. EPA records show that in Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia alone; there have been more than 130,000 violations reported in the last twenty years. At least 2,000 systems have tested positive for contaminants since 2012. Those statistics only cover people connected to public water systems.

Nationwide, another thirteen million people draw from private wells, and two million people don’t have a reliable source of running water. In areas affected by extraction industry, such as McDowell County, many wells and springs that rural residents are used to relying on are now running dry or showing unsafe levels of contaminants like arsenic and lead.

Struggling for Water

When their water issues started, Chauncy and Melissa contacted the county health department to get their water tested. On seeing the family’s dark brown water, the department referred the family to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection for more advanced testing. The family also had testing done by Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that has been drawing attention to people living with contaminated water. Those tests revealed unsafe levels of arsenic and lead, among other contaminants.

Chauncy and Melissa, together with Willie Dodson of Appalachian Voices, also tested water sources within a few miles of their house. They say they’re yet to find a water source that they trust. The most alarming reading came at a gas well that was drilled into a shallow section of a giant underground mine. It sits right beside the creek that’s below the Easterlings’ home.

That sample showed levels of lead and arsenic even higher than what had shown up in the Easterlings’ well water, along with other contaminants.

Just downstream from that sample site, water from the mine had broken out of the hillside and was flowing into the creek with an oily sheen that left the creek a dingy shade of orange.

More rounds of testing followed, including by scientists from Virginia Tech. The Easterlings say one official told them he suspected coal slurry, a toxic waste product from coal preparation, was the main contaminant, but never gave them any formal documents or test results.

Official comment and documents from the DEP say that there was “no indication that the well was impacted … by mining activity,” because both of the neighboring mines on record were deeper than the bottom of the well. The Easterlings believe that mines and gas wells exist far beyond what’s shown on the records.

The family can sometimes gather enough water from rainfall, using a system Chauncy put together to collect runoff from their roof into a cistern. When there’s a dry spell, Chauncy hauls water, towing a 250 gallon tank behind his pickup truck. Filling and hauling the tank costs the family around $200, and the water is only good for washing and flushing toilets, not for drinking. Since Chauncy works full time, they’ll sometimes have to wait for a weekend before he can fetch water. In the meantime, they have to make do without bathing and doing laundry.

Some of their neighbors, particularly those who are elderly and on fixed incomes, aren’t able to install a rain collection system or haul water. That leaves many of those already in the hardest situations with no alternative to using contaminated water from their wells and springs.

Linda McKinney runs the main food pantry that serves McDowell County. She says that all of the families served are drinking water from unsafe sources. She also sees kidney and liver issues far too often among those families.

The pantry provides bottled drinking water along with food, but they’re not able to fully meet the families’ needs. The food pantry recently received a donation of hydro-panels, which use solar energy to condense water moisture from the air. McKinney hopes that will help narrow the gap between what her team is able to provide and the need for clean water among the families they serve.

Widespread Issue

I’ve reported on water issues since 2016, mainly in the central Appalachian coalfields. The most glaring water problem I covered was in Martin County, Kentucky, where residents complained about possible exposure to health risks due to extremely leaky pipes and a lack of communication around water outages.

Martin County’s many-layered water problems started to get national attention and significant outside funding. But the $5 million now heading for Martin County is a drop in the bucket compared to the more than $600 million in water infrastructure needs that exist just in Appalachian Kentucky, according to a study from the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority. That includes $28 million for Letcher County, where I live, and where a third of the residents have no option for connecting to a public water system, according to the same study.

The federal government estimates that $472 billion in water investments are needed across the country in the next twenty years. If you break that down to one year, it’s a bit over $23 billion.

In recent history, the most the federal government has allocated toward water system infrastructure was $7.7 billion in 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Every other year since at least 1995, the amount has been less than $3 billion, even though the government’s own assessments have always shown an average annual need of at least $12 billion.

In reporting on Martin County I spoke repeatedly with Nina McCoy, a retired science teacher who, together with her husband Mickey, has played a prominent role in water testing and advocating for local water protection since at least 2000. That’s when a coal slurry impoundment broke through an underground mine shaft and sent a flood of sludge roaring down multiple creeks in Martin County, poisoning miles of streams.

McCoy says that in recent years, she’s seen a shift in local thinking and national awareness. She recalls that when neighbors without water in Martin County first saw TV coverage of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, “It was like, oh my gosh, there are other people who have water problems.”

McCoy now believes that any real solution will have to come from solidarity among communities whose water has been impacted. “We all need to get together on this, because this is a problem nationwide.”

The kinds and causes of America’s drinking water crises are widely varied, but extractive industry is a common thread. On a reporting trip to a coal mining region of the Navajo Nation, near Black Mesa, Arizona, I learned that while rain has long been scarce in the area, there used to be reliable sources of groundwater. Windmill-powered water wells dot the landscape, but many of them have run dry. Since coal mines opened on Black Mesa and started using large amounts of water to pump coal to a power plant, many wells and springs have run dry.

The mines and power plant recently closed, but it will still take years for the groundwater to recharge. In the meantime, rural residents have to pay to haul water from a well in town that taps into a deeper layer of groundwater. That water can be used for crops and livestock but not for human consumption. Drinking water has to be bought or brought in from elsewhere.

Nicole Horseherder is a resident of Black Mesa and founder of the community organization Tó Nizhóní Ání, which translates roughly to “clean water speaks.” She has seen the springs on her land dry up, making it harder and more expensive to keep livestock. Her fears though are mainly for the future.

“What’s going to be here in 20 years?” she asked. “If it’s not going to be here and it’s a life-giving element, there’s going to be no life here.”

Watershed Moments

Many residents in affected communities feel there’s a special injustice to situations like these, where clean water hadn’t been a problem until extractive industries took a toll.

Melissa Easterling said that growing up in McDowell County, good water was plentiful. High tables of clear groundwater flowed from abundant springs and streams. Her family and neighbors didn’t need to worry about water infrastructure. She suspects that as the used-up mines were allowed to flood, the water table sank. And now, she fears, the residue of coal and gas extraction seems to have left the water contaminated.

The Easterlings live at the end of Emerald Ridge. Looking south, the next ridgeline marks the state line with Virginia. To the north, down below, is a wooded valley carved by Panther Creek. The creek flows on into Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River, which marks the state line with Kentucky.

The area surrounding Panther Creek was long known as Panther State Forest and is now a wildlife management area meant for hunting and fishing. Chauncy says it was once an extremely popular fishing spot, but he and other locals have long stopped going there because of contamination fears.

Staff at Panther WMA say that water wells in the park are tested regularly, and haven’t shown any excessive levels of contaminants. They still stock the creek for fishing, and grow gardens to attract deer for hunters. The park still feels wild and healthy, though you’re likely to come across more gas wells and pipelines than other visitors.

Looking downstream from where dirty mine water flows into the creek, Chauncy lamented what’s been lost. “We used to drink the water out of that creek. Now you can’t do it. It’s contaminated.”

He worries for the future. “God knows our children’s children won’t be able to swim in that creek or play in that creek or fish in that creek.”

Water System Woes

The McDowell County water system has a line that runs up Bradshaw Mountain, and it reaches some of the families whose wells have dried up or been contaminated, but it stops a mile short of the Easterlings’ home. The family has been trying to get connected for eight years, but there’s still no money for the project, which would take years more to complete even once funding is found.

Much of the water infrastructure in McDowell County was installed by coal companies for their workers when the industry was booming. But coal production has been declining in McDowell County since the 1940’s. Many water systems were abandoned as the mines closed, and were then neglected for decades.

A county-wide public service district was created to take over the systems with the intention to maintain, update, and expand them. The problem is, there hasn’t been enough money. Federal funding, once provided through grants, was largely converted to loans. The McDowell PSD now has $34,000 in monthly debt payments and can’t afford to take more loans, according to General Manager Mavis Brewster.

“You don’t want to keep raising rates,” Brewster said. “A lot of the residents in McDowell County are elderly, they’re on fixed incomes, and water’s a basic need. You have to have that.”

Brewster said the PSD has some momentum toward expanding water services in the county. They’ve cobbled together what they can from state and federal agencies, but there’s nowhere near enough funding to meet their needs.

Top priorities for construction this spring are for the towns of Keystone and Coalwood.

In Keystone, the risk of bacterial contamination is high enough that since 2012 residents have been under a continual advisory to boil their water for safety. Coalwood, where the PSD is located, is slated to be the first area covered by a new sewage treatment system. Three towns in McDowell County — Welch, War, and Bradshaw — have their own sewage treatment systems, but none of the 3,300 customers served by McDowell PSD have sewer service.

Brewster says some of the communities have pipes that collect sewage but then send it straight into the nearest river or creek. That’s been the situation in Coalwood, but even that system has deteriorated further since the coal company that built it pulled out and stopped maintaining it. The collection network has issues with clogging and backing up, flooding homes with sewage.

Neighbors in Need

Chauncy and Melissa have been asking questions of old timers among their neighbors, with special interest in ones who’d worked in the mine below their water table. Among them, Chauncy recounted, were at least a couple who have since died, and who said they never would have worked in that mine if they’d known it could poison their own water.

One neighbor whose water contains high levels of lead and arsenic is suing a coal company, and also fighting to get any damages covered by her homeowners insurance. She’s shared photos of severe rashes and chemical burns that she claims came from exposure to the water.

Chauncy and Melissa say they wish they knew who they could sue, but there are too many companies involved in the mines and gas wells around them to know who to hold accountable, especially since many of the operations have complicated corporate histories.

Outside Owners

Chauncy Easterling says it’s his understanding that most of the people who own the local coal and gas operations live in distant cities. “Chicago, New York, places like that,” he explains. “I’d like to see them come in here and clean it up. I’d say they ain’t even rich enough to fix what damage has already been done.”

He said those same companies often own the land that many many of his neighbors rent, which is one reason that many are afraid to speak out. People are worried that they’ll get evicted or have their property condemned.

These concerns about absentee land ownership are woven into the roots of many of the region’s problems.

In 1979, teams of academics, community organizations, and local individuals across Appalachia worked together to conduct a land ownership study. Large landowners were assessed in eighty counties across six states. The study revealed high proportions of absentee corporate owners, often paying low tax rates on their holdings.

In McDowell County, for example, more than three-quarters of the land and more than 90% of the mineral rights were held by absentee owners at the time. The five largest owners included a range of timber and mining companies, all based in other states.

A new land study is currently in development, and organizers are seeking funding to do an updated survey of land and mineral ownership in Appalachia.

Based on what records are available, it seems the overall picture has stayed the same. Outside companies own large amounts of Appalachia’s land and resources. The business model is extractive not just in taking fossil fuels out of the ground, but also in taking wealth away from the region.

With little local control over the land, widely depleted sources of natural wealth, a range of work and environment related health issues, it’s no wonder that so many Appalachian communities are struggling to build new economies and keep themselves afloat.

Funding Prospects

President Donald J. Trump campaigned with promises of major infrastructure spending, and the White House has frequently touted “Infrastructure Week” initiatives. But so far those have not resulted in major new projects or funding. The topic has since faded from prominence among the president’s talking points.

Prominent Democrats have called for a “Green New Deal” to include massive infrastructure spending, including on water systems. The Green New Deal bill introduced by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year would “guarantee universal access to clean water,” but some fellow Democrats question the bill’s costs and the legislation faces stiff Republican opposition.

More immediately, coalfield communities have been focused on getting funding from the federal Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is supported by a fee on coal companies and used to fix damages caused before enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Regulation Act.

A bipartisan proposal known as the RECLAIM Act would speed the rate of spending that AML money and expand the scope of funding to include projects like water infrastructure that can help communities and their economies. A few pilot projects following a similar model have been included in recent federal budgets.

What’s Underground

The Easterlings say they’ve never sold their mineral rights, so no mining company should have had the right to mine beneath their home. But core samples drilled deep from the earth show that the coal had been mined underneath them anyway. The family somewhat expected this, having seen dishes fall out of the cabinet from shakes and jolts when, they presume, pillars were being pulled in a mineshaft below them, allowing the cavity to collapse. Chauncy says this kind of “robbing coal” is commonplace. “It’s underground. It’s out of sight, out of mind.”

The collapsed coal seams have been punctured by gas wells. No one knows what’s still in the old mine voids. From scouting around the mine entrances and talking to friends who used to work in the mines, Chauncy and Melissa have come to believe it’s likely that heavy equipment, batteries, and other industrial trash was left behind in the mine. They’re also concerned that refuse from a coal washing plant — a dark toxic sludge known as slurry — might have been pumped into the abandoned mine, which is a common practice for disposing of the waste. There’s no official record of slurry being injected in the area, but the Easterlings have heard that the mine below them was used for dumping by a nearby coal washing plant.

There have also been dozens of gas wells drilled near this web of mines. Some older gas wells don’t show up on official maps because they were not properly permitted or have no identifiable owner.

Some of the wells in the area are from conventional drilling but records show others used fracking, which pumps water and chemicals into the ground, opening up cracks from which gas can be drawn.

Once a well stops producing it is supposed to be sealed. But at least some of the older wells around the Easterlings were left unplugged, with just an abandoned pipe sticking out of the ground.

The Easterlings say that their water started to change soon after nearby gas wells were shut down. At first the water started to smell, then little bits of dark rock dust appeared, and then before long it was running dark brown.

Chauncy worked for years as a miner and then as a boss in underground coal mines. He says it wasn’t unusual for the mine to run into an area that had already been mined even though it was outside any other mine’s permit boundary.

Once, he said, a crew working under him cut into a gas well which hadn’t been on any of their maps. He and Melissa both remember that as a terrifying time. But shades of fear color much of Chauncy’s memories of working underground. Coal miners get paid not just to produce coal, but to regularly put themselves in danger.

Given today’s record rates of severe black lung disease, it’s no exaggeration to say Chauncy and other miners have been getting paid to accept that their lungs will likely get scarred by coal and rock dust.

Chauncy took a buyout offer in 2013, partly because his health and breathing had started to noticeably decline. The buyout came with six months of severance pay, which he used to get certified as a commercial truck driver. He’s applied for black lung compensation, but was told it may be five years before he’d start receiving any benefits.

Chauncy got out of the mines, but he and his family still fear for their health. Their home is surrounded by remnants of fossil fuel extraction and the lasting legacy of environmental degradation.

This is how the impact of corruption is measured in South Africa’s ailing water sector.

The country’s significant water challenges are all worsened by graft, says a new report by Corruption Watch and the Berlin-based Water Integrity Network.

It warns how corruption in the water and sanitation sector has put the water security of businesses and households “and indeed the entire country at risk.

“Water is often not available where and when it is needed, nor of the quality needed, due to unpredictable rainfall, limited infrastructure, the misuse of financial resources, and poor management – aggravated by corruption,” says the report Money down the Drain: Corruption in South Africa’s Water Sector.

Written by Professor Mike Muller, a former director-general of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, it describes how many, particularly young children, old people, and those with compromised immune systems, have fallen ill from drinking unsafe water, or their homes and toilets cannot be kept hygienic. “Corruption in the water sector has resulted in deaths.”

Corruption extends from taps in rural villages to the systems that supply the country’s economic heartland.

“Village taps have run dry so that councillors and their friends could get contracts to truck water. Construction of a dam to provide water to Gauteng has been delayed by years, in part because a minister sought to change procurement rules to benefit her friends. In the Western Cape, the raising of the Clanwilliam Dam, which would create thousands of new farming jobs, has been delayed for similar reasons.

“Companies have paid bribes to get business. Some companies have promoted unnecessary projects and claimed payment for work done badly or not at all, often colluding with officials who oversee their work.

Others have monopolised specialist areas of work to grossly overcharge for their services.” Individual households are involved, too, through unauthorised, unmetered water connections, “often made by the same plumbers who maintain the supply systems, using material from their workplaces”.

These problems are compounded by the failure to appoint competent people to do the jobs required and officials being pressurised by politicians and seniors “to do the wrong thing – risking dismissal or worse if they don’t comply”.

The report analyses a key range of corruption strategies spanning the manipulation of procurement and operational processes, influencing policy and regulatory decisions, and taking control of the decision-making sites of key institutions.

Corruption in the water sector is systemic and formal rules have been “superseded by informal rules that bypass or distort formal processes”.

The combined efforts of whistle-blowers, investigative journalists, the auditor-general and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) have begun to address the rot. “However, although some officials have resigned and others face internal disciplinary action, there have been few serious consequences.” Much of the corruption is driven by wider political and economic challenges.

“Unless these are also addressed, it’s unlikely that efforts to improve and enforce procedures and transparency will be enough to change the situation ... An effective campaign to wash corruption out of the water sector could create the environment in which larger water problems can be tackled.”

Not long ago, democratic SA was seen as a global leader in the management of water resources and the provision of water services. It had achieved its 2015 Millennium Development Goal for domestic water supply; through its free basic water policy, it had given practical effect to the Human Right to Water and SA had given legal protection to environmental water flows.

In 2002, it led the campaign to set a global goal for sanitation provision that was included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

But the performance of the water sector has significantly deteriorated:

-The reliability of water supply services is falling according to official data.

-The resilience of services to problems such as drought has decreased. While Cape Town’s temporary water restrictions gained worldwide publicity, regular supply failures are normal for millions of people around the country.

-Payment for water is falling and municipal debt is increasing, undermining service provision in many localities where there is simply not enough money for operation and maintenance.

-Pollution of rivers from failed municipal wastewater management and poorly regulated mining operations is widespread and growing.

-In 2018 the auditor-general and Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts reported the management of the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) had collapsed, with billions of rand of irregular expenditure, huge debts and failed projects. Many of these problems have been attributed to corruption.

Muller’s report was prompted by a series of investigations in the City Press about corruption in the water sector. “These revealed serious irregularities involving huge sums of money in DWS projects in Giyani, Limpopo.

Concerns grew when reports emerged about thousands of unpaid and unemployed trainees in the department’s multibillion-rand ‘War on Leaks’ project. “Then it emerged that nearly a billion rand had been committed to a computer project that wasn’t needed.

These cases, it is alleged, all involved former Water and Sanitation minister Nomvula Mokonyane and her associates.” Corruption was a problem before Mokonyane’s arrival with external investigations under way since 2012 – the SIU reported 28 criminal cases involving R50 million.

By the time she left, irregular expenditure was well over R4 billion “with new cases still being uncovered and the DWS is effectively bankrupt”.

Corruption in the water sector is far bigger than a few individuals and is “clearly systemic, involving many people at all levels, from plumbers and tanker drivers to mayors and ministers.

“Many private businesses joined in too, benefiting richly from corruption and in some cases, actively organising and encouraging it.” Corruption means that mining’s impact on water has not been properly regulated as in the awarding of mining licences, managing water pollution and water abstraction, “private interests frequently prevail over those of the communities, especially when public officials with the power to control these issues are complicit”. The looting strategies have included the capture of entire water sector organisations.

“Every facet of management has been exploited, including policy-making, procurement and operational and contract administration.” Oversight has been weakened. The decision to stop the production of the Blue, Green and No drop reports would appear to be a “deliberate contravention of the requirement under national water legislation to collect information on water services and water resources and provide that information to the public.

“Preparation of the National Water Resource Strategy, which is explicitly required by law to be produced every three years to explain how water security is to be sustained, is more than three years late.” Corruption is now “endemic, present and taken for granted”, across the South African water sector. “It’s simply regarded as what might be needed to get work done.""

Some of the cases highlighted in the report:

-The Giyani bulk water project in Limpopo, ballooned from R502 million to R2.7 billion in a year.

The failed project aimed to provide clean running water to 55 villages in Giyani. “Local municipalities have been left with a dysfunctional system that they cannot afford to operate.

Giyani’s households are little better off than they were before. One unanswered question is where all the money went,” says the report.

-In the 1990s, the first phase of the Lesotho Highlands Project provided a “textbook case of corruption” in large public sector construction projects. “More recently, it has provided an insight into the way in which attempts to capture the management structures and gain control over procurement and contract management issues can disrupt and delay an important public project and put a substantial part of South Africa’s economy at risk.”

Former Water and Sanitation minister Nomvula Mokonyane actively sought to change the procurement requirements for the project. Lesotho Highlands Water Project Phase 2 is back on track for now. “However, even if procurement proceeds cleanly and smoothly, Mokonyane’s interventions have further delayed an already delayed project.

The result is that the region served by the Vaal system and Lesotho’s dams will be at risk of serious supply restrictions if there is a drought before 2026, the current optimistic project completion date. Already, new developments in major cities have been halted as a result. The potential economic impacts are significant.”

-In 2014, three people were killed during protests in Mothutlung, a small community lying between Brits and Ga-Rankuwa. “The community’s water supply failed, it was reported, because all three pumps serving the area had broken down.

In the interim, the Britsbased Madibeng municipality told residents that they would be served by tanker,” states the report.

“The residents refused to accept this. They alleged that the pumps had been deliberately sabotaged to enrich the private owners of water tankers, who had paid kickbacks to municipal officials to cut the supply.

“This allegation was credible. Mothutlung is not a distant rural village. It is close to major urban centres with reliable water supplies and well-developed maintenance facilities, just 10km from the municipal water treatment plan.”

-In Umlazi, eThekwini, residents protested because, they said, tanker drivers were demanding R200 to fill their house tanks after four weeks without water.

Their protest leaders also alleged that the supply cuts were deliberate. “We hear that officials are cutting our water supply so that we will get water delivered by tankers. We hear that the officials are benefiting from the water tankers,” said protest leader Nkanyiso Msomi.

-The Lekwa municipality in Mpumalanga province “provides an example of how infighting in a municipality, in this case between ANC factions, has had disastrous impacts on water supply. Standerton, Lekwa’s main town, is home to the main poultry processing plant of Astral Foods, the biggest in southern Africa – one of the largest employers in the area, with over 2 200 workers. But its future is under threat, owing to the lack of a reliable water supply, says the report.

“Disputes between different factions of the ruling party, essentially to capture control of the municipality’s limited resources, distracted attention from the critical job of maintaining and expanding the town’s water supply.

“Despite the company’s assistance, the municipality had failed to undertake even minimum maintenance. Even a court order compelling the municipality to provide the contracted volume of water had no impact.

As a consequence, the company has had to truck water to its installations at considerable expense. It is now considering shifting production elsewhere.”

Report recommendations:

-Designating the water sector as an “island of integrity”

-Ending impunity and instilling a culture of consequences

-Ensuring the appointment of honest, ethical and committed leaders to run key institutions

-Improving and strengthening procurement systems and practices

-Facilitating transparency in regulatory decisions

-Addressing broader environmental factors and supporting the media and civil society to uncover corrupt activities and pursue them until appropriate remedial action is taken.

83,https://www.postindependent.com/news/local/marble-quarry-operators-violated-clean-water-act-army-corps-of-engineers-finds/,"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Glenwood Springs Post Independent,"Marble quarry operators violated Clean Water Act, Army Corps of Engineers finds","MARBLE — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has determined that the operators of a local marble quarry violated the Clean Water Act when they diverted a tributary of the Crystal River to make way for a mining road.

In the fall of 2018, Colorado Stone Quarries, which operates the famed Yule Quarry just outside the town of Marble, diverted Yule Creek from its natural channel — located on the west side of Franklin Ridge, a rock outcropping — to the east side of the ridge. Operators piled the original streambed with fill material, including marble blocks.

Although this move probably spared Yule Creek the impacts of a diesel spill last October , it was done without the proper permits or oversight, according to the Army Corps.

Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, a project requires a permit from the Army Corps if it includes the discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters such as rivers, streams and wetlands. CSQ did not obtain a permit for the project because company officials thought the work was exempt, citing the temporary nature of the access road and creek diversion.

Army Corps officials disagreed.

“The work performed does not qualify for an exemption,” states a March 5 letter from Army Corps Colorado West Section chief Susan Nall, as the work “is being utilized for purposes other than moving mining equipment (e.g., hauling mined marble, accessing other portions of the mine, fuel staging area, and performing spill cleanup and monitoring activities) as required by the applicable exemption.”

Nall’s letter then declares: “Therefore, the work is a violation of the Clean Water Act.”

In order to remedy the situation, the Army Corps wants Yule Creek returned to its original alignment.

“Our preference is always to preserve the physical waterway if possible,” Nall said.

CSQ is considering a few different alignments for Yule Creek.

“The current alignment does accomplish the goal of creating separation between the creek and mining activities, which benefits the watershed,” CSQ general manager Daniele Treves said in a prepared statement.

The company plans to apply for an “individual permit,” which will require a 30-day public notice, public review and comments. The final decision on the Yule Creek alignment rests with the Army Corps.

The diversion of Yule Creek came to the attention of Army Corps staff after October’s diesel spill, which released roughly 5,500 gallons of fuel from storage tanks onto the ground.

Although CSQ notified the Army Corps in 2018 that it was planning to divert about 1,500 feet of the creek, the company didn’t follow the proper procedure, and the Army Corps didn’t realize the scope of the work it was planning, according to Nall.

“We did not realize it was a formal request for concurrence of an exemption,” Nall said. “That might have been an error on our part. … We didn’t object, and they took it as a concurrence. Nothing is exempt until we say it is. They really should have obtained it from us in writing.”

DRMS penalty

On Wednesday, the board of the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety levied a $18,600 penalty for the October spill. The accident resulted in the quarry’s violation of three state statutes : unauthorized release of pollutants into groundwater, failure to minimize disturbance to water quality and failure to comply with the conditions of the permit.

DRMS determined that last September’s relocation of generators and the diesel-fuel tanks that supplied them was not approved and was a violation of CSQ’s permit. The diesel tanks were not put in secondary containment structures.

CSQ has agreed to pay the fine.

“We are always more interested in gaining compliance than the monetary aspect of it,” said Russell Means, minerals program director for DRMS.

According to an agreement between quarry operators and state regulators, CSQ will also continue to clean up the site, including bioremediation treatments to remove hydrocarbons from the soil and long-term water-quality monitoring.

Means and Nall said CSQ has been cooperative throughout the process.

“I think everybody’s interest is the same — we would all like to see the spill area cleaned up and the best thing for Yule Creek,” Nall said.

The quarry, now known as The Pride of America Mine, is owned by Italian company Red Graniti and employs about 30 to 40 people. According to CSQ, there are enough marble reserves contained in its six galleries to continue mining at the current rate for more than 100 years.

When creating a tray or basket, suppliers must balance the asset’s function as well as features that will make it easier to use, whether that’s easy cleaning or ergonomically friendly.

“In a commercial bakery, first you’re trying to make sure you protect a product that can be so delicate,” said Patrice Painchaud, vice president of sales and marketing, Rexfab. “You have to keep it light because that’s a cost implication. You also want to design it so it doesn’t waste space during transportation or storage. Now that they are all being washed, that’s the next piece of tray design.”

When creating trays that are easier to clean, the features should mimic that of sanitary design for equipment by eliminating places where dirt, bacteria and water can hide or be difficult to remove.

“Trays and baskets are designed in such a way to minimize ‘masking’ of the surfaces to be cleaned and prevent wash or rinse water from being trapped within the tray or basket, allowing for better cleaning and drying,” said Kevin Quinn, sales manager, Douglas Machines Corp.

The same crevices that can harbor dirt and bacteria can also trap water after the tray or basket is dry, and that isn’t any better than trapped dirt. Standing water will encourage bacteria to flourish, so transportation assets are often created to eliminate these dirt and water traps.

Instead, these suppliers are building assets with flow-through design so the water drains out of the tray or basket and the blower can remove residue.

The next step? Going further with antimicrobial materials. An additive package is available now to be mixed in with a tray’s or basket’s plastic, but currently it’s a costly option.

“There’s the plastic and then the color additive,” Mr. Painchaud said. “You might have UV and antioxidant stabilizers, and then you can actually add in an antimicrobial. It’s an option worth mentioning, but it can be cost-prohibitive.”

New trays are supposed to make it easier for washer/dryer systems to sanitize trays and baskets. And as tray and baskets evolve to accommodate FSMA, washer/dryer systems, too, must adapt to the new assets.

“AMF Bakery Systems custom designs the water sprayer configuration to pressure wash all around the tray or basket in a full 360-degree all axis,” said Bobby Martin, executive product manager, AMF Bakery Systems. “There is also a guiding system that will adapt to the basket’s dimensions to a certain min/max overall degree.”

Douglas Machines Corp.’s washer and dryer systems also can be customized to suit a bakery’s trays and baskets. In the company’s tunnel washer, the tray determines the spray pattern to optimize the clean. The company engineers its Blow-Off Drying systems with single or multiple blowers and heated air drying.

These machines take the muscle work out of keeping these plastic assets food safe. AMF’s Basket Washing and Drying System uses high-performance nozzles with filtered hot water to clean baskets. The water’s temperature is closely controlled for wash efficiency, and a moisture eliminator system dries the baskets by recirculating air and eliminating excess moisture.

Douglas Machines Corp.’s rack washer uses high-velocity stainless steel V jets to remove stubborn soils and contaminants.

“Wash cycle times are selected depending on soil conditions,” Mr. Quinn said. “Recirculated detergent wash water reduces water use and provides quicker turnaround time to get those racks and baskets back in use.”

After each wash cycle, the system rinses with a hot water sanitizing rinse, and that water is routed to the recirculated wash tank to freshen it each cycle. Water reduction and sustainability are at the forefront of keeping trays and baskets clean. Minimizing water usage not only saves the bakery money and benefits the environment, but it minimizes the potential for bacteria growth.

“The use or presence of water and moisture in a facility is a significant risk factor for contamination,” Mr. Quinn said. “If present, standing water may allow pathogen growth and is unfortunately an excellent and efficient way to spread pathogens throughout a facility. Having an automated washing and sanitizing system reduces the amount of water being used while keeping it contained to a small footprint.”

• The concept is to bring innovators together to address safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene education issues

Hyderabad: The State Government is planning to set up a Sanitation Hub in the city with an aim to bring innovators under one roof. The S-Hub aims to promote innovation and knowledge in three main categories: water, sanitation and hygiene.



According to reliable sources, the S-Hub is to come up at Hi-Tec City. The primary objective of the Sanitation Hub will be to create a continuous chain for development of sanitation system in the state. It would support innovators and all stakeholders in innovation pertaining to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene.

Lack of sanitation contributes to about 700,000 child deaths every year due to diarrhoea, mainly in developing countries. The concept of S- Hub is to group together the three main components to address safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene education issues to create a strong positive impact on public health.

The Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) and Center for Innovation in Public Systems (CIPS) are to play key roles as knowledge partners.

Opportunity for innovators

Sanitation Hub will be calling all innovators (developers and operators) in public toilet and community toilet space to exhibit their prototype models at the city hub.

An innovator, Suresh Mada from Hyderabad, went a step ahead by tagging his cost-effective toilets built under Rs 5,000 to the tweet of Arvind Kumar, Principal Secretary (Urban Development), announcing the Sanitation Hub.

Speaking about the proposal, Suresh Mada, said, ""As the basic sanitation facility becomes higher end luxury in the current period in rural areas, most of the villages are still preferring open defecation for their regular needs as they could not afford to build a good toilet and they don't have a proper sanitation system. That led me to come up with a cost-effective toilet. All the materials I used are three cylindrical cement blocks, basin, toilet seats, tap, pipe, doors and an iron sheet to cover.""

""I received a mail from the Sanitation Hub team asking me to demonstrate the model with few changes,"" he added.","The S-Hub aims to promote innovation and knowledge in three main categories: water, sanitation and hygiene.

“The water supply maintained in our distribution systems up to the customers’ taps has been disinfected with chlorine, as prescribed by the Philippine National Standard for Drinking Water (PNSDW) set by the Department of Health (DOH). Our water is therefore free from bacteria and viruses (including the COVID-19 virus) and is safe for domestic consumption,” Chief Regulator Patrick Ty said.

“The wastewater discharged from our Sewage and/or Septage Treatment Plants (STPs) into our receiving water bodies has also been disinfected with chlorine; in accordance with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Order 2016-08 or the “Water Quality Guidelines and General Effluent Standards,” he added.

Ty said that MWSS-RO’s statement came amid speculations that the water from concessionaires may be carrying the COVID-19, as cases continued to pile up in the Philippines.

MWSS oversees the supply of water to Metro Manila, which is divided into two sectors under the concession agreement: the east side belonging to Manila Water, and the west side being serviced by Maynilad.

As of Monday, Metro Manila, Luzon, and other areas are still under an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) to prevent COVID-19 from further spreading. The Department of Health said that that there are now 1,546 patients infected with COVID-19, 78 of which have already died while at least 42 have recovered.

89,https://www.producegrower.com/article/food-safety-fresh-and-clean/,"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Produce Grower,Fresh and clean,"When Austin Webb enrolled in Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University in 2016 to pursue his M.B.A., he knew that artificial intelligence and robotics would be a part of whatever business he ended up in. At the time, he says, the “entrepreneurial fever” had hit him completely.

“I went to Carnegie Mellon specifically to try and start a company because I believe AI and robotics can help change the world,” he says. “In month one there, I met this tall, lanky guy named Austin, who said, 'Hey, do you know much about vertical farming?' and I said, 'Hey, my name's Austin too and yes, I do know a little bit.' What we [eventually] found was this industry-wide struggle to make the economics work.”

That Austin is Austin Lawrence, who previously worked on another ag-tech start-up and now has a master’s degree in robotics from Northwestern University. Lawrence, along with Webb and his brother, engineer Brac Webb, co-founded the business in 2016 under the name RoBotany. The tech was first tested in two locations on Pittsburgh’s south side, where greens were grown and sold by retailers such as Giant Eagle and Whole Foods, as well as local restaurants. Ahead of the launch of a 60,000-square-foot vertical farm in Braddock, Pennsylvania, the company rebranded to Fifth Season, although it retains the tagline “powered by RoBotany.”

According to Webb, the main thrust of the business is two-fold. First, it aims to bring cleaner, more sustainably grown food to the Pittsburgh area before building farms in other locales. Secondly, the company wants to use technology not only to grow leafy greens, microgreens and herbs, but to create a new agriculture job that’s fueled by the same technology powering the farm.

“We really wanted to jump in and make vertical farming, which we think can be this wonderful solution to solve food waste and food health and food access, and to take that solution and make it an economic reality today as opposed to just a pipe dream for the future,” he says.

How Fifth Season grows

To dive deep into the field, Austin and the other co-founders first considered comparing the idea of vertical farming and how it currently works vs. how it would work. The two trial locations were, in that sense, a proof of concept not just to potential investors, but also for the business’ concept itself.

According to Webb, Fifth Season’s system is mostly built out of proprietary technology that combines AI and robotics with engineering. The facilities feature 30-foot tall towers, LED lighting, data-collecting sensors that gather information from plants throughout the growing process and various automated features that limit human contact with the plants. The farm still employs laborers, but Webb says the majority of their current employees are engineers — for a specific reason.

“Engineers are working on everything from hardware, software, firmware in embedded systems so that the system is able to tell the but hardware what it’s doing,” he says. “It’s all connected end to end. And they are working with our food safety specialist, our operations specialists and our plant management because our operations are integrated with our technology.” Webb adds that the amount of connectivity is what allows the farm to maintain the standards of food quality and safety that the founders want. An estimated 60 workers will be employed.

According to grow lead Danielle Ferreira, the key to growing at Fifth Season is the “recipes” for leafy greens and herbs that have been developed to provide the exact input each plant needs. Additionally, none of the crops are grown with pesticides.

“It’s a massive step up. You have a recipe and your inputs are always the same because you are controlling it 100%,” says Ferreira, who previously worked at Nature Fresh Farms, Metrolina Greenhouses and Green Circle Growers. “If you have 100% of the control, you have consistency [in the crops].”

“On a day-to-day basis, with any changes we make, it’s a continuing improvement,” she says. “Everything is being considered.”

The data collected by Fifth Season makes growing easier, too, she says, when compared to a more traditional controlled environment.

“We have an awesome R&D team developing those recipes for those farms; [they] are being tested in the farm and validated,” she says. “Even small differences — say, a slight change in the intensity of lighting — can make a huge difference. Knowing the details of what works best, you can see the results in the quality of the crops.”

As for picking Braddock as the facilities location, Webb says one benefit is that their farm doesn’t take up too much space compared to an outdoor farm or other businesses. By their estimates, the 60,000 square-foot farm produces the equivalent of 2.5 acres of outdoor growing space.

The second location is where Fifth Season leadership identified Braddock and the broader Pittsburgh area needed more locally grown produce. Braddock particularly needs a jolt. According to City Lab, 30.3% of the city’s residents currently live below the poverty line and the area has struggled to find an economic identity as the steel industry declined.

According to Webb, the design of the Braddock farm is replicable and will allow the company to build new facilities in other cities.

“The technology is what creates this level of freshness. It’s what allows us to change the distribution. Technology is the enabler.” - Austin Webb

“A big part of how he selected Braddock is looking at the food distribution system and acknowledging that it’s broken — that people are disconnected from its food,” Webb says. “So, we can go into a city like Braddock, which is a food desert, and it’s a great spot to start the decentralization and transform that harvest so that within a few hours, it’s in your hand, your salad or on your shelf.” He notes that Braddock has a history of innovation but has lost all but one of the steel mills that defined it for so long.

“We want to be part of the new era of innovation,” he says.

Emphasizing technology

Webb says that Brac, his older brother and co-founder, started tinkering with computers and programming since he was a teenager.

“We’ve always been connected to technology,” he says. “And a lot of [Brac’s] older work is around satellites and the 'internet of things.' That’s where software and hardware really come together and you’re moving hard assets.” He says that seeing how his brother's brain power could be used to utilize that technology was what put AI and robotics onto his radar.

According to Webb, the three years between the company’s founding and the Braddock facility’s launch were spent largely developing the technology and learning more about what worked and what didn’t on other farms. He says that several prototypes were built — some of which influenced the system that’s currently in place now — and that others at least provided value in helping Fifth Season do R&D across the board. For instance, some early prototypes were used to test what crops might work in the system, as company leadership didn’t want to limit the potential product line to just one or two items.

“We want to be able to provide many more products than that, giving people options based on their lifestyle,” Webb says. The next step was using prototypes to grow product and get consumer feedback well before the actual farm opened. One lesson they learned was that emphasizing the local aspect of production — Webb says 70% of consumers will pick local over 18% preferring organic — when presented with either option.

Data is an essential part of the business too; Webb says that they are taking “tons of data points every minute.” Every tray in the system, he says, has a unique ID number so it can be located at any time and traced throughout the growing process and when it gets to the package.

“That allows us to make improvements in quantity and yield,” Webb says. “That level of traceability allows us to create the peace of mind that consumers are wanting, especially right now where lettuce is the highest cause of food-borne illness and we have all of these food safety recalls.”

He notes that data always works hand-in-hand with the company’s use of AI: The amount of data collected would be a massive task for a team of workers to break down, but something that a computer can do much more efficiently.

“It creates these feedback loops in our closed-off system that allows us to get feedback and connect data by connecting dots,” Webb says.

Continuing the build

The future of Fifth Season, he says, is expanding outside of Braddock. Like other operations — such as Revol Greens, Bowery Farming and Little Leaf Farms — Fifth Season’s growth plan involves building new locations in different cities. According to Webb, emphasizing technology on the farm makes taking it elsewhere — be it the U.S. South, the Pacific Northwest or abroad — more feasible than if the business was centered around a single crop.

“The technology is what creates this level of freshness,” he says. “It’s what allows us to change the distribution. Technology is the enabler.”

That includes reaching retail and food-service partners too — particularly amid a string of E. coli outbreaks stemming from field-grown lettuce. The traceability, Webb says, creates a sense of comfort and transparency for the end consumer.

“I don’t imagine [doing this without data] because anyone who isn’t doing something different — maybe just building some greenhouses — you’re not really innovating to move the dial when it comes to quality, hyper-locality, food safety or price and affordability,” he says. “We definitely view it as this technology creating this whole new open door, whether you’re thinking about it as a business owner or end consumer.”

“We can go into a city like Braddock, which is a food desert, and it’s a great spot to start the decentralization and transform that harvest so that within a few hours, it’s in your hand, your salad or on your shelf.” - Austin Webb

Moving forward, the plan is to go somewhere new; locations are to be determined. According to Ferreira, the recipes used at the Braddock facility should be the same at any new facility, with minor tweaks once the farm is built and data is collected in that new environment.

Expansion will require the Braddock farm to work, and will also likely demand more capital. At its inception, Fifth Season was incubated through Carnegie Mellon; they’ve since raised $35 million with assistance from Columbus-based venture capital firm Drive Capital. Webb says the goal isn’t to raise as much money as possible. (In comparison, California-based farming company Plenty raised $200 million in its last round of funding, while New Jersey-based operation Aero Farms raised $100 million last summer.)

“The thing that’s really nice about our approach — which I’d describe as a disciplined walk-the-walk — is an ability to do more in less time and with less capital,” he says. “We haven’t had to go out and do this huge mega raise that puts us and our employees in a bad spot."" He says the technology, instead of being a way to seek out investment, is a way to not have to.

Still, Webb doesn’t define Fifth Season as solely a technology company or even just a grower. Instead, he uses the term “consumer-experience company.” By investing in Braddock and ideally other communities, Webb hopes the company can play a part in democratizing food and creating change.

“It’s taking something that was viewed as a commodity and making it part of their lifestyle,” he says. “That’s the most fun part.”","According to Webb, Fifth Season’s system is mostly built out of proprietary technology that combines AI and robotics with engineering.

C oronavirus cases have hit the U.S., and employers and employees alike are concerned about how the virus may spread through the workplace.



Serious respiratory illnesses are generally spread through coughing or sneezing, touching objects with contaminated hands, and touching your face after touching contaminated objects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Keeping the workplace clean can inhibit the spread of communicable diseases. In addition to limiting exposure to the new strain of coronavirus—known as COVID-19—taking the following steps can help prevent the spread of the flu and other viruses.



1. Wash Your Hands



""Emphasize hand-washing year-round and highlight it during flu season,"" suggested Howard Mavity, an attorney with Fisher Phillips in Atlanta. ""Creatively keep the need fresh on employees' minds.""

The CDC has said that keeping hands clean is one of the most important steps to avoid the spread of germs. The agency recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Employers can print and post CDC fact sheets that remind employees when to wash their hands, including:

After using the bathroom.

Before, during and after food preparation.

Before eating food.

After blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.

After caring for someone who is sick or after changing a child's diaper.

After handling pets or other animals or their food and waste.

After touching garbage.

Employees should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available, noted Sean Paisan, an attorney with Ogletree Deakins in Orange County, Calif.

The CDC said alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain 60 percent to 95 percent alcohol, but washing with soap and water is preferable, particularly if hands are visibly dirty.

How can employers help? The CDC suggests that employers provide soap and water and alcohol-based hand rubs in the workplace and ensure that adequate supplies are maintained.

""Place hand rubs in multiple locations or in conference rooms to encourage hand hygiene,"" the CDC said. Employers should also consider providing tissues and touch-free trash bins.

2. Practice Sneezing and Coughing Etiquette



Considering how similar viruses spread, people infected with COVID-19 may be spreading the virus through respiratory secretions when they cough or sneeze, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). ""There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 as the outbreak investigation continues,"" the agency stated on its webpage, noting that existing OSHA standards apply to protecting workers from COVID-19.

The CDC noted that previous outbreaks of coronavirus have spread through close contact with sick people. ""A critical time to practice good hygiene etiquette is when you are sick, especially when coughing or sneezing.""

To help prevent the spread of germs, the CDC recommends:

Avoiding coughing or sneezing into your hands.

Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when you cough or sneeze.

Putting used tissue in a wastebasket.

3. Clean Your Workstation

Employers should encourage employees and housekeeping staff to routinely clean all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as keyboards, remote controls, desks, countertops and doorknobs.

Will regular cleaning products kill the bug? The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said coronaviruses are among ""the easiest to kill with the appropriate disinfectant product."" But the EPA noted that emerging viral pathogens are less common and predictable than established pathogens, so few EPA-registered disinfectant products specifically target them. Credible products may not yet carry a label promising to kill COVID-19.

The CDC recommended using the cleaning agents that are usually used to clean work surfaces, doorknobs and countertops and to follow the directions on the label. The agency also suggested that employers provide disposable wipes so that workers can easily wipe down commonly used surfaces.

A best practice, however, is to avoid contact with people who are sick. ""If you are ill, you should try to distance yourself from others so you do not spread your germs,"" the CDC said.

91,https://www.nrn.com/operations/how-should-restaurants-clean-coronavirus-cases,"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Nation's Restaurant News,How should restaurants clean in coronavirus cases?,"As more restaurants discover workers with suspected coronavirus diagnoses, operators are finding ways to scrub the units from top to bottom and to allay customer concerns.

Major brands over the past two weeks have encountered suspected novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, cases among staff members, from a Waffle House in Canton, Ga. , to a Panera Bread in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and a Starbucks Reserve unit in downtown Seattle, Wash.

After a worker at an Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill & Bar in North Platte, Neb., last week underwent a coronavirus test, which was eventually determined to be negative, the franchisee owner closed the unit and re-opened it ""following a deep cleaning of the restaurant.""

What should those cleaning methods and protocols entail?

Nation’s Restaurant News asked Mandy Sedlak, food safety and public health manager for Ecolab’s Ecosure division, to offer her expert advice.

What are the first steps a restaurant operator should take when they learn an employee or customer has been diagnosed with coronavirus/COVID-19?

Stay calm, follow your company’s communication policy, send the employee home and ask them to call their healthcare provider, and disinfect high-touch guest areas. It’s of utmost importance to ensure everyone is working together and clear steps are followed. Mixed messages can cause confusion and it’s important to make the right decisions quickly and involve the right team. If the employee has stated they are confirmed to have COVID-19, the employee should self-isolate for 14 days and follow guidance from their doctor and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. If it’s not in your ill employee policy already, add flu-like symptoms and fever for exclusion. Best practice has been to not return until the employee is 72 hours symptom free. With COVID-19, additional precautions are needed to help ensure the safety of your team.

When should a restaurant consider closing to the public?

Restaurants should work with their company and regulatory to discuss possible closures.

What and how should you communicate to your staff? To the public?

Have a plan and talk about it. If reaction to a confirmed case in the area is what prompts conversations; it’s late. These conversations should be happening now. Have open talks with your staff upon check-ins and whenever concerns arise. Talk about proper handwashing, not working when ill and proactively and properly disinfecting. Use education materials from trusted sources such as the CDC. Ecolab also has resources available here to start the conversations and find solutions. We are seeing many restaurants proactively train and provide information to employees, suppliers and others. For the public, ensure all customer-facing employees are giving the same message as one voice, speaking to the facts if customers ask questions. If they ask, tell them the action steps you are taking; increased focus on hand washing, no one working with flu-like symptoms, stepping up disinfecting, etc. Restaurants are stepping it up, and they should consider sharing this information with guests.

What should a “complete and thorough” cleaning involving when coronavirus is suspect? What specific products and techniques do you recommend?

When looking at risks, we can divide them into three areas:

GREEN: Standard prevention. No direct threat. Follow current procedures: Maintain standard hygiene/ill employee and sanitizing/disinfection practices.

YELLOW: Risk reduction. Potential for an outbreak in your geographic area or industry. Enhance procedures to respond to an outbreak in your facility, designed to break the chain of infection or illness.

RED: Proactive Remediation. A publicly declared outbreak in your facility or region disrupting normal business. Heighten pro-active position and reinforce training while following current procedures.

We would consider this a need for “proactive remediation.” The guidelines would be to:

Heighten pro-active position and reinforce training while following current procedures.

Reinforce hand hygiene, ill employee policy and cough etiquette.

Monitor employee health.

Disinfect with an [Environmental Protection Agency]-registered hard surface contact surface disinfectant according to label directions.

Carefully read and follow label directions for use and proper contact times. For food contact surfaces, thoroughly rinse with potable water.

Wash and sanitize food contact surfaces and equipment on a more frequent basis.

Change out utensils in buffet line on a more frequent basis.

Perform training, reinforcing cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting procedures.

Ensure all hand sinks are properly accessible, not blocked and stocked with warm water, soap and paper towels.

Increase the frequency of monitoring hand sinks, including those in the guest restrooms, as hand-washing frequency will increase.

For disinfecting, focus on high-touch objects in the dining room. Door knobs, door handles and push plates, railings, light and air-control switches, faucets, toilet flush levers and the restrooms.

For a deep clean, also consider taking everything off of the tables and properly disinfecting the table surfaces. Be careful not to contaminate any food products. If salt and pepper shakers are at the tables, empty them before cleaning and allow them to air dry before refilling. The EPA does consider tabletops to be a food contact surface so after table surfaces are disinfected, you’ll need to follow with a wash, rinse and sanitize.

For typical cleaning, right now it is recommended to follow normal sanitizing procedures for food contact surfaces.

Completely disinfect the guest and employee restrooms.

Disinfect the service station, bar and lobby counters.

If menus can be discarded, replace them with new ones if they are on hand. If not, disinfect the menus carefully.

Disinfect point-of-sale terminals and touch screens and pagers, too. Again, carefully, not to damage electronics.

Disinfect tables in the kitchen, remembering to move everything away from the area you are disinfecting to prevent chemical contamination.

Follow with wash, rinse and sanitize. Disinfect handles on coolers and equipment, as well as other handles.

Wash, rinse and sanitize any food contact wares such as stacked plates or scoops and tongs that are set out and not covered.

Use approved disinfectants with an EPA “emerging viral pathogen” claim and follow the specified procedures on high-touch guest points.

What routine cleaning should be conducted, such as on consumer-facing parts of the restaurant such as kiosks, counters, cash tills, chairs, tables, door handles?

For disinfecting, focus on high-touch objects in the dining room. Door knobs, door handles and push plates, railings, light and air control switches, faucets, toilet flush levers and the restrooms.

What pieces of advice are we missing in these questions?

Coronavirus is a respiratory virus – it is not considered to be a foodborne illness by the CDC, but similar proactive steps such as not working when sick, proper hand washing and thorough disinfecting can help mitigate the risk.

This is the time where you rely on your proactive prevention controls. Standard operating procedures that employees should not work when they are sick, proper hand washing should take place at the right times and cleaning procedures should be effective and well understood by employees. Continue to reinforce and train to your standard operating procedures, preventative controls and the food safety culture in your location.

Restaurants have a common goal with health departments protect their guests, their employees and the communities in which they serve. And right now, restaurant companies and Health Departments are taking additional actions to do just that. There has been tremendous effort by restaurant companies to keep ill employees out of the restaurants, increase handwashing even more than they already do and disinfect surfaces on an increased basis. Companies are also sharing prevention steps and best practices with each other.

Coronavirus is mainly transmitted from person to person via tiny droplets of saliva or other bodily fluids that float in the air after a cough or sneeze.

Contaminated objects and surfaces can also be important in the transmission of disease. It’s not entirely clear what role they play in transmitting the new coronavirus, but they play an important one for related viruses such as SARS and MERS.

However, it makes sense that something contaminated with the virus could pass it on, for example if a person touches it and then touches their nose, mouth or face.

So, if someone at risk of having the virus has been in your home, cleaning to reduce the amount of contamination on surfaces may help cut down your risk of further transmission of coronavirus. (It will also cut the risk of transmitting other pathogens.)

What’s the difference between cleaning and disinfection?

There’s a useful to distinction to make between cleaning and disinfection.

Cleaning means physically removing organic matter such as germs and dirt from surfaces. Disinfection means using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces.

Cleaning is very important, because organic matter may inhibit or reduce the disinfectant’s ability to kill germs.

How long will coronavirus survive in my house?

We are not exactly sure how long this coronavirus will survive on surfaces. If it is similar to other coronaviruses, it could survive a few hours – potentially up to several days. How long it survives could depend on temperature, humidity and what the surface is made of.

What could be contaminated in my house?

It’s hard to say exactly. When someone coughs or sneezes, especially if they don’t cover their mouth, it is likely surfaces close to them will be contaminated.

Hands are often responsible for transferring pathogens from one place to another, so items that people often touch are at greatest risk of being contaminated.

Frequently touched items may include TV remotes, fridge doors, kitchen cupboards, kitchen surfaces, taps and door handles. And of course, there are devices such as phones and iPads – but these may not be shared or touched by others frequently.

What should I use to clean and how?

The coronavirus is a delicate structure and it is vulnerable in the environment. Both heat and detergents, including soap, can stop it functioning.

Contaminated surfaces

If a surface becomes contaminated or you think it could be, cleaning it with a common household disinfectant will kill the virus. Remember to wash your hands after cleaning (or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser) and avoid touching your eyes, mouth or nose.

There are many options for what to use to clean, including paper towels, cloths or disposable wipes.

Brett Mitchell , Author provided

How you clean is important. You don’t want to “recontaminate” surfaces while cleaning. Working from one side of a surface to the other helps with this, using an “S” shape to clean.

If you are reusing a cloth, remember to wash it afterwards and let it dry. Laundering cloths in the washing machine with normal washing liquid is also likely to kill the virus, particularly on a hot wash.

Dishes and cutlery

Washing with hot water and detergent is fine for dishes and cutlery. A dishwasher is even better, because it can use hotter water than your hands will tolerate.

Clothing and linen

Use the warmest setting possible to wash contaminated laundry and make sure you allow it to dry completely. You may not want to ruin clothing or other materials, so always look at the manufacturer’s instructions.

Laundry from someone who is sick can be washed with other people’s items. If you are handling contaminated items such as towel or sheets, avoid shaking them before washing, to reduce the risk of contaminating other surfaces.

And remember to wash your hands immediately after touching any contaminated laundry.

Prevention is best

Remember that surfaces play a role in transmitting pathogens, so preventing them from becoming contaminated in the first place is as important as cleaning. There are some things you can do to reduce the amount of contamination of surfaces in your house:

– cover your cough and sneezes, ideally with a tissue but otherwise into your elbow, and wash your hands immediately

– wash your hands often, especially after going to the bathroom and before eating.

What do I do if someone in my home is sick?

It may be wise to think about which room in your home could be used to care for a sick member of your family. If possible, the ideal room is one that that is separate from other parts of your home and has a separate bathroom.

Cleaning this room when someone is sick also requires some thought. Further advice on caring for someone with coronavirus at home is available from the Department of Health.","Coronavirus claims checked by expertsHow long will coronavirus survive in my house?

An inventor from Chester hopes to use solar panel technology to produce safe drinking water in the developing world.

Barry Johnston, of King Street, used to run a business selling solar panels that provided hot water for washing and bathing in the home.

But he closed the business when it became impossible to compete with solar voltaic panels which generate electricity.

Now he wants to repurpose his original solar panel technology to pasteurise water so it is safe to drink. Developing countries could make use of this relatively inexpensive equipment with the advantage that many experience all year round sunshine.

The ethical entrepreneur, who has applied for a worldwide patent, said: “As a child I nearly died of a waterborne disease, hepatitis, and it’s always been at the back of my mind to work out how I can make water clean. Because one of the biggest killers of people around the world is water that’s infected with bacteria and viruses.”

He continued: “So I have redeveloped the solar panel to heat water that you would otherwise be unable to drink because it’s full of foecal bacteria. It’s also got a device that cools it, which makes it efficient and means you can drink the water. It will produce a quarter of a ton of water every day.”

Barry envisages the technology being used in a domestic or small community setting – or could even be set up at a refugee camp within hours and negates the need for plastic bottled water with its high carbon footprint.

The World Health Organisation has stumped up £30,000 towards testing costs as the project chimes with two of its goals – providing clean water and sanitation as well as affordable clean energy by 2030.

“My mission is to try to save half a million lives in 10-15 years using this technology,” added the father of four, a qualified environmental biologist, who enjoys open water swimming.

Barry has been working with Liverpool University who lent him students and facilities, including its roof.

“I was basically sitting on an English roof waiting for the sun,” explained the scientist who filled the upper water tank with pigeon poo. He drank the clean water that emerged at the other end in full knowledge the water had been heated to a high enough temperature over a sufficient length of time to kill any pathogens.

The next step is to test the technology out in the field so he has been working with an academic at Kenyatta University in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.

To bring the product to market will mean securing investors willing to finance the product to the tune of several million pounds.

But Barry stressed that for him the project was driven by a humanitarian motive, saying: “I would like it to make an income but the main thing is to save lives.”

Full of ideas, he has already invented a coating for overhead power lines that makes remote renewable energy more viable in a business that is ‘flying’.

“I’m just over 60 and I love work. I’m going to spend the next decade developing some of the ideas I’ve got,” he added.","Subscribe here Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy noticeAn inventor from Chester hopes to use solar panel technology to produce safe drinking water in the developing world.

Not enough toilets – and the ones there are often dirty. Beds crammed together. The only way to shower is with water from a bucket that everyone has to share. No soap or hand sanitizer.

People who've been quarantined in India for suspected exposure to coronavirus say conditions inside government facilities are unsanitary and unsafe — ripe to foment an outbreak rather than prevent one. Indians are posting photos and videos on social media of dirty sheets, broken toilets and trash littering crowded quarantine centers.

The World Health Organization says the arc of the global pandemic may depend on what huge, densely-populated countries like India do next.

The second-most populous country behind China, India has reported more than 550 coronavirus cases and ten deaths, as of Wednesday night local time — in a population of 1.3 billion. That's a relatively low infection rate per capita. But the fear is that if the virus spreads through slums – where some 600 million Indians lack regular access to clean water – many millions could die.

So in the early hours of Wednesday morning, India imposed the world's largest anti-coronavirus lockdown. For the next 21 days, no one across the country is allowed to leave their home except to go to buy food or medicine or to see a doctor. In a televised address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this is what's needed to ""save every Indian.""

Most of the country's coronavirus cases are believed to be people who traveled abroad or had contact with someone who did. So in addition to the lockdown, the Indian government is also sending anyone it suspects of having the virus — particularly incoming travelers — into mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Health Ministry says there are some 60,000 beds for quarantine at facilities it's set up at university campuses and military barracks across the country.

But people inside say the conditions are dismal.

""There are beds without anything to separate them. The men's bathroom is in pretty bad shape with no hot water. Sometimes there is no handwash [soap], and we've run out of hand sanitizer,"" Aaliyah Khan, 28, told NPR by phone from inside one such facility set up on a college campus in Gurgaon, outside India's capital. ""In the showers, there is only one bucket, and we have to share it with other passengers. So it's not the best facility to avoid contamination.""

Khan was taken to the facility after landing Saturday at New Delhi's airport, with her husband. The couple was married March 6 in India and went on a honeymoon in the United States. As coronavirus spread, they cut short their trip and headed home.

On arrival in India, they found a chaotic scene in the airport: serpentine queues to get through immigration and airport security, passengers heckling and jostling to get ahead in the line, and no social distancing. The couple say they waited nearly 24 hours — after a 14-hour flight from New York — to leave the airport.

Officials screening incoming passengers asked Khan and her husband, Behzad Fatmi, how they were feeling. They admitted to having headaches and sore throats — but said it was likely from their long flight and the ordeal at the airport. To their surprise, officials cleared Fatmi to go home but said Khan would have to go into a government quarantine facility for 14 days.

Neither husband or wife has been tested for the virus. The Indian government is grappling with a shortage of testing kits. Amid criticism about the low number of Indians being tested, it recently asked private companies to start manufacturing kits. But supplies remain low.

Fatmi says he tried to explain to Indian officials that he had been with his wife the entire time and their risk of exposure to coronavirus was likely identical.

""I said, 'We've been together! We traveled to New York and Los Angeles — so many places. So if she has something — god forbid — then I also have it. So please also take me to the quarantine facility,'"" Fatmi, 28, recalls. ""But they said, 'No, we will not do that.'""

Upon reaching the college campus, Khan says passengers were taken into a co-ed dormitory with rows of 30 to 40 beds arranged about three feet apart. There are no curtains or screens for privacy, she says.

""As a Muslim, I'm not supposed to be in such a place,"" Khan says. ""We are all in one hall, old and young, male and female.""

She says she and her fellow female ""inmates,"" as she calls them, have to share three toilets — which are often covered with excrement and littered with used sanitary napkins. On the first day, she says, they weren't given enough food and water.

""All of us are distressed, tired, sick of this situation,"" Khan says. ""It's so high-risk.""

Another tweet for the same. We are more than 40 people with only 3 washrooms and 5 large bed rooms. They want us to stay sanitised and this is what they give us. Guys this is a A MAJOR CONCERN. this way India cannot contain coronavirus only will get more cases. @PMOIndia @WHO pic.twitter.com/5q1wcr0xKX — Navya Dua (@NavyaDua) March 16, 2020

Such unsanitary conditions in quarantine facilities are ""totally unacceptable,"" Sujatha Rao, a former secretary with the Indian ministry of health and family welfare, told NPR in an email. This indicates that government officials at the lowest level, where quarantine is being carried out, do not sufficiently understand the importance of these measures, Rao says.

Despite police security, some Indians have been fleeing quarantine facilities. Unhygienic isolation units might also discourage people from reporting their symptoms, says Khan.

""We are paying the price for being honest,"" she says.

Authorities at Indian airports have been putting a stamp with indelible ink on the hands of passengers who've been asked to home quarantine. The stamp reads ""proud to protect"" with the name of the city and the date until which the individual has been instructed to stay at home. Police have been checking up with phone calls and surprise visits on those asked to self-quarantine. In some states, authorities are using cellphone data and GPS for contact tracing. That has raised privacy concerns.

Khan says that after their initial distress, she and her fellow quarantine mates are slowly starting to accept the situation they're in. She's become close with an elderly woman.

""The woman doesn't have a phone, so her daughters call me and I hand my phone to her,"" Khan explains.

They exchange stories about their families, as they live in limbo, awaiting a coronavirus test.","Quarantined In India: No Soap, Dirty Toilets, Not Enough Coronavirus TestsEnlarge this image toggle caption Waseem Andrabi/Hindustan Times via Getty Images Waseem Andrabi/Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesNot enough toilets – and the ones there are often dirty.

Wochit

Living in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic means dashing into the grocery store and grabbing something off the shelf is no longer the norm.

And if you order take-out from restaurants you're not dashing in to pick it up either. Now, most places carry it out to your car. Literally.

But people are worried. Is the food safe? What if someone has the virus and sneezed or coughed on that head of broccoli, the bin of apples or stack of avocados? What about take-out? Is it safe? Can the virus live on packaging? What about the food itself?

There are plenty of questions swirling around about food safety. But fresh produce and packaging have raised the most questions.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says there's no evidence of touching food or food packaging associated with transmission of COVID-19.

With restaurant workers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that: ""Anyone handling, preparing and serving food should always follow safe food handling procedures, such as washing hands and surfaces often.""

CORONAVIRUS WATCH: Stay informed on the latest COVID-19 updates, locally and nationally. Sign up for our newsletter here.

Felicia Goulet-Miller, an instructor of microbiology at Florida Gulf Coast University, told USA Today that food items, including fresh produce, can spread the disease.

""If the produce is contaminated by a sick person and you touch it and then touch your face, you can become infected,"" Goulet-Miller said, noting it's another reason not to touch your faces in public and to wash hands after touching things touched by others.

Kevin Kenny, a packaging expert and COO of Decernis, a food safety and regulatory compliance company, said it's highly unlikely the virus will get transferred as part of the initial packaging process because ""it's in a very sterile and clean environment.""

But at stores, he said, the food had multiple places it sat around: ""Your risk is much higher walking through the grocery stores, exposed to the clerk who was exposed to it, the money... it's impossible to eliminate risk. ""

With takeout, he said, there's some risk that food handlers could be exposed to be the virus. But he's less worried about that scenario. Take a pizza box made of cardboard. What's put inside that is actually fairly safe. After you open the box, you probably want to wash your hands before you remove the food and begin eating it.

We've all heard about coronavirus surviving on certain surfaces for several days: Cardboard for 24 hours, plastic and stainless steel up to 3 days and up to 4 days on glass.

Here's what Harvard's School of Public Health says: ""... because of the limited ability of coronavirus to survive on surfaces, the easiest way to minimize risk of infection from foods purchased at a store or delivered to your home is just let it sit in an out-of-the way place for three days.""

Keep in mind, you don't want to do this with foods that need to be immediately refrigerated, fresh produce, dairy, eggs, meat, poultry and seafood or foods that require freezing.

But this won’t work for foods that need immediate refrigeration or freezing, and they can be treated like fresh produce.

Although the FDA doesn't provide a guideline for wiping down packages with disinfecting wipes, plenty of people are doing so. You can wipe down the outside of gallons of milk, juice and some packaging with the disinfecting wipes.

What should consumers to do?

A YouTube video by Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen, a Grand Rapids family physician, on how to clean your groceries has gone viral, with more than 12 million views and 11,000 comments.

One the best explanations about the virus that VanWingen describes is to image it as glitter. And all that glitter is on the packages. The goal is to remove all that glitter.

He covers from bringing home groceries to washing to handling. Some things are extreme, but meant to eliminate risk. Some of what VanWingen recommends contradicts what the FDA recommends doing. For example, he washes apples in soapy water, rinses and then dries it, something the FDA cautions against.

The biggest takeaway of all with food safety is washing your hands.

Here's why: The virus is spread person to person through droplets from coughing and sneezing and who are within close contact with each other.

One thing consumers can do is shop smartly and follow the FDA's recommend four step guidelines for food safety.

How to grocery shop:

Shop only if you need to, minimizing trips to the store.

Shop at a time when it's not as busy. If you're a senior citizen or in a high risk group take advantage of stores special shopping hours.

Wipe down the cart with disinfecting wipes. Use hand sanitizer.

Exercise social distancing, staying 6 feet away from others.

Know what you want to buy. Don't handle products and put back on the shelf.

Keep foods separate in your cart. Separate raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs from other foods. Use plastic bags, if available, for raw meat, poultry and seafood. Place those products in separate bags from other foods.

Use a credit or debit card when paying.

What to do when you get groceries home:

The FDA recommends these four steps to food safety: Clean, separate, cook and chill. Here are its guidelines:

Clean:

Wash hands, utensils and all surfaces such as counters and cutting boards. Wash cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and counter tops with hot, soapy water especially after they’ve held raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Wash utensils after each use.

Wash hands often: Before, during and after preparing food. After handling raw meat, poultry, seafood, or their juices, or uncooked eggs. Before and after eating. After touching garbage.

Wash all fruits (even those with a peel like bananas) and vegetables : Cut away any damaged or bruised areas, then rinse fruits and vegetables under running water for 20 seconds without soap, bleach, or commercial produce washes.

Scrub firm produce like melons or cucumbers with a clean produce brush.

Dry produce with a paper towel or clean cloth towel.

Don’t wash meat, poultry, eggs, or bagged produce marked “pre-washed”.

Separate:

Avoid cross contamination among raw foods.

Use separate cutting boards and plates for produce, meat, poultry, seafood and eggs.

Use one cutting board for fresh produce or other foods that won’t be cooked before they’re eaten, and another for raw meat, poultry, or seafood.

Use separate plates and utensils for cooked and raw foods.

Wash thoroughly all plates, utensils, and cutting boards that touched raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs before using them again. Use hot, soapy water.

At home, place raw meat, poultry, and seafood in containers or sealed plastic bags. Freeze them if you’re not planning to use them within a few days.

In the fridge, keep eggs in their original carton and store them in the main compartment—not in the door.

Cook food to a safe temperature:

Use a food thermometer to be sure your food is safe. When you think your food is done, place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food, making sure not to touch bone, fat or gristle.

Keep food hot, 140 degrees or above, after cooking. Do not leave food out more than two hours.

If you’re not serving food right after cooking, keep it out of the temperature danger zone by using a heat source like a chafing dish, warming tray, or slow cooker .

Chill:

Refrigerate perishable foods within 2 hours:

Bacteria that cause food poisoning multiply quickest between 40 and 140 degrees,

Check your refrigerator setting is should be set to 40 degrees or below and your freezer to 0 degrees or below. Place an appliance thermometer to be sure.

Never leave perishable foods out of refrigeration for more than 2 hours. If the food is exposed to temperatures above 90 degrees (like a hot car or summer picnic), refrigerate it within 1 hour.

Place leftovers in shallow containers and refrigerated promptly to allow quick cooling.

Never thaw or marinate foods on the counter. Thaw or marinate in foods in the refrigerator.

Freezing does not destroy harmful germs, but it does keep food safe until you can cook it.

How to handle take out food:

Washing hands is paramount with take-out.

Food service workers and restaurants are required to follow food safety practices.

If you have to go inside exercise social distancing, keeping six feet away from others.

Choose curbside delivery so you don't have to get out of your car.

When you get home. Wash your hands before handling the take out bags, containers and wrappers.

Take the food out of container it was packaged in, transferring to a plate. Wash your hands before and after eating.

But as many of us spend more and more time in the house, it's not just public spaces that pose a risk anymore.

If you or one of your family members is one of the many asymptomatic victims of the outbreak, it could put your entire household in danger, all in a matter of days. The risk is even higher if you have older or immunocompromised loved ones in your home.

Want to minimize the chance of coronavirus spreading in your home or, worst-case scenario, between your family members? Take these cleaning precautions:

1. Clean your most-used high-touch surfaces regularly

This includes places like your doorknobs, the kitchen table, light switches, toilets, sinks, faucet handles, and even your TV remotes and cell phones. Pay close attention to places like the living room and kitchen, where your family likely congregates often. If you're cooking daily, wipe down the stove and refrigerator handles, too.

2. Use the right cleaners

Not all cleaning agents are effective in killing the virus. The Centers for Disease Control recommends using a diluted household bleach solution or an alcohol cleaning solution with at least 70% alcohol. Hydrogen peroxide is also effective, but it needs to sit on the surface for at least a minute to kill the virus.

Here's a full list of cleaners you can use to kill the coronavirus:

Bleach solutions (5 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water).

Alcohol-based cleaners with at least 70% alcohol.

Hydrogen peroxide.

Household disinfectants like Clorox (NYSE: CLX) and Lysol (OTCMKTS: RBGLY).

What won't work on coronavirus? Vodka, homemade hand sanitizer, or vinegar. (That last one won't smell great either).

3. Wear gloves when cleaning

In the event a surface has been contaminated with the coronavirus, you want to make sure you're protected. Wear disposable latex gloves, and replace them each time you start a new round of cleaning. Be careful not to touch any additional surfaces, linens, or household members while cleaning, either -- the virus could be transferred to the gloves from a contaminated surface.

4. Change out your linens often

Don't use and reuse towels during this time (even hand ones), as the virus can easily live in the fibers. Your best bet is to use towels only once after a bath or shower and use paper towels when drying your hands. Another option is to dedicate a hand towel for each individual family member just to be safe.

5. Wash laundry in warm water

Cold water isn't going to do anything to kill germs, so make sure to run your laundry on warm (or hot even) for the time being. If you're collecting laundry in a linen bag, you should also throw that in with your loads as well. If you suspect someone in your house might be infected, put their laundry in a separate trash bag and only handle it while wearing gloves.

The bottom line

Even if you or a household member isn't sick or showing symptoms, exercising caution right now is critical. Take proactive steps to keep your household clean and sanitized, and that could be what keeps your loved ones safe, healthy, and virus-free in the long run.

And remember, if you're struggling financially due to the COVID-19 outbreak. You have options. Here's what to do if you can't pay your mortgage or your rent.","If you or one of your family members is one of the many asymptomatic victims of the outbreak, it could put your entire household in danger, all in a matter of days.

“A good pan cleaner should mechanically brush the pan hard enough to remove excess material while not damaging the surface of the pan,” observed Mike Scouten, vice president of sales and marketing, Stewart Systems and Baker Thermal, both Middleby Bakery companies.

“And an air knife and vacuum coupled with the brush are needed to remove all the loosened debris,” he continued. “The sprayed-on glazes do build up over time, and while a good portion of this can be removed mechanically, not all of it can. As a result, this is currently the main driver in the number of cycles a baker can use these pans between needing to be recoated.”

Bundy Baking Solutions is developing a new pan cleaner with FME Food Machinery Engineering Ltd. to help clean the pans without damaging the coating. The company provides tips for protecting coatings, such as avoiding exposure to hot steam or too much moisture for prolonged periods, using detergents in low concentration, if necessary, and drying properly after washing, said Trevor Walker, vice president of North American sales, Bundy Baking Solutions.

Such common practices also are incorporated into most cleaning systems.

“Today’s pan-washing systems offer temperature adjustments to allow for detergents that activate and clean at lower temperature levels,” said Kevin Quinn, sales manager, Douglas Machines Corp. “Using lower wash temperatures can save expensive coatings on pans.”

He added that Douglas’ washer line provides for a sanitizing rinse using hot water rather than chemical sanitation, which reduces cost on chemicals and exposure of multiple chemicals on the pans.

The Food Safety Modernization Act played a major role in upgrading cleaning procedures in recent years.

“Recirculated wash systems have replaced the hose or pressure washer, which send water down the floor drain,” Mr. Quinn explained. “Continuous motion tunnel washers are now designed with multiple recirculated tanks so that the final sanitizing rinse water consumption can be reduced by as much as 70% over conventional designs.”

In bread and bun bakeries, seeds and toppings remain a primary culprit for cleaning and allergen control.

“Pans for cakes and muffins are best cleaned using a pan washer to remove the sugar and fat content,” noted Bruce Campbell, vice president of dough processing technologies, AMF Bakery Systems. “Doing this can extend the life of pan coatings by 10% to 15%.”

Mr. Quinn said the Douglas tunnel washer can be customized to provide high processing speeds for sheet and muffin pan lines.

“Our tunnel washers can be used out-of-line with operators at each end,” he said. “Or they can be designed for in-line operation by accepting pans from a depanning device into the washer and then out to an exit conveyor to be returned to the baking operation.”

To dry-clean pans on high-speed lines, AMF bun and bread pan cleaners use dry brushes and gravity by inverting the pans and ambient air blowers to remove crumbs and topping debris stuck in them.

“This reduces the impact of burning the leftover crumbs which tends to generate extra heat and damage the pan glazing material,” said Bobby Martin, executive product manager, AMF. “Bread loaves left in pans will result in crooked stacks with the risk of tilting over as well as pans being stuck together at the unstacker.”

Overall, bakers need to consider all costs by calculating the economics of the coatings vs. the value obtained from them, said Mr. Walker.

“Factors including proximity to a recoating facility, use of release agents, along with baking temperature, pan-handling practices and cleaning are important in determining the right type of coating,” he said.

And don’t forget to include overall pan operations as part of the company’s broader environmental program.

“Today’s pan coatings are helping bakeries be more sustainable because of their longer usage cycles and comprehensive service,” Mr. Walter said. “Easy and consistent release of products means fewer cripples and bakery waste.”

Paying close attention to the finest details can uncover new roads to profitability as bakeries test the limits of working in the fast lane.

What is it and can it make your vehicle sick?

We at Kelley Blue Book want to help you make informed decisions on what the best practices are to keep your vehicle as clean as possible while reducing the spread of the virus.

What is the coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are viruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illnesses like the common cold. The novel coronavirus is a new, previously unidentified, strain.

The virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections link to a live animal market. It spreads quickly from person to person. It is now spreading through the community. Containment recommendations include a quarantine in place and constantly cleaning surfaces for at least a 14-day period.

Consulting with a doctor and submitting for medical tests will ensure that you are either past the point of infection or not carrying the virus. Either way, it is essential to keep in contact with your medical practitioner until they give you the “all clear.”

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because of the virus’s poor survivability on surfaces, there is a very low risk from products packaged and shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. There is currently no evidence of COVID-19 transmission by the receipt of imported goods, nor are there any cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. through such imported goods.

Can my vehicle get sick from the coronavirus?

Nothing will happen to your car, truck or SUV should the coronavirus get onboard. But if not properly cleaned, your vehicle could be a hotbed of coronavirus and other infections and germs. It is for this reason that we suggest using hand sanitizers and disinfecting wipes to wipe down the interior of your car and any other area that could be considered a high-touch area. A good rule of thumb is to clean areas that you contact regularly and to sanitize your hands on an hourly basis.

This applies doubly in the case of rental vehicles, ride-sharing vehicles like Uber UBER, -2.64% and Lyft, LYFT, -1.82% share cars, share bikes and taxis. Be sure to wipe any areas that human hands typically touch. These include door handles, door latches, lock buttons, seat belts and buckles, window buttons, mirrors, radio and climate control buttons and more.

One more bit of advice: We don’t recommend storing a large pump bottle of hand sanitizer in your car. The heat buildup may cause the alcohol in the sanitizer to “boil,” resulting in an expansion of the sanitizer’s bottle. This, in turn, might result in leakage and a mess that will require an extensive cleaning effort. It is a better idea to carry a more manageable-sized bottle, that can be on or near your personal effects, whether in the home, office or on the road.

What’s the best way to clean your vehicle to reduce the existence of coronavirus?

Alcohol works best in your automobile or SUV’s cabin. It is the cleaner most used by manufacturers of most automotive interiors today. All it takes is a quick wipe to clean most germs and fingerprints. Soap and water will work, too.

We suggest spending extra time on the steering wheel. The steering wheel has four times the amount of germs found on an average toilet seat, thanks to all the cracks and crevices on the rim and spokes, according to Expedia Travel Group’s website, CarRentals.com. For this reason, we suggest using disinfecting wipes to clean all the surfaces on the steering wheel. These include the redundant controls for radio, voice control, cruise control, navigation, and paddle shift levers. And don’t forget about the gear selector lever or the turn indicator stalks.

Also clean the door and center console armrests, display screens, cupholders, cubbyholes, air conditioner vents and even the door “grab handles.” You touch them more than you realize and are rife with bacteria and could carry coronavirus. You will very likely be surprised by the amount of dirt your wipes will pick up.

What not to use

We would advise against using any type of bleach or hydrogen peroxide on the vehicle’s interior. Both chemicals will put an end to the coronavirus germs, but they will also cause damage to the vinyl and plastics used in most modern vehicles today.

Under no circumstances should you use any ammonia-based cleaning products. These can be found in “blue glass cleaners.” (You know which we are talking about.) The ammonia breaks down the vinyl on the dashboard, making it sticky when subjected to heat and light. Additionally, to avoid damage to anti-glare coatings, the glass cleaner should not be used on touch display screens.

Finally, if you find yourself without any alcohol or other cleaners, a good scrubbing with soap and water will fill the bill. The coronavirus resides in a protective pocket that acts as a facilitator to infect other cells, but is broken down by soap. Heavy-duty cleaning will weaken the coronavirus. It just may take a little bit longer to effectively clean it properly. Don’t scrub too hard, though, as you might find you are removing some of the surface coatings or dyes.

Wash your hands, often

Finally, we cannot say this enough: Clean your hands regularly. Even after cleaning your vehicle properly, if your hands are dirty, you are putting germs right back onto an already clean surface.

A month ago, the answer for many people was probably something like, “Put them away.” With coronavirus concerns though, people are wondering how or if they should be cleaning their food.

Sue DeHart reached out to CapRadio. She’s retired and lives in Fair Oaks. She says she had previously rinsed off the veggies when she got them home, but now wonders if that’s enough. After finding a variety of posts, ideas, and suggestions online, she came to us with this question:

“Some things say wipe everything down. Some say soak your produce in a solution of bleach water and other sites say nothing to worry about. So I’d like to know what I should do,” she said.

Ron Fong, president of the California Grocers Association, says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have different recommendations for different types of surfaces.

""The CDC has recommended plain old hot water and soap on hard surfaces like cans,"" Fong said. ""For produce, don’t use bleach water. Use regular warm water to wash your produce.”

Fong says you can also use soap and water or a disinfecting wipe to clean the grocery bags, too.

As for exposure and social distancing, DeHart and her husband had already taken to using online shopping before the virus, and then picking up curbside.

”The person who brought the groceries out was wearing gloves and all she had to do was open the trunk and pop everything in the trunk so we really didn’t have any contact,” she said by phone this week.

But she wonders about the possibility of the virus touching any number of things within a store, especially now that she has to return for more groceries.

“I’ve been reading about the number of people who touch things and it’s handled many times and I’ve seen conflicting things online,” she said.

Jennifer Cliff is the Marketing Director for Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op. She says for the time being, the store is encouraging new bags for every shopping trip to minimize the risk of someone bringing the virus in, and staff are wiping or spraying almost everything in sight.

""Store support, grocery clerks, front end clerks, everyone pretty much no matter what department you work in is reminded to constantly hand wash,” Cliff said by phone from her office (grocery stores are considered essential according to health agencies locally and statewide). “We’re wiping things down with sanitation spray, wiping the hand carts down after every every transaction, etc. That’s happening pretty much after every transaction as they’re turned back in. It’s a storewide effort.”

She says DeHart is smart to use online services to do her shopping for her, or a store service in which an employee does the shopping. The co-op has a delivery service and is working to roll out that kind of curbside pickup program by the end of the week.

As for the method of payment, CDC says the virus lives on hard surfaces longer than fabric. But that doesn’t mean stores want cash instead of plastic.

“Management has taken the position of trying to reduce cash, trying to reduce that exchange between two individuals. The more we’re not touching other folks’ stuff, the better. That is encouraging people to use credit and debit,” Cliff said. “I’m a habitual user of Apple Pay because that’s just the easiest (way) of not touching anything.”

Some stores, like Ralph’s in Southern California and its parent company Kroger, are going a step further to separate shoppers from employees. Ralph’s has begun erecting plastic barriers similar to sneeze guards at checkouts.

Some stores, like Winco, have signs informing customers that the stores are no longer open 24 hours to give employees time to restock and clean during the overnight hours.

During several trips to the Yuba City Winco, cashiers had wipes next to the register but not all of them were wearing gloves, nor were they wiping down the conveyor belts or the card readers. Also, staff collecting the carts were not wiping down the handles. A Winco store manager referred all questions to the corporate office in Idaho, which did not return calls for comment.

Target released new guidelines this week that follow what Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op already has in place. Target’s website now states an employee will be responsible for cart cleanliness. The stores will add floor decals at the checklanes to encourage social distancing between shoppers in line. It will also clean checklanes on a rotating basis after each use. Stores will also temporarily stop accepting returns and are waiving any fees for paper or plastic store bags. People who bring their own bags in will be asked to bag their own groceries.

Cliff from the Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op says she’s proud of the job employees have been doing.

“It’s hard because you can’t see what your enemy is,"" she said. ""It’s pretty much like you have to assume that it’s on everything.”","As for exposure and social distancing, DeHart and her husband had already taken to using online shopping before the virus, and then picking up curbside.

The CDC suggests you clean and disinfect all ""high-touch areas"" in your home, from doorknobs to smartphones.

Use a combination of household cleaners and disinfectants. Wear gloves and throw them out after you clean.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, more and more people are looking for ways to disinfect their living spaces.

It's always a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly and avoid close contact with people who have the disease, but there are other thing you can do to deep-clean your home.

The coronavirus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, and the CDC says that current evidence suggests it ""may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.""

There's already been an increase in demand for cleaning services all around the world, and numerous schools and businesses have closed for deep cleanings.

Here's how the CDC suggests you do a deep-clean.

Remember to clean first, disinfect later

Cleaning refers to the removal of germs from surfaces. Disinfecting refers to the use of chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. Both can lower the risk of infection spread, but you should clean first, disinfect after.

Don't forget to read the label on your disinfectants. Some need to remain wet for anywhere from two to ten minutes.

Use household cleaners and disinfectants on frequently touched surfaces

Look at tables, doorknobs, light switches and toilets as places to start. Before you disinfect dirty surfaces, clean them with detergent or soap and water.

For disinfecting, you can use alcohol solutions that contains at least 70% alcohol, household disinfectants registered with the EPA, or diluted household bleach solutions. Don't use expired products, and don't mix bleach with any other cleaners. Common household disinfectant brands on the EPA list include Lysol and Clorox.

The CDC recommends people create their own bleach solutions by mixing 5 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water.

Wear gloves and make sure you have good ventilation while you clean

Wear disposable gloves and throw them out after you're done using them, according to the CDC.

If you're using reusable gloves, don't use them for other purposes, and clean your hands immediately after the gloves are removed. Peel the gloves away from your body, pulling them inside out, and try not to let the outside of the glove touch your skin.

Wash dirty laundry on the warmest setting possible

There is no need to shake dirty laundry, as that can spread viruses through the air. Use the warmest appropriate water setting for washing the items and let them dry completely afterward.

If you're not using gloves when washing dirty laundry, make sure to wash your hands afterwards. Also, consider washing the laundry bag that holds your clothes, as that surface can also collect germs and viruses.

Clean your electronics

Phones and tablets are what the CDC calls ""high touch"" surfaces, so you're going to want to clean them. You should avoid using rubbing alcohol, disinfectants, or similar sprays, Business Insider previously reported, in part because using them can damage the protective coating on your phone's screen.

Instead, turn off your device, lightly dampen a microfiber cloth with soap and water, and scrub the screen. You can also use a UV sanitation device, which beams UV-C rays at your phone in order to kill germs.

The outlook doesn’t look good at the moment, but Singapore does have the situation under control, and there’s something you can do.



How to protect yourself and your loved ones



Adopt good personal hygiene habits. As we visit shared spaces, in particular high-traffic public places such as public toilets and hawker centres, keep in mind that cleanliness is really important.



Are you a highly hygienic person? Have a look at these “7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene” see how many of them you practice.



1. Hand-some rewards

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, it kills viruses that may be on your hands!

2. Second time’s the charm

Monitor your temperature twice daily – being “hot” is not a compliment!

3. No issue with a tissue

Use tissues when you sneeze or cough to avoid causing an issue for others. Droplets spread viruses!

4. Bin there, done that

Bin litter, used masks and tissues

5. Without a tray(s)

Eat on food trays where possible, return your trays and keep tables clean, leave no trace of waste

6. No-fly zone

Keep your surroundings clean, well-ventilated and pest-free

7. Get to the bottom (of cleanliness)

Keep toilets clean and dry

We’ll also need to make changes to some things we do daily. We should all:

Refrain from shaking hands;

Use serving spoons when sharing food.

On top of this, stay home if you’re feeling unwell and do not go to work or attend social gatherings. Remember to practice safe distancing. Many clusters in Singapore can be traced to someone with symptoms attending a gathering although ill.



Raising hygiene standards – the SG Clean movement



Launched on 16 Feb 2020, the SG Clean movement calls on all Singaporeans to adopt good personal and environmental hygiene habits. It also calls on organisations to adhere to sanitation and hygiene checklists by authorities.



Increased inspection and cleaning of public places



Since end-January 2020, NEA has stepped up inspection of public toilets, finding and fixing hygiene gaps like missing soap lotion. Also, since early February 2020, cleaning of public places of high human traffic has been stepped up, like table-tops and toilets in hawker centres being cleaned every two hours. NEA has also increased enforcement against public hygiene offences, like spitting and littering.



Amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act



To ensure high standards of cleanliness in Singapore, amendments to set mandatory cleaning standards will be made to the Environmental Public Health Act later this year. Premise managers will also need submit and implement an environmental sanitation programme.



SG Clean quality mark



The SG Clean quality mark, a marker of whether a place’s cleanliness is of a high standard, has been rolled out hawker centres and coffee shops. Those with the quality mark will have to commit and adhere to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists, covering areas such as management oversight, cleaning methodology, toilet cleanliness, and general public hygiene.



It is being rolled out to various sectors, covering premises with high human traffic, like hawker centres, train stations and bus interchanges, schools, hotels, tourist attractions, shopping malls and so on.



Everyone has a part to play in keeping Singapore clean to fight the spread of COVID-19. Keeping up a high level of personal and raising public hygiene standards together will help reduce risks to public health from the COVID-19 situation and beyond.

Wherever there is poor sanitation, disease and illness spread. That’s why those who work in the waste management industry are just as much an “essential service” right now as are health care, pharmacy, grocery, and restaurant workers. Dealing with all the trash society produces is a dirty and dangerous job even in normal times; during a global health pandemic, it gets even riskier. The Department of Homeland Security agrees, deciding on March 20 to designate waste workers an “Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce.”

According to the EPA, each person in the United States produces an average of four-and-half pounds of solid waste every day; exactly how that number might change under quarantine conditions is unknown. It’s possible that sanitation workers could soon be facing an onslaught of residential garbage as millions of people stay home and put a lot more boxes, bags, jars, food take-out containers, hand sanitizer bottles, Lysol wipes, latex gloves, and masks out on the curb.

That means heavier loads and longer hours—as well as the potential for exposure to COVID-19-contaminated trash.

For the men and women who empty the bins we all put out each week and the landfill workers who bury the stuff, there are new questions about safety and paid time off for sick employees. What precautions are the garbage companies taking to look after workers’ health and well-being?

Harrison Persinger, who works for a waste collection firm in the Detroit metro area, says that “Signage regarding COVID-19 has been posted” at his garage, “and drivers have been provided with gloves and cleaners.”

Despite significant automation of the industry in recent years, much of the work is still done manually. A single worker on a residential route comes into contact with the garbage of hundreds or even thousands of different individuals every day. This raises concerns about how long the virus survives on surfaces—including on the surfaces of objects put in the garbage can.

“Elevated risk of exposure”

Even more perilous is the mountain of medical waste being created as hospitals and clinics ramp up coronavirus testing and treatment. Every single COVID-19 test, for instance, produces a pile of personal protective equipment that goes straight to disposal—gowns, masks, face visors, gloves, and more. When it’s disposed of properly, the most dangerous medical waste is supposed to be incinerated and never touched by sanitation workers. Beyond items such as needles and other sharps, though, a lot of these materials go into the regular garbage.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has issued COVID-19 guidelines for the industry that say beyond “typical engineering and administrative controls,” no special measures are required at this time. It acknowledges, however, that waste workers are at an elevated risk of exposure. “Workers and employers should manage municipal (e.g., household, business) solid waste with potential or known COVID-19 contamination like any other non-contaminated municipal waste,” the agency says.

But the National Waste and Recycling Association, the industry’s main employers’ organization, is requesting that federal and state authorities grant regulatory exemptions on a number of other fronts in order to keep garbage trucks on the streets and waste under control. These include such things as extensions on expiring drivers’ licenses and delays in regularly-scheduled physical exams for workers at a time when medical facilities are already strained.

The NWRA’s Healthcare Waste Institute has also issued its own FAQs about COVID-19-contaminated waste for workers to consult.

For workers on the garbage frontlines, some guidelines are easier to follow than others. Social distancing, for example, is not so easy for Persinger and his colleagues to stick to. Keeping space between co-workers has been recommended at his yard, Persinger says, “but it’s been difficult to go about, especially with our two- to three-man trash crews sitting together in a truck for a decent chunk of the day.” If one crewmember gets sick, it could be easy for his co-workers to end up infected as well.

That’s why the Teamsters union is asking CEOs at the “Big Three” garbage collectors—Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections—to provide details on the steps they’re taking to ensure the health and safety of sanitation workers.

In a letter sent to the companies on March 16, Chuck Stiles, director of the union’s Waste and Recycling Division, made a number of specific requests. Stiles wanted to know how workers will be protected from coronavirus-contaminated waste, what kind of risk management plans are in place, and what personal protective equipment and safety training is being provided.

Stiles also asked whether the waste corporations are going to grant increased paid time off for any workers who end up ill or stuck in quarantine. “Many Americans will transition into telework to avoid exposure, including many of your corporate employees,” Stiles wrote to the trash executives. “Our members, however, won’t have that option. Their boots will be needed on the ground each and every day.” Given existing attendance and PTO policies, Stiles said that “infected employees may find themselves…unable to afford to take unpaid medical leave.”

Waste Management, the country’s largest employer in the waste sector—along with competitors Republic Services and Waste Connections—says it is sticking to information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevision (CDC), the Public Health Agency of Canada, and state and local agencies. No clear word on extended paid time off, yet.

At his non-unionized Detroit-area employer, Persinger says there’s been no mention of extra paid sick days, either.

Essential public service in a time of crisis

The solid waste industry directly employs nearly 470,000 people in the U.S., with a payroll approaching $30 billion, and many of those workers are employed by municipal governments or smaller private collection companies other than the Big Three.

The New York Department of Sanitation (DSNY), the largest city-operated waste collector in the United States, saw its first employee diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 18 at a facility in Queens. The workplace had to be immediately shut down, cleaned, and disinfected.

A DSNY spokesperson told the media that extra risk mitigation measures are in place department-wide, including equipping garages with extra sanitizing materials, the wipe-down of all surfaces before and after each shift, and hand-washing guidelines. It is also moving up daily collection schedules to 5 a.m. to expose workers to even less crowds or street traffic.

The city’s sanitation commissioner sent a letter to Teamsters Local 813 this week recognizing workers as “essential employees who perform a critical public service for the City in this time of crisis.”

For those sanitation workers who are typically assigned to commercial and industrial pick-up routes rather than households, a different kind of danger is emerging: job loss. With factories, stores, malls, schools, restaurants, and offices shuttered across the nation, there is the potential for an unprecedented fall off in the amount of recyclable materials and garbage coming from such institutions.

Mike Hellstrom, secretary-treasurer of Laborers Local 108 representing some private-sector workers in New York, told Politico this week, “We’re hoping it’s a temporary, big ugly hiccup and that there’s a really rapid recovery on the other side of it.” The longer quarantines and business closures drag on, though, the grimmer the situation could become. “If it lasts until August,” Hellstrom added, “I would say call me back…and I’ll tell you how many people have been laid off.”

Meanwhile, for Harrison Persinger back in Detroit, busy season is on the horizon. “The region I work in is about to begin compost season.” Yard waste and leaf pick-up ratchets up in April, and since most people are going to be spending a lot of time at home, they’ll have time for more gardening and landscaping. “Tonnage typically increases for trash and recycle” this time of year, too, he says, “due to spring cleaning and increasing summer consumption.”

With COVID-19 turning life upside down and the economy along with it, no one can yet predict exactly how the waste management industry will have to adjust or change, but Persinger is committed to the job and is ready for what comes. He sees the job of sanitation workers as a public service. “Rain, snow, plague, or apocalypse, we will be here.”","That’s why those who work in the waste management industry are just as much an “essential service” right now as are health care, pharmacy, grocery, and restaurant workers.
What precautions are the garbage companies taking to look after workers’ health and well-being?
When it’s disposed of properly, the most dangerous medical waste is supposed to be incinerated and never touched by sanitation workers.
It acknowledges, however, that waste workers are at an elevated risk of exposure.

But have you ever thought about how dirty your home or office coffee maker can get after all those uses?

Whether it’s the single-serve Keurig, espresso Nespresso machine or a traditional coffee maker, it’s important to keep these appliances clean to prevent the growth of bacteria, yeast or even mold.

Lisa Yakas, senior product manager of Consumer Products at NSF International, formerly known as the National Sanitation Foundation, says that these appliances are relatively harmless as long as clients follow the manufacturer’s cleaning directions.

However, without routine cleaning, they can get pretty grimy.

Mold and yeast like to grow in your coffee maker

Yakas points to the water reservoir — the part of the coffee maker that stores water — as one of the dirtiest parts of the kitchen if not cleaned on a regular basis.

A NSF International study of kitchen products in 2011 found that 50% of the sampled reservoirs in coffee makers had mold or yeast.

“It wasn’t on their radar,” Yakas said of the families involved in the study.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, food borne yeast and mold can be a source of sensitivity for people with allergies and may even cause infections.

Yakas recommends to always empty out the unused water in the reservoir and leave the lid off to let it dry out.

“Some of these organisms like these moist and damp places, that’s where they like to grow,” Yakas said. “If you eliminate that moisture altogether… then you eliminate their conditions to grow.”

Her motto is “keep it dry and keep it clean.”

Other places germs appear in and around your coffee maker

Chuck Gerba, professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, said coffee break rooms have more bacteria than restrooms in most office buildings.

If the office has a coffee pot, Gerba says the first thing that gets germiest is the coffee pot handle. However, on a single-use machine, he says the top of the machine where the people place the plastic pod has the most germs.

“When you use the machine, it could get in your coffee,” he said.

Gerba also said that another big source of germs are coffee cups, especially if they’re shared amongst co-workers. A 1997 study he co-authored examining office coffee cups found that E. coli and even fecal matter were found in some of the cups.

According to Gerba, the sponges that people were using to clean out their cups were actually contaminating them. If the office has a dishwasher, he recommends using it.

“Dishwashers work great because you have a high temperature and it dries out,” he said.

However, if the sponge can’t be avoided, Gerba says it’s important to wipe the coffee cup dry with a paper towel instead of using a cloth or letting it dry out on a rack.

How to clean your coffee maker: Keurig, Nespresso, Black & Decker, Mr. Coffee

Both Gerba and Yakas say that the heat from the coffee maker can kill most germs, but it shouldn’t replace ritual cleaning or descaling, which should happen every one to six months depending on the manufacturer’s recommendations.

“While it’s possible the heat of coffee brewing might kill some microbes, why take a chance?” Yakas said. “We think it’s best to go to the source and keep the coffee maker clean.”

So, here’s how to properly clean your coffee maker according to the product’s manufacturer:

Keurig: Turn off the Keurig and empty out the water reservoir, removing the filter. Pour Keurig descaling solution into the reservoir. After pouring the entire solution in, fill the empty bottle with water and add that into the reservoir. Power the Keurig back on, place a mug, perform a cleansing brew using 10 oz. brew size and then pour out the contents of the mug. Repeat until the “add water” light comes on. Let the Keurig sit for about 30 minutes (with the power still on) and then rinse out the reservoir thoroughly. Fill the reservoir with fresh water and perform at least 12 cleansing brews.

Nespresso: Rinse and clean the water tank before filling it with fresh water and then put the water tank in place. Rinse the cup support and place a container of at least 0.5 liters under under the coffee outlet. Then open the machine head, let the used capsule be ejected, and empty and rinse the capsule container. Close the head and turn lever until in the “locked” position. Push the button three times within two seconds, the button should start blinking quickly. It will take less than two minutes for a flow to come out, then the cleaning procedure will run automatically for five minutes for three cycles. The company urges that consumers to not use any cleaning agents or vinegar in the process. The company offers their own descaling products to use instead.

Black & Decker: The coffee maker will indicate when it’s time for a cleaning cycle. Fill the reservoir with equal parts white vinegar and cold water, then place a paper filter into the filter basket and close the cover. Press the auto clean button on the control panel. About half of the liquid will pour into the pot right away, but the second half will take about 30 minutes. When the process is done, the pot should be full and the coffee maker will automatically shut off. Before brewing coffee again, run another cycle with just cold water.

Mr. Coffee: Some traditional coffee makers aren’t programmable with a cleaning cycle, in which it’s recommended to clean your coffee maker with the vinegar solution every 40 to 80 uses. Instead of using the auto clean button, turn on the coffee maker until the carafe is three cups full. Turn if off and wait 30 minutes, then turn it back on and brew the rest.

Gerba said that vinegar will clear out most of the mold and yeast, but it’s not considered to be a disinfectant by the U.S. Environmental and Protection Agency and doesn’t get rid of all the bacteria that can make a person sick.

That’s why Yakas recommends taking out each removable piece of the coffee maker and cleaning it by hand. Some coffee maker parts are dishwasher safe.

All the worst stuff from everywhere in the outside world gets dragged in and stays. All the good stuff follows us in, too, but that subtle whiff of pine on Uncle Fred's jacket is far less consequential than COVID-19.

Luckily, keeping your car clean isn't all that complicated. The most effective weapon against COVID-19 is soap (for seats and dashboards, of course). It doesn’t need to be antibacterial. Pretty much any household soap will do. Even that frou-frou decorative bar with the ribbon around it probably has the right stuff in it. Soap interacts with viruses in much the same way it does oils: it breaks them down. So a simple soap scrub will annihilate any viruses in your car, and soap is unlikely to degrade your interior surfaces the way many cleaners can. But that business about scrubbing your hands for 20 seconds applies here, too. You can’t just move some soap around and then rinse it off. Soap needs time to surround and break down the virus.



When cleaning, wear disposable gloves. And be sure to pay special attention to door handles, steering wheel, shifter, seatbelt buckles, and other surfaces you touch the most.

What about the screen? you ask. Your instinct is correct: It's not a good idea to be splashing water all over your infotainment system or even the steering wheel (there are plenty of electronics in those today), and bleach solutions are obviously not a good idea for interior fabrics and materials. Automakers including Toyota and Volkswagen recommend against using solvents or alcohol-based products on touchscreens. You can use a bleach-free wipe on a touchscreen, occasionally, but a better strategy is to keep the fingers clean that are going to touch the touchscreen.

This comprehensive list from the Environmental Protection Agency names cleaners that are effective against the virus, and it includes plenty of bleach-free sprays and wipes.



As always with a car interior, be sure to test the product in an inconspicuous area in case of unforeseen discoloration. And if you have a leather interior, be aware that many cleaning products can dry out the leather. After cleaning and drying, you should make a second pass over any leather surfaces with a leather conditioner to avoid cracking.



And most important, if you’re showing any symptoms of having contracted coronavirus, get the necessary treatment; see CDC's website for the latest information.

Health officials have not yet documented the transmission of the new coronavirus from contaminated surfaces, but because they think it spreads through droplets, they’re encouraging people to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs and faucets.

Practising good hand hygiene, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze, and cleaning and disinfecting oft-handled items “are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19,” according to the Public Health Agency of Canada’s website.

But which surfaces should you pay attention to most? And how should you clean and disinfect for the virus? Here’s a guide:

How long can the coronavirus survive outside the body?

In a controlled laboratory environment, coronaviruses can live for a few hours or up to a day on a surface. But when they are shed out of people’s noses or mouths, the organic load – in other words, “snot” – can help preserve them a little longer, about a couple of days to a maximum of five, says Jason Tetro, author of The Germ Code and The Germ Files.

So far, the evidence suggests the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can survive for hours to days on a variety of surfaces, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It says, however, that transmission of coronaviruses is more common through respiratory droplets than contaminated objects or materials, and that the latter route of transmission has not been documented for the new virus.

Mr. Tetro explains this has to do with its minimal infectious dose. That is, you need to introduce a certain amount of the virus into the body for it to gain hold and start an infection.

“Perhaps there’s not enough of the virus that’s coming out of somebody, and coming onto a surface for somebody [else] to touch it, pick it up and reinoculate themselves,” he says, though he cautions it’s still not known what the minimal infectious dose of the new virus is.

How do you get rid of the virus?

Coronaviruses, much like flu viruses, are called “enveloped,” which means they have a shell made of lipids or fats, Mr. Tetro says. Thus, any surfactant, such as regular soap or a household product that breaks up fat, will be effective against the new virus.

For households, the CDC says people should wear disposable gloves, which should be thrown out after each use, to routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as tables and light switches. They should also wash their hands immediately after removing the gloves.

Dirty surfaces should be cleaned with soap and water before disinfecting them, the CDC advises. For disinfection, it says diluted household bleach, solutions with at least 70 per cent alcohol, and household disinfectants registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should be effective. (For bleach, use five tablespoons for every four litres of water.)

Disposable gloves should also be used when handling laundry of anyone ill, the CDC says. To minimize the possibility of spreading the virus by air, avoid shaking out dirty laundry, it says. Launder items according to manufacturers’ instructions, using the warmest water settings possible and dry completely. And clean and disinfect clothes hampers, it says.

How can you navigate germy surfaces in public?

Many buildings now are designed to reduce the need for people to touch surfaces, with elements like automatic doors, door-less entries to washrooms, and automatic taps and towel dispensers, says Stephen Hoption Cann, an epidemiologist and clinical professor at the University of British Columbia’s school of population and public health.

Story continues below advertisement

If you can’t avoid contact, though, try not to use your hands. Instead, you can use a sleeve of your coat or a paper towel to open doors or push elevator buttons, he suggests.

Your likelihood of getting sick from touching a public surface or object can vary, Mr. Tetro says. Items like cafeteria trays or tables can be more risky, since they are touched by numerous people and are handled more than just fleetingly, he says. By comparison, the hand rails of the stairs to a subway station may be touched by just as many people, but not likely long enough to spread a lot of germs.

Regardless, it’s best to frequently wash your hands or use hand sanitizer, as instructed by health officials. Until more is known about the new coronavirus, it’s impossible to say you won’t get it from touching surfaces, Mr. Tetro says.

Health Canada recommends washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using regular soap and warm water, and wiping them dry.

When using hand sanitizer, Mr. Tetro says you should cover your hands so that they are wet for a minimum of 15 seconds.

Still, as you board the aircraft and sit in your seat, you might find yourself reconsidering inflight hygiene -- and wondering just how thoroughly the aircraft's actually been cleaned before you boarded.

CNN Travel spoke to airlines, airplane companies and medical experts to find out what's been done to ensure you're flying in as hygienic an environment as possible, and what passengers can do for extra reassurance.

Normal cleaning procedure

Christian Rooney is the manager of JetWash Aero, a specialist aviation cleaning company based in the UK that's tasked with turning around aircraft between flights.

Rooney tells CNN Travel that the cleaning process varies depending on the schedule of the aircraft in question.

When aircraft downtime is very limited, some of what Rooney calls the ""very straightforward cleaning,"" such as removing old newspapers and passenger trash, will be done by the cabin crew at the end of the previous flight.

""A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night -- or when there is more downtime -- and it includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, [overhead bins], seats etc. This may take up to an hour or longer,"" explains Rooney.

""An airline will also always schedule a 'deep interior clean' every month or six weeks. This clean takes several hours and is extremely thorough.""

Cleaning products and disinfectants are approved by aircraft manufacturers, says Rooney.

""Some of the disinfectants we use are effective against a wide range of pathogens and are known to inactivate complex viruses with similar properties to SARS, E. coli, avian flu, MRSA etc,"" he adds.

These offer antimicrobial protection for up to 10 days, he says.

Stephanie Biron, a recently retired flight attendant who used to work for American Airlines, tells CNN Travel that, in her experience, standards of aircraft cleaning would vary.

""A lot of times you come on and it's not terribly satisfactory, but you have to rely on the individuals doing their jobs, because that's what they've been paid to do,"" she says.

""Sometimes you come on and you have to go out and tell the agent, 'look, the plane looks terrible. We need somebody to come on and redo it.' It just varies all the time. Sometimes you come on in the morning and they deep cleaned the whole thing, or at least they told you they have.""

Passenger personal hygiene

Some airlines have requested additional measures due to the current climate, says Rooney.

""We have seen an uptick in the requirements and levels of disinfection, spraying and fumigation of the cabin, as the airlines look to address concerns over the coronavirus,"" he explains.

But Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, says that he doesn't think there's much more carriers can do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Because transmission most often occurs person to person, the inanimate environment of the airplane isn't really the problem, says Schaffner.

It's still wise, he says, to wipe down surfaces -- but ultimately it's handwashing that is the most important preventative step.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle. You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,"" Schaffner explains.

""So it's those hands we have that are the important intermediary -- and that's where I would put the emphasis. Use those wipes on your hands. That's the important thing.""

Dr Paulo Alves, who is currently attending IATA's Aviation Resilience Health workshop in Singapore -- which is working to address the overall impact of COVID-19 -- agrees with Schaffner.

""The most effective, simple measure vacationers should implement is to wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer should be used,"" says Alves.

""It seems reasonable to wipe the tray table surface, where it is more likely for droplets to land after someone coughs or sneezes. Travelers should maintain good personal hygiene on board flights, before flights and after flights and avoid touching their face.""

Travel medicine specialist Richard Dawood agrees, and says this advice stretches to navigating airports too. ""Remain aware of where your hands have been,"" he says.

Former flight attendant Biron also expresses concern not just for passengers -- but for air crew. They're just as likely to get sick, she points out, or feel pressured to still fly while unwell.

Airlines for America, the aviation group that represents North American carriers, says airlines are working closely with federal authorities -- and tells CNN Travel that the safety and security of passengers and crew ""is -- and always will be -- the top priority of US carriers.""

""I really don't think [airlines] can do very much. They might make the wipes more available to individuals,"" says Schaffner.

Airline response

So what are airlines doing differently right now?

Brian Parrish, spokesman for Southwest Airlines, tells CNN Travel that Southwest aircraft undergo ""regular cleanings between flights and a comprehensive cleaning when aircraft are parked overnight.""

""Our cleaning program includes the disinfecting of all hard surfaces within the cabin, as well as seat and carpet cleaning,"" he says. ""Southwest will continue to monitor and follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization regarding the coronavirus and make any adjustments to our procedures, as necessary.""

Curtis Blessing, an American Airlines spokesperson, echos Parrish.

""Our aircraft, including lavatories, are cleaned on a regular basis, and the depth of the cleaning varies depending on turn times and type of flying,"" he says. ""Lavatories are cleaned, floors are spot cleaned and visible trash is removed from seat pockets on all flights.""

Transcontinental, Hawaii and international flights see a deeper level of cleaning, Blessing adds.

Meanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson tells CNN Travel that the airline adopts ""the highest standard in cleaning and disinfecting our cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms.""

The spokesperson also highlights the HEPA filters which are part of the air conditioning system. ""These filters are used in hospital operating theaters, with air in the cabin replaced every three to five minutes. This provides much cleaner air than other public spaces like trains, restaurants, shopping centers and offices.""

This echoes the official advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, due to the way air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, ""most viruses and other germs do not spread easily,"" but that travelers are still advised to ""avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol.""

Delta says on its website that it's been deploying a ""fogging technique"" since February, using ""a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant.""

Fogging is being used on all trans-Pacific Delta flights arriving into the US, with plans to expand those procedures to more inbound international flights, focusing on flights coming from places with reported coronavirus cases. Fogging has been taking place on all inbound Delta flights from Italy to New York-JFK and Atlanta since February 29.

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific tells CNN Travel that aircraft cabin cleaning is always carried out to ""high standards"" -- but some extra precautions are currently in place.

""Out of an abundance of caution, aircraft will be taken out of service to perform extensive additional deep cleaning and supplementary disinfection when a confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified,"" says a Cathay Pacific spokesperson.

""This includes the replacement of all seat covers, disinfection of all surfaces and galley equipment, detailed cleaning of the lavatories, disinfection of carpets, sterilization of the water system and replacement of air filters in addition to standard cleaning procedures.""

Cathay Pacific has also temporarily suspended hot towels, pillows, blankets, magazines and in-flight duty-free on flights to and from destinations in mainland China.

Still, Schaffner says panicked passengers shouldn't feel they need to avoid using in-flight blankets or pillows if they are provided on their flight. There's ""no good data"" to support the idea they're responsible for transmission, he says.

""It's a consideration that comes logically to the mind, but it's difficult to convince people that they're really low risk. I always come back to the intermediate vehicle [which is] your hands. Do a lot of good hand-sanitizing.""

Alves agrees, pointing out that viruses will be eliminated when blankets and pillows are washed. However, he does clarify that there are ""knowledge gaps"" about the COVID-19 virus and research is ongoing, so recommendations may change.

Staying vigilant

So if you're boarding a flight soon, stocking up on hand sanitizer is the best move. Is there anything else to be done?

Schaffner notes that, from the passengers' point of view, the ultimate way to avoid infections on aircraft is to stay home.

""And there will come a time perhaps -- and some of that is happening already -- where we are being urged to social distance ourselves,"" he says. ""People are reconsidering whether they wish to fly at the moment.""

Richard Dawood stresses the important of airlines following the CDC's guidance, but he stresses that travelers should still make up their own mind on whether they should fly:","Rooney tells CNN Travel that the cleaning process varies depending on the schedule of the aircraft in question.

""You should take good infection prevention precautions all the time,"" she said. ""Although, given the circumstances, I think it’s probably wise to do it more than you normally would.""

The Centers for Disease Control offers guidance for good personal health habits and home sanitation at cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html.

The CDC makes a distinction between cleaning and disinfecting.

Cleaning is the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. Cleaning doesn’t necessarily kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting refers to using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces.

The CDC recommends a daily cleaning of frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs and cabinet handles, using a regular household detergent and water.

For a more thorough disinfecting of hard surfaces, including tile and linoleum floors, the CDC offers this advice:

• If surfaces are dirty, clean them first with detergent or soap and water prior to using a disinfectant.

Common EPA-registered household disinfectants will be fine in most household situations. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface you are cleaning.

A list of common EPA-registered household disinfectant products certified as likely to be effective against the novel coronavirus, as well as more information, can be found at www.epa.gov/coronavirus.

You can also make your own disinfecting solution by diluting household bleach. The CDC recommends mixing four teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, or five tablespoons (one-third cup) of bleach per gallon of water.

• When using alcohol solutions to disinfect, be sure the solution contains at least 70% alcohol.

• Always follow manufacturer’s instructions for application, including recommended precautions such as wearing gloves during use and ensuring proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date.

• Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser; it can produce toxic fumes.

The CDC recommends that soft or porous surfaces such as carpets, rugs, and drapes be cleaned with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. For disinfecting, use products on the EPA list that are suitable for porous surfaces.

Items that can be laundered, should be washed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. For disinfecting, use products approved by the EPA for viral pathogens claims that are suitable for porous surfaces.

And, despite what one might read on social media, Consumer Reports advises that homemade hand-sanitizer, consumable alcohol such as vodka, or distilled white vinegar are not effective in killing the virus.

Roberts also suggests regular cleaning of frequently touched electronic devices such as remote controls, keyboards and phones.

Although phone and device makers such as Apple and Samsung have long urged users to clean their devices only with a microfiber cloth, many makers have recently approved the use of disinfecting wipes.

Apple says that 70-percent isopropyl alcohol wipes or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes are OK to use on screens, keyboards and other exterior surfaces.

For remote controls, Consumer Reports recommends first removing the batteries, then wiping the device, not spraying it, with disinfectant or a disinfectant wipe. In harder-to-clean areas, such as around keys, a cotton swab lightly dampened with disinfecting solution can be used.

Once this health emergency is over, a lot of people might seek help from a professional housecleaning service.

Rosemary Stadler, the owner of Elite Cleaning Services in Columbus, said her business will be closed until April 6 in accordance with Ohio’s stay-at-home order.

Stadler said she plans to provide her regular clients with a newsletter with do-it-yourself tips about cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing during the lockdown.

Stadler, who opened her business in 2007, has had to temporarily lay off most of her staff, nearly 20 people.

""It’s been devastating, but once we get out of this we’re going to be ready to go,"" Stadler said.

""I hope that our services,"" she said, ""are going to be needed again.""

Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen has been a family physician in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for more than 20 years. He shared a video Tuesday detailing what he said is called ""sterile technique"" to clean your items.

""We have a dilemma in society where we need to eat to live but we also need to get that food. And that getting of food is now risky,"" VanWingen said. ""Safety out in the marketplace can literally save lives.""

Medical professionals use ""sterile technique"" while performing surgeries to maintain a clean environment, VanWingen said, also suggesting leaving groceries outside for three days after purchasing in case of any germs on the packaging.

If that isn't possible, VanWingen also suggested the following while shopping:

Wipe down your cart

Commit to buying items before picking up so you are not touching everything

Don't shop if you have any respiratory symptoms or have been exposed

Don't allow loved ones over the age of 60 to go grocery shopping

Buy 2 weeks worth of groceries so you do not have to go again

After shopping, VanWingen advised:

Sanitize your table or the area you will place groceries

Designate one half of the table for ""clean"" groceries and the other half for ""dirty"" groceries

Wipe down each item before placing on the ""clean"" half of the table with a disinfectant

Wipe down or spray all plastic items and packages

When handling take-out food, VanWingen suggests:

Washing hands before handling

Hold wrapper and keep food free of contact while placing on a plate from home

Microwave or heat food whenever possible

Choose hot takeout food whenever possible

Other things to know, according to VanWingen:

Remove plastic bags from cardboard containers that may have had human contact

If you must use a reusable bag, consider them dirty after using them

Move items like bread into alternative storage containers

Wash fruit in soapy water for at least 20 seconds similar to washing hands

Coronavirus does not survive well in food, but the wrappers should be a concern, VanWingen said, adding that some coronavirus can live inside a frozen environment for two years.

But while you’re hopefully already washing your hands—and not touching your face—make sure to extend those efforts to the phones, tablets, and laptops you handle every day.

The science shows that bacteria are very happy breeding on computer keyboards and smartphone screens, particularly when they're used by more than one person. And viruses can cling to glass surfaces for up to 96 hours, multiple days’ worth of potential infection. So whether you want to minimize your risk of coronavirus, the flu, or a bacterial infection, some regular cleaning is advised.

Indeed, some of the most dangerous bugs have been found on the plastic and glass surfaces of smartphones. From there they can make their way to your fingers, your face, your desk, the local restaurant, and all the other places you put your phone down. So, just about everywhere.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

The good news is that disinfecting your phone and your other electronic gear doesn't need industrial-strength chemicals or hazmat suits. You can do a very decent job of cleaning up your gear using the materials you've already got at home. It's also not necessary to clean your phone every time you go out—in fact it's probably bad for it to be scrubbed and wiped so often—but it's a good idea to do a quick wipe-down when you've been traveling, or after other people have used it, or at the very least every week or so.

Sanitize Your Smartphone

When it comes to cleaning a smartphone, gentleness is key. These are expensive and delicate bits of electronics, so you don't want to dive in with abrasive cleaning solutions and materials. Clorox wipes and the like aren’t just excessive; they can eat away at the oleophobic coating that keeps fingerprints from smudging your display. Simple, common cleaning materials are all you need to get your handset germ-free—although as of Monday, you also have Apple's blessing to use 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipes on hard surfaces if you insist.

Before you start, power down the device, remove any cases, and unplug any accessories so you've got full access to the phone. Your main cleaning tool should be a microfiber cloth. Anything that's soft and that won't scratch your phone will do, though Apple specifically recommends a camera lens cloth, if you want to follow its advice.

It's a good idea to start without any fluids at all, just a little pressure, but if needed then you can add warm and soapy water to the mix. Use it sparingly, applying it with your cloth, and drying off the device carefully with another cloth. Be sure to avoid getting excess moisture around ports and buttons.

Generally speaking, cans of compressed air aren't recommended on phones, though you can use them on your keyboard. The powered jet of air might interfere with the inner workings of your handset, and you don't want to take the chance. If you find your phone's ports have been cluttered with debris, try using cotton swabs or toothpicks to tease it out, again taking care not to cause any damage.

If your phone is fully IP68 rated for waterproofing—and triple-check the specs before you attempt this—then you can place the phone in a bowl of clean water for a few minutes, then leave it to dry on a paper towel or dab the moisture off with a cloth.

We'd recommend looking online for device-specific instructions, too. Google says it's OK to use cleaning wipes on Pixel handsets, but use them sparingly, well away from the ports and buttons. If possible buy ones that have been specifically approved for use on electronics.","It’s always a good idea to maintain good hygiene, but especially so in the midst of the ongoing spread of Covid-19.

Apple also recently said that it's safe to clean its products with a Clorox Disinfectant Wipe or 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe.

But you should never submerge your phone in a cleaning agent, or spray cleaning fluid directly onto the device.

You could also try using a UV sanitation device, which is an electronic device that beams UV-C rays at your phone to kill germs.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If you're anything like the average American, you probably check your smartphone more than 50 times per day, as a Deloitte study from 2018 found.

And each time you do, your mobile device picks up more bacteria from your hands. In fact, The University of Arizona found back in 2012 that cellphones carry 10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat, largely because toilet seats are typically cleaned more frequently while personal electronics are largely overlooked.

As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization are advising the general public to wash their hands often and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. That means keeping your phone clean is important as well.

But cleaning your phone can be tricky, considering many of the standard cleaning products you'd typically use for disinfection could potentially damage your mobile device.

Hygiene that is not limited to hand-washing but also extends to frequently touched surfaces such as your smartphone.

From authorities across the globe to the World Health Organization, experts are emphasising on the importance of hand-washing and sanitisation more than ever.

Search giant Google on Friday dedicated its Google Doodle to Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, the first person to prove that hand washing can be life-saving.

The same level of caution should also be applied to sanitising all frequently touched objects and surfaces around you. This includes your smartphone. How do you ensure that your smartphone is germ-free? Here are a few ways in which you can clean your smartphone from time to time:

Soft cloth

Before you begin with the cleaning, make sure you unplug all cables including headphones and charger from your phone. You can use a soft, lint-free cloth made up of microfiber to clean your phone. Do not use any kind of bleach, spray or abrasive with the cloth.

Plain, dry cleaning cloth similar to the ones provided with glasses works well for smartphones. Clean all stains and marks with circular movements across the display. Blow away any lint that might be stuck around the edges and inside open surfaces like charging ports and wipe the surface again.

Disinfectant wipes

Disinfectant wipes with no additional abrasives work well for smartphones. “Using a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, you may gently wipe the exterior surfaces of your iPhone,” Apple suggests on its support page. A few places such as office depots and mobile accessory stores also offer antibacterial screen wipes for phones. You can check online or at your local store for the same.

Damp cloth dipped in soapy water (for water-proof phones)

If you have a smartphone that is water-proof, you can dampen your microfiber cloth in water mixed with a little soap. However, ensure that your cloth is not dripping wet and only a little damp. Stay away from all edges and open slots such as earphones and charging ports. Do not use towels or tissues as they are more likely to damage the protective, scratch-resistant layer on your phone’s display. This method, however, works only for water-proof phones, do not try it otherwise.

Mobile sanitizers

Regular sanitizers are a big no-no when it comes to smartphones. However, there are a few brands that produce sanitizers made especially for smartphones such as Mobiwash, Phonemop, etc. You can apply a small amount of sanitizer to your phone and wipe all stains and marks away with a soft, linen-free cloth for cleaning.

Make sure to clean all edges of your phone properly along with your phone case.

Some brands also offer a complete cleaning kit for smartphones online.

According to a report by online tech news portal Sammobile, Samsung has also reportedly announced a Samsung Galaxy Sanitising service in 19 countries including the US and UK. The Korean smartphone maker is expected to expand this service in more countries in the upcoming weeks.","Hygiene that is not limited to hand-washing but also extends to frequently touched surfaces such as your smartphone.

117,https://www.autoblog.com/2020/03/12/coronavirus-car-interior-cleaning-how-to/,"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Autoblog,Coronavirus: How to disinfect and clean your car without ruining the interior,"If your routine includes a lot of time either behind the wheel or in the back seat of strange automobiles, you may be wondering how best to protect yourself from the coronavirus pandemic. Or maybe you drive for Uber or Lyft and you want to protect yourself and your customers from accidental transmission.

Take our fleet, for example. In the Autoblog office, we often have a half-dozen manufacturer-supplied vehicles rotating in and out every week, with just as many members of our staff taking turns behind the wheel. That's a lot of cars being driven by a lot of people, and keeping them as disease-free as possible is a difficult, time-consuming task.

When it comes to disinfecting an interior, the potential for unwanted interactions can be daunting, especially when some cleaning ingredients can do lasting harm to the materials that make up your cabin.

The good news is that keeping your car's interior free of harmful viruses and other unwanted elements is actually fairly simple if you follow a few guidelines. Since we're a bunch of car geeks, we reached out to an industry expert in cleaning chemistry. She works for an international chemical and consumer goods company and didn't want to be named for this article, but she was kind enough to give us a few cleaning pointers.

The key?

""Basic, good old soap. Soap chemically interacts with the surface of the virus in a way that degrades it very quickly and basically destroys the virus,"" she said.

If you're used to an environment where the use of hand sanitizers is encouraged, this may seem counter-intuitive, but while alcohol-based products like garden-variety Purell may do a fine job of eliminating microbial threats, they're not actually ideal for car interiors.

Conveniently, soap is a key ingredient in a lot of easily obtained items — classic liquid hand or dish soaps (think Dial), for example. The trick here is to avoid any cleaners that are labeled as being free of detergents.

If you're already sitting on a cache of automotive cleaning supplies, you're probably in good shape. Basic Armor All wipes, for example, contain a mild detergent.

For those with leather interior bits, makeup removal wipes (such as the Biore wipes pictured above) are a great solution; that's because skin care products typically contain moisturizers, which are good for organic trim materials.

""Unlike our skin, which has the ability to self re-moisturize, your interior can't,"" she said.

Both alcohol- and detergent-based cleaners can dry out organic materials. In other words, if it leaves your hands feeling dry after use, chances are it will sap the natural oils out of your car's leather interior, too.

If you don't have access to detergent-based cleaners that contain moisturizers, or you plan to use an alcohol-based cleaner, you can mitigate the drying effects with leather conditioners. These will replenish the oils that your cleaning process depleted.

As an added bonus, leather conditioners tend to contain surfactants, which are the chemicals that help cleansers do what they do. They reduce the surface tension of water, helping it get into places it may not otherwise. In other words, they make water wetter.

Ever used dish soap to clean a tent, only to find out it made the water leak right through the material? Congratulations, you already know how surfactants work, and they do the same thing to the outer layer of coronavirus, effectively neutralizing it.

You shouldn't rely on conditioners alone to keep your leather surfaces free of viruses, however, and you don't want to over-use them, as they will leave leather greasy if you saturate it. If you use a product advertised for both cleaning and treating interior surfaces, make sure its packaging indicates it's safe for leather.

Regardless of what you use and how you use it, remember to wipe surfaces down after you're done cleaning them. Even gentler cleansers shouldn't be left to linger on your interior materials.

For those without real leather, there's more good news. While these vinyl or other synthetic interiors should not be cleaned with alcohol- or bleach-based cleansers, they do have one key upside: They're much easier to disinfect.

""They don't absorb anything, so once you clean the surface, it's clean,"" she said.

What about other surfaces, or items like key fobs and such, which may not have been built to the same exacting standards as highly trafficked interior bits?

""Painted surfaces will not love alcohol, but will generally tolerate bleach well. Vinyl-wrapped surfaces — many 'chrome' surfaces are actually vinyl wraps — will not do well and the finish will be damaged. Simple plastics can tolerate bleach well,"" she said.

What else should you avoid besides bleach?

""All solvents (alcohols, acetone, kerosene, etc) should be avoided, not just because they can damage expensive interior bits, but also because they don't really affect viruses,"" she said.

If you're going to use household cleaning wipes such as those made by Lysol or Clorox, absolutely avoid anything with bleach. And beware of spray disinfectants (again, Lysol), as they only work through direct contact. If you miss a spot, you may as well have not used anything at all.

She also had tips for those who, like us, might frequently be swapping between cars that we don't own.

""Focus on the steering wheel, assorted switchgear, shifter, and the [infotainment interface],"" she said. ""The rear view mirror merits a wipe, too, [and] don't forget the gas cap!""

If you're low on supplies, you can probably afford to skip the seating surfaces, as they don't really touch the parts of your body likely to come into contact with viruses. Unless, of course, you drive for a ride-hailing service like Uber or Lyft.

""Those drivers have it the worst,"" she said.

The best advice she had for those who carry passengers for a living is to do so in a car with the simplest, most easily wiped-down interior possible. Plastic dashes and vinyl seating surfaces are far more easily cleaned than those adorned with fancier materials. It's like taxi fleets know what they're doing or something.

So, when cleaning your car's interior, keep these tips in mind:

Soap is always your best bet. It is harmful to coronavirus.

Avoid bleach except on simple plastics.

Don't use solvents.

Hand sanitizers contain alcohol, which can dry out leather. Use leather conditioner to keep it healthy.

When in doubt, test cleaners on a surface that can't be easily seen first.

Wipe off what you wipe on; don't leave chemicals to linger.

Prioritize the surfaces you touch. Don't forget buttons and switches, your rearview mirror, even your gas cap.

Ride-hailing drivers should stick to the basics. Simpler interiors are the easiest to clean.

Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen has posted videos to his YouTube page, showing viewers how to properly sanitize their groceries before storing them in their cupboards and cabinets.

""We have a dilemma in society that we need to eat to live, but we also need to get food and getting food is now risky,"" said VanWingen in a YouTube video, where he explains how food becomes contaminants by shoppers touching it. The containers and food you eat may be contaminated with the novel coronavirus and could be putting your family at risk.

""Stores are doing a good job and to their credit, they are sanitizing at night,"" said VanWingen. ""But they are not cleaning every single canned good, every single bit of food that is wrapped in plastic. That is up to us. It’s not just about wiping the handle on the grocery cart. We need to be a bit more savvy when we go into the store.""

Throughout the course of his video, VanWingen shows viewers how to sanitize food: fruits, vegetables, cardboard wrapping, plastic wrapping and other types of goods.

For fruits and vegetables, he recommends soaking them in soapy water. Then, wash them for about 20 seconds each, the length of time you should wash your hands for.

The National Institute of Health says COVID-19 could live up to 24 hours on cardboard surfaces and as long as three days for surfaces like plastic or similar materials. VanWingen recommends washing these surfaces down with sanitizing wipes or solution.

For food such as bread, the exterior may be contaminated, but the food inside likely will not have any type of exposure. VanWingen says the best option is to carefully remove the package and without touching the food, place it into a clean container such as Tubberware.

If you would like to support local businesses, now is the best time to order hot take-out food. When you receive, VanWingen recommends taking it out of the packaging without touching it. Then, heat it up for a significant period of time prior to eating it. Heat is known to kill COVID-19.

119,https://www.prevention.com/health/a31700300/how-to-clean-keyboard/,"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Prevention.com,How to Clean and Disinfect Any Keyboard,"Right up there with your phone, computer keyboards are one of the most-touched surfaces in homes and offices everywhere—meaning they’re also one of the germiest. In fact, one 2018 study found that 96% of 25 keyboards sampled were contaminated with bacteria. The possible culprits: Unwashed hands, all the crumbs from your 2 p.m. stress snacks, and moisture-trapping dust, to name a few.

But with dozens of keys, copious cracks and crevices, and sensitive electronic parts underneath, keyboards are notoriously difficult to clean. The same study found that, after disinfection, only about 16% of keyboards completely reduced their bacterial contamination. The researchers believe this could be due to inadequate buffing between the keys, where all the gunk tends to accumulate.

So, a regular cleaning is in order. And with the right equipment, it doesn’t take too much time or effort—just ask Melissa Maker, owner of home cleaning company Clean My Space in Toronto. “When cleaning a keyboard, you have a couple of things to think about,” Maker says. “What falls inside is the first thing to worry about, and the second is the surface of the keys.”

Whether your keyboard has seen one too many desk lunches or your laptop is about to become your de facto office (looking at you, people stuck working from home), this cleaning technique only takes a few minutes and will leave your keyboard squeaky clean. It might even work better after a bit of elbow grease.

What equipment do I need to clean my keyboard?

Keyboard cleaning only takes a few household items, according to Maker. Some of this equipment is interchangeable—a soft toothbrush can fill in for compressed air, for example—but it’s best to have all of it at hand, just in case.



Disinfecting wipes





Toothbrush

Cotton swabs

How do I clean under the keys?

To play it safe, make sure you shut your computer down first. External keyboards should be disconnected from your computer completely. Then, “start by taking the keyboard and tilting it up on its short side, straight up, over a flat surface,” Maker explains. For laptops, aim for a 75-degree angle, per Apple’s website.

❗Always shut down your computer before cleaning any parts.

“If you have , you can start doing short blasts from top to bottom to squeeze any of those crumbs out of the areas between keys.” Now, use a clean toothbrush to sweep out larger or stubborn debris in short strokes. (For external keyboards, a toothbrush alone works just fine for this step, but compressed air will be gentler on laptops.)

It’s important to do this process top to bottom, ensuring that crumbs and dust fall out instead of getting lodged in a forgotten corner. When they fall out, sweep them up and send them packing. “This is not a step to be skipped,” Maker says. “It is shocking how much stuff comes out of there. But when you think about how many snacks you’ve had sitting over your computer, then it won’t surprise you.”

How do I clean the surface of my keyboard?

Here, Maker explains, you have a choice: You can use either a disinfectant wipe or a microfiber cloth coated with diluted rubbing alcohol (equal parts water and alcohol). Apple recommends a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Do not use aerosol cleaning sprays or wipes that contain bleach.

“Clean the keys and the surrounding area by wiping them and keeping them wet for about three minutes if you’re looking to disinfect,” Maker says. In this case, “wet” doesn’t mean soaking—you want to see moisture on the surface of the keys, but liquids shouldn’t be allowed to soak into the keyboard. If you’re using a wipe, you may need to squeeze out excess liquid. You can also spray a cotton swab with the diluted alcohol and use that to clean hard-to-reach areas.

After you give it a gentle sweep, let your keyboard rest for a few minutes while it dries off—and always make sure everything is 100% dry before powering back on.

✅ Depending on your device’s specific user manual, many manufacturers recommend removing the keys completely (they should pop right off) for a deep-cleaning at least once per year.

How often should I clean my keyboard?

In the same study above, the researchers reported that 52% of people said they clean their keyboard about once or twice a month—but to properly disinfect, you should aim to clean it with a disinfectant wipe daily, the authors say. That said, if you’re the only person using your computer, most of that bacteria likely won’t cause you any serious harm, and other research finds that once per week is okay.

But prevention is key here: Washing your hands regularly and keeping snacks away from your computer will keep the area less grimy.

120,https://www.musicradar.com/news/how-to-clean-your-microphones,"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",MusicRadar,How to clean a microphone: keep your mics germ-free,"The outbreak of the Coronavirus – COVID-19 – has shone a light on the importance of good hygiene. It’s fair to say it has taken us all by surprise, and given us some harsh realities to consider. Hygiene and music don’t often go hand-in-hand, after all. Yet, our chosen interest – producing music – actually puts us at a fairly high risk of cross contamination.

Think about it; musicians are often in enclosed spaces with others, we share instruments and equipment, and the actual act of playing an instrument is fundamentally tactile. So, it makes sense for us to offer some advice on how to ensure the risks are low when it comes to performing, recording or enjoying music in any form.

One of the highest risk areas comes in the form of microphones. No piece of equipment is shared more between other people. In studios, at venues, in rehearsal rooms, even in your home studio – the humble microphone is that most communal piece of music gear. Yet due to the way it’s used, and its proximity to hands and mouths, it could potentially be one of the most dangerous.

We’ve put together this guide to help you clean your microphones. Aside from hygiene, it makes good sense for you to clean your mic frequently regardless of health concerns. It’s not uncommon to find saliva, lipstick, even bits of food lodged in the grille of your vocal mics, plus a microphone free of dust stands the best chance of giving you the recorded sounds you’re looking for.

Which microphones can be cleaned?

Before anyone rushes off to the cupboard to get the bleach, it’s important to understand the differences between microphones. Dynamic mics are much more robust than condenser mics, making them ideally suited to live performance and the stresses that come with that. Condensers, on the other hand, are much more fragile and require special attention when it comes to cleaning. Ribbon and valve mics are even more so, and we’d advise checking with the manufacturer before you start attacking it with a spare toothbrush.

For dynamic microphones, you can usually remove or unscrew the grille. If so, this makes life a lot easier. The grille is that layer of protection between the magic going on inside and the grime-filled outside world, so if you can remove the grille you will be able to use a basic solution of water and mild detergent to clean it. A toothbrush will help when it comes to cleaning in between the gaps. If the front grille cannot be removed, or if you’re using a condenser microphone, the best advice is to avoid water or any form of liquid. Microphones are delicate things and they most definitely do not like water. Again, a toothbrush will aid you in removing any dried scum, but make sure to hold the mic upside down so any dislodged particles fall to the floor, rather than back inside.

As well as the usual household items, there are some great tools designed to improve hygiene in microphones. Let’s take a look.

Elacin Hygiene Kit

While aimed at earplug and earphone users, the Elacin Hygiene Kit is perfect for cleaning microphones. It comes with two bottles of cleaning spray and a collection of small brushes capable of getting into the tight areas of a mic grille.

Buy the Elacin Hygiene Kit

Microphome

A specialist mic cleaning product, Microphome antimicrobial cleaning fluid goes into the mic as a foam that clings to the grille. This keeps it away from the electronics and dissipates quickly.

Pop Filter

More a preventative measure than something that will clean the microphone, but it’s well worth investing in a pop filter if the mic’s primary function is recording vocals. There are plenty of inexpensive options available, and they do a great job of reducing plosives and sibilance in your recording too.

Mic cover

Similar to the pop filter, a basic foam microphone cover will serve as a barrier between saliva and other moistures and ensure they don’t reach the parts of the mic you need to keep dry.

How to clean a dynamic microphone

(Image credit: Rob Laing)

Dynamic microphones are arguably the easiest to clean. The majority come with a grille which can be unscrewed or gently pulled apart from the body.

Step 1. Unscrew or remove the grille from the microphone, being careful not to damage the cartridge.

Step 2. With the grille removed, set the mic body to one side. Using a solution of plain, lukewarm water and mild detergent – dishwashing liquid is fine – wipe the grille to remove the surface layer of grime.

Step 3. Using a toothbrush, gently rub the grille, taking care to get into all the corners and cavities. The combination of the detergent and the toothbrush will ensure any caked-on residue is removed. You can also use a gentle disinfectant to kill off any nasty bugs or microbes which are still hanging around.

Step 4. Allow the now-clean grille to dry naturally. Be patient here; even a drop of water could kill your precious mic if it gets inside. While that’s drying, use a disinfectant household wipe to clean the body of the mic, being careful not to tough the electronics inside.

Step 5. When the grille and body are completely dry, reattach both together.

How to clean a condenser microphone

Cleaning a condenser is an altogether trickier task, on account of the fact few have detachable grilles, and all of them are considerably more fragile electronically. So, the key to cleaning a condenser mic is to take care. Using a dry, soft toothbrush gently scrub the grille. Keep the mic facing downwards to ensure loosened particles fall away from the grille. Be mindful or pushing dirt or grime through the grille and into the chamber. As with a dynamic, you can employ a disinfectant wipe to clean the body.","The best microphones for recording instruments, vocals and podcastsfor recording instruments, vocals and podcasts On a budget?

121,https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/duke-university-uses-vaporized-hydrogen-peroxide-to-clean-n95-face-masks-for-reuse/,"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",TechCrunch,Duke University uses vaporized hydrogen peroxide to clean N95 face masks for reuse – TechCrunch,"With shortages of N95 face masks persisting nationwide, healthcare facilities are scrambling to find ways to clean and treat the masks for reuse to protect doctors and nurses most at risk of exposure to COVID-19.

Duke University thinks it has found a solution using vaporized hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate the masks.

The process uses specialized equipment to vaporize hydrogen peroxide, which can then infuse all the layers of the mask to kill germs (including viruses) without degrading mask material.

“This is a decontamination technology and method we’ve used for years in our biocontainment laboratory,” said Scott Alderman, associate director of the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory, in a statement.

The university said it has proven effective and will begin using the technology at all three of its hospitals, according to Matthew Stiegel, the director of the Occupational and Environmental Safety Office at Duke.

Ideally, the hospitals would be able to use fresh masks and not need to try to decontaminate their masks, but these are not ideal times.

Duke’s decision to use hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate N95 masks is based on published studies conducted in 2016, but the practice wasn’t widespread, because the industry wasn’t facing shortages. Those earlier studies also didn’t include fit-testing — or the resizing of masks for individual wearers — after cleaning. Duke has now done that efficacy testing in the real world, the university said.

“The ability to reuse the crucial N95 masks will boost the hospitals’ ability to protect front-line healthcare workers during this time of critical shortages of N95 masks,” said Cameron Wolfe, MD, associate professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist.

Monte Brown, MD, vice president at Duke University Health System, said the Duke team is working to spread the word about the technique, making the protocols widely available. He said several health systems and many pharmaceutical companies already have the needed equipment, which is currently used in different ways, and could ramp up operations to come to the aid of their local hospitals.

“We could stand up in front of our staff and state with confidence that we are using a proven decontamination method,” Brown said. “It has been a proven method for years. While this alone will not solve the problem, if we and others can reuse masks even once or twice, that would be a huge benefit given the current shortages.”","Duke University thinks it has found a solution using vaporized hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate the masks.

Focus on public sanitation in the wake of COVID-19 has improved a lot with majority of villages looking very clean and most of the panchayat staff paying special attention to spraying disinfectants on a large scale for the first time in Anantapur district.

The other positive aspect is the unity among the villagers with Grama Sachivalayam (Village Secretariat) playing a key role in ensuring the ‘21-day Lockdown’ by moving towards village self-sufficiency. In Gutukuru, people have been sharing their grocery reserves with neighbours and there is no panic reaction like the one seen in Anantapur city.

Village Secretariat staff have helped the Gotukuru panchayat villagers put up notice boards at all entry points restricting others into their habitation and people at Ramachandrapuram village have begun guarding all entry points by taking turns in two shifts.

Thorny bushes and carts have been placed across the roads leading into the villages from national highways and State highways. Those on the Karnataka border areas are more alert as some of their relatives live across the border too, but it is a strict ‘No’ for them to either come into A.P. or these people going there.

“We are happy to find people coming up with their own initiative to stop travel into and out of their villages by guarding the entry points at 20 villages throughout the district and enforcing government orders strictly without the intervention of the government machinery,” said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu.

Massive sanitation drive

Disinfectant spraying activities at Kunukuntla, and Dadithota of Tadimarri mandal, and Chowlur Gram Panchayat in Hindupur mandal began on a massive scale on Thursday with panchayat staff mounting large plastic tanks on tractor-trailers. Motorised sprayers put up on the tractor are not leaving any household from spraying. “We are happy the panchayat is spraying some disinfectant, which is keeping the mosquitoes away and stench emanating from stagnant water in open sewage channels is no more there and such comprehensive operation is being taken up for the first time in the village,” said a resident, V. Brahmaiah.

Sanitation workers toil hard to spray bleaching powder all along the village roads, hoping people do not throw garbage into the drains.","The other positive aspect is the unity among the villagers with Grama Sachivalayam (Village Secretariat) playing a key role in ensuring the ‘21-day Lockdown’ by moving towards village self-sufficiency.

To clean your house effectively during corona pandemic you must first know the difference between cleaning and disinfecting as the latter is essential to achieve a thorough cleaning that can guarantee that the microbes are kept at bay. Cleaning refers to mere physical cleaning that will remove the organic matter like dirt and germs from the surface. Disinfecting means employing chemicals to kill the germs on the surfaces. Before you disinfect, cleaning is important as organic matter can inhibit the disinfectant’s ability to put an end to the germs.Frequently touched items can include the remotes of TVs, doors of refrigerators, kitchen cupboards, kitchen surfaces, door handles and taps. It is very important to clean these frequently shared items that can spread the germs between people.Surfaces play a significant role in transmitting the pathogens. Hence preventing them from getting contaminated is important as cleaning. To prevent or reduce the extent of contamination of surfaces in your house, cover your coughs and sneezes with tissue and wash your hands immediately after. Washing hands with soap and water often and especially before eating and after using the toilet is very important.Most viruses have a delicate structure that is highly vulnerable to destruction under a tough environment. Detergents and heat are found effective to stop the microbe from functioning. There are so many options available for cleaning like cloth, disposable wipes, towels and tissues.When you use a disinfectant, always depend on those products that have more than 60% alcohol as ethyl alcohol is the best ingredient you can depend on to kill most microbes.Washing with soap and water is the best approach. Add a few drops of dish soap to eight ounces of water. Though soap water might not be able to kill all germs, scrubbing with soapy water can do the trick in removing coronavirus from any surface.How you clean is a very important aspect you must focus on. It is important that you do not contaminate the surfaces once again while cleaning. While cleaning, work from one side of the surface to the other following an ‘S’ pattern.When you use cloth for cleaning, do not forget to wash it and dry it after you use it. A hot wash on the laundry machine using a detergent can be a dependable way to disinfect the cloths used for cleaning.Using a dish washer for cleaning cutlery and dishes is more recommended since it can use hotter water than what can be tolerated by your hands.Sources:","Coronavirus pandemic has triggered alarms on personal hygiene and keeping homes as clean as possible to prevent the entry of these deadly microbes.

Article content Cannabis resin is notoriously hard to scrub and glass can break easily under rough treatments. Don’t reach for the dish soap, though, that will only make matters worse. What’s needed is some rubbing alcohol and salt — any coarse ground will do and without iodine if possible. Some cotton swabs (those in the know prefer plastic to paper, which lacks flexibility) and zip-seal food storage bags may also come in handy. Pipes Perhaps the easiest item to clean, scrape off as much of the resin as possible before letting it soak in a bowl of rubbing alcohol, with a little salt, for a few hours. Rinse it off with warm water and carefully dry it when done, keeping in mind that glass becomes more fragile the warmer it gets. Let air dry.

When that’s done, move away from anything you don’t want to get messy and cover both openings of the bong with a washcloth (get it right in there if possible) and shake it like a polaroid picture for a few minutes. Repeat the procedure in a few minutes if it’s still dirty. Use a cloth and/or a swab to get at stubborn resin stuck in the bowl or other parts of the bong. Let everything air dry. Grinders Open it up and brush or pick out anything you can (putting it in the freezer for an hour makes it easier) before soaking the grinder in rubbing alcohol for a few hours and brushing it again with an alcohol-soaked swab. Rinse with warm water and let air dry.

Article content Vape pens There are two main types: those that use oil and those that use ground flower. For the first, scrape off the cartridge, which may also be able to use dried herbs. Use a light touch on the glass — it’s fragile. Then wipe the outside of the cartridge with an alcohol-soaked swab and air dry. It’s better to stay on the outside of the cartridge to avoid damaging the heating element. For the mouthpiece, give it a 30-minute soak in alcohol and a rinse with warm water, then air dry. For ground flower pens that have a chamber that you fill, instead of a cartridge, take it apart and scrape out all the bits (a toothbrush works well here). Clean the outside with alcohol or warm water — again, avoiding any heating element. Take care of the mouthpiece in the same way as above. Air dry.

It is not only important to be careful outside home. It is equally important to keep your home safe and disinfected. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has laid down certain guidelines to help you keep your homes clean and free of the coronavirus infection.- Clean and disinfect daily in high-touch surfaces within common areas like doorknobs, light switches and tabletops.- Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and discard them afterwards.- Clean with household cleaners and disinfectants that are appropriate for the surface.- For soft surfaces such as carpets, rugs and drapes, remove any visible contamination and clean with appropriate cleaners.- For all laundry, wash using the warmest possible setting and dry completely.Apart from these basic guidelines by the CDC, these are a few tips you should follow to keep this pandemic away from your home.Use a disinfectant wipe to clean places in your house that you touch often like doorknobs, chairs and tables to keep the infection at bay. You touch these surfaces often and it is important that you disinfect them often and so always keep a box of alcohol-based disinfectant wipes at hand. It is especially important someone in your house is sick.For surfaces that cannot be wiped down, like those of sofas and carpets, it is best to use a disinfectant spray. They work the same way that a wipe does. Spray it over the entire surface and it dry completely before sitting down or walking over it. If you don’t have wipes, you can use the spray on a paper towel and then clean other surfaces as well.Your shoes may also track in a lot of dirt and along with it the virus as well. It is advisable to use a mixture of one cup of bleach in 5 gallons of water to clean the kitchen and bathroom floors. Be careful of using bleach on wooden flooring. You can use a mixture of white vinegar and water for wooden flooring.A 3% hydrogen peroxide is effective against the virus. You can use it directly on surfaces like the sinks, toilets and tabletops. Leave it for 10-15 minutes and wash off thoroughly. Hydrogen Peroxide can also be used to clean your toothbrushes which harbour a lot of bacteria.","The coronavirus outbreak has been declared a pandemic, and it has become important to maintain personal hygiene to help stop the spread of the disease.

Social distancing lends itself well to the deep spring cleaning we’ve all been meaning to get around to but have found reasons to avoid, up until now. While we all do our part to avoid spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) by staying home, there’s no better time to clean the house. As you tidy up around your space, disinfecting surfaces and deep-cleaning your carpets, now is also the perfect time to clean your makeup products.

Makeup can carry bacteria the same way any other surface can, so regular cleanings are important for preventing the spread of germs.

No one knows this more than makeup artists who work on hundreds of faces per year using the same makeup products—which means their sanitation practices have to be on par with their makeup skills. “Proper sanitation should be the first and most important lesson for every makeup artist,” says Van Khai Truong, a makeup artist based in New York City. “We have to constantly educate ourselves on how to properly keep our tools and products clean before, during, and after each application.”

Makeup artists are the authority on all things cosmetic sanitation. Their work depends on it. They often invest thousands of dollars into their makeup kits and work close to their clients, so proper hygiene is essential to protect themselves, their tools, and the rest of their clients.

Below are a few ways experts say you can keep your makeup sanitized and germ-free.

1Wash your hands before doing your makeup.

This seems like a no-brainer, but washing your hands before doing your makeup can dramatically reduce the spread of germs. If you’re prone to acne, this simple step could help decrease the breakouts on your skin. When makeup artists are working on multiple people in a day, they wash their hands before and after each application to prevent any cross-contamination. Incorporating this quick and easy step into your daily routine is just good hygiene, like washing your hands before cooking a meal. If you don’t have access to a sink, use a hand sanitizer.

2Deep-clean your makeup brushes with soap and water.

Common wisdom says you should be washing your makeup brushes every two to three weeks, or more often if you’re prone to breakouts. You don’t need to use fancy brush soap—good old-fashioned soap and water are just as effective. If it’s good enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, it’s good enough to clean your makeup brushes. Many makeup artists recommend Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castile Liquid Soap, baby soap, or dishwashing liquid, but use whatever you have on hand. Lather the bristles, rinse, and repeat until the water runs clear and there’s no more soap in the bristles. Lay flat to dry overnight.

3Sanitize makeup packaging and powders with 70% isopropyl alcohol.

If you’ve never properly cleaned your makeup before, your makeup bag likely has more germs than a bowl of candy on Halloween. To disinfect, decant 70% isopropyl alcohol into a reusable spray bottle. The percentage is important because anything in a higher percentage evaporates too quickly to properly disinfect. Open your powder products—like powder foundations, blushes, bronzers, and eyeshadows—and spray until the entire pan is evenly saturated. Leave products open until the alcohol evaporates, and then spray the outside packaging to disinfect. You can also do the same thing with any of your wooden pencils, like eyeliners and lipliners, and tools like eyelash curlers and brush handles. Don’t worry: The 70% isopropyl alcohol doesn’t disrupt or change the formula of any of your products. Once the alcohol evaporates (it shouldn’t take longer than five to 10 minutes), your products are sanitized and ready to use.

4Avoid double-dipping into creams and liquid products.

Avoid applying products directly from their packaging to your face. When you do, you’re putting the germs from your face onto the product, and then repeating that over and over again with new germs. Instead, swipe the amount of product you think you’ll need on the back of your (clean) hand, and then apply it on your face with your fingers or a brush. This goes for concealer wands, cream blushes, bronzers, and eyeshadows. Creams can’t be sanitized the way that powder products can, so the best way to ward off the spread of bacteria is to prevent it from happening in the first place.

Makeup artists typically decant or scrape off cream or liquid products onto a stainless steel palette and work off that to avoid any cross-contamination, but for personal use, the back of your hand works just fine. Bacteria also breaks down products faster, so avoiding double-dipping in your makeup routine will make your products last longer.

5Toss the sponges and powder puffs that come included with your face products.

Those sponges that come with face powder aren’t individually packaged like other sponges, so you can’t be sure they’re clean the first time you use them. Each sponge can be loaded with bacteria after just one use, and putting it back into that small container is like creating a tropical oasis for bacteria to multiply. You’re better off touching up with a small brush or sponge and washing it every two to three weeks.

6Be aware of expiration dates.

Did you know that all makeup has an expiration date? It’s printed on the back of all makeup packaging. Look for a picture of a tiny, open jar: Inside the jar is a number that states how many months the product is good for. The general rule of thumb: The more moisture a product has, or the closer it is to your eyes, the shorter the lifespan.

Mascara and liquid eyeliner should be tossed and replaced most often at every three months, liquid foundation and concealers every six to 12 months, cream blushes and lipsticks every 12-18 months, and powders every two years. Powders can last longer if you properly disinfect them regularly, using the advice outlined above. When all else fails, always trust your nose. If a product smells off, toss it.

7Wash (and replace) your makeup sponges regularly.

Makeup artists never use the same sponge on multiple people because sponges are the perfect vehicle for spreading bacteria. For personal use, sponges are a great tool for applying liquids and creams and doing touch-ups but, like your kitchen sponges, they need to be washed and replaced regularly.","As you tidy up around your space, disinfecting surfaces and deep-cleaning your carpets, now is also the perfect time to clean your makeup products.
No one knows this more than makeup artists who work on hundreds of faces per year using the same makeup products—which means their sanitation practices have to be on par with their makeup skills.
When makeup artists are working on multiple people in a day, they wash their hands before and after each application to prevent any cross-contamination.
Many makeup artists recommend Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castile Liquid Soap, baby soap, or dishwashing liquid, but use whatever you have on hand.

For the most up-to-date news and information about the coronavirus pandemic, visit the WHO website

You've probably heard this before: ""Your phone is crawling with germs! It's 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat!"" Gross, right? Until recently I mostly shrugged off those claims -- if my phone is such a petri dish, how come I'm not getting sick all the time? -- but all the coronavirus craziness is giving me pause. Maybe it's time to err on the side of ""better safe than sorry.""

What's the best way to do that? For starters, read CNET's story on how to clean your phone -- which includes important info on what not to do. Beyond that, consider murdering those microbes with UV light. There are a number of products designed to do exactly that, most notably the PhoneSoap, which appeared on Shark Tank a few years back. However, the least expensive model, the PhoneSoap 3, sells for $79.95 and won't ship until April 1.

There are less expensive alternatives, though I should note that prices are on the rise and availability is decreasing. One product I looked at was $39 last night -- and $53 when I woke up this morning. Others are showing in-stock dates of up to a week from now.

These devices have been likened to little tanning beds. You put your phone inside, press a button and wait 5-10 minutes while a UV light ""bath"" kills all the germs. (Many of them are large enough to accommodate other items as well: earbuds, eyeglasses, toothbrushes, keys and so on.)

Why not just fill a little spray-bottle with equal parts distilled water and 70% isopropyl alcohol, spritz it at a lint-free cleaning cloth and wipe down your phone? You absolutely could do that; it's a cheap solution (literally) that, according to one amateur test, can be highly effective. It's also more work and messier, and you run the risk of liquid getting into a place it doesn't belong.

If you like the UV idea better, here are three PhoneSoap alternatives priced less. Update (3/5/20): All three of these products are now sold out.

Want a sanitizer you can take with you? The HoMedics product is portable, promising up to 70 uses per charge. It's also fast, able to zap 99.9% of all germs in just 30 seconds, according to HoMedics. However, its pop-up phone bed has only ""upper"" UV lighting; after you run it once, you have to flip your phone over and run it again. The Kohl's sale price (which is $20 below Amazon's) includes $10 in Kohl's Cash, which must be used between March 9-22. Shipping costs extra, however, unless your pad your cart to at least $75.

Lecone Normally selling for $40, Lecone's sanitizer just jumped in price -- no doubt due to increasing demand. It's large enough to accommodate phones up to 6.2 inches (not necessarily including a bulky case), and it has a Qi charging pad embedded in its lid -- meaning when your phone isn't inside getting clean, it can sit on top getting charged. Like a couple other off-brand sanitizers I've seen, this one is also an essential-oil diffuser for some reason. So if you want your phone to smell like sandalwood, lavender or whatever when it comes out, this is the product for you.

Salmue This thing was $36 when I started writing this story; it's now showing $41.99. And it's about as basic as they come, a simple plastic coffin with UV lights embedded in the lid and base. There's not even a groove for your phone's charging cord, should you wish to top it off while cleaning. (Thankfully, the automated cleaning function takes just six minutes.) Update: This model is now sold out.

If you have any experience with these products or PhoneSoap, or thoughts on other ways to keep your phone germ-free, please share them in the comments!

Major hypermarkets and supermarkets in Doha have reassured consumers of a sanitised and clean environment at their stores and in delivering online orders as part of the precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

Speaking to Gulf Times, LuLu Group International regional manager Shanavas PM said they are handling all food and non-food items with utmost care and safety from the stockroom to the shelves of every store, ensuring supplies are clean and free from any contamination.

He stressed that LuLu has been implementing all possible measures of the highest standard at every store across the country for employees and shoppers' safety.

LuLu’s campaign also includes promoting “proper hygiene and cleanliness at every possible juncture, starting from disinfecting constantly all areas of its facilities, as well as equipment, that come in wider contact.”

Temperature of employees and merchandisers, among other staff, are also checked and monitored from their accommodations and as they arrive at stores.

Apart from LuLu stores, Shavanas said they also regularly clean and sanitise in detail every corner of staff villas for the safety of all.





Regular temperature checks



Meanwhile, as the demand for hand sanitisers continue to surge, he said that they will be available soon.

Other hypermarkets also continue to take additional measures to help deal with the Covid-19 outbreak, as advised by the Ministry of Public Health.

Monoprix regional general manager Sebastien Farhat told Gulf Times that they sanitise all Monoprix stores and staff accommodations daily – from hallways to rooms and toilets, among other areas of these buildings.

He said temperature checks are also in place and conducted regularly, from drivers and delivery support crew to the regular staff of the company, aimed at excluding those who have signs of illnesses and limiting exposure to all in the facility.

“We are among the most sanitised and hygienic stores in Qatar. Monoprix stores are the safest place to shop in Qatar,” Farhat said.

Pictures and videos sent to Gulf Times showed that appliances and equipment at accommodations such as washing machines, water dispensers, chairs, doors and doorknobs, and steel bars, among others, are all being sanitised regularly.

At every store, trolleys, shelves, steel bars, and various equipment, as well as surfaces, are also santised while staff are seen using and changing gloves regularly.

Hand sanitisers are also kept in relevant areas at stores and staff accommodations for people to use.

Carrefour, in an email to its customers recently, said: “At Carrefour, we are committed to the well-being of our customers, colleagues and the community we operate in. Providing a safe and hygienic shopping environment and home delivery is key to that commitment and we have put in place some additional measures to ensure your peace of mind.”

“As always, orders are prepared in a quality-controlled, clean environment. Sanitation of all surfaces has been amplified and staff are required to wear a mask and gloves while preparing your order,” the statement added. “For your peace of mind, our drivers are also required to wear gloves when delivering to you.”

Such initiatives were echoed by many residents who recently shopped at these stores saying that they find the shelves, as well as the flooring and other surfaces, neat while items are well-ordered.

“We feel safe while shopping at these supermarkets and other grocery stores, and we are thankful that they continue to operate with enough stocks for consumers during these trying times,” said a Filipino expatriate who bought mostly food items at LuLu D Ring Road.

He stressed that these efforts are laudable and can be replicated by others in other countries dealing with the pandemic.

Earlier, Al Meera also implemented various measures and hygiene practices to ensure the safety of its customers and employees from Covid-19 by constantly cleaning and sanitising its stores.","He stressed that LuLu has been implementing all possible measures of the highest standard at every store across the country for employees and shoppers' safety.

This was announced the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) in a press conference on Mar. 6, 2020.

Chaired by environment minister Masagos Zulkifli, the SG Clean Taskforce is set up under the purview of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) on Covid-19.

It will galvanise the nation to do the following:

Ensure the cleanliness of public spaces

Encourage good personal hygiene

Adjust social norms to reduce the spread of diseases

Ensure the cleanliness of public spaces

Premise owners and members of the public will have to maintain high standards of cleanliness and users have to use the spaces responsibly.

The SG Clean campaign has been launched on Feb. 16, 2020.

The important component of the campaign is the SG Clean quality mark, which serves as a premise-based sanitation and hygiene indicator.

The SG Clean quality mark requires organisations to commit to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists to safeguard public health in Singapore.

The National Environment Agency and the Singapore Food Agency have been working with hawker centres and coffee shops to be part of the SG Clean quality mark certification programme.

To date, 1,907 hawker and market stalls, and 345 coffee shop stalls have been awarded the SG Clean quality mark.

In addition, 13 hawker centres and 49 coffee shops have also been awarded.

Other sectors such as retail, hospitality, transport nodes, educational institutions and preeschool will also be part of the certification programme.

NEA aims to roll out the SG Clean certification programme to premises with high human traffic and more vulnerable segments of the population by the end of 2020.

MEWR will make amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act in the later part of 2020.

Mandatory cleaning standards will also be introduced, including a regime for pro-active routine cleaning and disinfection at prescribed frequencies.

These include standards for public cleanliness such as

frequency of cleaning and disinfection of high contact areas, in particular toilets

pest management, including a mosquito control regime and

back-of-house waste management such as bin centres

Premise managers will face greater accountability as they will be required to submit and implement an environmental sanitation programme, and remedy any lapses in public cleanliness on their premises.

They will also be required to appoint a trained designated person to assist them to develop and implement the environmental sanitation programme.

NEA will work to progressively implement the new requirements from 2021 at preschools, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres, starting with higher-risk premises with high footfall and immuno-vulnerable occupants.

Adopting good personal habits

The National Environment Agency has been encouraging ""seven habits of good public hygiene"", including frequent hand-washing and using a tissue when sneezing or coughing.

Another habit includes keeping public toilets clean and dry, which will help in reducing the spread of diseases and viruses such as Covid-19 and dengue within the community.

Adjusting social norms

The SG Clean Taskforce will encourage people to use serving spoons when sharing food, to eat from and return trays when dining out, and to keep their tables clean.

Eating from trays prevents food from dropping on the table, Masagos explained.

Used tissues should not be left to the cleaners, as the tissues are biohazards, the minister said.

During this period, many have refrained from shaking hands, the release added, as it is ""necessary"" to make such adjustments to social norms to help prevent community spread of Covid-19.

Speaking on the exercise, Mr. Godwin Ibeabuchi, Business Executive, Retail and Consumer Banking in charge of Victoria Island Area for Sterling Bank, said the bank has been promoting environmental sustainability, good sanitation, and hygiene across the country for about 10 years, ensuring that Nigerians live and do business in a clean environment.

He added: “We are motivated by the understanding that it is difficult to live a healthy life, conduct business and create wealth amidst waste or in a toxic environment. Without clean air, water, land and energy, our collective humanity is endangered. This makes it necessary for us to keep our environment orderly and functional through sustainable living actions and regular cleaning.”

Also speaking, Mrs. Idu Okwuosa, Managing Partner of Lasgidis Recyclers said: “I live in this neighbourhood and I normally take early morning walks. Also, when I am driving around, I see drains blocked by plastics and other wastes and this usually breaks my heart.”

She said Lasgidis decided to make the Lekki area clean by cleaning one street at a time and this gave her the opportunity to reach out to volunteers and to some of the women who receive stipends from Lasgidis to help in the cleaning of the environment.

Mrs. Okwuosa disclosed that besides Freedom Way and Admiral Ayinla Way, Lasgidis has plans to organise another major cleaning exercise, tagged Lagos Sweep, before the end of the month. Thereafter, two staff members from Lasgidis would be assigned to clean one street daily in the Lekki area, she said.

She said Lasgidis would be working with housing estates in the Lekki neighbourhood in a bid to sustain a clean environment, adding that they are also working on an app that can be downloaded by residents so that when they have enough wastes, they can easily contact Lasgidis through the app.

The founder said her goal is to pick up and dispose waste before they get to the drains.

A primary school has been forced to temporarily close after one of its pupils was diagnosed with typhoid fever.

Whitmore Park Primary School in Halford Lane, Keresley Heath, is currently undergoing a deep cleaning programme after the youngster contracted the highly contagious infection.

Coventry Live reports a letter was sent to parents and carers on Friday and states that a thorough deep clean had started over the weekend.

Parents have been told that there is no need to worry and that the risk to other children is low.

The school is expected to reopen on Tuesday.

Jacqueline McGibney, the school's headteacher, said: “The Health and wellbeing of our pupils and staff are of the utmost importance, so we are taking advice from the health professionals at Public Health England and the Environmental Health team at Coventry City Council following the confirmation of a case of typhoid in one of our pupils.”

She added: ""We take the health of our pupils and staff very seriously and have been working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that the risk to children is low.

“We have a well-managed cleaning regime which follows the advice of the council’s environmental health team.

""We have been keeping parents up to date and fully expect to open as normal tomorrow.”

Public Health England confirmed this evening that it is working with Coventry City Council concerning a confirmed case of typhoid in a child that attends Whitmore Park Primary School.

The infection is believed to be travel-related and the child has been receiving antibiotics and is now feeling much improved.

A small number of close contacts of the case have been asked for blood and stool samples, for lab testing, and the school has been advised to undergo a thorough clean with bleach-based products.

The school decided to perform a deep clean over the weekend, which will take three days – hence remaining closed today to complete cleaning and reopening on Tuesday.

Angela Cartwright, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control with PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said: “Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection which is uncommon in the UK, with an estimated 500 cases each year, generally related to foreign travel to countries at high risk including those in South Asia, Africa and South America.

""The infection is caused by bacteria called Salmonella typhi, and transmission is through the stools (faeces) and, less commonly, the urine. In countries with poor sanitation, water can be infected with the bacteria, and people drinking contaminated water or eating food cooked or washed in contaminated water can become infected with the bacteria and develop typhoid fever.”

Ms Cartwright added: “The risk to other children at the school is low, but as a precaution, we are testing a small number of close contacts.

""If typhoid fever is left untreated, symptoms will worsen over time, and there is a risk of developing serious complications – so it’s important for people with symptoms to contact their GP or call NHS 111.

""Prompt treatment with antibiotics is important, and cases diagnosed early usually recover after a 7 to 14-day course of treatment.

“Good hygiene is the best way to prevent illnesses such as typhoid, colds and flu.

""Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly using soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time is the best advice for these kind of illnesses, especially after using the toilet and before preparing and eating food or drinks.

""It is also important that children with gastro-intestinal symptoms (diarrhoea or vomiting) do not attend school until they have been free of symptoms for at least 48 hours – this will help prevent spread of typhoid and other infections, such as norovirus, which also cause gastro-intestinal symptoms and are common at this time of the year.”

According to the NHS, Typhoid fever is most common in parts of the world that have poor sanitation and limited access to clean water but children globally are at risk of developing it.

It is caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that causes salmonella food poisoning.

Symptoms include a high temperature that can reach 39 or 40 degrees, a headache, general aches and pains, a cough and constipation.

As the infection progresses, people may lose their appetite, feel sick, and have a tummy ache and diarrhoea.

There are approximately around 500 cases in the UK every year.","Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy noticeA primary school has been forced to temporarily close after one of its pupils was diagnosed with typhoid fever.

But while it's easy enough to wash your hands regularly, it's not quite as easy to keep your phone clean. We've got a few tips of our own, but we're curious to know: How do you clean your phone?

Both Apple and Google have published documentation with best practices for sanitizing your device. Each recommends that you avoid using products that include bleach to clean your device, though alcohol wipes (up to 70% isopropyl alcohol) or Clorox branded disinfecting wipes have each company's explicit blessing. Just keep in mind that strong solvents like alcohol and abrasive materials can wear down the oleophobic coating on your screen. While lower alcohol concentrations are more likely to be safe, if you're worried, you can stick to using alcohol-free wipes. And don't try to grind smears clean with a paper towel, napkin, or your pants leg, they're all too abrasive for that oleophobic finish as well and can destroy it over time.

But wet wipes aren't the only game in town. Samsung, for example, offers in-store sanitation for Galaxy devices via a strong UV light, and some companies make similar products for at-home use. If your phone has an IP rating, even just a spray bottle with some lightly soapy water and a big 'ol microfiber towel can do the trick, just be careful not to spray into speaker grilles, microphone holes, or other ports.

Also, don't forget to keep your phone case clean, too, since it's probably the part you touch the most. If it's not made of any exotic materials, just a simple bath in soapy water should do the trick. (That even works for Google's fabric cases, which collect grime like nobody's business.) If you have a snazzy leather case, it's best to ask the manufacturer, but as Android Police's resident leatherworker, I recommend Ashland Leather's Tanner's Blend Cleaner & Conditioner. In a pinch, basic saddle soap can also work, just be sure to replenish the lost oils it strips away or your leather might get dried out.

So, how do you keep your phone clean? Feel free to select all the answers that apply. And if you have any tips or tricks that we haven't mentioned, let your fellow readers know.

The city's three casinos reported an aggregate revenue of $121.7 million last month — a 6.3 percent year-over-year increase, according to the Michigan Gaming Control Board.

Sports bets are expected to pad the casinos' bottom lines as the activity rolls out this week. Online betting is expected to be implemented in Michigan in the next year.

""Obviously, this has been a long time coming,"" MGM Detroit President and COO Davis Tsa told Crain's at the casino's launch party Wednesday. ""We're especially excited we were able to open by March Madness, which is one of the busiest, if not the busiest, times for sports.""

MGM Grand Detroit held 43 percent of the market share with a 6.4 percent revenue increase in February to $52.6 million. MotorCity Casino Hotel had 33 percent of the market share with a 4.7 percent revenue jump to $40.5 million. Greektown Casino-Hotel's 8.3 percent revenue increase to $28.6 million nabbed it 24 percent of the market.

Coronavirus fears evidently haven't kept patrons away from the slots and tables, but the threat became real Tuesday night when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced there are two presumptive positive tests for the disease in Oakland and Wayne counties.

News of the state's first confirmed COVID-19 cases came on the eve of legal sports betting in Michigan. MGM Grand Detroit and Greektown plan to accept the first sports bets at 1 p.m. Wednesday, while MotorCity's sportsbook will go live 10 a.m. Thursday, according to a news release.

Casinos are joining local offices, universities, convention centers and shops in putting together plans to safeguard against the deadly respiratory illness. Large events are being canceled or postponed by the handful in Michigan and across the country and world. The fate of March Madness is also uncertain as universities suspend classes and sports leagues institute drastic measures, such as cancel tournaments and play in front of empty stands.

Complete coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""In relation to the COVID-19 virus, we continue to closely monitor information from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Disease Control,"" John Drake, Greektown vice president and general manager, said in an email.

Drake said the casino is increasing its fresh air circulation, adding sanitation areas throughout the complex and ramping up cleaning of restrooms, gaming units, door handles, elevator buttons, carpets and food menus.

MGM Detroit said it has implemented similar measures.

""We are proactively communicating with our employees on the guidance from the CDC regarding prevention,"" MGM Detroit President and COO Davis Tsai said in an email. ""We have enhanced our cleaning protocols that include placing hand sanitizer dispensing station in high-traffic areas, reinforcing proactive cleaning and increasing the frequency of disinfectant procedures. We continue to follow the CDC's guidelines and are closely monitoring for updates.""

MotorCity provided a statement to the same effect: ""In addition to following CDC guidelines, we are staying in close touch with local, state and federal health agencies and trade associations on best practices. We have also implemented intensified cleaning/disinfecting of highly trafficked surface and common areas. We will remain flexible as new information becomes available.""

The three casinos paid a total of $9.9 million in gaming taxes to the state and $14.5 million to the city in gaming taxes and development agreements.

Sports betting revenue tax in Michigan is set at 8.4 percent, plus 1.25 percent in city taxes for Detroit's casinos. Operators also must pay a one-time license fee of $150,000 and $50,000 annually. The Michigan Department of Treasury said it expects legalized sports and online gambling to bring in $19 million of new yearly revenue for the state.

Despite the coronavirus scare, dozens of people turned up Wednesday at MGM Detroit's launch party, including former Red Wings player Dino Ciccarelli, former Piston James ""Buddha"" Edwards, ex-boxing star Tommy Hearns, former Tigers pitcher Dave Rozema and Jerome Bettis, who played football in the NFL and at University of Michigan.

Bettis was among the first to place a legal bet Wednesday. He wagered $20 on Rory McIlroy winning The Players Championship this weekend.

""I think (legal sports betting) opens up a wealth of opportunity for fans here in Detroit,"" he told Crain's. ""You gotta think, Detroit is one of the few cities to have all of the sports, and so to have the ability now to bet on your favorite sport gives fans an opportunity to be more invested in these games.""","""Obviously, this has been a long time coming,"" MGM Detroit President and COO Davis Tsa told Crain's at the casino's launch party Wednesday.
""We are proactively communicating with our employees on the guidance from the CDC regarding prevention,"" MGM Detroit President and COO Davis Tsai said in an email.

To get the SG Clean certification, schools must ensure that hand washing and toilet flushing facilities are functioning well, toilets are cleaned and disinfected twice a day, and a pest management programme is in place, among other things.

Over 95 per cent of schools and institutes of higher learning have received the certification so far, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Ministry of Education yesterday.

Schools will be audited by NEA.

Yesterday, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Manpower Low Yen Ling visited Kent Ridge Secondary School in West Coast Road.

They observed some of the hygiene practices there, such as a cleaner disinfecting the toilets as well as students wiping their tables and chairs in the classrooms.

Mr Masagos said: ""As I moved around the school, I saw that the students knew what they were doing - not only how to do it, but also why they were doing it.

""So this is a good way for us to inculcate good values in our children... We will make sure that this will become our first line of defence in the fight against Covid-19.""

Added Ms Low: ""SG Clean is a whole-of-nation effort to raise the standard of cleanliness across Singapore... We will continue to upkeep the stringent level of standards, cleanliness and public hygiene.""

The SG Clean scheme was launched on Feb 16 to raise cleanliness and safeguard public health amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Since then, over 5,000 premises have received the SG Clean certification that shows they have met the new hygiene standards, said NEA.

These premises include hawker centres, food stalls, coffee shops, hotels, schools, and food and retail businesses in malls.

NEA had said previously that the quality mark will be progressively rolled out in various sectors with high human traffic, including pre-schools, schools, hotels, tourist attractions and shopping malls.

The hygiene checklist differs from sector to sector.

For example, hawker stallholders have to set up processes to ensure food preparation areas and equipment are sanitised, waste is handled properly and systems are in place to monitor staff health.

NEA said it hopes these hygiene practices will continue even after the coronavirus outbreak, as they can also help to reduce the spread of diseases such as dengue.

NEA also released new dengue-related statistics yesterday. Over the last three years, more than 3,000 mosquito breeding habitats were linked to receptacles, such as plastic containers and empty drink cans, found in public areas. About 65 per cent of these receptacles had been discarded as litter by people.

Said Mr Masagos: ""Through collective action by all stakeholders, we can contribute towards safeguarding public health and making Singapore a cleaner and safer environment for our families and those around us.""","By the end of this month, all schools here will have to adhere to a new hygiene checklist as part of the SG Clean scheme.

People across affected countries are now social distancing, or staying home as much as possible to avoid spreading the virus further.

If you're staying indoors, now is the perfect time to clean your makeup brushes, as the virus can live on surfaces for hours and sometimes days.

It's also worth throwing out expired products while you have free time, since they can harbor bacteria that causes other infections.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

The coronavirus pandemic is affecting people across the globe. In the US alone, more than 14,000 people have been infected, and 212 have died after becoming ill, at the time of writing.

To help prevent spreading the virus further, many affected areas are asking people to socially distance themselves by staying home and away from large crowds. Washing your hands and cleaning your belongings has also become a major priority.

But while many people wipe down their phones and furniture, you might want to consider devoting the same attention to cleaning your beauty products. Here's why.

Coronavirus can live on surfaces, including your beauty products, for days

As Business Insider previously reported, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) analyzed how long coronavirus can last on various surfaces. According to its report, the virus can live for up to four hours on copper, up to a day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. These lengths are also affected by temperature and humidity.

Because some makeup tools, palettes, compacts, and even brush handles can be made from those materials, it's safe to assume they could become infected if used by an ill individual.

Makeup brushes can be made from various materials, so keeping them clean is crucial. monticha a/Shutterstock

However, it's less clear if the virus can live on actual makeup itself. Speaking to InStyle's Sarah Conley, Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said scientists are not yet sure how coronavirus ""persists in beauty products."" Still, she recommended that people throw away makeup they've used if they contract the virus, just to be safe.

Dr. Rasmussen also told the publication that the virus won't live on all ingredients the same. For example, makeup with higher alcohol contents could ""render the virus inactive,"" whereas products with less alcohol pose a higher risk of becoming contaminated.

That being said, now is a great time to clean your makeup brushes

Speaking to Insider, makeup artist Ivy Boyd said she typically recommends washing your brushes once every week. During a pandemic, however, she'd ""up that to every few days.""

""I've been washing my own personal brushes every other day or so,"" Boyd said. ""Remember, your brushes will only remain clean if you have clean hands too, so keep up on the handwashing, especially before sitting down to do your makeup.""

What to look for as a client to ensure you are receiving a safe and sanitary makeup application from your makeup artist. This applies to makeup applications during and NOT during a pandemic flu. -- If you are a makeup artist, let this serve as a 10 minute crash course in sanitation. -- At this time, I will be implementing additional measures like the hospital grade hand cleanser, Hibiclens and if a client prefers, I am happy to wear gloves, mask, Hazmat suit, honestly, whatever you feel most comfortable with :) A post shared by Ivy Boyd✖️Wake Up For Makeup (@ivysavanah) on Mar 13, 2020 at 7:49am PDT Mar 13, 2020 at 7:49am PDT

Boyd recommends using ""gentle but effective soaps"" to clean brush bristles, specifically those from Dr. Bronner's and Beautyblender. That being said, brush handles should also be cleaned as a precaution.

""For liquid and cream products, bar soaps often work best,"" Boyd said. ""In a pinch, try dipping a brush into some olive oil first to help break down the product, but still follow with soap and water.""

You should also be wary of using beauty products if you feel any coronavirus symptoms or have other signs of illness

While it's important to clean brushes frequently, it's also worth sanitizing your actual makeup. Speaking to Insider, makeup artist Jordan Liberty said powder products are especially easy to clean, as they ""don't breed bacteria"" in the same way creams and liquids do.

You can spritz a 70% alcohol spray on them, according to Liberty, to kill surface bacteria. However, using products with applicators that actually touch your skin, like lip glosses and gel eyeliners, are ""where you start getting into trouble.""

""Any product that you touch to your face when you have something like coronavirus, that product is probably contaminated,"" Liberty said.

To be safe, Liberty recommends using makeup sparingly if you're feeling any symptoms of an illness like coronavirus.

""If you have any doubts, just make sure that you're more cognizant of your products,"" Liberty said. ""Maybe choose one lipstick that you're gonna use right now, and then in a couple of weeks, throw that out and pick a new one out. Not contaminating your entire kit is very important.""

It's a good idea to check the expiration dates of products you own

Just because a beauty product is clean doesn't mean it's necessarily safe to use. According to Boyd, expired makeup can be just as harmful as infected products.

""I'd be very mindful of product expiration dates right now,"" Boyd told Insider. ""Look for a little open jar symbol on the label. The number indicates how many months you have from the time the product is opened. When in doubt? Throw it out.""

If you're not sure if a product is expired, it's best to just throw it away. Amanda Krause/Insider

Makeup artists can also use this time to pick up some new hygiene skills

Because some states don't require makeup artists to obtain a license before practicing, Liberty says many makeup artists use improper hygiene practices on clients. For example, some say they use products like lip gloss straight from the tube on multiple clients because it's quicker and cheaper than using a disposable wand.

That makes now the perfect time for makeup artists to try out new skills they might not have learned, or have been opposed to using, previously, according to Liberty.

""This is a really great time while we're all in self-imposed quarantine to practice those habits at home,"" Liberty said. ""If you're a makeup artist and you're bored and you don't have any clients right now, do your own face with hygiene standards to the point where you get good at it and fast at it.""

""We can really use this time to change our rhythms and our habits so that when we come out of this, we're in a position to serve our clients better,"" he said.","If you're staying indoors, now is the perfect time to clean your makeup brushes, as the virus can live on surfaces for hours and sometimes days.

138,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/03/03/coronavirus-marketing-why-most-brands-are-keeping-their-hands-clean,"Tue, 03 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Drum,Coronavirus marketing: why most brands are keeping their hands clean,"As cases of the coronavirus (Covid-19) increase internationally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and governments alike are engaging in information warfare to combat the spread of the virus. Elsewhere, brands — usually the first react and engage with newsworthy topics — have steered well clear, despite the clear social good (and potential financial) incentives.

Since the first instances of the virus were detected in China's Wuhan province on 31 December, examples of brands using their marketing might to share helpful information have been few and far between. Even those in the travel and health sectors, who have had their services directly impacted by the outbreak, have shied away from addressing the issue directly their campaigns.

One outlier is Lush, which recently invited the UK public to wash their hands in-store for free. Posters promoting the initiative throughout its UK stores make no mention of the virus, instead offering a contextual prompt to a public scrambling for cleanliness.

In a statement, the company said: “Since we’re universally known as ‘that soap shop’, from Friday 28 February we’re using our shop windows to promote the hand-washing guidelines as advised by the NHS in the UK and other public health organisations around the world,” the company said in a statement.

“The winter months are always a time when hand hygiene matters because coughs and colds pass around, but the current situation with the spread of the new Coronavirus means that it is more important than ever that people regularly wash their hands and observe best practice.

“It is also important that people understand the full, effective routine of washing as advised by the health authorities to maximise the removal of germs.”

Lush chief executive Mark Constantine fell short of naming the illness in his own explanation.

“The simplest thing you can do to not get a virus is to regularly wash your hands,"" he said.

""So we’re saying people can come in off the street and wash their hands in our place. We’ve got loads of soap and plenty of hot water.""

This wisdom is likely to drive footfall to stores as coronavirus continues its global spread, with the brand sticking its neck out in a way very few have.

Brands 'unsure' how to help

Owen Lee, chief creative officer of FCB Inferno, tells The Drum, he's spoken to and heard of brands that want to help, but are unsure if and how they can.

“Brands are nervous about appearing to profit from this crisis. The conversation is being had in many client and agency organisations, but they have to be absolutely sure they are helping people not just making money from it, or being seen to make money from it.”

For Lee, any brand considering linking itself to a public health scare will have to first ask if they have a ""genuine association"" with it and if they have an active role to play in helping.

""Advertisers also need to be careful they don’t do anything that runs counter to government advice. People are confused about how they should act so brands need to be careful not to add to the confusion.”

It’s largely uncharted territory. While Lee offers examples of businesses aiding the WWII propaganda effort (like Coca-Cola) he hesitates to conjure any positive examples around the spread of disease. He concludes: “I dare say condom brands even jumped on the AIDS virus scare campaign in the late 1980s.”

'Stay the hell out of it unless you absolutely can’t'

Nervousness withstanding, bad players looking to profit from growing emergency have emerged too.

Facemask prices and health-aid prices have been jacked up to exploit demand. For its part, Amazon has warned sellers against exploitative price gouging around antibacterial and precautionary products. Health experts, meanwhile, have warned that the effectiveness of masks has been over-egged at best, and they are hastening the spread at worst. A quick scan of Instagram shows masked influencers and celebs partaking in something between misinformation and false advertising.

Meanwhile, retailers have had their own ups and downs.

Those selling near affected areas have been selling out of certain food types (see: 'pasta shortage enrages Italian man in quarantine zone'), and hygiene products.

This new demand is a gift to retailers - if they are a position to restock, and secondly, if there remains a public still willing to risk a visit to the high street. In the UK, Boots the pharmacy recently ran out of hand soap. A section of the pharmacist's website explains how to minimize exposure to the disease and there is a subtle call to action to shop its antibacterial soaps there.

Online advertising has been impacted too. On Google, brands are now restricted from buying keywords sensitive events, including disease. So, for now, there's no promoted search results appearing atop vital news services reporting on coronavirus.

All in, ad land has shown an uncharacteristic level of self-control around reactive marketing. This may be down to the fear that any comparisons with the virus can hurt brand perception. The unfortunately named Corona beer has taken a hit, according to a small sample PR poll, although the brewer denies sales have been hurt.

Doctor Ryan Wallman, creative director and head of copy at Wellmark, and author of Delusions of Brandeur, couldn't think of many positive campaigns around health issues and argues there's little precedent for businesses to get involved. The freshest campaign he could highlight was a “horribly tone-deaf 'Unhappy meals' campaign from Burger King”, which drew criticism from mental health campaigners last year.

Wallman explained: ""I suspect brands don’t want to be associated with [coronavirus], even if it’s in an ostensibly helpful way. I’m no PR person, but you get the sense that the risk of a negative association is just too great.

“The risks of getting it wrong are greater in healthcare than in most other areas. My advice is to stay the hell out of it unless you absolutely can’t.”

As the UK awaits a public health campaign from the government, brands could lend their media space or assets to amplify the message. As could the tech platforms that command so much of the public's attention. Facebook has been planking coronavirus advice on its newsfeed, it has also said it is curbing misinformation about the disease, if not political advertising, at least.

At the time of writing, reported cases of coronavirus stood at 92,262. 3,131.

With the final severity of the pandemic yet to be realised, caution from advertisers remains well placed.

Perhaps, then, it is best brands butt out and in the absence of bad or #spon information, the real public health messages may stand a better chance of cutting through.","One outlier is Lush, which recently invited the UK public to wash their hands in-store for free.

Stop & Shop stores will open from 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. only for those customers of the age group who the CDC and local health officials say are most vulnerable.

""Although Stop & shop will not be requesting ID for entry, we request that we all respect the purpose of the early opening – and do the right thing for our older neighbors,"" Stop & Shop said in a statement. ""Stop & Shop will reserve the right to ask customers to leave if they are not a member of this age group.""

Stop & Shop is also suspending pickup service and stopped all in-store tastings.

ShopRite has not adjusted its hours.

All three stores said delivery services to homes will be delayed. ShopRite said all items will be left at the door.

ShopRite has also limited the purchase of items such as disinfectant cleaners and wipes, bar and liquid soaps, water, cough/cold over the counter medicines to two.

And as the number of COVID-19 infections in Malaysia surpasses well over 100 cases, we began seeing several offices, buildings and businesses being temporarily closed and their workers sent away for self-quarantine to stop the spread of the viral contagion.

Though itâ€™s always a good thing to be cautious when dealing with outbreaks of infectious disease, experts note that some of the steps being taken by Malaysians in trying to stop the spread of COVID-19 might have gone a little overboard.

No need to panic

Despite the growing number of infections both in the country and around the world, health professionals maintain the stance that the COVID-19 outbreak has yet to reach pandemic proportions and that the most basic â€œbest practicesâ€ are able to contain its spread.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the chances of you getting infected with COVID-19 is still relatively low, unless youâ€™ve either travelled to an area where the coronavirus is spreading, or had contact with someone positive for the infection.

Meanwhile, Malaysiaâ€™s Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah made it a point to inform the public that it was unnecessary to shut down places and premises with known COVID-19 cases.

According to the good doctor, a regiment of disinfecting and cleaning procedures where someone whoâ€™s infected with COVID-19 had been would suffice at ensuring that these spaces remain clear.

Scientists conclude that one of the most effective ways to counter the spread of microbial diseases such as COVID-19 is through the act of maintaining good hygiene by disinfecting and cleaning frequently touched surfaces and areas thoroughly and regularly.

This easy process of â€œkeeping things cleanâ€ has been implemented in most public places like hospitals, airports, government buildings, public transportation and even in shopping malls accross Malaysia and the world in order to contain COVID-19.

To kill a microbe

COVID-19 can easily spread between people through close contact with one another or through environmental transmission via respiratory droplets or bodily fluids produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even breathes.

Infections can happen as easily as touching or coming in contact with a contaminated surface or object, and touching your own face, eyes, nose and mouth after.

(Credit: Twitter)

However, just like any other microorganism such as bacteria, archaea or fungi. Viruses are relatively easy to kill when it is exposed outside of the body of a host.

According to the WHO, COVID-19 can survive between a few hours to several days on any given surface, depending on what kind of surface it is as well as the temperature and humidity of the object in question.

These contaminated items can be simply disinfected through the use of chemicals such as alcohol, bleach, or household antimicrobial agents and cleaning products.

Keeping things clean

As weâ€™ve already established that COVID-19 can be killed through basic hygiene practices, hereâ€™s a quick and simple guide on how you can properly clean and disinfect your home, offices or businesses from contamination.

Cleaning surfaces

Simple low-cost measures can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your home and workplace.

Start by ensuring that you have the appropriate protective gear on so that you donâ€™t get yourself infected when youâ€™re busying with the â€œspring cleaningâ€ routine. Have disposable gloves, surgical masks and to be super safe, disposable gowns or aprons available during the cleaning process, and to only use disposable cleaning materials such as single-use sponges, rags and towels.

You can begin by cleaning the most â€œhigh-touchâ€ surfaces and items around you like the desks and tables, doorknobs, light switches and electronic devices, and even the sink and toilets, before moving on to other areas around the house or workplace.

Also, remember to clean and disinfect areas in or on your personal vehicles too.

If the particular surface or item is dirty or dustier than usual, then try and clean it using detergent or soap and water before you begin wiping it down with disinfectants.

Any household disinfectants and antimicrobial cleaners will do fine to rid of contamination. But, do make sure that the product youâ€™re using has not expired.

You can also prepare your own disinfecting solution by mixing 5 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water. This works pretty well at killing those pesky germs and viruses.

Wipe each and every surface thoroughly, at least twice daily to ensure the best protection for yourself and the people around you and remember to not touch your face, eyes, mouth and nose, and to immediately wash after cleaning.

For soft and porous surfaces like carpets, rugs and drapes, use the appropriate cleaners and detergents available for them or simply toss em’ into the washing machine or send them away to be professionally cleaned.

Cleaning clothing and textiles

Textiles and clothing materials can be washed as per usual. However, itâ€™s best to use the warmest appropriate wash and dry settings available on your machines to ensure that you properly decontaminate the clothing.

When putting clothing into the washer, try not to shake the laundry too much to minimise the possibility of dispersing contagions through the air and to always clean and disinfect your hampers and laundry baskets after.

And laundry from patients infected with COVID-19 can be mixed and washed together with other peopleâ€™s items without any fear of cross-contamination.

Paranoia and fear are natural human responses that no one should feel embarrassed about.

But just remember that a lil’ common sense and some good ole’ fashion hygiene is more than enough to keep you and your loved ones protected from illness.

144,https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2020/mar/18/n-y-stock-exchange-gets-first-ever-deep/,"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,N.Y. Stock Exchange gets first-ever 'deep clean',"NEW YORK -- On a recent day on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders were cheek to cheek as stock prices flashed above them. They stood in clusters shouting, sharing screens, sharing pizza, sharing pens. They shook hands, leaned over shoulders, patted each others' backs, hugged. There were no windows open.

The New York Stock Exchange was not built for social distancing. But it is not ready to close and send the traders home because of the coronavirus.

And so, starting late Friday, the stock exchange got fully sanitized for the first time since the iconic neoclassical building opened in 1903. More precisely, it got a ""deep clean.""

The process took eight hours and a crew of 10 specialists. These deep cleanings are planned to be repeated weekly, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per month. But those in charge of the building and many of the traders themselves believe the New York Stock Exchange -- a symbol of American economic might and stability -- is too important to shut down.

""The stock exchange is a sign of strength,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange. ""That's why we're open.""

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

John Tuttle, vice chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, added, ""The bell always rings, rain or shine. It's the most sacred 40 square feet in finance.""

The stock market closed Friday up more than 9% after a stressful week that included what was then the worst single-day drop since the 1987 crash.

Around 5 p.m., the CNBC crew that broadcasts from the floor of the exchange turned its lights off.

The traders were exhausted. They filed out. The regular cleaning crew came through with trash bags and brooms.

At 6 p.m., the new crew came in through the colonnade, under the pediment with carved stone figures representing science, industry, agriculture and mining. The crew was from an outside firm, Tech Clean Industries. They were familiar with the stock exchange -- they usually cleaned the building's ducts, fans, air pumps and heaters. Now they had been fitted with new gear and the task of deep cleaning.

There had been arguments to close the building. Much of the work that once happened on the trading floor now happens online, executed by algorithms, quietly, with no handshaking.

But the work that traders do in person reduces volatility and adds a layer of human-guided assurance, many of them said.

""It's like a plane. It can fly itself,"" Cunningham said. ""But when you're managing critical situations you want people involved, with human eyes on each stock.""

Tim Anderson, managing director of TJM investments, who works in a pod on the trading floor, said he had been trying to shake hands less and hug less. He was using hand sanitizer more. He said he had no intention of staying home from work.

""It would be a very bad optic for the building to close,"" he said, adding that he was excited about the sanitation effort: ""I mean look, I think it'd be a great idea to do it once a month, even if there wasn't a virus.""

The disinfection crew wore matching hazardous material suits, reflective yellow vests, doubled-up blue gloves, goggles and purple respirators. They filled spray bottles and fanned out across the floor. They would be working until the morning. They would clean every surface that people had touched.

The place was pretty messy.

There is a long tradition of writing notes and arithmetic on scraps of paper and dropping them, ripped up, on the floor. And so Friday, there were the scraps, along with piles of candy wrappers, water bottles, pizza oil-covered paper plates, tin foil, and many balled-up napkins, which doubled as stress balls for the traders during the day.

The hazmat suit-clad cleaning team wandered and sprayed every surface -- computers, chair legs, tables, floor, everything -- with Z BioScience Multi-Task Probiotic Cleaner. They threw out every paper they encountered, making piles of notes and printer paper. They wiped the surfaces down.

Next, they rolled out a big yellow tank, and a couple of crew members put on tank backpacks. Using a specialized sprayer that looked like a paint gun, they coated everything with Anasphere, a biohazard disinfectant. This was the most toxic step.

They left the disinfectant there for about 10 minutes to allow it to cure. They worked quietly at the beginning. As the night wore on, they talked and joked a little more.

The last step was preventive. They applied a probiotic layer -- Z BioScience Enviro-Mist Microflora spray -- that would stay on all the surfaces and buy them a couple more days until the process needed to start again.

Jim Katsarelis, the stock exchange's head of building operations who oversees efforts to keep the building clean every day, said he knows keeping the surfaces sanitized was not enough to prevent the spread of a virus that comes from bodies, traveling from a sneeze or a wiped nose and a handshake.

So ""we also have new rules -- no shaking hands, no hugging, no kissing,"" he said, adding that it was hard because, ""We're affectionate people.""

He talked about keeping the building open as a civic obligation.

""I drive over the Long Island bridge, and it always amazes me the beauty of the city skyline, and I see this place equal to that,"" Katsarelis said. ""I want to keep it open, and I want to keep it clean, and I want to keep us healthy so I can do it for a little bit longer.""

The disinfection crew sprayed just about everything but the opening bell.

They finished early Saturday morning, funneling out in civilian clothes before the sun rose over Wall Street, quiet on a weekend.

On Monday morning, as New York schools, restaurants and shops stayed dark and with subways eerily quiet, the stock exchange lit up like normal. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to near zero to help stimulate the economy.

The CNBC lights came back on. The stock prices flashed. Traders returned, not quite elbow to elbow anymore.

""This is one of four buildings that defines America: the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court and the New York Stock Exchange. All three branches of government and then the economy,"" Tuttle said. ""We can't close.""

145,https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/society-and-culture/in-praise-of-human-filth-caspar-salmon,"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Prospect,Clean freaks are having a field day with coronavirus—but there’s something to be said for the intimacy of human filth,"It was only to be expected that, following the handwashing recommendations made by all health organisations and governments worldwide to combat Covid-19, the clucking scolds who make up Lifestyle & Cleanliness Twitter would have a field day.

To explain: the social website has its own little corners and subsets. Football Twitter, philosophy Twitter, pornography Twitter; I gather Tory Twitter is even a thing. These groups of like-minded people form relatively organically and make the site their own by sharing in-jokes and developing a common history, a common language even.

And one of the more resilient, and somehow popular demographics to exist on this website famous for the free exchange of inane opinions is what might also be termed “Health and Sanitation Twitter.”

Here, forbidding persons with presumably pristine bedrooms will generate long conversations by holding forth on such scintillating topics as “how many towels you must own” or “how often you should change your sheets,” or “are you drinking water?” (a hardy favourite). A deathless topic in recent years has been the discovery that there is a hardcore of people who don’t actively wash their legs in the shower, preferring instead to prioritise other, more obviously dirty body parts and let the soapy water trickle down their pins. Social media is apparently still reeling from this revelation, which can be said to have birthed a whole generation of lifestyle opiners.

These people, who earnestly intone every now and then that it’s important to moisturise must know—surely they must—that it isn’t, really. Few things could be less important. But the crucial thing is never to let slip the pretence that this stuff is paramount.

Perhaps a fear of death—of becoming dust or soil oneself—is at play here. The documentary The Disappearance of My Mother, currently in cinemas, shows the ex-model Benedetta Barzini as an older woman attempting to retreat from a universe of femininity and appearances. Barzini wishes to flee the world’s expectations of her as a mother and beautiful person. In one of the university lectures she gives, she asks why we idolise youth, suggesting that it stems from a fear of annihilation. She seems to be willing herself to deteriorate: her skin bears the traces of a lifetime of cigarette smoke; we hear at one point that she hasn’t showered in two weeks. There is something beautiful about Barzini’s humanity, and about the tussle, in her, between an adventurous mind and a body that she seems to consider in purely utilitarian terms. The beauty and the cleanliness of it, are trivial to her – things she doesn’t want to wrangle anymore.

Perhaps our personal habits seem, to people from younger generations, like one thing that we are able to control. Cleanliness—the idea of subjecting one’s natural environment to one’s own will and might—could, then, be read as a sort of salve, to compensate for powerlessness in other dimensions; financial, political.

Meeting friends at a restaurant this weekend, we laughingly tried out for the first time the new elbow pats that are advised in lieu of handshakes. Amidst it, I felt a tiny pang for what we had lost in human connection—for the warm breath on a cheek, for the familiar smell of someone and for their hand pressing into the small of my back. With one’s children, as with sexual partners, many of the things that endear a person to you are to do with their grime and smell, the transmission of friendly bacteria. Catching my oldest boy’s warm sick in one hand and wiping beads of sweat from his brow when he was ill, I felt close to him, could divine his personhood from that slight and heaving frame.

I sometimes think of a friend who told me about a man who paused for only a split second when she sneezed into her hand during sex with him before wiping her palm in his hair—how sexy it was of him not to care. I think of an old lover of mine who made me warm with affection when he didn’t act like a whiny baby about sharing a toothbrush when I stayed over. And I think of Seamus Heaney, reminded of a skunk by his wife, and “By the sootfall of your things at bedtime,/Your head-down, tail-up hunt in a bottom drawer/ For the black plunge-line nightdress.” I love this picture of the loved one’s rump in the air, watched from the bed with a fond and easy lust. The hum of someone, the cheerful filth of your shared bedsheets—these are the imperfections that bind us to one another, like jokes.



Our natural disgust at filth, as when a baby recoils from a brown banana, is partly what keeps us alive. But running the risk of sharing bacteria with someone, of letting down one’s guard to let somebody commingle with you, is partly what makes our existences lives. We want to be able to abstract ourselves from an idea of ourselves as vectors of muck; we couldn’t cope if we truly confronted the profusion of alien bodies in our midst; and it destroys our sense of selfhood to think of ourselves as organisms.

Maybe part of the queasy horror of coronavirus now is that we are forced to focus on washing, on our unthinking relation to others in the midst of our world, and on our own physicality. This is a strain of consciousness too far—we need to be able to un-think our bodies, un-remember them, so that we can use them to connect with one another.","Football Twitter, philosophy Twitter, pornography Twitter; I gather Tory Twitter is even a thing.

Thus began Kavita Kajaria and Shruti Ghose’s journey. Reaching out at community level and involving school students, the duo has partnered to help the city manage their waste with several result-oriented programmes. For instance, their Khal Road (Alipore) project in April 2018 transformed the area into a beautiful green belt from a garbage dumping ground with support from the Port Trust and local municipal authority. Also worth mentioning is their Bank It Don’t Bin It programme, which has diverted close to two tons of plastic wastes through recyclers, from landfill and water bodies to last-mile disposal.

While raising funds and implementing projects are a task, Shruti term them as ‘learnings’ rather than ‘challenges’. “It takes time and a slight nudge to help people rethink waste as an area of priority. It’s work in progress and patience is the key. The change will come slowly, but surely,” emphasises Shruti, founder of GFI Kolkata, for whom the biggest inspiration is their team that respects the environment and shares the same zeal. Echoing her thoughts and giving due credit and respect to sanitation workers mentor Kavita states, “Every sanitation worker we see rummaging through our waste gives us the push to think of ways we can make their life easier.” And before signing off they urge one and all to rethink their relationship with waste for the sake of a better planet.","Thus began Kavita Kajaria and Shruti Ghose’s journey.

Also, your kids’ phones (ahem). Because while it’s important to know the best way to wash your hands, it’s a little counterproductive to to dry off those newly clean hands, only pick up a germy phone and start tapping on that phone screen.

– Note: This post was updated with new information on March 11, 2020 –

Before you start freaking out about your teens grabbing snacks at S’bux while scrolling Insta, reports so far are that Coronavirus itself is not likely to be able to live on metal surfaces for more than a few hours — though it may be more for plastic, and that includes phone cases.

(Update: Here is a NiH list of how long a coronavirus can be active on various surfaces. It lives the longest on plastic surfaces (16 hours), less on steel (13 hours), followed by 8.5 hours on cardboard, 3.4 hours on copper, and 2.7 hours in the air.)

The CDC also reports that while it may be possible that to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface with the virus on it, then touching your own mouth or nose, “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”

So still, this is about preparing, not panicking.

I wrote earlier this week, facts are friends. This is about common sense prevention tips, and maybe even finding some solutions that ease any anxiety you’re having just a bit.

But Coronavirus aside, with the knowledge that a cell phone can be10 times dirtier than your toilet seat (and that’s not counting kids’ phones), it’s good to have some phone-cleaning supplies and disinfectant techniques available to you any time of year at all.

Tips and Methods for Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Phone, from Light Cleaning to the Serious Stuff





For a quick clean: Clean your phone screen with a soft microfiber cloth

For the best way to clean your phone, I like carrying soft, lint-free, microfiber cloths for my devices. They’re affordable, reusable, and come in convenient multipacks so that you can hand them out to the kids. Stash extras around the house or in the car; you really can’t have too many.

You can also consider a thin microfiber lens cloth like the ones shown above from MagicFiber. You may even have them around the house already, free with eyeglass purchases but can’t hurt to have more. Both options are washable, making them an eco-friendly choice as well.

Bonus: If you’re really worried about germs, you can whip out your cloth to wipe down ATM screens or those screens at retail check-out that you have to sign with your finger.

For a deeper clean: Clean your phone screen with warm, soapy water

If you need to get something sticky off your phone (hey, parents!) and a quick wipe-down with a cloth isn’t working, you can go to the next step. According to Apple, the easiest way to clean your phone requires nothing more than a microfiber cloth or the kind of cloth that comes with your eyeglasses — plus some soapy water. It should be slightly damp, not soaked through. And don’t use dish soap which is a lot more concentrated and a lot more sudsy. A drop of whatever you wash your hands with should be fine.

And unless you have a newer model waterproof phone (Galaxy Note 10, Galaxy S10, iPhone XS, iPhone 11, etc), avoid getting the ports wet. Otherwise, not much to worry about.

(Note: Apple has updated their recommendations since publication of this post, see below.)

For wiping away germs: Clean your phone screen with wipes or sprays made for electronics





(Updated) I’m surprised how many sites recommend using regular old household disinfectant sprays, considering how many phone manufacturers recommend against them; mainly because of how damp sprays can get your devices, and how they compromise some touch screens — and I’ve read a few horror stories from users after trying them out.

You definitely want a product that’s designed to be gentle on your pricy devices and here are a couple I like:

Option 1:

For the best way to clean your phone safely and make it shine, I remain the biggest fan of Whoosh! Screen Cleaning spray (above), which comes with a reusable microfiber cloth that I also love. It claims to eliminate 99.9% of “dust, dirt, oil and gunk” from your screen, so while it’s not antibacterial, it will keep it clean. There are other brands, but I really haven’t found one that’s better.





Option 2:

While not as eco-friendly as a reusable cloth option, I have long been a fan of Windex Electronic Wipes, which you can use safely on most gadget screens. Find multipacks on Amazon, or you can grab them at most supermarkets and hardware stores. These wipes really do work well!

Note: (Updated) The active ingredient in both of these products is Ethanol, or simple alcohol. The CDC notes that alcohol doesn’t kill germs, but removes them, which lowers the risk of transferring them from your gadget to your fingers.

For wiping away germs and disinfecting: Clean your phone screen with household cleansing wipes that contain ammonia and alcohol





Since first publishing this post, Apple has updated their how to clean your devices FAQ page (WTG Apple!) with a very clear message: they now suggest that it is fine to use a household disinfectant wipe, like Lysol wipes or Clorox wipes.





The active ingredients in each of these is a combination of isopropyl alcohol, and alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride.

Isopropyl alcohol can be a slightly better choice than ethyl alcohol because it evaporates more quickly and doesn’t leave oil behind. Alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (benzalkonium chloride) is an ammonia compound which is both a surfactant and a disinfectant. So unlike the electronic wipes above, these products do infect disinfect your devices.

Note that these wipes do not contain bleach! The name Clorox may make you think of bleach, but the wipes are not made with Clorox bleach. Please don’t substitute a DIY bleach solution on your phone!

The biggest problem however, is finding them. While they’re temporarily out of stock basically everywhere, the manufacturers and retailers claim they’ll be back in stock soon.

What about natural wipes?

You may generally prefer a “natural wipe” around your home like 7th Generation disinfectant wipes, in which the active ingredient is Thymol, a botanical derivative of Thyme. I’ve been trying to find resources that indicate whether it’s as effective as a product like Clorox wipes on the Novel Coronavirus, but that’s been tough.

Even the 7th Generation Coronavirus FAQ page doesn’t make any claims, and I admit that gives me pause. However they do link to the Cleaning Institute, which makes a general claim that that “disinfectants or disinfectant cleaners (also known as antibacterial cleaners) kill the germs that can cause many illnesses,” and 7th Gen Disinfecting Wipes are in fact labeled “disinfectants.”

So…I just personally can’t vouch for them comparatively and I’ve looked around a lot. Natural ingredients (Thymol, pine oil) are not mentioned in the Consumer Reports article about products that kill Coronavirus; and I see no natural disinfectants in the EPA approved list of registered anti-microbial Products for use against Novel Coronavirus, which includes products by Lysol, Clorox, Oxy, and others.

(I also take EPA info with a grain of salt these days, but still.)

If you have different info, please leave in comments and I will update.

For sterilizing and disinfecting: Clean your phone with a UV phone sterilizer

Here’s where we start getting into the serious stuff when it comes to cleaning your phone. These options for sterilizing and disinfecting your phone will cost you more, but will get the microbe-killing job done.





One of my new favorites is PhoneSoap UV-C smartphone sanitizer, an electronic device that looks like a little isolation chamber for your phone. It works using UV-C bulbs that sanitize the entire phone, reportedly killing 99.99% of bacteria and germs. It’s expensive, for sure. But it also doubles as an attractive phone charger in lots of colors. Pop your phone in there each night before bed and let it clean (and charge) while you sleep.

You can search Amazon and find a few more affordable alternatives that work in similar ways, but they’re from brands I’m not as familiar with personally and in this case, I’d go with the trusted brand that gets expert recommendations over and over.





While the PhoneSoap3 can accommodate all smartphones including the larger iPhone plus or Galaxy S10+ models, obviously it won’t fit your tablets. If you’ve got larger gadgets — or lots of phones and gadgets to clean at once — definitely check out the HomeSoap UV Sanitizer through their website.

It’s like a giant UVC-light germ-destroying locker, big enough that you can pop in your phones, remote controls, gaming controllers, hand-held games like Nintendo Switch, headphones or AirPods, or an Apple iPad Pro. (Though probably not all at once.) It’s expensive, but a smart idea for families with lots of gadgets to clean and disinfect.

For speedy sterilizing and disinfecting: Clean your phone with a UV-C wand





The great thing about using UV-C wands to clean your phone, is that they can clean microbes and bacteria really quickly, especially on smooth surfaces like phone screens. That makes them great for a quick swipe over your kids’ phones before they run out the door.

We first recommended the Verilux CleanWave UV-C sterilizing wand back in 2012, and it still gets terrific ratings. Wave it over your phone, tablet, keyboard, you name it, and it disinfects — at least until you pick it up again with your germy hands, ha. While it may be one of the best ways to clean your phone, note that it won’t get into crevices, like the buttons under your remote control or the cracks between your phone and case.

If you’re gawking at the price, I’ve been searching for a more affordable alternative for cleaning your phone with a UV-C wand. The one I feel I can recommend that has decent ratings across various sites is the Petoneer UV Wand Sterilizer. It was originally created by a pet-solution company to sterilize your pet’s food and water, but also works on your phones and devices, as with all UV-C light wands. Plus, it’s compact and not too expensive.

""There is a strategy and timelines. The first 100 days, some projects will have taken off. We will start with a few projects,"" he said. He has 25 items to deliver in the first three months.

Badi said the clean-up of the city has started.

""In Burma Market and Muthurwa, we collected 250 tonnes [of garbage] that has been taken to Dandora,"" he said.

Tourism CS Najib Balala and head of the now-defunct Nairobi Regeneration team said Badi’s experience will turn Nairobi around for good.

Speaking when he handed over the helm, Balala said cleaning up the city is not going to be easy.

“Some programmes took off while others did not,” Balala said.

The CS said the success of his team was in laying the foundation for others to build on.

Balala said they did 38 roads in Eastlands worth Sh2.7 billion with Sh1.8 billion coming from the national government while Sh800 million came from the City Hall.

The CS said electricity was connected to county hospitals.

“Thirty thousand title deeds were issued in Nairobi in May 2018. Five thousand are set to be issued,” he said.

Balala said he had directed relevant county executives to prepare a brief on what has been done, what hasn't and what needs to be done.

He said reshuffling of county CECs, lack of a framework, the absence of a deputy governor dealt the exercise a major blow.

“There was an informal understanding. We got support technically for two months before it fizzled out,” Balala said.

He said the programme also faced political interference as well as marauding cartels which must be dismantled.

The CS said cartels were not faceless as they are known. “We must dismantle for Nairobi to work.”

Balala's team was tasked with fixing public safety and security, housing and settlement, education and health, environment, water and sanitation, garbage management.

Others were traffic management, city transport, job, business and wealth creation, youth, women, people living with disability and social inclusion.

He said the Interior ministry will offer support to crush cartels.

Balala said the exercise could not have been led by a cabinet secretary as they have other duties.

“All Nairobi residents and politicians should give the director-general the support,” Balala said.

Balala said it will be a shame if the regeneration programme does not work.

He said some of the work was ready for implementation.

Balala said the construction permit which has been a problem needs to be institutionalised to be transparent and curb corruption cases.

Badi will be deputised by Physical Planning Permanent Secretary Enosh Momanyi and will oversee the running of Nairobi county.

President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Nairobi Metropolitan Services during a formal handover at State House Wednesday.

The NMS takes charge after Governor Mike Sonko handed over the crucial services last month.

This followed the expiry of 21 days for the Deed of Transfer of four crucial functions – health, transport, planning and development, and public works and utilities.

""I have also today created the office of the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. These two gentlemen and other offices to be seconded by both the county and national government will assume control over the functions that have been transferred to the National Government,"" Uhuru said.

""For Nairobi to continue with its paramount status not only as the capital but a diplomatic city it is essential that the residents must have reliable, efficient and timely services.""

The core mandate of the NMS will be to deliver services for the people of Nairobi.

President Kenyatta called on the NMS to bring sanity and dismantle the cartels that have hindered the development of the county.

He further promised the NMS that his office and the government will ensure that it achieves its goals.

The Nairobi Metropolitan Services has been tasked with streamlining urban renewal housing projects in Pangani and Jevanjee whose contracts were awarded in 2018 but are yet to kick off.

""The NMS should review these projects and see how they can take off, realising that these projects are part of the recently concluded Eastlands Urban Renewal Master Plan,"" Uhuru stated.

The new team was also tasked with actualising the Nairobi City Railway Master Plan that seeks to create and redevelop 425 acres around the Nairobi Central Railway Station to create a world-class multi-model in the Central Business District.

The area was gazetted last week by the Nairobi county government as a special area to pave the way for planning and implementation of the master plan.

Further, the NMS was tasked with ensuring that garbage was collected effectively and efficiently.

It was also directed to crack down on illegal dumpsites and ensure that industries and restaurants did not discharge effluent into rivers.

“I also direct NMS to ensure that their focus will be on operationalising effective garbage collection and disposal methods that will include a collaboration with the National Youth Service,” the President said.

Grounded machinery and equipment requiring minimum repair are expected to be activated.

The Badi team was told to move with speed and recover contested county land meant for solid waste matter.

In 100 days, the team is expected to gazette the legal solid waste dumpsites for both public and private solid waste collectors.

In the same timeline, the NMS will be expected to come up with strategies of equitable water distribution under the rationing programme.

Water vendors will be registered and monitored to limit water cartels and interruption of services.

This will ensure that Nairobians pay fair water bills.

President Kenyatta noted that corruption and cartels at City Hall were the biggest challenges facing the County

""There is no doubt that there have been challenges in the delivery of these services. Part of these challenges are results of internal constraints and capacity issues afflicting Nairobi county. As a result, the public has been deprived of essentials services,"" he said.

The head of state reiterated that Nairobi is not just Kenya's capital but also an important city in diplomatic circles.

He said the Nairobi Regeneration team formed in 2018 struggled to deliver services to the city.

""We had recognised this problem with Sonko and that is what led to the partnership to develop the Nairobi regeneration programme to deal with the problems faced in Nairobi,"" Uhuru said.

The occasion was attended by among others head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, Attorney General Paul Kihara and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.

The others were Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi, and County CEC for Finance Allan Igambi.","Tourism CS Najib Balala and head of the now-defunct Nairobi Regeneration team said Badi’s experience will turn Nairobi around for good.

The Church of Pentecost in collaboration with the Wa Municipal Assembly has organised a massive clean-up exercise in Wa to climax the “Environmental Care Campaign”.

The two institutions launched the campaign on Sunday, February 23, 2020 to drum home the need for the public to observe good sanitation practices to help make Wa the cleanest city in Ghana.

As part of the campaign, they carried out institutional sensitization in churches, schools and mosques as well as radio discussions to get the message of good sanitation practices to the people.

Members of the Church of Pentecost, Wa Municipal Assembly, Boys Scout and the Zoomlion Ghana Limited among others participated in the clean-up exercise.

Shops at the Wa Central Market and Wa Kajetia, as well as around the Wa Naa’s Palace and the Jubilee Park where the exercise took place, were closed as personnel from the Ghana Police Service were present to ensure maximum compliance.

Addressing participants after the exercise, Mr Paul Baba Mornah, the Wa Municipal Environment Health Officer, said Wa was regarded as the cleanest town some years back, but stated that the narrative had changed because people now engage in bad sanitation practices.

He urged them to jealously guard that position to ensure that Wa remained the cleanest city in Ghana in the next ranking.

Mr Mornah identified poor plastic waste management as a major environmental health challenge in the municipality and appealed to the people to avoid indiscriminate waste disposal and to dispose of plastic waste in refuse bins.

On Open Defecation, the environmentalist appealed to the people to defecate in household latrines rather than defecating in the open, which posed health risk to the general public.

He explained that the Assembly would soon gazette by-laws against ill sanitation practices and called on landlords to construct toilets in their houses in order to avoid being prosecuted.

Mr Mustapha Nuhu Sinto, the Upper West Regional Director of the Information Service Department, urged the people to discipline themselves in their quest to make Wa the cleanest city in the country, and said observing good sanitation practices required self-discipline.

Apostle Daniel Nii Tetteh Tackie, the Upper West Regional Area Head of the Church of Pentecost, noted that it was a collective responsibility for everyone to keep the environment clean.

He said the current state of the environment in the Region should be a wake-up call on stakeholders and the public to act to make the region the cleanest in the northern part of the country.","The Church of Pentecost in collaboration with the Wa Municipal Assembly has organised a massive clean-up exercise in Wa to climax the “Environmental Care Campaign”.

The standing committee on urban development has recommended the agencies concerned to begin biomining at the site to reduce the waste. Bio-mining is a technique of extraction and segregation of minerals and useful material from mounds of waste. This can be used to extract materials like plastic, rubber, metals and gases.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation ( EDMC ) had informed the committee that efforts were being made to remediate the Ghazipur landfill site on line of Indore Municipal Corporation. But the legacy (old) waste at Indore was only 13 lakh tonnes whereas at Ghazipur it is over 140 lakh tonnes.

In its report, the panel said: “The committee from the post evidence reply finds that as desired by them a visit of commissioner, EDMC, joint secretary in-charge of SBM (U) in MoH&UA along with local MP took place and it was agreed to continue bio-mining of landfill site and use of output for RDF and construction and demolition plants with NHAI agreeing to take initial 5,000 tonnes of soil for road construction. The committee recommend that work be started expeditiously on the pattern of Indore.”

The panel headed by BJP MP Jagdambika Pal also took note of a survey which had highlighted how as high as 80% of public toilets in East Delhi were unusable for want of proper maintenance. “In view of ground reality, the committee does not subscribe to the views of the EDMC and recommends that all-out efforts be made on the part of MoH&UA under sanitation component for required level of maintenance in the affected area,” it said.

The panel also found that out of Rs 5,026 crore worth of funds released for solid waste management in urban areas, barely Rs 3,470 crore were used. It also criticised lower utilisation of funds under Atal Mission and Rejuvenation of Urban Transport scheme, which focusses on water supply and sewage connections.

It also flagged the slow pace of work done on the implementation of reform agenda like replacement of energy efficient lights. The report said that 74 lakh such lights were installed, which is less than the target of 100 lakh.

By Emmanuel Elebeke

The Abuja Environmental Protection Board, AEPB is collaborating with the Rotary Club International in the cleanup of communities in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.

The clean- up exercise is focused on clearing all waste disposal sights and ensure that sanitation is maintained even in the rural communities across the FCT.

Speaking at Sabo Lugbe, venue of the clean-up exercise, Director, Abuja Environmental Protection Board, Babashehu Lawan, informed that the partnership is reaching out to many communities within the territory in fulfilment of a promise to the community.

He also said that the exercise was part of the directive of the Minister of the FCT to sanitise as much as possible all the communities in the FCT.

“This is one of the areas we visited last year during the rainy season. We carried out sanitisation campaign and alerted the community and told them to keep their environment very clean.

“The challenge we had during the rainy season was this their communal dump site. Where they are depositing their wastes.

“But because the heavy trucks could not access the dump site that period to lift the refuse, we promised them that we are coming back.

“September last year was our time of sanitization, to give them a health talk and we now came in March 2020 to ensure that the wastes being collected are taken to the central dump site.

“The community is very happy with us. This is also one of the pet-projects of Rotary International. We are working with the community to now identify an ideal dump site because this dump site is very close to a water source, a seasonal stream which usual passes through this communal dump site and the dirty water coming out from the dumps is also reaching out to the streams and all the streams are interlinked and this will also pollute their water bodies. And sometimes people in the community may use same stream for their domestic chores.”

With the clearing of the community, and together with the community, Lawan said the AEPB will ensure that there is sanitary guard in the cleaned communities who will now ensure that wastes from the community are no longer deposited in the usual sites.

“What we are going to do here after removing this monumental wastes is to plant trees. Now the community and the Abuja Environmental Protection Board will identify and Ideal site outside the settlement so that disease transmission by vectors such as flies will not reach the community. And this is the main reason we came here today to ensure that this wastes is removed.”

The President, Rotary Club, Abuja Capital Territory, Mrs. Ndidi Uchuno said the clean-up exercise was in continuation of their culture of adopting communities for the purpose of keeping a clean environment.

She assured that after the clearing of waste, the Club is also going to work with AEPB to plant trees, who are expected to bring their own professional touch to bear.

“Here is Sabon-Lugbe our adopted community, Rotary is trying to make sure that our areas of focus are involved. We take out all our projects in the community and of course this is one of them.

“We came around and saw disaster waiting to happen and we were like we have to do something about it and then we started the project.

“The community has promised to find a better way of disposing their wastes by tying them in nylon with trucks moving around to pick them.

“For now we just have to get this place completely cleared as we promised them. It’s a promise made and a promise kept. Today we’ll make sure that all of this is completely cleared and then we’ll come back to plant the trees.”

On what the community planned to do, the representative of the community and son of the chief of Sabon-Lugbe,

Prince Aminu Ndakozo said they have a pick-up that goes round to collect the wastes and that enforcement to the community had commenced to have a nylon where residents package their refuse and keep in front of their houses for easy pick by waste disposal vehicles.

“That is what we’ll be doing after they cleared this place so that we’ll not contract diseases. We are hearing of Ebola and many other diseases effecting people. We believe with this (clearing of dump site) and by the grace of God, we’ll be very much okay.

“We have taskforce in the community that will be there to guide and lead them on how to go t0 disposing their wastes and I believe with the taskforce they will obey the rules and regulations of the community. We have those that go about to give information to the whole community telling them how to about the wastes . So we believe with those people and the taskforce, they’ll obey the rules and do what they ask them.”

Opinion: We need clean water now, more than ever. Here are 4 ways to help keep Arizona's water supply clean and plentiful.

Masks, ventilators, hospital beds, test kits – these have all been scarce at times. But critical clean water keeps running. (Photo: mheim3011, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

In the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Americans have rightly recognized the heroism and importance of medical professionals, first responders and the “essential workers” staffing groceries and pharmacies.

Perhaps less recognized, but every bit as important, are those employed in the water and sanitation sector.

Every time we wash our hands, we should be grateful for the policies, investments and – above all – dedicated professionals who keep our most important anti-viral weapon flowing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

Water professionals are so critical that some have been quarantined inside of water treatment facilities to protect them from infection so they can continue working, as is the case for workers at the Carlsbad desalination facility in California.

Most of us rarely, if ever, stop to think about the water professionals our lives depend on, but this week is Arizona Water Professionals Appreciation Week, so we’d like to take a moment to suggest four simple ways we can show our gratitude for the individuals who are working to ensure clean water and sanitation during this crisis and at all other times.

Four ways to help the water supply

First, don’t hoard bottled water. Bottled water has its uses, but hoarding bottled water is almost always unnecessary and fails to appreciate that, in nearly all areas of the United States, tap water is as safe and clean as bottled water – and also cheaper, more sustainable and more reliable.

Second, don’t yield to the temptation to use substitutes for toilet paper. Flush only the “three Ps” (need we say? – poop, pee and toilet paper) and nothing else, not even paper towels or those so-called “flushable” wipes, almost all of which are trouble for the sanitation system.

Third, fill out your 2020 census. Help ensure appropriate population-based funding to support water infrastructure investments.

Fourth, use water wisely. In many communities, increasing efficiency in water use has enabled water providers to stretch supplies out among a greater number of users and store water for the future.

Trust your tap water, don’t flush weird stuff, fill out your census and treat water as the precious resource it is.

Even in a pandemic, water still runs

Take a moment to appreciate that even in the developed world’s worst moments of the current pandemic – in Spain, in South Korea, in Italy, in the U.S. – clean tap water has continued to run.

Masks, ventilators, hospital beds, test kits – these have all been scarce at times. But the critical clean water keeps running. This is not an accident and should not be taken for granted. It is the consequence of careful planning and investment by communities and the training and dedication of thousands of water professionals.

Of course, millions of people all over the world lack sufficient supplies of safe water for drinking and cleaning. Indeed, the severity of COVID-19 on the Navajo Nation, where scarce water resources, inadequate infrastructure and ongoing water rights disputes impede access to water, demonstrates that the challenge of improving water access confronts even friends and neighbors here in Arizona as well as other parts of the U.S. and beyond.

There is perhaps no better way to stem future pandemics than to support charities, investors, lenders, and development agencies focused on improved water and sanitation around the world.

Our medical professionals are on the front line working fervently to aid the sick and keep facilities clean, unselfishly putting themselves at risk, like grocery store and restaurant employees, while top scientists work behind the scenes to search for a viable treatment to end this health crisis. Businesses large and small are donating what they can offer, and individuals are using their talents and excess time to spread a bit of kindness to those less fortunate. “Essential businesses” are moving full steam ahead (with extra precautions in place) to provide a bit of normalcy or distraction during this shock to everyday life, keeping the economy somewhat afloat so we don’t have to completely start over whenever this all ends.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recognizes “16 critical infrastructure sectors” which include health care, energy, communication and water, among others. These industries are essential to the way we live and are critically important in emergencies with special responsibility to continue their operations. DHS states: “Promoting the ability of such workers to continue to work during periods of community restriction, access management, social distancing, or closure orders/directives is crucial to community resilience and continuity of essential functions.” The industries deemed “essential” during the COVID-19 pandemic were estimated to collectively employ anywhere from 49 to 62 million workers prior to the outbreak, based on figures from DHS. These workers are helping us get what we need and get rid of what we don’t.

Clean water is and always has been essential in protecting public health. During the pandemic, the emphasis placed on washing your hands regularly cannot be overstated. In addition to water being the basis for every possible cleaning agent, water also needs to be consumed regularly to keep us healthy. Thankfully, water is an area most people in developed countries do not need to worry about right now. Tap water remains safe and reliable for use in your normal everyday activities, including for drinking, cooking, hand-washing, and cleaning. Public water systems, such as Lakeway Municipal Utility District, meet stringent state and federal standards set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to keep treated water clean, safe, and plentiful. The EPA website states that it has established regulations with treatment requirements for public water systems that prevent waterborne pathogens such as viruses [including COVID-19] from contaminating drinking water and wastewater.” Additionally, availability is not expected to be affected. Continuity of operation plans that are implemented by cities and utilities in times of disaster greatly improve the odds that there will always be enough staff on hand to keep critical services, such as water, functioning.

The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and others recognize the important role of water, sanitation and hygiene services working together, collectively known as WASH. Global WASH programs provide expertise and interventions aimed at saving lives and reducing illness by improving access to healthy and safe water, adequate sanitation, and improved hygiene. Within their critical infrastructures document, DHS states, “Safe drinking water is a prerequisite for protecting public health and all human activity. Properly treated wastewater is vital for preventing disease and protecting the environment. Thus, ensuring the supply of drinking water and wastewater treatment is essential to modern life and the nation’s economy.”

We continue to work for you, throughout this pandemic and beyond, to reliably provide the critical water and wastewater services you rely on in your day to day life. “These are unprecedented times we’re living in. Especially in the face of such uncertainty, we need to trust the authorities and comply,” said Earl Foster, general manager of LMUD. “It will take each of us foregoing convenience for a while to prevent the spread of this virus, but we will get through this together. Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to all those who are impacted.”

But with 10% of South Africa’s population having no access to piped water whatsoever, this leaves nearly six million people vulnerable.

Access to water as a basic socio-economic right is enshrined in section 27(1)(b) of the South African Constitution, which states: “Everyone has the right to have access to … sufficient food and water”. Access to water, moreover, is a human right that is monitored annually by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC).

However, the SAHRC has reported that this monitoring has been erratic, largely due to the failure of the Department of Water and Sanitation, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Department of Mineral Resources to respond to its annual requests for information. This has led to the SAHRC having to rely on data from Statistics South Africa to report on.

The table below shows the extent of access to piped water (inside the dwelling, inside the yard, or at an access point outside the yard), among the general population in 2016, 21 years into democracy.

Percentage of the population with access to piped water, 1996 vs. 2016, by province:

Only two provinces – the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal – registered healthy increases (20.4 percentage points and 16.7 percentage points respectively), in the proportion of their population that had access to water by 2016 – but off a low base. A quarter of the population of the Eastern Cape and 15% of the population of KwaZulu-Natal still had no access to piped water in 2016. By 2018, the situation had worsened. Two provinces (Free State and Limpopo), saw reductions in access to piped water (calculations based on 2019 Stats SA data), while the percentage of South Africans as a whole that had access to piped water declined by 11 percentage points.

More poignantly still, only 46.3% of households in South Africa had access to piped water in their dwellings in 2018. Provincial statistics, which would have shown the extent of poor access to water in some under-resourced rural provinces, were not published.

Water in the time of a pandemic

The South African government, taking its lead from the World Health Organisation, has published clear guidelines on the importance of washing hands with soap and water to guard against contracting Covid-19. But if hand washing with soap and water is the primary precautionary measure against contracting the virus and 10% of the population has no access to piped water whatsoever, this leaves nearly six million people (Stats SA’s 2019 mid-year population estimate was 58,775,022) particularly vulnerable to this viral infection.

Many of these people live in densely populated, often water-scarce areas, where there is understandably a fear of high levels of infection. This has important implications for household water management and the maintenance of hygiene – particularly given the need for uninterrupted water supply and strong supportive interventions during this pandemic.

This reality has not gone unattended. The Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation (HSWS) has begun to deliver water storage tanks and water tankers across the country. By 2 April 2020, a total of 612 water storage tanks and 31 water tankers had been delivered to the Free State, 287 tanks to Gauteng, and 262 tanks and 27 tankers to Limpopo.

The media has reported on further water-related government plans. The Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation has reportedly identified 2,000 communities nationally that are in need of water support, and by 28 March 2020, her department had procured 19,000 of the 41,000 water tanks which it hoped to have installed before the end of March. The minister was reported as saying that the decision had been taken to “cut the long process of procurement” and go directly to the distributors and manufacturers. “We have been in touch with manufacturers who have said 400,000 tanks are available to procure.”

The bypassing of onerous procurement procedures and the fact that Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation has been able to deliver water to communities that have either never had water or had only poor-quality water points up the cruel irony of service delivery at the time of a pandemic: What has taken years to achieve, and only partially at that, can be achieved when there is political will. But as Dr Jo Barnes, a retired epidemiologist, pointed out to the Sunday Tribune, water provision cannot be undertaken overnight, especially in the midst of a health crisis. Water reticulation systems take time to design and develop; what remains to be seen is whether the water authorities will undertake this in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The other irony of the government provision of water during the Covid-19 pandemic is that the water is intended for the washing of hands. Samuel Taylor Coleridge in The rime of the ancient mariner intoned:

Water, water, everywhere,

And all the boards did shrink;

Water, water, everywhere,

Nor any drop to drink.

Will there be water for the poor to drink once their hands have been washed? Or will the government revert to washing its hands of the poor? DM

Source: GrundfosClean Works was founded in Ontario, Canada, in 2012, by produce industry veterans who saw the need to improve the fruit and vegetable sanitation to prevent the outbreak of foodborne illnesses. Traditionally, post-harvest washing was used as a decontamination treatment. However, this highly water consumptive process only offered about a 50% contaminant reduction.

So, Clean Works designed a process that uses ultraviolet light, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ozone to kill 99.99% of pathogens, providing a more effective and consistent cleaning process while reducing water consumption.

Source: GrundfosAs the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, the technology in the Clean Flow Mini can sanitize up to 1,200 N95 masks per hour. Through its newest affiliate, Clean Works Medical, the company is offering the Clean Flow Healthcare Mini to meet that need.

The Situation

A key component of the Clean Flow Heath Care Mini is a chemical metering pump that provides continuous dosing of Clean Works sanitation solution. Precise control of the dosing levels and constant spray are essential to effective sanitation, whether sanitizing produce or PPE.

Previously, Clean Works had used peristaltic dosing pumps in their Clean Flow Mini, but these pumps were unable to provide continuous atomization and required additional time for maintenance.

“Pulsation was a big issue with the previous pump manufacturer,” said Joe Symons, general manager of Clean Works. “We needed a fully integrated solution that could deliver the needed accuracy and precision while communicating with the PLC controls.”

Additionally, Clean Works needed a pump that could be placed outside the system enclosure in a washdown environment without being damaged by water or dust.

The Solution

Source: GrundfosTo meet the accuracy and precision demands with PLC integration, Grundfos began testing its DDA FCM pumps with the Clean Works nozzle and chemicals. The Grundfos team was committed to ensuring the pumps worked with the innovative procedure.

“The atomizing was really cool to see,” said Aninda Sarker, Grundfos district sales manager. “As we tested the solution with our pump variants, I took a video for the Clean Works team, so they could see the pump in action. I also joined them at the plant for on-site testing to ensure our solution delivered the results needed.”

By using stepper motor technology, the Grundfos SMART Digital dosing pumps provide a smooth continuous flow profile, even when very small volumes are required. Additionally, an integrated pressure sensor and flow monitoring algorithm controls the flow rate by comparing the actual flow to the set point and automatically making any needed adjustments.

Source: GrundfosThe pump’s IP65 certification means it can safely be mounted outside the machine, conserving critical space inside the equipment.

The Outcome

The Grundfos DDA has been fully integrated into the Clean Works Clean Flow Mini for produce, as well as the Clean Flow Health Care Mini.

“This pump has completely alleviated our maintenance worries, and it’s hands-free,” said Paul Moyers, co-owner of Clean Works.

Source: GrundfosDue to the shortage of N95 masks and other PPE in Canada, Clean Works’ newest affiliate, Clean Works Medical, has seen an increased demand from healthcare providers and industries for the Clean Flow Health Care Mini and the chemical dosing pumps that are critical to its functionality.

Grundfos worked with its global operations teams to quickly meet the increased demand for DDA dosing pumps for Clean Works to ensure the company’s innovative solution can be deployed to sanitize equipment that protects the frontline workers who are helping save lives.

Clean Works Medical is now working with the federal and provincial governments, as well as hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities in Canada, to help supply sanitized equipment during the pandemic.

“The key was to quickly provide a PPE solution to our frontline healthcare providers during this crisis, and Grundfos was an integral part of that,” said Mark VanderVeen, president and CEO of Clean Works.

CÀ MAU – The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Cà Mau plans to build more water supply systems, set up water pipes, drill bore wells, and provide water containers for households affected by drought and saline intrusion, according to its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

The southernmost province has more than 20,850 households facing water shortage in the 2019 - 20 dry season.

The households either have no access to tap water or have to use tap water from degraded supply systems.

The department has instructed its Clean Water and Rural Sanitation Centre to install new water pipes to connect 6,000 households who have no access to tap water.

The centre will also upgrade deteriorating tap water supply systems to secure water for more than 6,200 households.

New water supply systems will be built to provide clean water for 4,000 households who live in populated residential areas that have no water supply.

The centre will also drill six public bore wells and provide plastic containers to store water for 4,200 households who live in scattered areas and cannot access tap water.

Cà Mau has called on international organisations and domestic donors to provide plastic water containers and water treatment facilities for households affected by drought and saltwater intrusion.

The province has installed huge plastic water containers at public places like communes' People’s Committees and cultural houses to supply free water for needed households.

It has also used tank trucks to transport water to supply clean water for households in remote areas, border areas, and islets.

Cà Mau needs about VNĐ230 billion (US$9.8 million) to build water supply infrastructure to provide clean water for household use, according to the centre.

The Government recently decided to provide Cà Mau VNĐ70 billion ($3 million) for prevention and control of drought and saltwater intrusion in the 2019 – 20 dry season.

The money will be used to pump water, dredge canals, build dams, install water pipes, dig wells, buy water treatment facilities, and transport clean water to households in areas affected by drought and water intrusion. – VNS","Cà Mau Province is speeding up construction of water supply projects to provide clean water for household use.

It has been less than a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government’s goal of ‘Har Ghal Jal,’ an ambitious program to provide clean water in every rural household in India. At the time, it was seen as an ambitious challenge in a country where only 18% of rural households have piped water at home.

Now, with COVID-19 threatening to sweep across India and hundreds of millions of Indians in rural villages being asked to wash their hands with water they do not have, the urgency of solving India’s eternal water crisis has rarely been more apparent.

Not that major cities have it much better. Even in Delhi, millions of families rely on illegal water tankers to make up for the capital’s hopelessly outmatched water system. Even as public health officials ask the public to respect the rules of social distancing, both urban and rural Indians have no choice but to share taps. India’s most burgeoning cities, including Bangalore, lack the infrastructure needed to keep themselves sustainably watered even under normal circumstances.

While the central government deliberates how to handle its path forward through lockdown, can it also seize this opportunity to drive home the need for a fundamental change in how 1.3 billion Indians use and access the water they need to survive – and, ultimately, to thrive?

A longstanding issue

Water scarcity has been a fact of life across India for generations, dating back to the harsh changes made to communal water management practices by British colonial authorities but more recently compounded by the rapid growth of India’s major cities. Whereas 31% of Indians lived in urban areas in 2011, 46% of the country will live in cities by 2025. By 2050, an estimated 814 million Indians will be city dwellers.

In these constantly growing urban areas, municipal water systems were simply not built for the numbers of people who now rely on them. In Delhi, an estimated 40% of water distributed by the official grid is ‘lost,’ either through leaks or, more often, quietly tolerated theft.

In rural areas, the changing climate has altered the seasonal monsoon patterns villagers depend on to water their crops and replenish their groundwater. In some areas, rainfall totals are dropping off precipitously. In others, excess rainfall is resulting in deadly flooding.

The lack of access to clean water, both for drinking and for bathing, was already putting hundreds of millions of Indians at risk from infectious diseases before COVID-19 emerged late last year. Communicable diseases including cholera, dysentery, and typhoid all continue to spread through rural India, in part because of subpar hand hygiene.

Between 2013 and 2017, Indian government statistics found that waterborne illnesses had killed 10,738 people. 60% of them had died of diarrhea, which can easily be prevented with proper sanitation and access to clean water.



The novel coronavirus’ not-so-unique dangers

Like these other diseases, the SARS-CoV-2 virus (widely known as the “novel coronavirus”) is able to spread more widely and more easily where clean water is scarce, but especially where sewage systems are failing to properly handle human waste. Researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) already suspect that the virus can spread through stool.

Evidence from the 2003 outbreak of the related SARS virus in Hong Kong has shown how fecal transmission caused by faulty plumbing can spread this type of respiratory illness among a community. Suspicions of the novel coronavirus spreading through unsealed pipes have already arisen during the current pandemic.

This means the daily open dumping of thousands of tons of human waste, where it can contaminate the water supply, is a potential vector for the further spread of the epidemic. Here again, infrastructural shortfalls are putting lives at risk. While the Modi government has built over 106 million toilets in four years, more than the country had constructed since independence 68 years prior, practically none of them are connected to the sewer system.

This means the toilets need to be pumped and the waste transported, which many in India refuse or are unable to do. Nor does the country have enough treatment plants to handle all the waste generated, whether or not it makes it to the sewage system. In urban areas, India only has enough capacity to treat 37% of the sewage its cities generate.

Pressing challenges demand long-term solutions

What, then, can both urban and rural Indians facing an extended lockdown do to protect themselves from this deadly new virus, and how can the government quickly expand access to clean water?

For many Indians, the solution has long been bottled water. Sales of bottled water were soaring in India even before the outbreak, with the market growing 19% annually in 2017. $1.38 billion (Rs9,010 crore) worth of bottled water were sold in India in the five-year period between 2012-2017.

With many poorer Indians unable to afford the expense, volunteer groups have taken to distributing it among the supplies they offer to the homeless and to stranded migrant workers. While major beverage brands like Coca-Cola have shut down most of their operations in the country, they continue to produce bottled water as an “essential beverage.”

Ultimately, however, the best possible outcome would be for the government to seize on this moment of crisis to drive forward with more ambitious and comprehensive programs to rapidly expand access to clean water and sanitation to all Indian families, regardless of where they live. Nearly ten years ago, the World Bank found inadequate sanitation was costing India 6.4% of its GDP. As diseases like COVID-19, cholera, and dysentery show us, however, the human costs of unequal access cannot be counted in rupees.

This is all and well if we have access to uninterrupted supply of clean water.

Last week, taps in 1,292 areas in Kuala Lumpur, Petaling, Klang, Shah Alam, Kuala Selangor, Hulu Selangor, Gombak and Kuala Langat went dry after pollution in Sungai Selangor necessitated the shutting down of water treatment plants (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3 and Rantau Panjang) that supplied these areas. Water supply was fully restored only after three days!

With little or no access to water to wash their hands, how would people be able to protect themselves in this pandemic?

Government and water operators are committed to providing uninterrupted water supply to the general public as well as the industrial and agricultural sectors. Policies and programmes have been developed and initiated to meet these commitments.

However, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, increasing incidents of pollution in rivers and the impact of climate change have rendered most of these traditional approaches ineffective.

We need better policies to prevent pollution at river basins. Instead of investigating who the polluters are after the incidents, it would be more beneficial to study how they operate and stop them in their tracks.

In the case mentioned here, fish rearing activities near the river were suspected of causing the pollution. If the enforcement agencies are unable to monitor our water sources for whatever reason, the policymakers need to aggressively think about engaging resident associations and communities living in riparian areas to create awareness among them of the importance of preserving water quality in the rivers.

Many regulator bodies say they want local NGOs to play an active role in promoting such awareness. This can be easily done if funds are allocated to NGOs that would then reach out to the communities and work with them. We can use the “Kita jaga kita” slogan in this case. A hotline should be made available to those living near rivers to enable them to report any activities that may pollute the water.

Large cities including Los Angeles and Sao Paulo have begun to heed the warnings on climate change and water scarcity. In response, their public officials are initiating innovative solutions to conserve water, reuse wastewater and harvest rainwater.

Malaysia’s water consumption per capita has increased by four litres from 222 LCD (litres per capita per day) in 2017 to 226 LCD in 2018. We need to start consuming water wisely and stop wastage by using water-efficient products and adopting healthy consumption habits.

Malaysians should start to look at integrating rainwater harvesting and reuse of wastewater technologies into new housing and office building projects as potential ways to meet future water demands.

Both consumers and producers need to be aware that demand for water is getting higher while supply is becoming scarce. Enforcement agencies need to ensure that all activities along rivers are actively monitored. According to the World Wide Fund For Nature (2020), at the current water consumption rate, by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages. Let us not wait for an economic shut-down due to water scarcity or pollution.

Just as the world’s scientists are now trying to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, policymakers in charge of water security must study the ways and means to meet our water demands in the future.

Fixing this is must go beyond simple messages. When a government school girl reads through her value education syllabus, the colourful picture of a young girl washing her hands in a spotless basin might seem like something out of fantasy.

The chances are high that her home, like approximately 24 crore households in India, still does not have access to basic sanitation facilities that perhaps you and I take for granted – like a toilet or even a basin.

Time and again, valuable research has shown that there’s a direct link between sanitisation and a reduced risk of contagious diseases.

With this vision, Sikshana Foundation, a Bengaluru based not-for-profit organisation, started a WASH programme in over 3000 schools in Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana.

Sudeepta Banerjee, the Director of Partnerships at the NGO, tells The Better India (TBI), “Through the programme, we target government schools specifically because most of the students here come from socio-economically backward backgrounds.

In this age of the COVID-19 pandemic, such disadvantaged communities are more vulnerable to infections. But we started the WASH initiative in 2019. Even before Coronavirus, the children were at high risk of contracting diseases like malaria, due to poor hygiene practices.”

Washing hands-off contagious diseases: Bengaluru NGO’s clean way forward:

Healthy Newborn Network, an online community dedicated to addressing knowledge about newborn health, dedicated an article to the state of newborns in India. The community, active in over 70 countries, reported, “In contrast to children born in families with better financial resources, poorer children are more at risk for diseases… Creating conditions for better hygiene and reduced exposure to contamination makes children less susceptible to diseases and infections that may lead to death.”

The Sikshana Foundation has taken upon itself to create such conditions in thousands of schools in India. And their approach is not just about creating awareness but also taking up practical projects that can help children.

Priyanka Motipawar, a class teacher at the Zilla Parishad school, Yavatmal, tells TBI, “Kids tend to wash their hands only with water even after playing outdoors. Through Shikshana, we organised a skit to teach the children various methods and correct techniques of washing hands.

After COVID-19 took over, one of my students pointed out that the methods taught by Sikshana representatives were shown on TV as the right technique to wash hands. Clearly, the skit has had a lasting impact on the kids.”

She adds that for older students, the project also involved understanding ways of rainwater harvesting and purifying water using readily available resources like cotton and coal.

Safe water activities undertaken by Sikshana:

A 2013-14 report published by UNICEF showed that 58 per cent of India’s rural preschools did not have any toilets, and 56 per cent had no water on the premises. Sikshana is addressing this in their capacity by improving plumbing facilities in schools, so students get used to hygienic toilets.

They also install water purifiers in schools in need of them.

S Nirmala, the headmistress at Karnataka Public School, Bengaluru, says, “Sikshana Foundation has helped our school of 200 students by installing a Water Purifier here. We had to purchase purified water every day to provide the same for the students. Now our students can use safe drinking water provided here and can avoid carrying plastic bottles from home.”

Organising WASH awareness camps where doctors, nurses, health department officials, and forest officials had a tete-a-tete with students about how small steps like washing their hands after visiting the toilet or before eating go a long way in protecting their health and their community

“Additionally, the WASH concept is academically driven in students through designing projects under Sikshana’s Project Based Learning program. Students work on projects based on topics like Local Agricultural Needs, Budget Farming, Dehydration, Sanitation, and Water Shortage under the academic wing of WASH initiative,” the team tells TBI.

Sudeepta shares that this project has already seen a ripple effect among communities in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana.

“The world is talking about washing hands diligently now. Thankfully, our 90,000 kids have already gotten into the habit. They also pass on the message to their families, friends, and neighbours.

The post-COVID-19 world is going to be difficult and even more so for those with limited resources. We are hoping that such small things and initiatives will change the way people think- especially those belonging to vulnerable communities,” Sudeepta shares.

Other initiatives in schools by the Bengaluru NGO:

A 2018 survey shows that about 30 per cent of girls drop out of school by the time they reach class 9. The same report shows that only 43 per cent of students are enrolled in higher secondary schools.

One way to keep them in school is to ignite a passion for education among students themselves. Sikshana does so by giving positive reinforcements to the children.

Sudeepta explains, “We launched the Prerana programme in Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana. 48,000 schools are enrolled under this programme, and we have about 2.7 million students under the umbrella. Our primary aim is to make the children want to come to school. The next step is to make them want to study.”

The Prerana programme is fourfold, each with incentives for the students. Sikshana wants to keep the students in schools by creating a healthy competition between them.

Engagement incentives: Providing minor incentives for students to attend school regularly, do their homework and participate in extracurricular activities. The focus is not so much on winning or getting things right as it is on mere participation.

Taking ownership of the school premises and of helping peers grow: If a rank scoring student helps those scoring poorly, the administrators incentivise these initiatives by giving them star badges to wear on their uniforms.

If a rank scoring student helps those scoring poorly, the administrators incentivise these initiatives by giving them star badges to wear on their uniforms. Structured Practice : Not all students are keen on extra work, and when it comes to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, they don’t even have material like workbooks and stationery to keep practising their sums, answers, and diagrams. To ensure that the students are involved in studies even outside of school, Sikshana has partnered with the Karnataka government to aid them with study material.

Project-Based Learning: This includes practical projects like WASH, implemented across thousands of schools.

Things that we took for granted in school – like clean toilets, unlimited workbooks, proper guidance, etc. seem like luxuries to underprivileged students in government schools.

Sikshana targets these basic needs to create a lasting and essential impact on tens of thousands of students.

After all, these children are the future of India. And to secure the future, we must safeguard their present.

THE World Health Organisation (WHO) and Zambia National Public Health Institute have revealed that novel coronavirus is a transmitted from human to human and is airborne.

Coronavirus or COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

WHO recommends hand washing as one hygiene measure in preventing contraction and transmission of coronavirus.

Notably, water is a critical factor in promoting and maintaining hygiene. What this entails is that clean and safe water is a necessity in promoting good health.

Water by its nature cuts across different areas of human endeavour and survival, therefore the resource needs to be accessed by all people irrespective of their social status.

For Zambia and many countries as they battle coronavirus, clean and safe water should be easily accessed in halting the spread of the pandemic as confirmed cases and deaths continue rising every day and night across the world.

Water without doubt is now a prominent feature in promoting hygiene and a critical precautionary measure in fighting a pandemic.

This is seen by hundreds of hand washing buckets complemented with soap and hand sanitisers placed at entrances of public and private institutions, shops, restaurants, bus stations and taxi ranks and homes among other areas.

The emphasis on water as an essential ingredient in preventing the contraction and transmission of a contiguous disease is an unprecedented development in recent years.

The Ministry of Health is advising people in the country that to protect themselves from coronavirus, they are required to wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol based hand sanitisers.

Staying home, avoid crowded areas, keep social distance are also among other hygiene measures that are being recommended.

Access to clean and safe water for people to use should therefore be prioritised. For people in areas along the line of rail, they can easily access clean and safe water, afford to buy hand sanitisers and hand washing buckets to ensure hygiene.

In areas serviced by utility companies, people are able to access chlorinated water which is also tested to ascertain its quality.

The same cannot be said about some people living in unplanned settlements and rural areas. Because of challenges in accessing clean and safe water, maintaining hygiene is a challenge.

It is a well-known fact that access to clean and safe water in some unplanned settlements and rural areas is a problem.

Drinking water in rural areas does not go through the processes like the commodity provided by water utility companies.

Where hand pumps are not available, some people in unplanned settlements and rural areas access water from shallow wells and streams.

But shallow wells and streams can be prone to contamination. In some cases, people cover long distances to access water.

Even if they access water, it may not meet minimum hygiene standards.

There are some rural parts of Zambia which share borders with countries where coronavirus has also broken out.

They are at high risk and they need special attention in accessing clean and safe water and affordable sanitisers to ensure hygiene.

Water is a prerequisite in promoting hygiene. People in rural areas need to access the commodity to safeguard their health from this contiguous disease.

Coupled with the use of soap clean and safe water is also a cost-effective precautionary and sustainable intervention to ensure hygiene thereby preventing transmission of COVID-19.

Clean and safe water remains an important resource for humanity in promoting good health in an environment that has embraced hygiene and good sanitation.

The importance of water with regard to the prevention and transmission of coronavirus cannot therefore be overemphasised.

The organizations donated 350,000 bars of soap to Clean the World Foundation, which will be used to provide life-saving soap to individuals and families across the globe that are most vulnerable to hygiene-related illnesses.

Washing hands to stop the spread of COVID-19

Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming currently participate in Clean the World's Hospitality Recycling program. Through this program, room attendants collect the soap and bathroom amenities left behind by hotel guests and ship them to a Clean the World facility. The soap is ground, sanitized, melted and reprocessed into a brand-new bar of soap. The plastic bathroom bottles are sent to recycling or an energy-from-waste facility. Since 2018, Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming have diverted a combined 15,000 pounds of waste from landfills and distributed almost 33,000 bars of soap to those in need.

The COVID-19 crisis has greatly affected the hospitality industry, so the soap coming into Clean the World has decreased significantly. For this reason, Clean the World is relying on partners such as Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming to donate hygiene supplies to allow the organization to meet its soap production goals and distribute soap to COVID-19 relief organizations with the greatest need.

""Soap is not federally subsidized, so individuals and families, especially living in transitional housing or experiencing homelessness, rarely have access to soap and other hygiene supplies to keep them safe,"" says Sam Stephens, executive director of Clean the World Foundation. ""Handwashing with soap is the most effective way to fight COVID-19, so it is crucial that we get supplies out to relief organizations as quickly as possible. We are incredibly thankful to Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming for their donation, which allows us to meet demands quickly.""

We are incredibly grateful to be able to help this worthy cause especially right now,"" said Tracy Bradford, EVP of Administration for Hard Rock International and Seminole Gaming. ""Save the Planet is one of our founding core beliefs since 1971; we have a significant investment behind the meaning of this principle.""

Clean the World Foundation is distributing more than 1.5 million bars of soap across North America in response to COVID-19. Shipments have been sent to New York, Washington state, Louisiana, Missouri, Wisconsin, Nevada, Florida, and Mexico. The foundation plans to send an additional 3 million bars of soap in the next 90 days to the hardest-hit areas affected by COVID-19 around the world.

Don’t squander the gains afterwards,"The way in which Covid-19 has quarantined most social and economic activity, is being called the world’s largest scale experiment ever. When the quarantine protocols are lifted, data collected during this experiment should help build better societies and economies. One notable area in which new baselines of what is possible have emerged is the environment. Specifically, consider the lockdown report cards of India’s rivers. From Ganga to Cauvery parts of our major rivers have reported dramatic improvements in water quality, becoming ‘fit for drinking’ for the first time in decades.

No mining, no manufacturing, no commercial activity mean no industrial discharge. This makes for swift and thrilling facelifts in cities like Kanpur that have several polluting enterprises along the river. Of course the health of the nation needs such activities to resume, and grow even stronger than before. But that doesn’t mean we have to pollute our rivers again. Several countries have been implementing industrial wastewater treatment strictly for half a century now and India needs to join their ranks at the soonest. It needs to protect rivers from untreated domestic sewage as well. The 34% reduction in faecal coliform reported from a Haridwar ghat in April may be on account of the paralysis of tourism, suggesting how appallingly human excreta are normally allowed to pollute the holy Ganga.

Knowing what needs to be done is one thing, doing it is another. But the current pandemic is a clarion call for walking the talk. Even before this, India’s per person disease burden due to unsafe water and sanitation was 40 times higher than China and 12 times higher than Sri Lanka. Now the need to wash hands worsens the distress of not having enough clean water to do so. Don’t waste a crisis, they sensibly say. It has shown that reviving the hydrology of our rivers is not just necessary but doable.

Accessibility to clean water and sanitation is one of the key essentials amidst preventative measures to the global coronavirus pandemic.

National Capital District under Governor Powes Parkop including the other three electorate MPs, are keen to see all communities have access to clean water.

“What we have done like for instance markets, we have got the support of UN women and they will be helping us to set up especially sanitizers and some water as well. On our part we are scoping and trying to source water potable containers, fill them up and put them in strategic places in the settlements and villages as well.”

“We are also working with Eda Ranu as well. Moresby North-East MP has been working closely with Eda Ranu to reach out especially within his electorate given most of the settlements in that electorate,” said NCD Governor Powes Parkop.

Livelihood in some settlements within the nation’s capital has been affected mainly because of lack of proper and clean water supply. Reasons as to how these communities could not access clean water continues to be a major issue raised to NCD, Eda Ranu and also community leaders.

Governor Parkop admits that the issue of water supply to settlements like those in few sections of Morata suburb is always a growing concern. Member for Moresby North-East John Kaupa has been vocal towards addressing and implementing water projects for over two years now. He said some places like Manuti at 7-Mile including Morobe block is now in progress. He said Eda Ranu represented by operations manager also shows interest and supports the rollout of clean water in line with UN Women.

“They (Eda Ranu) were also in supportive with the UN Women to put water to 9-Mile cemetery. As soon as we start cleaning the place starting from today then we can talk with Eda Ranu to put (connect) water.”

Villagers from Makadru Village on Matuku Island are facing difficulty accessing clean drinking water after the devastation left behind by Tropical Cyclone Harold last week.

Villager Lutu Baivou said they had to resort to drinking young coconut water to quench their thirst after water supply was disrupted.

Mr Baivou said they had always depended on water stored in water tanks and the dam in the village. However, both were either destroyed or contaminated during the storm surge.

“Our water source was one of the major things that has been affected,” he said.

He also said the villagers were continuing to clean up their surroundings. On Wednesday relief supplies reached the island.

750 Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) kits were distributed to affected families in Kadavu and Southern Lau.

It was noted in a Ministry of Health and Medical Services brief to the National Disaster Management Office, that most toilet facilities were destroyed in the areas impacted by TC Harold.

The report added that awareness would take place in affected areas, including monitoring of skin diseases and distribution of soaps to affected communities for health and hygiene.

173,https://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2020/april/mtu-engineers-build-mobile-unit-to-clean-covid19-ppe.html,"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Michigan Tech News,MTU Engineers Build Mobile Unit to Clean COVID-19 PPE,"A refrigerated shipping container. Commercial-grade baking sheets. A modified oven. These are the key pieces of a prototype that uses heat to sanitize personal protection equipment (PPE).

The idea is simple: Disinfect PPE at temperatures hot enough to break up coronaviruses and do so in a big, moveable oven that can be quickly made with local, off-the-shelf parts that are easy to get and put together. The unit can clean 5,000 to 10,000 PPE units every two hours and can run continuously.

The design is streamlined: Use a thick-walled shipping container with the refrigeration unit swapped for a heating unit run on an electric generator, then line it with stainless steel racks and trays holding PPE, and heat it up to 140-170 degrees Fahrenheit.

The manufacturing is built on community: The parts are all on hand in commercial bakeries, restaurants, HVAC shops, shipping yards and universities — and could be quickly delivered to hospital and clinic loading docks.

An engineering team from Michigan Technological University tested the prototype in a campus parking lot alongside local company Aire Care. They call it the Mobile Thermal Utility (MTU) Sanitizer. The prototype is now heading downstate for further validation testing. The World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend heat-soaking to eliminate coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19. The CDC offers guidelines on temperature ranges and time for effectiveness.

The ""hot"" side of the MTU Sanitizer conducts and reflects heat to clean PPE; the “cold” side houses the electrical work to control the shipping container’s environment. Credit: Andrew Barnard

""If Houghton, Michigan, can find 25 racks, the right kind of shipping container, a heating unit and the experts to put a prototype all together in a couple days, then this could be deployed in any city in our nation,” said Dan Barnard, co-inventor of the design along with his wife Amy, a biomedical engineer by training. Dan’s cousin, Andrew Barnard, is a mechanical engineer at Michigan Tech and the director of the Great Lakes Research Center.

“Our goal is to make a massively available and scalable mobile sanitation unit for hospital PPE. We’ve seen DIY versions using food dehydrators and ovens; we’re making it bigger, but still transportable,” Andrew Barnard said. “PPE shortages are expected to last weeks to months and we want to do something about that now.""

The team includes Amy Barnard’s father, Brad Andreae, owner of an industrial finishing system and water and wastewater treatment and heat processing equipment manufacturer, Therma-Tron-X, Inc., who offered insight on how to make the heating unit work, and thermodynamics expert Jeffrey Allen, John F. and Joan M. Calder Professor in Mechanical Engineering at Michigan Tech.

PPE includes lab coats, gowns, N95 masks, face shields, sleeves and other protective garments that help prevent the spread of disease and keep health care workers and lab technicians safe. In addition to disinfecting large amounts of PPE, upwards of 60,000 PPE units or more each day, the MTU Sanitizer can clean large items like gurneys, beds, firefighter gear and other contaminated materials that are hard to clean using chemicals or smaller ovens.

The team received $32,800 in seed funding from the College of Engineering and is working with local Sen. Ed McBroom, Rep. Greg Markkanen and Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit. InvestUPhas been an indispensable partner in locating resources, helping build collaborations and connecting the Upper Peninsula resources with the affected regions downstate.

“Detroit and the UP have a lot in common when we talk about internet, health issues and affordable energy. We face many similar challenges from different perspectives,” said Hollier. “The MTU Sanitizer is a game changer. The UP and Michigan Tech brought their expertise to bear so that our health care workers, home care workers and first responders can do their work safely. These engineers saw a problem and got to work to fix it — and I’m grateful for that.”

Hollier, who is a first lieutenant in the Army Reserve, helped coordinate with the National Guard to get the MTU Sanitizer to southeast Michigan and is working with local hospitals to get it into service as quickly as possible.

“I think this is another opportunity for the National Guard to change its legacy in Detroit from 1967 and respond to people’s needs today and make a difference in this pandemic,” Hollier said, adding that he is working with Michigan Tech and the Attorney General’s Office to secure Emergency Use Authorization and move the prototype through FDA certification to make the design and licensing widely available to communities and health care facilities across the country.

""It's important that we get this sanitation unit approved and in operation as soon as possible,"" McBroom said. ""The creativity and thoughtfulness of this engineering team at Michigan Tech in the Upper Peninsula to create a unit that can travel to hard-hit areas like Detroit is fantastic and worth celebrating. I will always remember the people like this team and my colleague Sen. Hollier who have relentlessly put their ingenuity and hard work to the test to help win this battle and protect our workers on the frontlines.""

“As an alumni, this is an important collaboration between local groups, the state and the university. This is a way to bring everyone to the table and come up with solutions to combat this crisis,” said Markkanen. “It’s what the governor has been calling for and Michigan Tech is delivering.”

Andrew Barnard agrees that time is of the essence.

“We want to get this design out there as quickly as possible,” he said. “And we want to make sure it’s done right.”

The dishwasher is also effective at sanitizing your dishes, since the enzymes in dish detergent combined with scalding hot water are effective at getting rid of germs.

To stay safe, be sure to use hot water, sanitize your sponges, scrub well, and wash your hands after doing the dishes.

This article was medically reviewed by Graham Snyder, MD, MS, who is the medical director for the Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology branch at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

The guidelines are clear: To protect yourself from germs that can lead to viruses like influenza and COVID-19, you must wash your hands often and thoroughly for twenty seconds. But what about germs on your dishware?

We spoke to an infectious disease specialist to learn how dish soap can kill germs and the best way to sanitize dishes.

Dish soap does get rid of germs and viruses

Dish soap's main function is to get grease and food residue off of your dishes. However, dish soap is quite effective at washing germs and viruses off of your dishes too, says Joy Phillips, PhD, research assistant and professor of immunology at San Diego State University. Like hand soap, dish soap does not kill bacteria, but it lifts them off surfaces so that they can be washed away by water.

Phillips says that any soap will work well against washing away bacteria and inactivating viruses, and with the COVID-19 virus in particular, part of this has to do with the fact that it's an enveloped virus.



""This [COVID-19] virus has what they call a lipid coat, which basically means it's surrounded by a bubble of fat. So, soap disrupts the fat, breaks apart that liquid membrane, and that ends up destroying the virus,"" says Phillips.

Dish soap vs. antibacterial soap vs. the dishwasher

While you can buy antibacterial dish soap from brands like Palmolive and Dawn, they really aren't necessary. The FDA has said that there is no concrete evidence showing that antibacterial soap is more effective at removing germs than regular dish soap and water. It's more about the actual physical action of washing. Scrubbing with soap will create friction that lifts off microcrobes and grease, getting the job done.

If your household prefers to use the dishwasher, you can rest assured that the germs and viruses are being destroyed, Phillips says. Major components of many dish detergents are enzymes, which clean various particles off the dishes since they have the ability to break down starches and proteins. Most detergents also contain some sort of bleach, which is effective in killing bacteria and viruses.

However, what really destroys the virus in the dishwasher is the scalding hot water. Phillips says temperatures around 55º Celsius, or 130º Fahrenheit, can denature and destroy viruses. As long as you leave your dishwasher settings on hot, this will certainly do the trick.

How to sanitize your dishes effectively

Here are some tips for effectively cleaning your dishes and destroying germs and viruses:

Make sure to sanitize your sponges and replace them often – preferably weekly – to ensure you're not cleaning dishes with something that's already dirty.

If you're washing your dishes by hand, Phillips and the CDC recommend getting the water temperature as hot as you can. Wear rubber gloves to protect your skin. The hotter the water, the better.

Wash the dishes thoroughly, and don't rush, just as we shouldn't be rushing through general hand washing. Scrub well, be sure to get in all the nooks and crannies of utensils like forks, and clean the entire surface of all dishes and cookware.

If you're looking to be more eco-friendly with your dishwashing, Phillips says using a dishwasher rather than washing by hand is more water-efficient, especially if you are using a newer dishwasher model and running it when the machine is completely full.

The CDC suggests washing your hands after handling used dishes – especially if someone in your household is sick.

Follow these tips and you'll be on your way to cleaning your dishes effectively and keeping yourself and your household healthy.

These homemade masks should cover the nose and mouth and be worn whenever you're in a community setting, like going to the supermarket or pharmacy. The CDC has a helpful guide for DIY-ing a mask with materials you'd have at home. While surgical masks and N95 respirators should be saved for healthcare workers, the idea is that a simple cloth covering could prevent asymptomatic people from spreading the disease in situations where it's hard to maintain social distance. ""These are not intended to prevent you from getting the virus, they are intended to prevent other people from getting the virus from you, Dr. Howard Forman, professor of management, public health, economics and radiology at Yale University and Yale School of Medicine, tells CNBC Make It. ""If everybody takes that recommendation carefully, then you are clearly benefiting from the collective."" But securing a mask is just one piece of the puzzle: For masks to be effective, they must be worn properly. Here's the right way to use a cloth face covering during the COVID-19 pandemic, plus common pitfalls that could affect your safety:

Focus on the fit

Face coverings should be snug, but still comfortable, and cover your whole nose and mouth, and extend underneath your chin, according to the CDC. You should be able to breathe normally, but the sides of the mask should fit close to your face. In truth, wearing a mask can be a little bit annoying, Forman says. Glasses-wearers may struggle with masks steaming up lenses, and it can make breathing somewhat uncomfortable or stuffy. (Kids under age 2 and people who have trouble breathing shouldn't wear cloth face coverings, per the CDC.) If you're feeling restricted or uncomfortable wearing a scarf over your face, you may want to consider making a mask. Here's how the CDC suggests making a quick face covering using a scarf, bandana or towel and two rubber bands or hair elastics.

But you should ""find a way to make it is as comfortable as possible,"" Forman says. ""If you choose not to wear it because it's uncomfortable, you're doing more harm,"" he says.

Put it on carefully

Whether you're using a homemade mask, scarf, bandana or surgical mask, ""one of the most important steps before putting on or after taking off a face covering is to use appropriate hand hygiene, either by using hand sanitizer or washing your hands with soap and water,"" Walley says. The World Health Organization suggests that people first clean their hands before putting a mask on and check that there are no holes or tears in the fabric. When putting on your face covering, use the ties to place it on your face and cover your face and mouth snugly, making sure you can breathe easily, Walley adds. If your mask has a nose bridge, hold it in place, then loop the ear bands over your ears. A bandana, scarf or cloth covering should be applied with the same care. And don't touch the outside of the mask or cloth which could be contaminated.

Don't touch the mask while wearing it

You shouldn't be taking off, adjusting or moving your mask during your outing, says Forman. ""It is important to remember the outside of the mask is considered contaminated,"" Dr. Susan Walley, professor at the University of Alabama School of Medicine, practicing at Children's of Alabama, tells CNBC Make It. A recent laboratory study found that the virus that causes COVID-19 could survive on a face mask for up to seven days. That means, if you must take off your mask for a quick breather, or an itch, it's important to practice good hand hygiene after touching the face covering.

Take it off carefully too

There's some technique involved taking off a mask, especially if you're a healthcare worker or taking care of someone who has COVID-19. The key is to avoid accidentally contaminating your hands or touching your face. Be extra careful not to touch the front of your mask and your eyes, nose and mouth when removing your face covering, and wash your hands after handling your mask, according to the CDC. Remember: Wearing a mask or cloth face covering doesn't make you invincible. ""There's no question you could be getting viral particles on the outside of it,"" Forman says. The CDC recommends storing personal protective equipment in a paper bag, so you should do the same with your cloth face covering, Walley says.

Wash your mask often

Currently, there are no strict guidelines about washing and sanitizing cloth face coverings and masks. According to the CDC, machine-washing your mask is enough to disinfect your cloth face covering. You should wash it regularly, or after each time you wear it. It's okay to re-wear a cloth face covering so long as it's not soiled, Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, told NBC's ""TODAY"" on Monday. Similarly, if you don't have immediate access to laundry, it's reasonable to wait until the face covering is visibly soiled to wash it, Walley says. Any clothing or accessories that you wear have the potential to be contaminated, but right now experts don't believe that the mechanism of transmission is so extreme that you need to be washing or changing your clothes multiple times a day, he says. The same is true for cloth masks and face coverings. ""If someone wanted to be aggressive and keep their clothes is as clean as they could be, I think they would want to do the same thing with a mask,"" Forman says. For example, Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious diseases expert at Columbia University, told NPR you should wash your mask as often as you do your underwear. (To that end, you may want to have multiple masks so you can still stay protected while it's in the wash.)

The mission aims to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to encourage hygienic sanitation practice. The scheme is also known as the “Clean India Mission”. The project was launched as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. It is a nation-wide campaign aiming to clean up the streets, roads, cities and rural areas. The mission aims to achieve an “open-defecation free” (ODF) India by 2nd October 2019.

It consists of two sub-missions – Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) which will be implemented in rural areas, and the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), which will be implemented in urban areas. The aim of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) is to achieve a clean and Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October 2019.

Information about Swachh Bharat can be accessed from the link, Official site.

Ramesh Jigajinagi (Minister of State) is the Minister of Drinking, Water and Sanitation. But from May 2019, the ministry has been merged with the Ministry of Jal Shakti.

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs which is overlooking the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Urban) currently works under the charge of Hardeep Singh Puri. He took the charge from Venkaiah Naidu who forfeited the post of Union Minister on his election to the post of Vice-president.

Background

India began its journey of cleanliness with the efforts of Mahatma Gandhi. The Father of our nation initiated a massive awareness program on hygiene and sanitation which inspired many more leaders to follow his footsteps. In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nation-wide campaign in the form of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to achieve the dream of Clean India as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 10th birth anniversary.

Mission Logo of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

The mission’s logo was selected through a competition that saw the participation of thousands of participants. Out of it, Shri Anant Khasbardar of Kolhapur from Maharashtra won the first prize. He designed the simple yet most meaningful logo for the campaign. His logo consists of spectacles of Mahatma Gandhi with ‘Swachh Bharat’ written on the two glasses with National Tricolour in the background. The logo is a tribute to Gandhiji’s ideals and the fact that the whole nation is working towards his cause.

The tagline competition was won by Ms.Bhagyasri Sheth of Rajkot from Gujarat who gave the beautiful wordings of “Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur”.

Components of Clean India Mission

1. Swachch Bharat Abhiyan- Gramin

It focuses on improving the ambit of rural sanitation coverage and eliminating the practice of open defecation. The scheme also focuses on improving the management of solid and liquid wastes.

2. Swachch Bharat Abhiyan- Urban

The scheme aims to ensure three-fold objectives within its scope. First of all, it envisages reducing the number of households engaging in the practice of open defecation. The second objective is to convert pit latrines into sanitary latrines. The third objective of the Clean India Mission is to halt the construction of any new unsanitary toilets.

Secretary of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is the Mission Coordinator for SBM.

Evolution of Swachhata Abhiyan

Earlier, a sanitation program was launched in 1954. This was the first such program of the nation. It was followed by the launch of the Central Rural Sanitation Programme in 1986. Then the strategic revamp of the scheme led to the development of the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in 1999, which transformed later into the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan in 2012.

Finally, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan was restructured into the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by Cabinet approval on 24 September 2014.

Objectives of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

To promote cleanliness and hygiene in a wholistic manner.

To reduce the incidence of open defecation

To bring improvement in the quality of life in rural areas

To encourage the concept of sustainable sanitation practices

To create awareness about health and hygiene.

To help India reach to India Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6).

To encourage cost-effective sanitation efforts.

To develop community managed sanitation systems

To focusing on scientific Solid & Liquid Waste Management systems.

To create a positive impact on gender and promote social inclusion

Funding pattern of PM Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

The scheme is covered by multi-sectoral funding pattern which includes-

Budgetary support

Funding and technical support from the World Bank and international institutions

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives

Swachh Bharat Kosh(SBK)

An incentive of Rs. 12,000 is provided to the eligible beneficiaries in rural areas for the construction of Individual Household Latrines. It also covers the provision of water storage.

The funding for constructing toilets will also be met by 3 primary sources – Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Rural Development, and the States. The funding ratio will be 75:25 between center and State for the normal states while for the North Eastern state, it will be 90:10.

SBM Approach

The program uses a multi-dimensional approach to achieve the goals of sanitation and hygiene.

Community participation : People’s participation is kept as the main focus of the initiative.

All-round Engagement: Inculcating every part of the resource base from Swachh Bharat Kosh to the organization’s Corporate Social Responsibility is a leading driver behind the massive reach of the program.

Collective effort

Even though the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (now merged in Ministry of Jal Shakti) is the nodal agency of the scheme, but the program also entails the active participation of other stakeholders such as local NGOs, civil societies, corporates, faith organizations, media, and others.

Prime Minister Modi had given a call for making the SBM program a community-driven program that focuses on involving all the stakeholders of society.

Under the scheme, volunteers, known as Swachhagrahis, or “Ambassadors of cleanliness“, have been tasked to encourage indoor plumbing. Non-governmental organizations such as The Ugly Indian, Waste Warriors are also part of this campaign. Community approaches to sanitation facilities are also being adopted at the village level.

Recognition

UNICEF report titled ‘The Financial and Economic Impact of SBM in India’ (2017)’ presented the fact that a household in an Open defecation free village in rural India saves Rs. 50,000 every year.

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also released a study that displays a significant improvement in diarrhea prevalence and stunting among children in ODF villages due to the convergence of activities under Clean India mission.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ‘s Global Goalkeepers award for his Swachh Bharat Abhiyan .

Performance monitoring

SBM app

To provide a 360-degree approach to the performance evaluation process of this scheme, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Mobile app was developed by the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation in technical collaboration with NIC. An individual can upload photographs of beneficiaries receiving toilet facilities in their homes.

The amazing feature of this scheme is that it automatically captures the latitude and longitude of the location as well as the date when photographed. The data then gets uploaded on the central server of the Mission located at the National Data Centre. This saves the hassle of manual uploading of data to the server.

Swachch Survekshan Survey

Swachh Survekshan is an annual survey of cleanliness and sanitation in cities and towns conducted across India. The Survekshan was launched under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The survey was carried out by the Quality Council of India. The first survey was undertaken in 2016 and covered 73 cities. But the latest Swachh Survekshan 2019 covered 4,237 cities in a record time of 28 days.

Indore has been bagging the first place for 3 years. The top 20 cities in the 2019 survey are- Indore, Mysuru, Ahmedabad, Navi Mumbai, Tirupati, Rajkot, Vijayawada, Ghaziabad, Surat, Mul, Ambikapur, Ujjain, NDMC, Karhad, Lonavala, Vita, Dewas, Bhilai, Shahganj, and Panhala.

The government has also come out with ODF+ and ODF++ status to declare a location’s sanitation standard. To know more about the detailed explanation, access the official PDF here.

Geo-tagged Toilets

The use of technology in the scheme has also been reported to the geo-tagging of toilets. This ensures that the scheme is functional always-on real-time information.

Progress Report of Clean India Mission

National sanitation coverage rose to 65% in 2017 as compared to the low-figure of 38.7% in 2014. In August 2018, this figure touched the soaring 90%.

By 25 September 2019, 35 states/Union Territories with 699 districts and 5.99 lakh villages were declared Open Defecation Free (ODF).

Conclusion

India’s drive towards cleanliness has been one of the largest such campaigns in the world that not only focuses on promoting sanitation but also engaging citizens as active participants.

The healthy target of eliminating open defecation has been a very targeted approach under this scheme. The focus of the program has been emphasized more on the outcomes rather than the quantifiable outcomes.

And finally, with the success of this scheme, it has been made clear that the scheme has been truly a game-changer in the arena of sanitation and hygiene.","It consists of two sub-missions – Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) which will be implemented in rural areas, and the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), which will be implemented in urban areas.

Now more than ever we need to ensure that we create more robust cleaning programmes to prevent the spread of the highly infectious COVID-19 in our food establishments and homes. However, we must note that if these functions are carried out improperly, food can be further contaminated.

The contact surfaces for all food must be cleaned and sanitised. This includes utensils, knives, tables, cutting boards, conveyor belts, bins, aprons, floors, walls and many others, including our hands! But before going on a cleaning frenzy we need to ensure we select the correct chemicals or else we pose the risk of harming ourselves and consumers.

Just a reminder that cleaning and sanitising are two different processes and achieve different outcomes. Cleaning is a process to remove visible dirt, organic matter, chemical residue from surfaces or objects. Cleaning doesn't eliminate microorganisms but lowers their numbers. Sanitising is the process by which clean surfaces or objects undergo a treatment that kills microorganisms or reduces them to a safe level. Both cleaning and sanitation go hand in hand; sanitising won't usually work effectively without first going thorough cleaning. Additionally effective cleaning and sanitising begin with selecting the right product.

Before selecting your cleaning and sanitation products you need to consider the following:

• Ensure products are approved for the intended use in your industry. This is important as products used should remove dirt and kill microorganisms but not contaminate food. With the current high demand for cleaning agents you may be tempted to just buy anything that is available; however, you should ask your supplier for a safety data sheet (SDS) and verify that your cleaning products are food safe.

• Factors such as product attributes (eg odour and colour), storage and mixing requirements for water pH, water hardness and temperature, presence of organic matter should be considered when choosing the right product as these factors can affect how the agents respond to your equipment and product and even to yourself and employees.

• Not all sanitisers are equal. You need to ensure that the sanitiser you use is suitable for the job. For example, inexpensive chlorine, while it will kill most microorganisms and is effective at low temperatures, may corrode metal and weaken rubber. It is also unstable at high temperatures and not effective with organic matter. On the other hand, quaternary ammonium compounds have non-corrosive residual activity if not rinsed and are less affected by organic materials. However, it is ineffective for certain microorganisms and inactivated by most detergents and hard water. Another agent is iodine, which may kill most microorganisms and is less affected by organic materials but may stain plastic and porous materials and is inactivated by temperatures above 49 ºC.

• Different surface materials have different reactions to different cleaners and sanitisers; some products such as caustic alkaline or acidic cleaners may be effective in removing dirt and food residue but can also be corrosive to softer metals such as aluminum or lower grades of steel.

• It is very important to practise due diligence in selecting products that are safe for use on food surfaces or equipment. We don't want to choose products that cause the surface, or equipment that is being cleaned and sanitised, to deteriorate, as this will make them more difficult to keep them clean. Additionally, we want to reduce sources of cross-contamination, not add to them. Choose cleaning and sanitation agents that are effective and get the job done with minimal potential for this.","Cleaning and sanitation have always been critical aspects of food safety, as both help to prevent cross-contamination and ensure food is safe.

In order to save surgical masks and medical masks for health care workers, the CDC said the general public should use cloth face coverings made out of household items.

“That’s the most important thing to keep in mind — that the purpose of the mask is not to protect the wearer,” Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease specialist at the Stanford University Medical Center, told Digital Trends. “It’s to protect others, in case [the wearer is] asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic but shedding the virus.” The masks are useful for places like the drugstore, where it may be difficult to stay six feet away from someone else.

Coughing, exhaling, and talking all release droplets into the air that can infect others. In other words, the mask isn’t protecting you from the world; it’s protecting the world from you. That’s why it’s important to wear one, even if you don’t have any symptoms. You can still spread the disease before you start coughing or if you’re infected but never get very sick. Winslow also wants to remind people that masks aren’t a substitute for more effective measures, like staying six feet away from others. “Shelter in place and social distancing are, in the big scheme of things, much, much more important than the wearing masks are, in my opinion,” he said.

How often should you clean your mask?

You’ll want to make your mask out of something that will hold up to a lot of washing. There are tutorials for making masks out of T-shirts, bandannas, and bed sheets. Some materials, like flannel and heavyweight cotton, are likely better at stopping the droplets than others. The mask is going to be covered in everything that comes out of your mouth.

While Winslow said there’s a small chance you could get some contamination on the outside of the mask when you’re outdoors, there are other reasons for regularly cleaning it. “It probably won’t smell too good by the end of the day,” he said. “You’re probably going to wash it every day.”

Soap up

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a list of antimicrobial products that have been shown to be effective at killing viruses similar to COVID-19. There are a couple options listed for presoaking laundry, but the majority are for hard, nonporous surfaces and meant to be used in hospitals, schools, and other places that typically use industrial cleaners.

Dr. Frankie Wood-Black, division chair of engineering, physical science, and process technology at Northern Oklahoma College, says it’s likely the detergents you have on hand will suffice for cleaning masks. “If washing my hands with warm, soapy water is going to be fine for my hands, something similar to that is going to work for my mask,” she said.

She’s concerned that people who are new to wearing masks will go through an adjustment period — literally. “When people are wearing a mask, they have to be even more conscious of not touching their face,” she said. It’s also important to carefully remove the mask when you get home, so you don’t contaminate your hands.

What temperature will kill the coronavirus?

“I always like to make sure that consumers understand the difference between cleaning and sanitizing,” said Mindy Costello in an email to Digital Trends. She’s a product certification specialist and registered environmental health sanitarian at the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), which inspects and certifies appliances and other products. “Cleaning is removing stains or soil from a surface or fabric. When sanitizing, you’re actually destroying microorganisms like bacteria, mold, and yeast,” she said. “If you want to reduce your risk of getting sick, sanitizing is the way to go.”

There aren’t published studies on how COVID-19 stands up to various temperatures, but the World Health Organization (WHO) found that 132.8 degrees Fahrenheit (56 degrees Celsius) is hot enough to kill the coronavirus that causes SARS. Other tests found higher temperatures, up to 149º F (65º C), are more effective.

Because those temperatures are scalding for human skin, using either warm or cold water and soap for at least 20 seconds is the CDC’s guideline for hand-washing. Since fabric can withstand higher temperatures, the CDC recommends washing clothing in the “warmest appropriate water setting.”

Why do washing machines work?

Some washing machines have allergen and sanitization settings. To qualify for an NSF certification for sanitization, washers must reduce 99.9% of microorganisms during the sanitization cycle. “The NSF International protocol does not specify a temperature for the washing machine’s sanitizing cycle to achieve,” said Costello. For the allergen certification, the washer has to remove at least 95% of house dust mite allergens and feline dander, and the water must reach 131º F (55º C). Neither certification includes testing on the efficacy of killing coronaviruses. “NSF International recommends following the CDC’s guidance for laundry,” said Costello. “In some cases, the sanitizing cycle on your washing machine may be the hottest setting.”

Even if your washer doesn’t have special sanitization settings, the mechanical action of the washer — tossing the clothes about and having them rub against each other — and the detergent will still kill the virus. It has a lipid layer that soap helps break down. (The American Chemical Society has a great video explaining more in-depth about why soap is great at destroying the COVID-19 virus.) “This is an RNA virus, so it’s not particularly hardy,” said Winslow. He agrees any warm cycle will probably do the trick. “That just dissolves the detergent more efficiently, if nothing else,” he said.

Can you use your dishwasher to clean your mask?

Shoes, hats, toys — there’s no limit to the weird stuff people put in their dishwashers to clean. Like washing machines, some newer models have sanitization settings. The NSF also certifies this setting. “During testing, three common organisms – staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa – are added to the loads of dishes,” said Costello. “The level of bacteria is tested afterward. The water in dishwashers that earn the NSF International mark for sanitization must reach 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.56º C) during the final rinse and stay at or above that temperature long enough to achieve the 99.999 % reduction.”

A 2000 study from the Institute of Environmental Medicine and Hospital Epidemiology found that 160º F (71º C) temperatures were adequate for disinfecting medical equipment, but not every dishwasher will get this hot. The water is still mixing with soap, which will help kill the virus, though it’s not being subjected to the same mechanical action as a washer produces. There’s also the potential that the mask could become wrapped around some of the dishwasher’s rotating parts and break the machine.

Can you boil your face mask?

For those living in homes with the bare minimum of appliances, it might be counterintuitive to risk a trip to the laundromat to wash a face mask. Winslow thinks most people will be fine just doing what they’d do if they were on a trip and forgot extra underwear: Fill the sink with hot, soapy water and hand wash. Wood-Black compares it to washing any item of clothing where there’s concern about a more familiar bacteria or virus, like salmonella or norovirus. “The same precautions are going to apply,” she said.

But if you’re symptomatic and living with others, you might want to be a little more rigorous. In that case, boiling your mask could be an option. Lots of people do this with smelly dish towels. Use a large pot and enough water to make sure it doesn’t all evaporate away. Leave the mask in the water for several minutes and swirl it around occasionally with tongs.

Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration recently proposed a fairly novel solution to reusing surgical masks. It suggests putting one in a rice cooker, with no water, and leaving it on for three minutes. Wood-Black doesn’t think that step is necessary and is potentially dangerous. “I would not recommend putting them into a dishwasher, into a microwave, into a rice cooker, or anything like that,” she said. “Because you are more likely to create a potential hazard.” If you made a mask out of a bandanna that has a metallic thread, for example, and put it in your microwave, it could damage the appliance or start a fire.

When should I get a new mask?

Some of these cleaning methods are harder on fabrics than others. Hotter water breaks down fibers more quickly, for example. A mesh laundry bag may help protect it from some of the twisting and turning that can happen as the washer rotates. If you’re noticing holes in your mask, it’s time to replace it.

In case of containment zones in slums, the touch points are common toilets, stair handles or railings, parapets, sitting areas such as concrete platforms outside slum structures and door handles.

Moreover, indoor areas of the patient’s home have to be sanitised rigorously before the 14-day isolation period and once the isolation is complete. According to the data released on Tuesday, there are 241 containment zones across all 24 municipal wards in the city. “Transmission is happening through these touch points and people are not aware of it. As on today, the focus is on cutting off the chain of transmission,” said Rajan Naringrekar, insecticide officer, BMC. “For this, not coming out of the house and ensuring touch points are sanitised daily is the key.”

Twenty-four pest control officers are working across all wards under the administrative control of ward officers. The insecticide department is carrying out daily sanitisation of all containment zones. They are using 200ml of sodium hypochlorite for 10 litres of water as a solution to spray the disinfectant using motorised mist spraying pumps. “Residents of these containment zones and apartments need not bother with the sodium hypochlorite solution, and can regularly sanitise these touch points using basic disinfectants or bleaching powder solutions easily available in markets. They need to wear gloves. Bleaching powder solution made in a bowl is best for cleaning parapets and sitting areas. If everybody follows this twice daily, the chances of transmission are reduced completely,” said Naringrekar.

Citizens on essential duty need to ensure the safety of their household and family members, said Naringrekar adding, they need to follow a daily process. “On reaching home, they need to first sanitise the cell phone, then their hands before entering the house. They need to immediately go to the wash basin. The foam on one’s hand (while using soap and water) needs to be used to wash the knob of the tap, which is an important touch point for households. Following this, a handkerchief dipped in disinfectant has to be used to wipe ones bag, belt, wallet, spectacles etc. followed by a shower. All clothes need to be dumped in a bucket filled with warm water and washed thereafter,” said Naringrekar.

Meanwhile, societies opting for private pest control operations were worried about the solution being used by these agencies. “While the BMC operations are for free, private pest control charges are almost ₹2,000 per day. In one of the canisters during sanitisation in our society, it was 100% water and no sodium hypochlorite solution at all,” said Sudhakar Trivedi, a Mulund resident.

“Pest control private bodies that are violating the insecticide department’s guidelines can lose their licence if they do not follow the exact steps identified for disinfection. If such violations are brought to our notice, we will immediately write to the state government,” said Naringrekar.","In case of containment zones in slums, the touch points are common toilets, stair handles or railings, parapets, sitting areas such as concrete platforms outside slum structures and door handles.

Key Highlights Coronavirus can spread by coming in direct contact with infected person or by indirectly exposing oneself to infected envrionment To prevent yourself, follow the 20-second hand wash rule and stay home to stay safe Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces at home to prevent indirect spread

The spread of Coronavirus has increased the demand for disinfectants like soaps, sanitisers, bathroom cleaners, and much more. The demand for face masks and gloves also increased. This is because one is likely to get infected by the virus either by coming in direct contact with the infected person or by indirectly exposing oneself to the surfaces where infected droplets exist. So even if you are staying at home and reducing your contact with the world, there are chances that your surroundings become carriers of the virus.

It is thus essential to disinfect every possible item in our homes or office spaces almost every day. We may not be able to contribute to weeding out the problem at a large scale but we can sure prevent ourselves and our loved ones from catching it. There are so many surfaces and items that we ignore, not intentionally but we just happen to ignore them as we focus more on sanitising and washing our hands. But just following the 20-second hand wash rule and staying home is not enough; we need to do more!

Every day, despite the lockdown, there is one person who leaves the house to get essential grocery items or some other essential activity. Anything or anyone that goes outside the house or comes inside comes in contact with other people, so there is a possibility of exposure to the virus. As we know Coronavirus is capable of living on surfaces like clothes or plastic for a considerable amount of time, it becomes extremely important to clean and disinfect such surfaces. Here are a few things that we think need urgent cleaning from your end.

1. Doorknobs and doormats

These are one of the first things that a person is likely to touch while coming inside the house. Make it a point that you clean them and disinfect them almost every day. Clean the surface with soapy water and avoid touching them too often. Also, make sure you disinfect them.

2. Sofa sets, chairs, bed covers and sheets

If someone comes from outside and lies down on any of these surfaces, make it a point that you both clean and disinfect it. Another thing that you can do is lay a sheet on your sofa sets and your chairs every time someone from outside comes and sits. This way you can later wash the sheet and you don’t have to undertake the tedious task of cleaning an entire sofa or chair.

3. Bathroom switches and toilet seats

Always clean the toilet seat after you are done using, especially when you have come from outside. This is not something that needs caution only now, but something that should be a routine practice.

4. Mobile phones and other screens

Your mobile phones and other screens are exposed to germs the most. This is because you literally carry them everywhere! Make sure you clean these every time you clean your hands. Don’t go back to touching your infected and unclean mobile phone after cleaning your hand; it brings your back to square one. And while you are cleaning your screens, clean their accessories like chargers, earphones, etc. too. Use gadget sanitiser or wipes to disinfect them.

5. Remote controls: Your TV remote might contain germs. Make sure you wipe them with wipes or gadget sanitiser from time to time.

6. Glasses: Also, clean the glasses and make sure you disinfect them well at your home. Wipe it with soap water and scrub them well.

7. Bathroom taps and faucets: Make it a practice to disinfect them after every use. Make sure you wash them with soapy water and sanitise them after using them.

8. Light switches: You may not realise it but the light switch at your home is one of the dirtiest spots at your home. Rub the switch with a disinfectant wipe to stay safe.","This is because one is likely to get infected by the virus either by coming in direct contact with the infected person or by indirectly exposing oneself to the surfaces where infected droplets exist.

She has a PhD in marine biology and studies how viruses interact with the world.

When the coronavirus outbreak started, she created a simple poster informing people how to disinfect their homes.

""Because when you want to disinfect or clean your house, you don't need a 40-page document,"" the scientist explained. ""You just need a few basic guidance points.""

The poster touts three simple agents to to kill the virus. ""Those agents are bleach, hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol at a high enough concentration,"" Dr. Noble said.

To keep the virus at bay, people should disinfect any surface they touch after coming home from running errands. ""So the way I look at the disinfectant,"" Noble said, ""you are strongly, strongly, reducing the amount of virus that could be on that surface.""

As the virus outbreak became a reality in March, Noble found common disinfecting information hard for people to find.

""They might have had to go on the CDC website. I went through one day and I counted the number of steps that it took me to get to their disinfecting practices for the home. There were about five or six or seven clicks, so to speak, that we're required to get to that information.""

Beyond disinfecting surfaces, Noble also wants people to know they should disinfect their cloth masks as well. ""Boiling it and putting it in the laundry are two very effective ways,"" she said. Laundry should be done on hot.

If boiling the mask, the water should be at least 140 degrees, and let it boil for 8-10 minutes.

Lightweight surgical style masks can not be cleaned. They simply won't hold up. And cloth mask will breakdown over time. Re-using the same mask should only be a short-term solution.

Noble believes this will not only decrease the risk of catching the virus, but by staying healthy, also reduce the strain on the medical community.

""And we know that there's an incredible, not only physical, but also emotional and spiritual toll that is being enacted on our emergency providers and so forth,"" she said. ""And this is really, really important. These are people that do a lot of good things for us, but they're not an infinite resource. Their capacity can only manage for so long.""","— Rachel Noble is a UNC professor at the Institute of Marine Sciences in Morehead City.

The City of Clinton Public Works and Utilities Department is holding its Spring Clean Up Week on April 13-17.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the definition of a normal life for residents in the city. Governor Roy Cooper has enacted a stay-at-home order for all residents in North Carolina. Those in Clinton can turn being stuck at home into an opportunity for some spring cleaning.

Public Works Director Chris Medlin addressed the Clinton City Council during the regular monthly meeting in regards to the annual event.

“We’re going to continue with our Spring Clean Up for the year,” Medlin noted. “We ask for a little patience. It may take us a little longer than normal. We’re expecting this one to shatter anything we’ve done in the past with so many people at home.”

Medlin and Tom Hart, City Manager, have agreed that it is important to proceed on with the event and not postpone or cancel it. Medlin and Hart hope that continuing on with the event will give the community, citizens and employees alike, some type of normalcy during this chaotic time.

“All the standards as in years past are in effect,” Medlin explained. “When you get it to the road, we’ll take it.”

Citizens have the opportunity to get rid of larger or non-routine items at no cost. During cleanup weeks, regular rules are suspended and additional items, such as furniture, appliances, four tires per household and piles of yard debris, including shrubs and tree limbs cut to a certain length, are collected.

Items that cannot be collected include oil-based paints, batteries, herbicides and pesticides, auto parts, gasoline and other substances that pose safety hazards for city crews and are unable to be processed at the landfill.

Hart noted that the city is focusing on taking steps to ensure that the city can provide essential services such as water, public safety, garbage collection and a mired of other services.

“I want to thank the staff for continuing on as business as usual as best we possibly can,” Mayor Lew Starling expressed. “We’re in a difficult spot and we want to be mindful of this situation but we also have to provide fire protection, we also have to provide police protection, we have to provide safe water and trash pick-up and sanitation.”

Under the current conditions, Starling wanted to thank every staff member for their hard work and dedication to provide these services.

The clean-up event is held twice a year to make the town look beauteous.

According to Stacey Ray, senior administrative specialist for the City’s Public Works and Utilities Department, last year the town collected over 36 tons of trash. The department collected 43 tons of trash the year before.

Ray noted that the department collected 37 mattresses and box spring sets; 25 televisions; 14 couches; 108 tires; and 40 large piles of trash during last year’s Spring Clean Up.

City officials ask that all items for disposal be placed alongside the road by 7 a.m. on the day of regular trash collection.

Don't worry, we are here to help with these simple tips!

The ongoing Covid-19 lockdown must have put most of you in boredom and many of you must be wondering what to do during this long, totally unexpected period. As an automotive publication that always stands with its readers (even during this state of boredom), we at Express Drives already suggested some interesting auto shows and movies to watch a few days back. Now, as many people also love to dedicate a few hours to their beloved two or four-wheeled possession during free time, a couple of our previous stories put emphasis on how to maintain your vehicle during this lockdown period. Now, as cleaning is one of the most important ways to maintain a vehicle, today’s story is all about just that. So read along and find out how you can properly clean your two-wheeler, especially in this quarantine period with the limited resources you have.

Park your two-wheeler on main stand

The first step before cleaning your two-wheeler is to park it on the center stand. One prime reason behind this is by doing so, your two-wheeler is parked in a balanced position and hence, it would be convenient and quite easier for you to reach all parts while cleaning it up. Moreover, putting the two-wheeler on a side stand instead of the center one can put it at a slight risk of a fall, something that you will obviously not want during the cleaning process.

Rinse with cold water

First, rinse your bike or scooter with cold water. Doing this will first allow the dirt to loosen up and rinse away on its own and hence, the cleaning process will be easier afterward. If you are using a hose, make sure that the water pressure is right so that it doesn’t damage the sensitive areas. Also, start the process only after making sure that your vehicle has cooled down.

Use the right soap/detergent/shampoo

Using the right soap, detergent or shampoo is beneficial for your two-wheeler as having the appropriate one will be gentle on its body. If you have one, always prefer it over other detergents as it will maintain the shine and luster of your vehicle. If not, then you can go with the regular one as well, however, use it in a smaller quantity as excessive use can damage the paintwork.

Use a sponge and cloth

Take a bucket of water and add detergent in it. After this, dip the sponge and use it to clean the painted surfaces. Wipe the sponge gently over the said surfaces which will clean out dust. After this, use a cloth to clean off the non-painted surfaces and areas where there is some dirt. Keep dipping it in water and wring it multiple times during the cleaning process so that dirt collected on the cloth from one part doesn’t travel to another one. Also, be careful while cleaning areas around the instrument console, switches and fuse box due to the electrical. Moreover, use a toothbrush to clean the tricky and tight areas.

Rinse again!

After you are done cleaning with sponge and cloth, rinse the bike with water using bucket water or hose, whichever is available. Make sure to not leave any area so that the detergent is washed off properly from all places. Also, it has to be kept in mind that you use only cold water as using hot water can damage the surfaces, especially the paint.

Use a dry cloth for drying it up!

After you are done with rinsing, use a dry cloth (microfiber, preferably) to wipe off the remaining water and avoid any stains once the said areas dry up. Make sure that you do all this while your bike is parked in shade as direct sunlight can create water spots as well.

Apply wax and lubricants for the final touch!

After you are done washing your beloved two-wheeler, now is the time for post-wash care. Apply wax on your bike or scooter at appropriate places and use a dry cloth again to rub it properly against the surface in order to get an uncompromised glow. Also, don’t forget to lube the chain and areas like clutch/brake lever pivot points, suspension, folding pegs, fasteners, and keyhole.

She thanked the various security agencies--Army, Prisons, Fire Service and Navy who have deployed personnel to help in the three-day exercise.

For his part, the Mayor of Accra, Mohammed Adjei Sowah, said the clean-up exercise will involve desilting of gutters, collection of refuse and disposing them of, and emptying all litter bins on the streets of Accra.

However, he averred that the city authority will enforce its sanitation bye-laws to ensure that Accra is always clean.

Buzz60

NEW ORLEANS – Gretchen Romero said there's no conceivable way for her to protect herself from contracting coronavirus.

Romero, 27, a Cuban migrant who's been held in custody for eight months since requesting asylum in the USA, said there's no room inside her dormitory at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center to walk, eat or sleep while practicing social distancing. She said guards come in and out of the dorm without wearing masks or gloves. More than 70 detainees in the dorm share five bars of soap, she said, and no additional disinfectant or hand sanitizer has been provided at the facility where some detainees have been isolated over fears of coronavirus.

Romero said it's horrifying to see such indifference inside the facility near Baton Rouge while the world outside is quarantining, social distancing, sewing masks and sanitizing their surroundings.

""It's like the world hasn’t changed and everything has stayed the same"" inside the detention center, Romero said. ""We are terrified of dying. If people who have the ability to go to the doctor are dying, what’s going to happen to us in here?""

Attorney General William Barr ordered the release of some medically vulnerable inmates from federal prisons, and sheriffs released thousands of jail inmates to minimize the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks. There has been no similar effort made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which holds more than 34,000 detainees, the majority of which – 60% – have no criminal record and are detained over only a civil immigration violation.

The agency released 160 detainees in recent weeks, but that hasn't been nearly enough for detainees, politicians, doctors and human rights groups pleading with the Trump administration to, at the very least, release detainees with poor health conditions. There has been little response from ICE, so the groups filed a wave of lawsuits around the country that resulted in judges ordering the release of dozens more detainees from California to Massachusetts to New Jersey.

When U.S. District Judge John Jones ordered ICE to release 11 chronically ill detainees from a Pennsylvania detention center last week, he wrote that he issued the order because he could not be party to the ""unconscionable and barbaric"" possibility of those detainees contracting coronavirus.

ICE facilities ""are plainly not equipped to protect Petitioners from a potentially fatal exposure to COVID-19,"" wrote Jones, who ordered an additional 22 ICE detainees freed Tuesday. ""If we are to remain the civilized society we hold ourselves out to be, it would be heartless and inhumane not to recognize Petitioners’ plight. And so we will act.""

One of the biggest challenges facing detainees is that they simply don't know the magnitude of the spread of coronavirus inside ICE facilities.

The agency said 30 detainees and ICE personnel tested positive for coronavirus in 16 different ICE facilities in 10 states as of Tuesday. ICE officials have disclosed little information about its testing procedures – they will not say how many tests have been administered or what facilities test people, saying only that detention centers follow testing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That makes it impossible to know how rapidly the virus is spreading inside ICE detention centers. In one case, a federal lawsuit forced the government to acknowledge that it had not tested any ICE detainees inside the Howard County Detention Center in Jessup, Maryland, has no test kits at the facility and has ""no plans to conduct testing,"" according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang last week ordering ICE to begin testing at the detention center.

ICE data on coronavirus cases is missing a large pool of people – the thousands of private contractors who work as wardens, administrators, guards, doctors, nurses, janitors and cooks inside ICE detention centers. ICE owns and operates only five of the more than 200 facilities that house ICE detainees around the country. The rest of the work is done by private prison companies and jails.

That means ICE's total case count does not include two guards working at the Krome Service Processing Center outside Miami who tested positive for coronavirus this week. An ICE official confirmed their positive tests.

ICE's count is also missing two nurses and one guard who died over the past week because of coronavirus complications at the Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearney, New Jersey, since they worked for the county or a private health care company under contract. The facility holds nearly 300 ICE detainees.

That lack of testing and transparency prompted lawyers to file lawsuits to win the freedom of the most at-risk detainees, according to Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who coordinates more than a dozen lawsuits the organization launched in recent weeks.

""We are fully aware of the magnitude of this problem and are deeply concerned about the health and welfare of all the detainees currently locked up in these facilities,"" Cho said.

Some lawsuits could lead to the release of thousands of unaccompanied minors in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services and adult migrants held by ICE.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in California is considering a request to fast-track the release of nearly 7,000 unaccompanied minors after HHS said four children in its custody in New York tested positive for coronavirus, as well as eight staffers, contractors and foster parents in New York, Washington and Texas.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of Washington is considering a request to release about 1,350 members of migrant families who are detained at three family detention centers in Pennsylvania and Texas.

Beyond those lawsuits, it's challenging for attorneys to hear from more detainees, given ICE's new guidelines requiring all attorneys to bring their own personal protective equipment when visiting clients in detention.

Jessica Schneider is the director of the detention program for Americans for Immigrant Justice in Miami. She said her attorneys would normally be in the region's ICE detention centers at least once a week meeting with detainees who enter the facility and providing legal assistance to them, but her organization doesn't have enough masks and gloves to send their attorneys into the facilities.

Making matters worse, the largest ICE detention facilities in Florida don't have secure videoconferencing capabilities that would allow lawyers and clients to speak confidentially about their cases. That's left Schneider forced to have conversations with her clients through unsecure phone calls or video chats on tablets provided to detainees as guards and other detainees walk past within earshot.

""We have always shied away from using those tablets because they're not confidential. But at this point, we feel that finding out what the facts are on the ground and communicating with people is trumping our ability to engage in confidential communications,"" she said. ""And that shouldn't be a decision an attorney has to make. It's 2020. If we can all have Zoom calls and FaceTime, setting up legal calls (should be possible).""

At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield, California, Charles Joseph said he has access to soap and water to wash his hands but no cleaning supplies to disinfect the hard surfaces in his dormitory. Joseph, 34, said he's trying to stay safe at Mesa Verde but officials at the 400-bed facility make it impossible.

""At no time am I ever 6 feet away from another person,"" said Joseph, who is from Fiji. ""We are sitting ducks in a petri dish. Once it comes in here, everybody is going to catch it.""

Asked about those concerns, a spokesperson for GEO Group, a private prison operator that manages Mesa Verde and 21 other ICE facilities around the country, rejected Joseph's ""unfounded allegations"" and claimed they were instigated by ""outside groups with political agendas.""

In a statement last month, the company said it has experience implementing ""best practices for the prevention, assessment, and management of infectious diseases."" In response to coronavirus, the company said it has educated employees about preventive measures, advised employees to stay home if they have flu-like symptoms, enacted quarantine and testing policies for employees who may have come in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus and deployed specialized sanitation teams to sterilize high-contact areas of its facilities.

Similarly, ICE said it has taken appropriate actions to mitigate the spread of coronavirus throughout its detention network. The agency said it is abiding by CDC guidelines and ""keeping everyone safe.""

Tuesday, the agency said for the first time that it was reviewing cases to determine whether the most vulnerable detainees could be released from custody, given the ""unprecedented nature of COVID-19.""The agency said it was reviewing 600 detainees deemed ""vulnerable.""

""Utilizing CDC guidance along with the advice of medical professionals, ICE may place individuals in a number of alternatives to detention options,"" the ICE statement read. ""Decisions to release individuals in ICE custody occur every day on a case-by-case basis.""

Detainees, and an increasing number of judges, said the agency has fallen short.

""The risk of contracting COVID-19 in tightly confined spaces, especially jails, is now exceedingly obvious,"" U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres wrote in a ruling ordering the release of 10 ICE detainees from detention centers in New Jersey last month.

Ricky Williamson, 31, a detainee at Mesa Verde, said he told a judge in immigration court last week that he was dropping his case to remain in the USA because he would rather be deported to his native United Kingdom than wait for the virus to start circulating through the detention center. Though the U.K. is going through its own coronavirus outbreak, he said he would prefer the freedom to wear gloves and a mask than stay inside an ICE facility.

""It was the hardest decision of my life,"" Williamson said. ""At least if I'm free, I can do my own stuff to prevent getting it.""

Martin Alvarez Garcia, 28, made a similar decision last week. He has had a cough and sore throat for more than two weeks, he said, but doctors at the facility denied his request for a COVID-19 test because he doesn't have a fever. Last week, he waived his right to appeal his deportation order.

""I would honestly rather sign and go back to my country than risk myself getting infected,"" he said. ""I don't feel safe anywhere in Mexico, but I have no choice.""

Six projects in this region won the fourth call for projects launched by the BeMed association. The winners are all environmental protection associations and NGOs. Four are based in Tunisia, one in Libya and one in Egypt.

In Egypt, the selected project is that of the VeryNile association, which focuses on “the involvement of Nile fishermen in the collection of plastic before its arrival at sea and raising awareness among the population”.

The list of BeMed 2020 winners was published on March 30, 2020. The list also includes nine other projects, located in European countries along the Mediterranean (Montenegro, Cyprus, France, Malta, Albania, Greece, Lebanon, and Italy). Under the terms of the call for projects launched on 4 October 2019, the selected projects have a duration of 12 to 18 months, and the funding allocated to each project amounts to a maximum of €10,000.

Plastic pollution in the Mediterranean

The fourth promotion of the BeMed initiative has 16 winners from 11 different countries. This allows the BeMed network to be present today in 15 countries around the Mediterranean, with a total of 54 projects supported.

The projects supported by the BeMed association all have the same goal, that of combating plastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. For the Mediterranean Sea is turning into a dangerous plastic waste sink, with record levels of pollution endangering marine species and human health. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Mediterranean Sea is now the most affected in the world by plastic pollution. Every year, 600,000 tonnes of plastics are dumped there. “That’s the equivalent of 34,000 plastic bottles thrown into the Mediterranean every minute,” said Ludovic Frère-Escoffier, head of WWF’s Ocean Life Programme.

The association Beyond Plastic Med (BeMed) was founded during the international conference “Plastics in the Mediterranean: beyond the facts, what solutions?” held in Monaco on March 10 and 11 March 2015. Its founding members, which are the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the Tara Ocean Foundation, Surfrider Foundation Europe and the Mava Foundation, were joined four years later by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

By | Published: 7:18 pm

Siddipet: Finance Minister T Harish Rao, who set a new trend of conducting official video-conference over smartphone on Sunday, expressed disappointment over sanitation inspectors’ functioning in Siddipet Municipality.

Rao, who conducted a review meeting from his Hyderabad residence using a smartphone for the first time, said that the two Sanitation Inspectors of the Siddipet civic body had failed to get an under repair garbage collecting vehicle repaired for four months. Stressing on the importance to improve sanitation in Siddipet town, Rao observed that the garbage collection was not done properly though each vehicles was assigned just 70 houses. He further said that sanitation work in streets and garbage collection was not being carried out properly though Siddipet Municipality was having more than required staff.

Stating that he got to know the Municipal officials had increased the workers more than its actual need, Rao suggested them to induct the workforce where there was an actual requirement. He has further asked them to unclog the drainages to ensure the free flow of water.

The Minister has also asked the officials ensure the supply of drinking water and spraying of hypochlorite every day.

He has further instructed them to continue the underground drainage and other pending works in Siddipet Municipality. Rao spoke to Municipal Chairperson, Kadavergu Rajanarsu, Commissioner, P Srinivas Reddy, OSD, G Balaraju, Executive Engineer, Public Health, Prathap, DE Lakshman and Sanitary Inspectors Satyanarayana, and Sathish. He has indicated that he would soon also conduct such video-conference over a smartphone with all the Mandal level officials of Sididpet Constituency.

191,https://reliefweb.int/report/jordan/life-under-lockdown-part-iv-keeping-za-atari-refugee-camp-clean-despite-covid-19,"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,Life Under Lockdown: Part IV - Keeping Za’atari Refugee Camp Clean despite Covid-19 - Jordan,"""Families are now told to keep their separated recyclables outside their doors to avoid contact with the trolley workers who pick them up,” says Ali, a Syrian Refugee who manages a team of paid volunteers at Oxfam’s one-of-a-kind recycling facility at Za’atari Refugee Camp in Jordan.

“Even when the trolley workers return to the facility after collection, we now make sure they enter one at a time, wash their carts before entering, refrain from sorting the recyclables right away, clean and sanitize all the machines daily and follow strict hygiene procedures upon entering and departing from the facility.”

Jordan is entering its sixth week of curfew as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and like many countries around the world, has permitted sectors of essential services to continue operating.

From the outset of the country’s lockdown measures, Oxfam did everything possible to ensure that litter collection and recycling at the refugee camp was deemed essential. In turn, this allowed Oxfam to secure curfew exemption permits for four staff to continue waste collection and recycling operations.

“Imagine what would happen if we stopped working or if the garbage trucks stopped collecting waste from the garbage bins,” Ali asks. “It would be a complete and utter disaster.”

It’s estimated that Jordan produces over two million tons of waste every year. Less than ten percent of it is recycled.

Oxfam’s two sorting facilities at Za’atari Refugee Camp were born out of a successful 2015 pilot project that upon completion, witnessed a 20% reduction of solid waste in landfills solely by recycling cardboard, metal and plastic.

The program has since grown to provide recycling and litter collection (also referred to as solid waste management) services to the refugee camp’s entire population of nearly 77,000 refugees who live within its five square kilometres, divided into twelve neighbourhoods referred to as ‘districts’.

By working closely with local municipalities, the program employs Syrian refugees, trained to collect and sort recyclable materials at which point they’re sold to private companies who compete in a transparent process of open tender bids.

Currently, 90% of Za’atari residents take part in sorting their household waste. It is the only place in the country with formal programming to do so. Last year alone, the program saw the creation of over 1000 jobs every month and a 40% engagement of women; the result of deliberate measures taken to break down the barriers women faced accessing jobs in the sector. Today, there are women-led teams and women “ambassadors” tasked with promoting environmental literacy in their homes and communities. To date, Oxfam’s recycling program has collected almost four million kilos of recyclable material.

Building on these initiatives, Oxfam launched “Bei’tak Baytak” (Arabic for “your environment is your home”) earlier this year, a country-wide environmental awareness campaign that hopes to raise environmental literacy in Jordan and turn a new leaf on attitudes and behaviours toward litter and recycling.

If Oxfam’s Za’atari model is any indicator, it is possible to keep communities clean, reduce environmental footprints while creating jobs and providing vulnerable people with a source of income.

“Before this, I had to constantly worry about my expenses, and stress about saving as much money as possible. But now, I can afford to give pocket money to my children,” Ali says.

Ali has been a team leader at the recycling facility for almost two years. Currently, he works six hours a day, six days a week and is responsible for overseeing the daily operation of one of Oxfam’s two sorting facilities including a staff cohort of almost 70 paid volunteers.

Teams of “trolley workers” like those Ali manages do regular walk-throughs of camp collecting the sorted recyclable materials that residents leave at their doorsteps.

On any given day he delegates duties, assigns teams to their respective districts and in this particularly trying period, has the added responsibility of ensuring preventative safety and security measures are followed, all the while making sure paid volunteers feel safe.

Non-recyclable material is either picked up at street level by refugee community cleaners or disposed of by residents in the numerous bins scattered throughout the refugee camp. It is then picked up by garbage trucks that service the camp every day transporting waste to neighbouring municipalities’ landfills.

Mahmoud is a 22-year-old Syrian refugee hired to oversee a similar – albeit smaller team of these community cleaners, tasked with picking up street waste from one of Za’atari’s districts.

“I connect with volunteer teams regularly to make sure I’m reminding them to maintain adequate distance between each other, sending them to different areas of camp, making sure they’re wearing gloves, washing their hands and often have to go as far as making sure people are comfortable working in the areas they’re assigned.”

Since the pandemic’s outbreak, experts and researchers have warned about the risks posed to refugee camps; Spaces not built to withstand crises of this magnitude simply by virtue of their population density, proximity of living conditions and basic levels of service intended to serve short-term humanitarian needs.

“All it would take is one person to get infected,” Ali says. “It would cause a ripple effect across the entire camp. The caravans we live in are so close to one another, supermarkets and bakeries are crowded – even with the physical distancing… I know we’re supposed to stay 2 meters apart but, sometimes even that is difficult in these conditions.”

Ali has five children that that he constantly worries about. And while Mahmoud doesn’t have children, he worries about the potential risk he poses to his family after coming home from a shift at work.

“I take a shower the instant I come home and make sure to change my clothes before I’m in contact with my family,” he says. “I don’t let my children go outside even, I don’t let them run the errands – even the older ones. I worry about them so much I prefer to make sure the essential errands are taken care of when I’m not at work.”

They were both pleased to find out their work was considered essential enough to continue operating.

“It is so hard to spend all day at home without work,” Ali says. “We’re able to spend our time contributing positively to our community and keeping the camp clean. I’m really happy to have this opportunity.”

Nonetheless they both expressed an apprehension about the future after the pandemic.

“I’m so thankful (to God) to have this opportunity – but I’m worried that the pandemic stays longer than we think,” he says. “What will I do? Where will I work after my contract here is over? Everything outside is closed and jobs in the camp are few and far between.”

Mahmoud quit school in order to support his family and his siblings and is trying to make sure they don’t ever have to make the same sacrifice.

Ali on the other hand has a grimmer outlook.

“It’s hard to answer this question,” he says. “In your own country, (before the war) it’s much easier to shape your own future and make choices that get you there. While Jordan has been good to us and is our second home – I can’t visualize the future that I’d like to see for myself here. My children are excellent students, I’m hopeful they’ll get scholarships that take them to post-secondary but if I’m being honest, my future is a narrow horizon and I don’t look forward to it.”

Despite this, both are able to hone in on a refined perspective born specifically from the pandemic and the curfew measures.

“People have started to feel the value of the smallest things they used to have that they may have taken for granted before,” Mahmoud says. “It has forced us to appreciate all of them – whether a job, family or health.”

“I just hope donor communities continue to support these important (solid waste management) projects at the refugee camp. I know for sure that working with Oxfam and getting this paid work opportunity has completely changed my life,” Ali says. “I just hope it all passes over without our Za’atari community needing more because of it.”

“But, regardless of what happens, what’s most important right now is having our health and having a life to wake up to.”

""I know we usually schedule a date for around May, I believe,"" said Inverness Township Supervisor Roger Gaynor. ""But with everything that's going on, it's kind of touch and go.""

For the last several years, the Spring Clean Up day for Inverness Township has been the first weekend in May. With the pandemic, Inverness Township has closed their transfer station until further notice, so there are not large groups of people congregating to dispose of their trash.

Inverness Township Trustee Rodney LaHaie said with the things that are happening around the world and in the state with the virus, he doesn't think it is a good idea for the township to have their event in May.

""We should just kind of wait and see, until things start opening up and people start feeling more comfortable,"" said LaHaie. ""There's a big crowd that ends up down there at the transfer station when this takes place.""

It was LaHaie's recommendation that the township wait, postpone the Clean Up day until sometime later in the year.

""I think that's a good idea,"" said Gaynor. ""Just kind of play it by ear for a little while and see what happens over the next few weeks, and go from there. I'm OK with that.""

That is similar to what the township has been doing with the transfer station, taking everything week by week. At this point, the facility is closed at least until the end of April, as that is when the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” order by the governor expires at this time.

Gaynor said if there are any residents in the township who are wondering where they are going to be able to dispose of their household waste, there are several waste disposal companies around the area who will pick up the trash.

Local Sanitation is also having a special for anyone who is not a normal customer of the company. The company is selling packages of prepaid budget garbage bags at different stores around the area, including Dave's Place gas station, Mullett Lake General Store, Conlin's Alverno Grocery Store and Ken's Village Market. These bags come with instructions on how to set up pick up of the garbage from a residence.

""It's 10 bags for $30,"" said Gaynor. ""They will set up a day to come and get it, right out of your driveway, with no contract. So, there are, at least I know of one, options if you need to get rid of your garbage.""

Gaynor said Local Sanitation was very accommodating when they came to pick up his garbage.

Green For Life Environmental, formerly Republic Waste Services, can pick up someone's trash for them as well, with a similar program to Local Sanitation. Information regarding this program can be found on the Inverness Township website, or by calling Green For Life at (586) 772-8900.

When the township board has made a decision when to hold their annual clean up, the details will be made available to the public.","INVERNESS TOWNSHIP — With the coronavirus pandemic making changes to how local municipalities do things, the Inverness Township Board discussed on April 7 how they should handle the upcoming annual Spring Clean Up event.

Hardly anybody has really seen the faces of the unsung heroes who braving calamity are ensuring our living spaces remain clean.

Even when the city is on a 21-day lockdown and residents are confined to the walls of their houses because of the fear of coronavirus spread, the 2,500-strong brigade of door-to-door garbage collectors is doing their job relentlessly, without giving it a day’s skip.

“We, too, are scared of the virus, but we have no other option. We work so that our family can have a day’s meal,” says 47-year-old Suresh Kumar, who collects garbage from over 140 houses in Sector 41 and over 50 houses in Sector 40.

The only change that the ‘virus’ has brought in Suresh’s working schedule is that now, he does not take his wife and two daughters, school drop-outs, along. The entire responsibility of collecting the garbage has fallen on him and his 16-year-old son, also a school drop-out. “This is the only thing I can do for my family at this time of crisis. At least the ladies of the house will be confined inside and it reduces the chances of their getting infected,” says Suresh.

Jagwanti, a garbage collector who works along with her husband in a society in Sector 48, says, “After we are done with work, the very first thing we do is take bath, before we meet the family.”

AN ‘UNRECOGNISED’ PROFESSION

The door-to-door garbage collectors are neither a part of the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s sanitation wing, nor are they employees of the private company that has been given charge of cleanness work in the southern sectors.

Most door-to-door garbage collectors are paid ₹50 to ₹100 per month per house for collecting daily trash.

They don’t have any life insurance cover or any health insurance benefits. They don’t even enjoy the privilege of a weekly off. If one of them falls sick, their family members must pitch and take their place. They cannot let the chain break—from houses to a sector’s garbage collection centre to the processing unit at Dadumajra.

“It is the time to show the society that we, too, care for them. If we don’t pick the garbage during the curfew period, the piled up garbage will start spreading infections,” says Shamsher Lotia, who is the head of the door-to-door garbage collectors’ society and himself collects garbage from Sector 27.

But how is the administration making sure they stay safe?

The only thing the collectors have been provided by the administration is a pair of plastic gloves each, which don’t last for more than a couple of days. “We have urged the UT administration and central government to provide insurance cover to door-to-door garbage collectors who fall under the rag picker category, and at least provide bare minimum facilities that are extended to municipal corporation’s sanitation workers to carry out work at the time of coronavirus,” says Lotia.

“Except for a handful, all garbage collectors are Dalits. Though we largely don’t face any discrimination in our work, people do have a tendency to maintain distance. Some people even tell us not to touch their gates. In case we ask for water, they prefer not to use steel or glass tumblers, but give us a bottle and ask us to take it along,” he adds.

CLEANLINESS, A DISTANT DREAM FOR THEIR LOCALITY

The garbage collectors ensure cleanliness in all sectors and societies in the city, but when it comes to their colony in Sector 56, cleanliness is a distant reality.

It was in 2008 that the collectors were allotted prefabricated tin shed houses under the central government’s Rag Pickers Awas Yojana Scheme in Sector 56, Chandigarh.

For the last four months, their sewerage line is choked and the wastewater is overflowing into the residential spaces.

“It is the duty of the MC to take care of the common toilets and sewerage lines and of the outer roads. But the officials have a callous approach towards us. They think since we are garbage collectors, we ourselves will take care of the entire sanitation work of the area,” says Rajdulari, 40, who accompanies her husband for collecting garbage from over 150 houses in Sector 39.

KIDS MEAN EXTRA INCOME

Most of the children of garbage collectors are school drop-outs and are seen as extra earning hands. “In our profession, you will see the entire family, including wife and kids, helping the man of the house to cover more houses and subsequently add more to the household income. We send our children to schools, but the rate of the drop-out is more in our community,” says garbage collector Geeta, 40, whose all four daughters attend school hoping to one day break out of the ‘family profession’.

“We are contributing towards keeping Chandigarh clean even at the time of coronavirus spread, and hoping the administration realises that the rag pickers’ colony, too, should be an area of concern. We are residents of Chandigarh as well,” says a 50-year-old garbage collector, Saroj.","Even when the city is on a 21-day lockdown and residents are confined to the walls of their houses because of the fear of coronavirus spread, the 2,500-strong brigade of door-to-door garbage collectors is doing their job relentlessly, without giving it a day’s skip.

CARACAS, Apr 29 2020 (IPS) - The oil slump, global recession and uncertainty about the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic will fuel the appetite for cheaper fossil fuel energy and delay investments in renewables, affecting the targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The countries of the developing South, and in particular oil exporters, will be affected as suppliers to shrinking economies and as seekers of investment in clean energy, in a world that will compete fiercely for low-cost recovery, warned experts consulted by IPS.

The crises, “in view of the abundance and low prices of oil, far from accelerating a change of era that would leave behind fossil fuels and embrace renewable energies, will postpone for a long time that aim, outlined in the SDGs,” said Venezuelan oil expert Elie Habalián.

One of the targets of SDG 7, which calls for affordable clean energy, is to “increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix” by 2030.

This is in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, signed in 2015, which enters into force at the end of this year. The accord includes energy transition measures: national contributions to replace fossil fuels with clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

These commitments are undermined by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which will cause a severe recession, with the global economy projected to shrink three percent this year and six percent in large countries in the North like the United States and in the South like Brazil.

With that forecast, “it seems that the efforts of governments will tend to sustain and deepen the extractivist model, including hydrocarbons,” said researcher María Marta di Paola, of Argentina’s Environment and Natural Resources Foundation.

In 2018, according to British oil giant BP, global consumption of primary energy (the energy embodied in natural resources before undergoing any human-made conversions or transformations) was 13,865 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), with a predominance of fossil fuels: oil 33.6 percent, coal 27.2 percent and gas 23.8 percent.

Hydroelectricity represented 6.8 percent and sources strictly considered renewable (solar, wind, geothermal, marine, biomass) contributed just 561 Mtoe, or 4.04 percent.

The Paris Agreement, aimed at adapting to and mitigating the climate emergency, establishes that developing countries will take longer to comply with the agreement and that the reductions to which they commit will be made on the basis of equity and in the context of their fight against poverty and for sustainable development.

But in the face of the crises caused by the pandemic, many of the 196 signatory countries, “seeking to take advantage of their installed capacity and regulate impacts on employment and consumption, will relax environmental standards and miss the opportunity to begin a clean, fair and inclusive energy transition,” said Di Paola.

Lisa Viscidi of the Washington-based think tank Inter-American Dialogue said that “although rates of return are currently higher for renewables than for fossil fuels, there are indications that it will be difficult to attract investment in solar or wind energy before demand recovers.”

She cited “the plunge in demand for electricity due to the self-isolation (to curb the spread of COVID-19), which strongly impacts the auctions of renewables, leading to their cancellation” – a reference to the mechanism for buying and selling electricity between suppliers and distributors.

With the collapse of oil prices, governments like those of Latin America “will not be inclined towards renewable energy for now, calculating that it could have higher costs,” said Viscidi, head of the energy area in her organisation.

But also when the current world health crisis ends, “the post-pandemic economy will pose insurmountable obstacles for many countries in the global South to achieve a transformation of their energy mix,” said Alejandro López-González, an expert in sustainability from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Spain.

This, he argued, is because “the transformation of the energy mix in countries of the South depends on trade in commodities with industrialised countries,” that is, on securing good markets and prices for their products, which provide revenue with which to adopt cleaner energy sources.

Throughout the developing South, the global recession will result in fewer exports, business closures, job losses, lower tax revenues and reduced investment, according to projections by multilateral bodies, leaving capital- and technology-intensive initiatives, such as solar or wind farms, without resources.

Currently, in the developing South, only India, with solar and wind energy plants, and Brazil (wind and biomass) are attempting to keep up with the giants that possess large non-conventional clean energy installations: China, the United States, Germany and Japan.

In 2018, renewable energies represented only 9.3 percent, or 2,480 of the 26,615 terawatts (1 Tw = 1 billion kilowatts) of electricity generation in the world, versus 10,100 Tw contributed by coal, 6,189 by gas and 4,193 by water sources.

Peter Fox-Penner, head of Boston University’s Institute for Sustainable Energy, said in an article distributed by The Conversation that “Economy-driven demand reductions, which are likely worldwide, will hurt new renewable installations.

“Utilities will tighten their budgets and defer building new plants. Companies that make solar cells, wind turbines, and other green energy technologies will shelve their growth plans and adopt austerity measures,” in the context of the global recession, he wrote.

But “Countervailing factors will partly offset this decline, at least in wealthy countries,” Fox-Penner said. “Many renewable plants are being installed for reasons other than demand growth, such as clean power targets in state laws and regulations,” and public pressure that forces utilities to close down coal-fired power plants, he added.

The outlook for oil

Along these lines, Venezuelan economist José Manuel Puente predicted that “the energy transition will happen, there are more and more regulations, electric and hybrid cars, and the problem for Venezuela, Nigeria or Mexico is that we will remain poor countries with deposits of black sludge underground.”

López-González is also in favour of countries like Venezuela – with an enormous potential for wind energy due to the strong, constant trade winds that blow in the northwest – fully exploiting their hydrocarbon resources in order to finance changes in their energy mix.

But these strategies were suspended for members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and for other crude oil producers, when oil prices collapsed to the point that on Apr. 20 they reached negative values, for the first time in history.

U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was quoted that day on the New York futures market at -37 dollars per barrel, 50 dollars below its opening price that day of 13 dollars.

The prices plunged because, as stockpiles overwhelmed storage facilities, buyers did not want to be forced to receive agreed shipments for delivery on that “Black Monday”, and preferred to assume the cost of getting out of the commitment.

That day illustrated the decline in demand that had already started before the arrival of coronavirus in Europe and the Americas, and which gave rise in March to a supply reduction agreement between the 11 OPEC partners and 10 other exporters.

The recession triggered by COVID-19 will mean that the world will consume 30 percent less this year: 70 million barrels a day of oil, down from 100 million in 2019.

This oil crisis “brings very bad news for producers in the Gulf, Russia, Mexico, Venezuela and others: it is the end of absolute income, and the extreme minimisation of the differential income of oil,” said Habalián, a former Venezuelan ambassador to OPEC.

For years, oil exporting nations benefited from setting reference prices for oil before it reached the markets. And in addition, due to the wide gap between costs and prices, they piled up profits that are being pulverised by the current crisis.

Also affected are dozens of companies facing bankruptcy since the growing demand and strong oil prices had allowed them to extract, mainly in the United States, shale oil and gas by means of fracking (hydraulic fracturing), an environmentally questionable technique.

Finally, the energy landscape will be impacted by the behaviors that consumers adopt in the wake of the pandemic – such as their use of energy or demand for travel – or by changes in labour relations after the extensive experiment in off-site work as a result of the COVID-19 self-isolation.","One of the targets of SDG 7, which calls for affordable clean energy, is to “increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix” by 2030.

CHENNAI: The complete lockdown RPT lockdown in the major urban centres of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Coimbatore, came into force on Sunday with groceries and vegetable shops also shutting down as civic bodies intensified disinfection work in their respective regions.

While police patrol vehicles and flying squads of civic bodies alone could be seen in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Salem and Tirupur, people in some localities in north Chennai loitered around and police warned them to stay indoors.

Also, regions close to Chennai and falling under Chengelpet, Kancheepuram, and Tiruvallur districts, besides districts including Cuddalore, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam are fully shut today.

Though mild showers since early morning here brought welcome relief to people during summer, there was no respite for health workers of Greater Chennai Corporation, who continued their work of visiting every household to check if people had symptoms, including fever associated with flu.

Districts, including Chengelpet, also witnessed rains.

Disinfection work was carried out in all shutdown cities, with special focus on containment zones, authorities said.

Milk supply was not affected as government run 'Aavin' (Tamil Nadu Co-operative Milk Producers'Federation) delivered it to consumers at their doorsteps as usual.

The Koyambedu vegetable market here, which alone was allowed to open, witnessed fewer footfalls as the public were not permitted to venture out and retailers running neighbourhood outlets avoided purchase from there as they could not open their shops.

Traders said some hawkers and pushcart vendors were among the very few number of people who visited the market to buy vegetables and arrival of fresh stocks too was limited.

While several shops within the market were either shut or opened only for purposes like cleaning, a section of outlets that opened for usual trade closed by noon.

President of the Koyambedu Market Anna Anaithu Vyabarigal PodhuNala Sangam, (General traders welfare association) 'Pazhakadiai' Jayaraman told PTI: ""The market is deserted since people did not venture out of their homes. Many like me who opened shops in the morning closed down our outlets at noon since there were not many buyers.""

People had on Saturday resorted to panic buying of essentials in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Tirupur and Salem.

Koyambedu, the name of both the locality here and the market, is one of the biggest in South India, that vends vegetables, fruits and flowers, catering to the general public, wholesalers and retailers as well.

As COVID-19 cases are on the rise in Tamil Nadu, Palaniswami had on April 24 announced a complete shutdown beginning Sunday in Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai for four days, disallowing grocery shops as well and fully curtailing movement of the public.

Also, Salem and Tirupur in western Tamil Nadu shall be shut similarly, albeit for three days from April 26, he said while assuring the people that mobile outlets would bring vegetables and fruits would to their doorsteps.

Chennai Corporation had made it clear that barring Koyambedu, no shops would be allowed to function even for selling vegetables and fruits and that only push carts and mobile vehicles would be permitted to do so.","By PTICHENNAI: The complete lockdown RPT lockdown in the major urban centres of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai and Coimbatore, came into force on Sunday with groceries and vegetable shops also shutting down as civic bodies intensified disinfection work in their respective regions.

KOCHI: Four days a week, Pius Mathai, a sanitation worker, cycles from his home in Ezhupunna in Alappuzha district to Elamakkara in Ernakulam , 58km up and down, to collect waste from house to cloistered house and deposit them in the corporation's garbage trucks.

Armed with a pair of gloves, a cotton mask and some carbolic acid, Pius's work begins at 7pm and officially ends at 3am, though he invariably hangs around till 9 in the morning when the trucks finally arrive. Like around 370 other temporary sanitation workers in the city in the frontline of the fight against Covid-19, Pius, 46, has no insurance or health benefits but he's not complaining because his 8-member family back in Alappuzha depends on him.

Pius would not have considered cycling to work, now a lifestyle choice for many who consider themselves to be woke, but ever since the Covid lockdown began he has been using his teenage son's bicycle to commute from Ezhupunna to Elamakkara.

And to get to the road from where he can pedal the distance of 29km to the city, Pius and his cycle must first cross a ferry from his home at Valmuthuku, bound by water on three sides.

As a temporary worker who helps to clear household waste from the city, Pius knows the work he does four days a week is an essential service. But the reason why he cannot sit at home blaming the lockdown is the life burden he shoulders. The wellbeing of two families with total of eight members -- his own and that of his widowed sister Soni -- depend on this casual job that pays him a meagre Rs 500 a day.

Pius was denied protective gear as he was new to work

I have never cycled more than three-four kilometres a day. By the time I get here the legs are stiff,” says Pius, pulling out from his bag a tube of diclofenac gel and a strip of tablets for the pain. It takes him three hours to get to the city from Ezhupunna. He works till 3am in the morning collecting waste from around 300 households in Elamakkara, including the residence of actor Mohanlal. He gets back only after the collection truck turns up around 9am in the morning.

“I took up the job two-and-a-half months ago after Shaji, my brotherin-law, who held the job, died in an accident,” says Pius. Shaji died in a road mishap in November, 2019, while returning after waste collection. “Since he was not on the rolls, there was no support from Kochi corporation. My coworkers and the local councilor raised some money. That was all,” he said. Recently, Kochi corporation gave away a pair of gloves, a cotton bath towel, carbolic soap and a cotton mask to sanitation workers. Pius says he was denied even this ‘protection gear’ as he was new to the work.

With even tea shops closed, night work is hard for waste collectors. “I carry my dinner now and a bottle of water. Even a cup of tea is out of question,” says Pius. He starts his work around 7pm every evening and wraps it up by 3am but they can’t leave until the collection truck arrives. “We had to wait till 9am on somedays but with the start of lockdown they arrive early, by around 7am,” he said. Pius then cycles back another 29km, feeling sleepy and tired, and gets home by around 11.30am to catch upon sleep followed by a late lunch.

“The way some treat their own waste makes me puke. Some don’t keep their waste out regularly and it begins to stink,” says Pius. With the pandemic spreading, workers like him are a worried lot because they don’t know what risk awaits them from homes from where they collect the waste.

“I’ve heard that even migrant labourers have insurance. Why can’t they provide us at least that,” says Rajesh T V, who had been in the job for the past 14 years. He commutes from Irinjalakkuda — a distance of 61km daily, but his condition is tad better since he has a motorbike

But, experts stress that sufficient clean water is needed to wash hands to be safe from the infection.

Taking part in a video conference organised by the Smart Solution Pvt Ltd, they emphasized the availability of pure and sufficient water to wash hand. They advised the government to be equally careful for the prevention and control of infectious diseases likely to be spread during summer.

The experts sought the attention of stakeholders concerned towards the supply of clean water to people’s households, quarantine facilities, in public places and other required areas.

Though, people have got the message that regular hand-washing with soap and the use of hand sanitiser are the effective measures to be safe from the virus, water is in short supply. Water tanks placed in public places are empty, and quarantine centers do not have a sufficient number of toilets, soap and running water facilities, according to them.

They expressed concerns over the compositions of hand sanitiser lately appeared in the market. As they said, ethanol alcohol -based sanitiser can kill the virus from 60 to 90 percent and mixture of isopropyl alcohol in it would give better results, but this knowledge seems lacking in the production of hand sanitiser in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

Former secretary engineer Suman Sharma, Kathmandu University teacher Subodh Sharma, director general at the Department of Water Supply and Drinking Water and Sewerage, Sunil Kumar Das; organising commitee chair engineer Ramdeep Shah, Water Aid’s Anil Thaman, former Minister Deepak Gyawali, former Science, Technology and Environment Minister Ganesh Shah, researchers from the drinking water and sanitation sector, policymakers from the related field, journalists, and government and non government representatives took part in the conference.

The participants spoke the need of strengthening local levels and local users’ committees to deal with the water crisis issue. They were univocal that water crisis was not only the issue of urban areas, but it was the problem of rural areas and it was really challenging to address issue when the country was struggling to combat the pandemic.

Governments are taking aggressive steps to contain and control the spread of the virus through social distancing, testing, and contract tracing. It is well established that a major vector for transmission is human to human contact as well as human contact with infected surfaces. A critical element of a successful virus containment must include frequent hand washing with soap and water.

Based on the latest estimates by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, three billion people don’t have soap and water at home, 900 million children don’t have soap and water at school, and 40 percent of health care facilities were not equipped to practice hand hygiene. There are also large inequalities between and within countries with some populations having extremely low coverage of this basic, and vital amenity. More than 400 million people in rural India have limited household hygiene facilities while 40 million people in rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo have no hygiene facilities at all; 100 percent of rural Gambians have no household hygiene facilities. Globally, 36 percent of schools have no hygiene services; in Yemen, it’s 84 percent.

Even before COVID-19, these gaps in access to hygiene services and safely managed drinking water and sanitation services were causing massive harm to people’s health, education, and economic opportunities in many of the world’s developing nations. The lack leads to increased incidences of water-borne diseases, particularly diarrhea which killed 829,000 people in 2016. Diseases like these also keep millions of children out of school and diminish women’s opportunities to create new economic enterprises. Overall, it’s estimated that even before COVID-19, inadequate hand hygiene resulted in nearly 300,000 deaths annually, with the majority of deaths being among children younger than five.

The critical importance of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development was recognized in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6.1 and 6.2:

6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all;

6.2 By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

Even before COVID-19, the World Health Organization estimated that universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene would reduce the global disease burden by about 10 percent. In urban areas, for every US$1 invested in basic sanitation, the return in saved medical costs and increased productivity is $2.5 while in rural areas, each $1invested returns on average more than $5.

UNDP, through programmes such as GoAL-WaSH and its Climate Change Adaptation portfolio, plays an active role in helping countries improve access to safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene. GoAL-WaSH supported the post-conflict government in Liberia to set up a national regulatory body for the water supply and sanitation sectors. In the Maldives, a project financed by the Green Climate Fund will bring safe drinking water to more than 100,000 people across 49 of the Outer Islands.

In recognition of the critical importance of handwashing both to prevent COVID-19, and to reduce the global burden of death, disease and lost socioeconomic opportunity towards achieving SDGs 6.1 and 6.2, the Sanitation and Water for All Partnership has issued a “Leadership Call to Action” calling upon leaders everywhere to provide water, sanitation and hygiene to all without discrimination, ensure that systems supporting them are resilient, and above all provide the financing to do this in a sustainable way.

The Leadership Call to Action has been signed by heads of state, the presidents of regional development banks, heads of international NGOs, CEOs of companies such as Unilever and SUEZ, as well as the heads of many UN agencies, including UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

Tangible follow-up on the Call to Action will not only play a major role in containing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics, but, by bringing safe water, sanitation and hygiene to communities and schools around the world, could help catalyze a measurable leap in sustainable human development and progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.","It is well established that a major vector for transmission is human to human contact as well as human contact with infected surfaces.
A critical element of a successful virus containment must include frequent hand washing with soap and water.

“When you are struggling for water, there are all these cascading ways that it can affect your health—it makes you more likely to be sick, stressed out, or have other vulnerabilities,” he said. “Inadequate water security can be a multiplier effect for COVID-19 risk and lead to more severe cases.”

Stoler, along with professors Wendy Jepson of Texas A&M University and Amber Wutich from Arizona State University, recently published their research in the Journal of Global Health. They describe how inadequate water access increases the risk for COVID-19 in many ways beyond limiting handwashing. Stringent physical distancing measures imposed as a result of COVID-19 are not always compatible with the realities of people living in the most impoverished regions of the world—such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia—who often obtain water from outside the home.

Stoler

“In the same way that New York City’s high population density made it a hotspot for COVID-19, megacities like Lagos, Nigeria, or Mumbai, India, with large urban slums are likely to be future hotspots across the global south,” Stoler said, noting that Rio de Janiero and São Paolo, Brazil, are already seeing rapid transmission. “The density of these cities, compounded by the lack of services, will make it worse.”

Typical social distancing measures that we take for granted in the United States will be even more challenging to follow for families living without basic water and sanitation services, Stoler said. When people experience water insecurity—which is a lack of access to affordable, adequate, reliable, and safe drinking water—it becomes more challenging for them to collect water needed for basic personal hygiene, such as handwashing. And, it is difficult for them to have enough water to sanitize surfaces.

These problems also exist in the U.S. in places like the Navajo Nation, where many live without running water. And in inner-city areas, some low-income residents who have lost jobs have had their water service shut off because they can’t pay the bill.

Additionally, many communities compensate for a lack of access to water by sharing a water source, which also contradicts physical distancing guidelines. And, some families must reuse water storage containers, which could raise the possibility of contamination or transmission of the virus, as well.

“Water sharing can facilitate COVID-19 transmission through close interpersonal interactions—often in other people’s living quarters—and physical contact with containers and taps,” the authors wrote in their study.

And, in communities where people often line up to fill their home’s buckets with water at a communal tap or at a body of water, it is difficult to maintain a large separation between families. For people who must collect the water, the researchers wrote, visiting a source alone could be dangerous because of treacherous terrain or, for women, threat of harassment and assault.

Stoler and his collaborators co-lead the Household Water Insecurity Experiences Research Coordination Network (HWISE-RCN), which has funding from the National Science Foundation through 2023. Stoler is currently leading a follow-up study with the HWISE-RCN that analyzed data from 8,297 households across 23 countries to quantify how COVID-19 is most likely to affect families who experience water insecurity. Their analysis shows that 71 percent of households face at least one water problem that could interfere with COVID-19 prevention, Stoler said.

When drafting guidelines to temper the infection rates for COVID-19, Stoler said, it is imperative that public health officials consider the lack of access to safe drinking water that the poor face.","They describe how inadequate water access increases the risk for COVID-19 in many ways beyond limiting handwashing.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Hand-washing and basic hygiene, alongside social distancing, are the world’s best weapons against the coronavirus. Yet for many people, especially those living in remote and rural areas of low- and middle-income countries, clean water remains elusive.

Globally, 1 in 3 people do not have access to safe drinking water, and at least 2 billion use a water source contaminated with feces, which can transmit diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and polio. Contaminated drinking water leads to about 485,000 diarrheal deaths per year. This does not include the effect of other viruses, such as the coronavirus, that simply spread faster when there is limited access to clean water for hand-washing and other hygienic behaviors.

Are water ATMs dispensing a viable solution to clean water? Water ATMs are increasingly popping up in low-resource settings, but are they really a solution to clean water?

While wells and water pumps are some of the more traditional solutions to providing communities with water, other unique methods are beginning to circulate in the hopes of generating impact.

“For those who are interested in increasing access to water, they should begin by understanding what the barriers to access are and then thinking creatively about how those challenges can be addressed,” said Lauren Cuscuna, innovations and insights manager at the Safe Water Network.

Devex takes a look at some of the innovative solutions already out there.

1. A new way to drill

Installing a well typically requires a drilling rig that can create a borehole deep enough to extract water from the ground. Such rigs are heavy pieces of equipment that cost anywhere between $15,000 and $25,000 to use per well.

But there are other ways to do it. The Village Drill is a lightweight, portable drill that operates using manpower rather than machine power. It was first designed in 2011 by engineers at Brigham Young University in Utah. For a one-off cost of $25,000, it can produce dozens of wells each year. There are now over 105 Village Drills operating in 36 countries, including Somalia, Bolivia, and Papua New Guinea.

“One of the problems with the big rigs is that they can’t get to most of the people who live off approved roads,” said John Renouard, founder of water nonprofit WHOlives and co-creator of the Village Drill.

According to Renouard, the drill takes less than two hours to put together, can drill up to 270 feet, and functions in 75% more areas than a typical drill rig.

When a community gets a Village Drill, WHOlives provides training on how to use it so wells can be drilled independently by community members, who sometimes go on to rent out the drill and their services to other communities as a way of generating income.

“My hope is that people realize there is a solution that's economically viable and doesn’t rely on constant funding,” Renouard said.

2. Warka Tower

Created by Warka Water — a nonprofit that focuses on innovative and sustainable solutions to global challenges — the Warka Tower is a vertical structure made of natural materials that collects rainwater, condensation, and fog before filtering and distributing between 40 and 80 liters of drinking water per day.

“What makes it special is that it is recalling an approach [to collecting water] that was used in ancient cultures but dismissed and forgotten. Today, there is a big need to go back to such sustainable approaches,” said Arturo Vittori, president of Warka Water. “It shows other approaches are possible ... in places like remote villages that are not served by the city pipeline.”

Still in its infancy, the Warka Tower concept has seen three structures built so far in Ethiopia and Cameroon, with plans for additional towers, specifically to support Pygmy people in Ethiopia, Vittori said.

“Structures like this that are independent from governmental infrastructure can help a lot to meet community needs,” he added.

3. Water ATMs

Operating much like an ATM for money, water ATMs dispense clean water when a card — sold by vendors and small shops — is inserted. The ATMs collect rainwater and purify it via solar-powered reverse osmosis or by connecting to the grid system. In Uganda, 1 liter of water from an ATM costs 500 shillings ($0.13). In Bangladesh, it costs 0.4 taka, or less than half of 1 cent.

WaterAid and the Safe Water Network are two of the organizations rolling out water ATMs in some countries.

“It addresses what we call the ‘sustainability gap,’ which is the gap between water revenues and expenses in order to have a financially sustainable model,” Cuscuna said.

“For those who are interested in increasing access to water, they should begin by understanding what the barriers to access are and then thinking creatively about how those challenges can be addressed.” — Lauren Cuscuna, innovations and insights manager, Safe Water Network

Water ATMs offer people reliable access to clean drinking water at an affordable price in places such as settlements or remote villages where access may otherwise be difficult. The use of a card rather than cash also makes it easier for organizations such as SWN to compile data on water ATMs’ usage to better meet the needs of communities, Cuscuna said.

While there can be an initial distrust of the machines, Cuscuna suggested that can be remedied by working with communities and explaining how they work.

4. Underground aqueducts

This centuries-old system of water collection goes by varying names, including qanat or kahriz. They are a kind of underground aqueduct or canal, engineered to collect groundwater and direct it to the surface for drinking, domestic use, and agriculture, according to Arzu Musayev, a senior engineering assistant with the International Organization for Migration in Azerbaijan.

Around the 1960s, the introduction of wells meant that many kahrizes were abandoned, but groundwater reserves have since decreased in some areas, making many wells insufficient, Musayev said. To tackle this, IOM is working in countries such as Azerbaijan to rehabilitate the system.

“It is a nonelectric and non-fossil-fuel-consuming method of supplying water. It therefore ensures the protection and improvement of biodiversity, while contributing to the improvement of beneficiaries’ quality of life,” Musayev said.

Since 1999, IOM Azerbaijan has rehabilitated 163 kahrizes, providing water for over 20,000 rural households. Once IOM has helped to restore them, community members are expected to maintain the system. Musayev said promotion, education, and training would help to increase their use.

5. Fog catchers

In the Southwest of Morocco, women-led nongovernmental organization Dar Si Hmad is taking advantage of the often foggy conditions around Mount Boutmezguida to provide water to people who would otherwise have to travel hours each day to the nearest well.

Made of 17,222 square feet of nets held together by two pillars, each catcher captures fog in its honeycomb-like structure before condensing it into liquid. The water then slowly gathers in the gutter below and is transported via pipes to local households.

While the yield can be small and much patience is needed, the quality of the water is exceptional given the lack of pollution in the area, said Jamila Bargach, co-founder and director of Dar Si Hmad. Since a pilot project launched in 2015, fog catchers have been constructed across 16 villages in the area, with immediate plans to reach eight more villages before looking to other locations across West and North Africa.

The access to clean water is having an impact on the area’s agriculture as well, according to Bargach. “We were also given a piece of land by the community, and the organization has turned this [into] a green farm thanks to the excess of fog water,” she said.","Yet for many people, especially those living in remote and rural areas of low- and middle-income countries, clean water remains elusive.

Matt Damon and Gary White Explain Why Clean Water Is Crucial To Fighting Coronavirus,"How do you combat coronavirus without water? That problem is a reality facing 785 million people around the world who lack access to safe water.

The coronavirus pandemic has only increased the urgency of Matt Damon and social entrepreneur Gary White, who spoke with CNN political commentator Van Jones about this water crisis as part of the TIME100 Talks: Finding Hope series on Thursday. Damon and White’s work with their organizations water.org and WaterEquity aim to facilitate access to water and sanitation around the world, White told Jones.Without clean water, you lack a crucial tool for protecting yourself from the virus: washing your hands. (And if you get sick, more than 66% of healthcare facilities in low income countries also don’t have soap or running water either, White added.)

While the first step towards combating coronavirus in wealthy countries has been obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE), Damon told Jones that the first step in many impoverished communities has been obtaining clean water. “Water is the very first level,” he said. “Water is PPE.”

In 2009, Damon and White co-founded their non-profit water.org to provide affordable financing to impoverished communities to help facilitate access to safe, cost-effective water and sanitation. White told Jones that they view the poor communities that they work with as “a market to be served,” rather than “a problem to be solved.”

The idea swiftly took off. In 2011, Damon and White were recognized on TIME’s 100 Most Influential for their work with water.org. Less than a decade later, in 2020, they’ve reached nearly 30 million people. The non-profit has also mobilized nearly two billion dollars in capital for its micro-loans, White shared, which are repaid at a rate of 99%.

More than 90% of water.org’s micro-loans go to women and girls, who are often tasked with water collection and subsequently have to skip or drop out of school, Damon said. Once their community has access to clean water, the girls who would have their day obtaining that water can instead focus on their studies. “It’s the difference between having a life and living out your potential or just being relegated to this brutal cycle of poverty,” he explained.

In 2017, Damon and White also co-founded WaterEquity, an impact investment fund manager that allows people to invest in a portfolio that helps increase access to water and sanitation. Around half of the water projects in the world fail, Damon told Jones, often because they weren’t put in the hands of the communities they’re meant to be serving. “We believe in empowering people to solve their own problems,” Damon said.

While a lot of their work has slowed down amid coronavirus, White said they’ve also seen a push from local utilities to try to reach more poor neighbors. The pandemic has exhibited how connected the world truly is and how the health of one community can affect the health of another around the globe, he added.

“For me, if there’s some hope in this,” White shared, “it’s a hope that water will finally start to be recognized as the hero that it is.”

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is exposing long-standing inequalities in societies around the world. The United Nations Global Goals calls on countries to eliminate poverty, make health care universal, and ensure the right to clean water and sanitation. You can join us in taking action on these issues here

Washing your hands with warm, soapy water is a directive heard countless times since the COVID-19 coronavirus began spreading around the world.

It’s sound medical advice that allows and empowers people to protect themselves. But not everyone is able to follow it.

On the Navajo Nation — an area spanning parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico that has become an epicenter of coronavirus — between 15% and 40% of households lack access to clean, running water. Navajo people often have to go to windmills, gas stations, or other facilities to fill up large plastic jugs with water, according to a 2019 report.

Because of its unique legal status and decades of neglect from the federal government, the Navajo Nation has often been excluded from water infrastructure projects, according to NPR. To make matters worse, groundwater in the region has been heavily contaminated by mining and other extractive industries, which has left many Navajo people with pre-existing conditions that further expose them to the virus.

As lockdown and curfew measures continue, families are having a harder time getting water, according to Bleu Adams (Mandan/Hidatsa, Diné), a Navajo activist, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Protect Native Elders.

She said that many families are beginning to ration water.

“When you’re rationing your water, you’re trying to be very mindful of how you’re using it,” Adams told Global Citizen. “And then, if you have multiple families in a household, that water gets more and more precious. Washing clothes, washing dishes and surfaces, that’s all impacted by the rationing.”

There are other factors that have made the community uniquely vulnerable to the virus.

Tribal members often live in densely packed homes — in part because of cultural tradition, but also because restrictive federal policy has resulted in a housing shortage. This has allowed the virus to surge through entire families, Adams said.

The Navajo Nation is facing one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the US.

“You’ll have two to four generations of family in one home,” she said. “And the homes are fairly small, anywhere from two to four bedrooms. The traditional homes that many of our elders still live in are single rooms.

“When you’re asking for people to isolate, it’s very difficult for them,” she said, mentioning, by way of example, a mother she knows with COVID-19 who's self-isolating in her car.

The Navajo Nation has little in the way of infrastructure compared to the rest of the US. Adams said that there are 12 health facilities and six hospitals for an area as large as West Virginia.

“We’re overwhelmed quickly in our health facilities,” she said. “When we’re hit with these numbers, we’re immediately overwhelmed, so what happens is, if the patient needs critical care, they need to be transferred to Albuquerque, Phoenix, or Flagstaff. That’s a minimum of one hour by helicopter ride or a three-hour car ride.”

Communities have few grocery options, and the stores that are available are often overpriced and understocked because it’s difficult to source supplies to the reservation, Adams said.

“I have a friend who owns a market in the Hard Rock community on the reservation, and she has been saying for months that she just can’t get access to cleaning supplies,” Adams said. “Then you have the problem of people traveling off res and possibly coming into contact with infected people and coming back.”

Lack of broadband internet access has also impeded the ability of Navajo people to get regular updates on the pandemic.

Because of these and other factors, the virus has been able to spread like wildfire. An estimated 144 Navajo people have died from the virus, and 4,153 have been infected by it, according to the Navajo Department of Health. The Navajo Nation now has the highest per capita rate of infection in the US, having recently surpassed New York.

The federal government set aside $8 billion within coronavirus stimulus packages to help Native American tribes address the virus, but little of this money has been disbursed so far, according to the New York Times. Tribes are now suing the government for the funds.

“How is it that the Navajo Nation borders 80 miles of the Colorado River and doesn’t have access to one drop of water?” Wahleah Johns, a founder of Native Renewables, recently wrote in a New York Times op-ed. “How can it be that coal and water from Navajo lands helped create electricity for Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, and yet 15,000 families on the reservation don’t have power?”

Grassroots Navajo groups and international nonprofits such as Doctors Without Borders have stepped up to fill the void by the federal government, and relief funds have been set up to help communities overcome the economic hardship of lockdown measures.

“We were willing to mobilize so quickly at the grassroots level because historically we haven’t had the support of the federal government,” Adams said. “There are multiple grassroots organizations mobilizing, coming up with innovative solutions to these problems, but if we’re talking long-term, it has to involve politics: regulations and policy at the federal level.”

Adams said that you can’t understand the virus’ impact on the Navajo Nation without understanding the broader history of Indigenous communities in the US, which has involved cultural erasure, oppression, and marginalization. Overcoming the virus and preventing future outbreaks, she said, requires Indigenous people having a seat at the table in political discussions — bringing centuries of knowledge and wisdom to bear.

If the tribe's fundamental right to clean water was fulfilled, for example, the virus could be more easily contained.

“We need water,” she said. “This literally all ties back to how water is life. Most of our communities are fighting for our right to water.”

The County of Tulare led a project to construct a replacement water system and potable water is available throughout the community. As of Friday, May 15, 2020, the Water Board has rescinded the boil water notice.

“We are excited to have been part of the team bringing a clean, safe, reliable water system to Seville and we look forward to transitioning it over to the newly created Yettem-Seville CSD,” said Reed Schenke, Director, Tulare County Resource Management Agency. “This ensures the residents and users of the infrastructure can own and maintain the system with local control and interest. We want to thank all of the partners, sponsors, and community members who have been part of this project.”

This new water system is the first phase in a County project to improve water quality and quantity in the communities of Yettem and Seville. The County, working with the Community Service District (CSD) and other community stakeholders, has begun a grant application to construct the second phase of the project to add a new well in Yettem and connect both water systems along Avenue 384. This second phase of construction is expected in 2021 or 2022.

“Communities like Seville and Yettem represent the hardships we still face as a county,” stated District 4 Supervisor, Eddie Valero. “However, it is through commitment, resolve, and a collective capacity that enables us to tackle these issues for the betterment of County residents.”

The County has served as the court-appointed receiver for the Seville Water Company since 2009, when the State of California asked the County to help the community with ongoing water quality and quantity problems. Seville has received international attention in the past for its issues with access to clean drinking water, including serving as a focal point on water quality issues in the San Joaquin Valley in the UN Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mission to the United States of America (2011).

The County is working with the recently formed Yettem-Seville Community Services District (CSD) to transfer ownership and control of the new system, along with the County’s water system in Yettem, to the CSD in the near future.

Seville’s replacement water system construction was funded by a grant from the State Water Resources Control Board and the connections were funded by Self-Help Enterprises and Community Services Employment Training (CSET). The project was designed by Provost and Pritchard Consulting Group and the general contractor was Brough Construction, Inc.

Health officials say hand washing is key to avoiding the novel coronavirus, but millions of homeless people continue to have little or no access to hygiene stations.

The sun was just beginning to rise over Peoria, Illinois, when construction workers showed up at their job site and began ordering people camping on the lot to get up and move. In the early morning chill, some of the campers—virtually all of them elderly and coping with chronic pain and mobility issues—struggled to get going. This was not the first time they had been displaced from their makeshift encampment, but it was a surprise to be ushered out so suddenly in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It didn’t just mean the loss of a rare patch of relative shelter; it also meant that, once again, they would have no nearby access to toilet and hand-cleansing facilities.

When Chris Schaffner, program director at JOLT Harm Reduction, made his routine morning drive-by on May 19, he found the campers gathered across from the construction site, next to a set of portable toilets and a hand-sanitizing station that his organization had worked with the city to secure after the novel coronavirus caused public facilities and businesses to close. It was no accident that the toilets were directly across the street from the newly displaced encampment.

“I advocated for them specifically because they have limited mobility, so we wanted one close to where they were at for that very reason,” lamented Schaffner.

There are four bathrooms and two hand-sanitizing stations total, at two downtown locations. They don’t use water, just alcohol-based sanitizing gel—JOLT tries to make up for that by bringing jugs of water and hand soap when the organization does harm reduction outreach at the encampments—but they give Peoria’s homeless population a measure of cleanliness and privacy.

“When our government implemented shelter-in-place protocols throughout the state … people living on the streets had every bathroom they were able to use previously just taken away from them,” recalls Schaffner. Not only were they forced to relieve themselves outdoors, they also had no way to keep themselves clean or wash their hands—an essential component of basic hygiene now even more crucial in the context of a viral pandemic.

Across the nation, with many businesses and nonprofits still closed to foot traffic even as states loosen restrictions, people without homes are left with few options for staying clean.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance on how to address some of the unique risks that come with being homeless during the pandemic, including lack of access to hygiene facilities. The agency recommends a “whole community” approach that utilizes collaboration between the full spectrum of providers, including law enforcement, health departments and other government agencies, and outreach teams and people experiencing homelessness themselves.

Some metropolitan areas have taken those recommendations to heart, like Seattle, which has the third largest homeless population in the United States. There, various city and county offices, such as Seattle Public Utilities and Public Health Seattle & King County, have teamed together to operate a variety of hygiene stations. These include two hygiene trailers equipped with showers, and strategically placed hand-washing stations that are operational near known encampments every day from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

“There’s definitely a need for sanitary systems, [there’s] not enough sinks, and not enough bathrooms,” said Shilo Jama, executive director of the People’s Harm Reduction Alliance (PHRA), a drug user-led syringe distribution service headquartered in Seattle. “We have a hepatitis A outbreak that is pretty bad in the city, and that’s partly because of the [lack of] sanitary systems.”

In addition to its regular services, PHRA has been operating a portable hand-washing station during its open hours. ROOTS Young Adult Shelter, in conjunction with the University of Washington, also installed a hand-washing station in the same alleyway where PHRA operates, near the university’s main campus. Jama described other community hygiene efforts, such as a local business owner producing and dispensing hand sanitizer, and free hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations offered weekly by Public Health Seattle & King County at PHRA.

“My community … wouldn’t make it without everyone involved,” Jama said. “That includes the shop owners, that includes residents, that includes homeless community members, everyone.”

A smattering of cities across the U.S. report similar endeavors. Denver and San Francisco, for example, implemented public hand-washing facilities in collaboration with community organizations that serve high-risk populations. But many parts of the country lack a holistic, targeted response to address hygiene among people experiencing homelessness.

“The homeless situation as far as showers are slim to none, the portable toilets around the city are slim to none. These are all essential things people need,” said Hiawatha Collins, harm reduction community mobilization coordinator at the Harm Reduction Coalition in New York. New York City has the highest number of homeless people in the country; although some shelters have remained open, many drop-in centers where people can take showers and rest have been forced to close.

Some communities have decided to stop waiting for government action. Devin Ceartas, a mutual aid organizer in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, teamed with other community members he knew from past mutual aid projects to build and distribute simple but functional makeshift hand-washing stations throughout Chapel Hill and the neighboring towns of Durham and Carrboro. Unlike Peoria’s city-funded efforts, these home-crafted units use soap and water, which volunteers refill once an alert is posted on a website that Ceartas built to track the units. Overall, he says the stations have been well-received, though a couple have gone missing. One was even called in to the police as a bomb scare, Ceartas recalled with a chuckle—but besides those few hiccups, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

“If washing your hands is the most important thing to do right now and you don’t have a place with running water, that’s going to be an issue” Ceartas said. “Any time we see people on the streets, they are very thankful for [the hand-washing stations]. They all agree it’s a good idea.”

In Peoria, Schaffner says members of the displaced encampment have not yet found a suitable location to replace the site they lost, and that virtually no other options exist near the downtown area.

“The options are limited, and will push them farther from the public restrooms,” he said. “They will likely end up in a small encampment farther out, that will very rapidly become unsanitary, risking a hep A outbreak again, which is why we fought to get those toilets up to begin with.”","Lack Of Access To Clean Water Is Putting Homeless People At Risk Even As Cities Reopen Amid COVID-19Health officials say hand washing is key to avoiding the novel coronavirus, but millions of homeless people continue to have little or no access to hygiene stations.

Fifteen years ago he set himself the significant task of combatting world poverty and poor sanitation, having witnessed its effects first hand when filming. Tirelessly campaigning for the provision of clean water and economic empowerment, since 2009, without further ado, roll out the red carpet it’s Matt Damon!

What prompted you to first get involved with this environmental cause/charity/foundation?

As I researched the world’s most pressing issues, I recognised access to water and sanitation is the solution to a lot of the issues. Without water or toilets, people have no way out of poverty and some of the world’s largest issues can’t be solved—with them, lives, communities, and economies are changed. While I was filming a movie in Sub-Saharan Africa, I spent time with families in a Zambian village. They lacked access to water and toilets. Seeing their daily struggles to find water or a place to go really inspired my passion for, and commitment to, helping solve the global water crisis through my work at Water.org.

What are its current goals and current project?

Water.org has reached more than 25 million people with access to safe water and sanitation, and we’re not stopping. Our goal is to continue to increase financing for water and toilets so more people in need can get the safe water and sanitation solutions they need—bringing the world closer to achieving the global goal of safe water and sanitation for all by 2030.

What is the worst thing you have witnessed as an environmental activist/ambassador?

About six years ago I was in Haiti. I met a 13-year-old girl who spent 3 to 4 hours of her day collecting water for her family because they didn’t have access to water at home. Kids like her, shouldn’t be burdened with these things. They should be playing and in school, not walking so far to find and carry heavy vessels of water from rivers or ponds.

…and the most hopeful or best?

So, that same girl has access to water now. Through some of our early work at Water.org her family got access to water at home. When I asked her what she would do now that she doesn’t have to collect water every day she said, “I will play.” That was a pretty powerful moment for me because she gets to be a kid now, she gets to play. This is the result of our work–access to water empowers kids and their families with health, hope, and opportunity.

How do you think the conversation around environmental issues has changed in recent years?

I think the world is waking up. I think we have more work to do, and when it comes to things like access to water and improved sanitation for people living in poverty, we’re having important conversations with global leaders on how we’re going to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6. This goal calls for universal access to water and sanitation. According to the latest development reports, the world is not on track to achieve the goal. It will cost approximately $114 billion a year between now and 2030 to get there. The amount needed is three times more than what is currently being applied to solve the water crisis. This is where Water. org comes in. We have a solution that addresses the gap in financing. Through access to affordable financing, we can empower millions in need with safe water and sanitation.

If you were “president of the earth”, what laws or amendments would you enforce to make the planet a better place to live in?

I think breaking the cycle of poverty for people around the world starts with access to safe water. Without it, people can’t survive. So, if I were “president of the earth” I’d make affordable access to safe water for all the priority.

Bulehora - For many people, accessing clean water is as simple as walking to the tap and turning the knob. Yet for the thousands of people living in Kercha district in Ethiopia, some 410 kilometers from the capital Addis Ababa, it is never that easy. Following the breakdown of their water pumps two years ago, people in this community have been collecting water from unimproved sources.

With no other means of collecting safe water, people have been gathering water from a dirty pond, the same source used by domestic animals. This has posed a serious health risk to the community, that of waterborne diseases.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, the lack of clean and safe water sources and hygiene facilities poses an even greater health risk for communities. Ethiopia has confirmed more than 730 COVID-19 cases thus far.

IOM is strengthening its support to vulnerable communities in Ethiopia, ensuring they have access to clean water and improved hygiene services in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Since the emergence of the disease, the Organization has also provided hygiene promotion trainings to 113 community hygiene promoters and reached more than 1,000 people. IOM has also continued the distribution of soap to sites in East Hararge.

The rehabilitation of the water pumps which were carried out by IOM before the spread of COVID-19 has come as a welcome relief for the people of Kercha. It has been six months since the water pumps were brought back to life, yet the community’s sense of relief and joy remains fresh. Children now happily bring their scuffed-up jerry cans and wait for their turn for clean water at the pump.

This water source is one of the main sources of protection as clean water is essential for implementing COVID-19 basic prevention measures, such as proper and frequent handwashing.

Ture, 65, was born and raised in Boretu Hirba town in Kercha district. He explained how happy the community is now that they can access clean water.

“Things were very difficult. The water was dirty; our family was getting sick from drinking unsafe water and people had to take long trips just to fetch water,” said Ture.

“It was upsetting to find the water in the pond muddied by people washing clothes, or by children playing in it, making it unhealthy to drink,” added 60-year-old Shitaye.

“If we were lucky, we found the water less contaminated and used filters made of cloth to sift out the dirt while filling up our jerry cans, before the one and a half hour walk uphill,” she said.

IOM rehabilitated the water pumps located on a higher plateau in Kercha district after consultations with the community and the regional administration.

“We are glad that this pump is working again,” Ture explains. He, however, expresses concern over the high number of people who depend on the pump as their only source of clean water, suggesting the need for more pumps.

Representatives from the community have since been trained on how to use and take care of the pump.

Water for all in Kercha

Additionally, IOM is also constructing a large-scale water system in Kercha district.

Now nearing completion, this project includes a capping of a three-eye spring, collection chamber, water reservoir, water supply pipes and several tap stands for easy access to water for the community.

This project will significantly increase access to safe water in the community, ultimately reducing the risk of communicable diseases as well as the spread of COVID-19.

After consulting the community on their needs in 2019, IOM Ethiopia commenced work on increasing the water supply. Ayele Tadesse, the Kercha District Water Expert, says that the water from the spring will be a game changer for the town.

“The water yield was around 1.5 liters per second, which was simply not enough for the community of over 5,000 individuals”. He explained how the increase yield of 2.4 liters per second significantly improved the water supply.

Reviving a health post to its full glory

In remote districts such as Kercha, the availability of health posts to the community is critical.

IOM has begun to rehabilitate seven health post in the district. It is also building latrine facilities in six schools. With robust rainwater drainage, concrete sidewalks and plastered walls, the renovated health posts at Kercha will serve some 300 people in the community for years to come.

“The walls of the health post had collapsed, it had stopped to function, and the latrines were no longer accessible,” Hirba Hituke, the Kercha District Health Post Manager explains.

“In addition to the health post, we have a large water tank where community members come to wash their clothes, so there are other benefits the community is now enjoying,” He added.

Handwashing for Health

As part of IOM’s effort to help prevent the spread of diseases and to generally encourage healthy communities, the Organization provides soap and teaches communities techniques for effective handwashing.

“In providing these awareness-raising sessions, as well as the soap distributions, we are helping the community to understand simple ways they can protect themselves from diseases,” explains Hana Abebe, IOM Ethiopia’s WASH Project Assistant at Bulehora. “In 2019 we provided 50,000 bars of soaps and hygiene training sessions to over 600,000 individuals,” she adds.

In the face of COVID-19 emergency, water facilities that provide at-risk communities with clean water and sanitary hygiene services are making a life-saving impact by keeping hundreds of thousands of people safe and healthy.

The project was made possible through the financial contributions from ECHO, OFDA and JSB.","By Alemayehu SeifeselassieBulehora - For many people, accessing clean water is as simple as walking to the tap and turning the knob.

This novel virus has brought our inalienable right to clean water – one of the human rights enshrined in our Constitution – into sharp focus.

As I pursue my royal duties of community development to create jobs and eradicate poverty, the dreadful water situation in many rural communities tears my heart apart. Women bear the brunt of it all as our mothers, grandmothers and daughters must often fetch water from the rivers.

The risks of exposure to Covid-19 are so real, as limited access to water impedes our ability to comply with good hygiene and social distancing regulations.

Let us imagine the anguish of women and children in Ximausa village, outside Giyani in Limpopo, trying to maintain social distancing as they wait for their turn to fetch water from the river.

On top of this, the long walks undertaken by women and children to fetch water also make them vulnerable to rapists and murderers.

The ANC government has been making election promises to provide clean water and sanitation to households for nearly three decades.

But, for tens of thousands of people in villages across the country, the situation remains the same.

To overcome the Covid-19 pandemic, it is important that government prioritise the provision of water and sanitation to its most vulnerable citizens Livhuwani Matsila

State-built pipelines carrying water from our own dams and rivers to affluent areas run past our dry villages.

Our calls for government to connect rural households to the water supply grid have been in vain.



It is very sad that the main obstacles to the supply of clean water and sanitation services to our communities are corruption and incompetence.

The high levels of these vices in government have, especially during the past decade, surpassed epidemic proportions.

The water reticulation project in Giyani is a heart-breaking example of a promising project that collapsed due to the looting of funds.

Here at home in my village Ha-Matsila, there are several water projects that have been abandoned and their funding is unaccounted for.

Our pleas to government authorities for the revival and completion of these projects have fallen on deaf ears.

President Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration inherited an enormous backlog on water and sanitation infrastructure from its predecessor.

The state capture project of the past decade crippled the department of water and sanitation, which was left literally in disarray and dysfunctional.

To ensure the speedy delivery of water to poor communities, the president should urgently tackle the rot and capacitate this ailing department.

The knee-jerk reaction of providing water in tankers to communities, in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, is simply not enough.

The deployment of tankers should never be celebrated because it is not a decent way to supply water to the people.

The millions of rands spent on water tankers could have been used to fix the dilapidated water infrastructure in rural areas.

We cannot afford to relegate a precious resource and right such as water to an afterthought during this national health crisis.

The president’s Khawuleza model should come to our rescue. We can no longer stand the indignity of sharing water with domestic and wild animals.

Globally, 46% of schools don’t have hand-washing facilities with water and soap.

Germs, as we have come to appreciate so painfully during the current pandemic, respect no borders. A bug in China or Italy can circle the globe in no time, especially if billions of people can’t even wash their hands.

Editorials

Public health professionals tell us to wash our hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. But how do you do that when your tap regularly runs dry or indoor plumbing is a pipe dream? Only 5% of the people in Rwanda, for example, have access to hand-washing facilities with soap and water.

Around the globe, efforts are being made to address the problem. Cities that can’t supply clean water to all residents in their homes are installing portable hand-washing stations in public places. Governments are trucking water into slums. Soap and water is being placed outside businesses and apartment buildings.

But those are short-term and fragmented solutions. They fall far short of the global need.

Making clean water more widely and permanently accessible to all people, a campaign of the World Bank since 2017, begins with more aggressive efforts by every nation to stop polluting water. This includes in the United States, where the Clean Water Act has been under assault by the Trump administration.

The world must also ramp up its investments in water supply and sanitation. The World Research Institute estimates that spending a little more than 1% of the global Gross Domestic Product could provide clean water security for everyone by 2030.

We can invest more now or pay more later. COVID-19 is devastating national economies and future pandemics would do so as well.

The world has to get smarter about how much potable water is used for industry and agriculture. And we must protect and expand wetlands and forested areas in watersheds and floodplains, which retain clean water.

In a world of haves and have-nots, getting clean water to every human being would seem to be a global moral responsibility.

But as COVID-19 has taught us, it would be no act of charity.

Africa will need to prioritize on access to clean water after COVID-19, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the importance of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in its interim emergency guidance.

One of the main steps put in place by The World Health Organization (WHO) to help curb the spread of the corona virus is washing hands with soap and clean-running water yet in Sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 63% of populations in town areas find it challenging to access basic water services.

Hence, many cannot wash their hands regularly as required, further, an estimated 70% to 80% of the region’s diseases like typhoid, cholera and dysentery are attributed to unavailability of clean water; this is according to a recent report by WHO and UNICEF.

In recent years, most African cities have had to take drastic measures to help reduce the frequent water shortages experienced in their regions.

A good example is Cape Town’s extraordinary water shortage in 2018 where South African authorities avoided disaster by a flicker by rationing drinking water to 50 liters per inhabitant per day in a city that was used to consuming lots of water.

RELATED:

In the same year, Bouaké in Côte d’Ivoire received emergency financing of US$8.5 million from the World Bank to cope with a serious water shortage. As a result, two compact water treatment plants and 20 new wells were constructed , 82 hand pumps in the villages were rehabilitated which has helped connect to the city’s water system, and frequent distribution of safe water by water tankers.

Strategies to be put in place

Rapid strategies should be put in place by African governments that will ensure availability of clean water, sanitation and hygiene services for all citizens both in urban and rural areas.

Also, the governments should guarantee the financial viability of water utilities: According to a recent World Bank study on the performance of water supply services in Africa, it revealed that half of the region’s utilities do not have the revenues to cover their operation and maintenance costs, therefore leading to immense water shortages.

Most African countries should urgently build up the operational capacities of both public and private utilities to be able to supply clean water adequately. However, they need to do this at an acceptable tariff while remaining financially viable.","One of the main steps put in place by The World Health Organization (WHO) to help curb the spread of the corona virus is washing hands with soap and clean-running waterAfrica will need to prioritize on access to clean water after COVID-19, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the importance of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in its interim emergency guidance.

215,https://www.ctinsider.com/news/ctpost/article/Shelton-students-bringing-clean-water-to-South-15259115.php,"Mon, 11 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CT Insider,Shelton students bringing clean water to South Sudan,"SHELTON — City students have taken charity to a lifesaving level.

Some 180 students in the Shelton Intermediate School’s School of Innovation spent the past couple years raising about $20,000 to help create two wells in South Sudan, Africa, bringing much-needed clean drinking water to the region.

“These kids are truly inspiring,” said SIS seventh grade language arts teacher Penny Zhitomi, who organized the fund-raising efforts.

The SIS students donated the money to Water for South Sudan, a nonprofit organization dedicated to delivering direct, sustainable quality-of-life service to the people of South Sudan by providing access to clean, safe water and improving hygiene and sanitation practices.

Water for South Sudan was founded by former “Lost Boy” of Sudan Salva Dut in 2003 in Rochester, N.Y. Rochester continues to serve as the administrative headquarters. The Operations Center in Wau, South Sudan, is where the local team directs the water, sanitation, and hygiene programs.

“The kids really had a true sense of accomplishment … you can see it in their eyes, they just light up when they know they are really making a difference in someone’s life,” said Zhitomi, an ambassador with Water for South Sudan.

“These kids are making someone’s life better,” added Zhitomi. “You can’t ask for more than that as a teacher. It is an awesome feeling.”

Zhitomi and her family learned firsthand of the desperate need for clean water in 2013 during a trip to Tanzania, Africa. In all, the Zhitomis have vacationed in all 50 U.S. states and five of the seven continents over the years, and she said part of their trips always include volunteering for at least one day.

In Tanzania, the family volunteered at a school.

“We, as a family, were so shocked,” said Zhitomi. “There was no running water. The bathroom was literally a hole in the ground, and the people were drinking from a dirty trough. It was an eye-opener as a human being.”

When she returned, Zhitomi said she had a desire to help and get her students involved. Initially, she helped organize a school supply collection, all of which was sent to the school at which the family volunteered.

“That was great, but that did not hit the right note,” she said. “They needed more. They needed water.”

While reading the book “A Long Walk to Water” with her students, they were all introduced to the story of Dut, founder of Water for South Sudan. That was the spark that led to the fund raising for the class’s water project.

The fund raising began in 2017, when Zhitomi, then a teacher with the School of Innovation, was asked to find a major project for the students in the newly formed school to undertake. Knowing the desperate need for clean, drinkable water in South Sudan, she felt raising money for wells was the answer.

Students started raising money in 2017. One student created his own lollipop business, another family rented the Shelton Community Center for a charity basketball game while others donated money from recycling returns or babysitting jobs.

Zhitomi said the students raised $15,000 for the first well, which was dug and operational in March 2019 in the village of Aguath in Pankot, Manlor, South Sudan. In turn, Shelton Intermediate School joined dozens of other charitable schools throughout the country in earning the moniker “Iron Giraffe School.”

With the initial success, Zhitomi said SIS continued its effort, this time outside the School of Innovation, raising another $5,000 thanks in large part to a walk-a-thon held last spring. The latest round of fund raising was about to begin when the pandemic shuttered schools and eliminated such activities.

But SIS still helped, said Zhitomi, as Water for South Sudan took the $5,000 from SIS and combined that with other Iron Giraffe Schools to create a pool of $15,000 to build a well in the village of Panyuon in Aguok-North County, Gogrial State.

“This really showed them that they can make a difference,” said Zhitomi. “I think we underestimate young people at times. Some think all they want is to text or play video games. But so many care, and want to make a difference. These kids are saving the lives of people they will probably never meet.”

By Gabriel Ewepu – Abuja

A humanitarian organization, WaterAid Nigeria, Friday, warned that without access to clean water and hygiene practices Nigeria cannot defeat the deadly Coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic.

This was the position of the organization in a press statement made available to Saturday Vanguard, where it pointed out that frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water to halt the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that are well known remains one of the best preventive measures, yet many Nigerians are without these basic life-saving services, which 60 million Nigerians are without access to basic water supply and 150 million without access to handwashing facilities with soap and water.

It said: “The importance and effectiveness of frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water to halt the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases are well known, yet many in Nigeria remain without these basic life-saving services – 60 million without access to basic water supply and 150 million without access to handwashing facilities with soap and water.

“Handwashing with soap and clean water is one of the simplest and most cost-effective public health interventions and the first line of defense against the spread of diseases such as COVID-19. Much of the challenge of poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is experienced in the rural, small towns and urban slum areas of Nigeria and also among the poorest households and vulnerable and marginalised populations irrespective of locations.”

Meanwhile, the organization clearly stated that despite measures put in place to contain spread of the deadly virus there is no indication of it abating based on several factors.

“In spite of the measures put in place to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria, there are no indications that the spread of the disease is abating. On the contrary, Nigeria is now experiencing massive community transmission of the disease.

“The inadequacy of palliatives provided to address the harsh economic reality of the pandemic, a lack of facilities and supplies for taking the necessary preventive hygiene measures and the apparent lack of compliance with hygiene and social distancing guidelines by many citizens stress the need for Nigeria to have a more holistic and coordinated approach to curtailing the spread of this disease”, it pointed out.

The organization also strongly urged the government to respond rapidly with WASH approach to curtail the spread of the virus without further delay.

`“Clean water, decent sanitation facilities, and good hygiene practices are an indispensable element in the fight to prevent the spread of the pandemic and the foundation that underpins almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly health.

“Therefore, in the face of this pandemic, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) response is a healthy response. Strong health systems need strong WASH systems. We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to ensure representation from the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in its national response and on the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19.

“The Federal Government must also take urgent steps to fast-track the implementation of activities laid out in the National WASH Action Plan, leveraging on the Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet campaign to drive and champion key hygiene behaviours crucial to halting the spread of COVID-19.

“Statistics show that only five per cent of healthcare institutions in Nigeria have access to combined water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. We are calling on the government at all levels to ensure that all isolation, testing, and treatment centres have safely managed, reliable, and inclusive water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities to meet workers’ and patients’ needs in the fight against the pandemic.

“Urgent steps must also be made to ensure that all healthcare facilities across the country are provided with inclusive, equitable water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities.”

According to it the wealthiest households are more than ten times more likely to have access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene services than the poorest households; Only eight per cent of those in the rural areas have access to complete basic water, sanitation and hygiene services – compared to 18 per cent of people in urban areas; and millions in Nigeria, including about half of all rural dwellers, have to trek long distances and spend more than 30 minutes to get water and usually from unimproved sources.

The organization also added that “It is critical that interventions curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic reach everyone, everywhere and we leave no one behind.”

A 2018 report by NITI Aayog also predicted similar results, with a total of 21 major cities poised to run out of groundwater by the following year. And, in 2019, Chennai city did. India’s groundwater, which makes up for 40 percent of the country’s water supply, has been depleting for years.

In June 2019, the Central Water Commission noted that two-thirds of India’s reservoirs were running below normal levels.

In Karnataka, the drinking water crisis is acute with reserves drying out and people crippled by the shortage of water and unsafe drinking water.

In 2010, homemaker-turned-social entrepreneur Chinnmaye Praveen, aware of difficulties in accessing clean water, started a social initiative to provide free drinking water to underprivileged people.

Chinnmaye Praveen, founder of GeWinn Wachstum.

Later, she converted the initiative to a social enterprise GeWinn Wachstum (meaning ‘grow exponentially’ in German). Her venture has installed over 900 drinking water dispensing ATMs in over 14 districts of Karnataka to date. The ATMs provide safe mineral drinking water at affordable prices — Rs 5 for 25 litres of water.

""Business is not my cup of tea, I was always interested in social activity and social service. Seeing that people were not getting drinking water, which is a basic human right, we decided to pool in our resources with my husband also helping with financial requirements, and we started the social enterprise,” says 40-year-old Chinnmaye.

The water ATMs deploy a seven-stage filtration system, which also includes UV filtration. GeWinn Wachstum’s machines are manufactured at a plant in Pune with whom Chinnmaye has a joint venture. She imports the filtration membrane from Germany, which is why the venture has a German name.

Providing employment to the needy

The Bengaluru-based startup also converts littered and dumped areas to resourceful places by converting them into water points. Chinnmaye has been actively providing employment to women to help them secure financial independence, integrity to uneducated youth, and dignity of work to physically challenged individuals – who comprise three percent of the company’s employees.

Women make up more than 33 percent of the enterprise’s workforce. In Harihar and Rayavellore district, the ATMs are run, operated, and maintained by all-women teams. The startup provides employment to nearly 160 people, who have become breadwinners for their families.

Helping improve health

The World Bank estimates that 21 percent of communicable diseases in India are linked to unsafe water and the lack of hygiene practices. Further, more than 500 children under the age of five die each day from diarrhoea in India alone.

Chinnmaye says that the water ATMs have led to a gradual improvement in health in the communities. She claims that there has at least been a 10 percent increase in health levels in these districts.

“They were badly hit by ill-health. They cannot afford Rs 60-70 per can of water every day. In the last four to five years, people have transitioned to using this water, not just for drinking, but cooking purposes also,” she adds.

Earlier, the water from the ATMs was just given to children. Now, it is used by every member of the family and has improved hygienic practices in all of the household, says Chinnmaye.

To make people respect the water and understand its importance, Chinnmaye has conducted water conservation campaigns with kids and in rural communities through her NGO Vistara Foundation, which helps bring back dropped students to schools.

Through CSR initiatives, the startup has also donated water ATMs to government schools, religious places of worship, and places severely affected by the water crisis.

COVID-19 relief work

Aware of the impact of the scarcity of drinking water on people’s lives, Chinnmaye decided to keep all water ATMs running 24x7 during the lockdown. Water at the ATMs is dispensed for free every Wednesday during the lockdown period.

She has taken up the responsibility of providing safe measures — gloves, masks, and sanitation kits — for all her employees and their families. These supplies are replenished every fortnight.

Through the foundation, Chinnmaye has also been providing food packets and food kits to needy families.

Facing crises head on

Chinnmaye has been tackling more than just the water crisis. Initially, it was difficult for her to gain the trust of the government to provide her tenders.

“My first rejection was my lowest low. I had approached MLAs and MPs in a forum, and I was not given an opportunity. The government did not readily accept the initiative with me being a single founder and a woman,” she recalls.

But, Chinnmaye is testament to the saying, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.” She set out to prove her model and deployed it in various communities. After a successful demonstration, her work was accepted.

She believes that hard work, work efficiency, and proficiency were instrumental to her success. Her work has been recognised by many and she has received over 25 awards and accolades.

Speaking about her journey, Chinnmaye says, “More than others believing in me, I should believe in me — this is the greatest lesson I have learnt. Don't lend your ears to rejection, follow your gut feeling, and you will get the results. Don’t let gender parity stop you; you can prove yourself with your work.”

Every summer, the water crisis deepens and the foundation installs at least 10-12 new plants. But this year, the lockdown has stalled the installation of new water ATMs.

Now, the startup is working to bring to the market an alkaline water purification system. It is also planning to start mobile water ATMs to tackle space crunch and provide water to slums and areas that face water scarcity. It also hopes to upgrade all of its ATMs to AI systems in the near future.","In Karnataka, the drinking water crisis is acute with reserves drying out and people crippled by the shortage of water and unsafe drinking water.

Read Part One

This week, a fellow member of the San Juan Water Conservancy District board emailed a link to an article by writer Gary Pitzer published in Western Water magazine (republished by Water Education Foundation).

The article title:

Questions Simmer About Lake Powell’s Future As Drought, Climate Change Point To A Drier Colorado River Basin

The article repeats an as-yet-unproven theory that 1) the American West is entering a long-term ‘megadrought’ and 2) ‘climate change’ will necessarily mean less water in the Colorado River and other western rivers.

The story also shares a wide range of views about what should be done with Lake Powell, if this ‘megadrought’ theory actually holds water.

Tear down the Glen Canyon Dam? Require Colorado and other ‘Upper Basin’ states to send additional water downstream to fill the struggling reservoir? Require California to stop using more than its share of Colorado River water?

We learn from the article that Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico use much less Colorado River water than the 7.5 million acre-feet they were allotted annually under the Colorado River Compact, the 1922 agreement adopted by the seven US states along the Colorado River. At the same time, California has been using more water than it was originally allocated. We might be tempted to blame the Los Angeles metro area for the excess diversions, but in fact, the lion’s share of water extracted by California goes to wealthy industrial farmers in the Imperial Valley east of Los Angeles.

Imperial Irrigation District receives 3.1 million acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River. The rest of California receives 1.3 million acre-feet. In other words, the 180,000 people in the Imperial Valley receive approximately 70% of California’s allocation of water from the Colorado River. The other 20 million-plus people in Southern California get about 30%.

This might remind us of the water situation in our own community of Pagosa Springs, where it appears that 399 farms and ranches account for 94 percent of the total water usage in the county, while the residential population of 13,500 uses the other 6 percent.

To judge by news articles I’ve come across, California’s Imperial Irrigation District is a political sacred cow. No one in a political leadership position seems courageous enough to challenge the valley’s right to massive diversions from the Colorado River — even as we’ve watched Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the American West’s two largest water reservoirs, slowly drained to half their capacity.

On a smaller scale, the agricultural water users in Archuleta County — many of them holding ‘senior water rights’ — have been essentially left out of every water supply discussion I’ve reported on since I started writing for the Daily Post in 2004.

On a smaller scale, you could say Archuleta County agricultural industry has been treated like a political sacred cow, in terms of water diversions.

A much, much smaller scale…

But while the Imperial Irrigation District reportedly generates an annual harvest of more than $2 billion, a US Department of Agriculture report from 2017 indicates that our local agriculture sector generates a net loss of -$2.1 million. In Region 9’s ‘Economic Snapshot 2020’ report, they estimated 413 people were employed in ‘Agriculture’ in Archuleta County. (Whether that includes people planting and harvesting marijuana, I cannot say.)

As I suggested in Part Four, many of the agricultural operations in Pagosa Springs depend upon ‘trophy ranches’ — property owners who contract with folks who maintain a herd of cattle, to arrange to have their ranches grazed for several weeks each year, and thereby allow the property owner to request an “agricultural” classification for their property, greatly reducing the amount of property tax owed by the ranch owner.

I have no data showing the amount of ‘senior water rights’ in use by these trophy ranches. It might be a significant number.

We also discussed previously that, regardless of the frightening ‘megadrought’ narrative we’ve been hearing from the water industry, the situation in Pagosa Springs — heading into June — is surprisingly normal, with all of our municipal reservoirs being full or nearly full, and plenty of water flowing down the San Juan River. Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District (PAWSD) recently supplied an assessment of the water available for treatment in our numerous storage reservoirs, when they are full:

The same PAWSD document stated:

In 2018, PAWSD produced 2,104 acre feet of water.

This 2,104 acre feet of treated drinking water serves maybe 75 percent of the homes and businesses in Archuleta County. Unfortunately, the PAWSD water system suffers from leaks and other issues, and loses a significant percentage of their treated water before it arrives at its final destination. A recent PAWSD document suggests that about 1,237 acre-feet of drinking water made it to customers’ homes and businesses in 2019 — suggesting that maybe 900 acre-feet per year, or around 40% of our treated water, is lost to leaks and other ‘non-revenue’ uses.

If we assume that PAWSD will never be able to fix their leaks, then we currently have about two years worth of water storage, even if not a single drop of rain or flake of snow fell for two years.

If PAWSD were able to completely eliminate ‘non-revenue’ water losses, then the District might have more than three years of water storage, assuming all reservoirs are full.

Certainly, a 50-year ‘megadrought’ would make those estimates meaningless… primarily because we would all change the way we think about water… and how it gets wasted… and how it gets taken for granted.

Might we also change the way we think about ‘senior water rights’ and ‘trophy ranches’…? But maybe we don’t need a ‘megadrought’ to start considering that question. Maybe we just need some courageous community leadership.","EDITORIAL: Clean Drinking Water, Considered, Part FiveRead Part OneThis week, a fellow member of the San Juan Water Conservancy District board emailed a link to an article by writer Gary Pitzer published in Western Water magazine (republished by Water Education Foundation).

222,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/coronavirus-best-way-to-clean-your-face-mask-cvd,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Geographic,Here's the best way to clean your face mask,"Wearing a mask in public once meant you were dressed for Halloween or to rob a bank. Yet in a few short months, because of COVID-19, this clothing item has evolved into everyday wear.

The World Health Organization recommends wearing a surgical mask—the type found in hospitals—if you feel ill or are caring for a sick person. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention go further and advise a cloth covering for anyone venturing into a crowded public place. Some people are exceeding those official guidelines and also wearing reusable or disposable gloves in public.

Experts warn, however, that misusing any of this protective gear could potentially expose you to just as many germs as you would contact without it—because the masks and gloves themselves collect viruses if they’re not cleaned or changed frequently, and because they may then contaminate your hands or things that you later touch without protection.

“When I see someone [wearing gloves] touching countertops and then digging in their purse, I think, Now they’ve created cross contamination and voided whatever protection they’re wearing,” says Jade Flinn, a nurse educator in the biocontainment unit at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

Social distancing and frequent handwashing remain the most valuable ways, experts say, to keep from spreading or being infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the global pandemic.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But if you do venture out wearing masks and gloves, here’s how to clean them, when to dispose of them, and why you ultimately shouldn’t fear harboring the virus on the rest of your clothes.

How to clean a cloth mask

A standard laundry cycle is enough to wash the coronavirus off cloth, according to the WHO and CDC.

“Because it’s an enveloped virus, it’s really susceptible to detergents,” says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The envelope that encapsulates viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is a delicate layer of oily lipids and proteins, held together by surface tension.

Laundry detergents and soaps contain surfactants, chemicals that easily break that envelope apart by reducing surface tension, explains Joshua Santarpia, a pathologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. A surfactant molecule has one end that’s attracted to oil and grease, while the other is attracted to water. The oil-loving end wedges into the coronavirus’s envelope, busting it apart. The remnants get trapped in circular pods of surfactant called micelles and are washed away in water.

“The interaction of that surfactant with the viral envelope pretty quickly destroys the ability of that virus to be infective,” Santarpia says. Potent surfactants are found in most home and commercial cleaning products.

The water temperature in the washing machine doesn’t matter as long as you use detergent. “The masks made of cotton withstand higher temperatures, so if it makes you feel better to wash it at a higher temp, go ahead and do that,” Graham says. The high, concentrated heat from a dryer offers added protection: it’s enough to kill most microorganisms.

4:15

What if I’m wearing a surgical or N95 mask?

Unlike cloth coverings, medical masks intended for single use are made of non-woven synthetic fabrics that can’t withstand a typical laundry cycle.

“If you wash them it will do a lot of damage to their filtration capability,” Santarpia says. Out of necessity, healthcare workers have been reusing N95 respirators—the dome-shaped, tight-fitting masks that are the only verified way to efficiently filter small particles like viruses. The facilities where Flinn and Santarpia work use hospital-grade disinfectants that preserve the mask’s integrity through the cleaning process.

Santarpia’s Nebraska hospital is also sanitizing masks with UV-C, a high-energy type of ultraviolet light. That allows staff to re-wear masks a handful of times, Santarpia says. Because UV-C is considered more intense and more likely to cause cancer than UV-A and UV-B, this brand of sterilization should only be conducted under expert supervision by people trained in using UV-C light, according to the CDC.

For the general public, the bottom line is, you should ideally only wear medical masks once—and if you’re going to reuse them, set them aside between uses long enough for the virus to decay.

The take-home message is that the virus can remain infectious for several hours, potentially up to a few days, on various surfaces, including masks.

How long is that? Scientists are still unpacking exactly how long SARS-CoV-2 lasts on surfaces, in the air, and on masks. Preliminary evidence released late last month without peer-review found traces of the coronavirus persisted for considerable time on N95 respirators.

“The take-home message is that the virus can remain infectious for several hours, potentially up to a few days, on various surfaces, including masks,” says Amandine Gamble, one of the study’s authors and an infectious disease expert at the University of California Los Angeles. She suspects the coronavirus gets trapped within a mask’s fibers, which poses a hazard until the germ spontaneously degrades over time. For this reason, the CDC advises against wearing an N95 respirator for more than 8 hours total, and unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer, those face filters should be discarded after five reuses.

But even outside of hospitals, respirators that are reused repeatedly in public could collect virus over time and increase the wearer’s own chances of accidental exposure.

“The one important thing to keep in mind is that the probability of getting infected increases with the number of viral particles encountered,” she says. “It is not an on-off process, but a gradual one.”

Can you reuse and wash your gloves?

Public health organizations do not recommend wearing gloves of any kind to prevent contracting the coronavirus.

“As long as your skin is intact, it’s a very effective immune barrier,” says Graham, adding there’s also no evidence the coronavirus can squeeze through a cut and it doesn’t circulate well in the bloodstream.

However, if your worries override your desires to follow health guidelines and you feel the need for the extra layer of protection, be as careful as you would with ungloved hands. Limit the number of things you touch, and—as always—don’t touch your face.

4:24

“My concern is some people think they are protected” by gloves, says Jane Greatorex, a virologist at Cambridge University in the U.K. Gloves “need disposing of or washing in the same way you would your hands.”

The CDC provides step-by-step instructions for removing gloves and advises you to wash your hands after doing so.

“Single-use gloves aren’t really meant to be washed, and you’re much more likely to get a breach in your gloves,” says Santarpia. “People should focus much more on hand hygiene than glove wear.”

What about everything else I’m wearing?

Going to the grocery store doesn’t mean you have to throw away your clothes. That’s because enveloped viruses like the coronavirus don’t easily survive on porous surfaces such as cotton shirts, polyester blouses, and denim jeans.

Coronaviruses primarily spread in respiratory droplets, which are mostly water and keep the virus moist until it can reach another body. Given time—anywhere from a few days to a week—the viruses will decay by simply drying out, says Gerardo Lopez, a University of Arizona environmental microbiologist who has studied how viruses transmit from various surfaces.

Your regular clothes aren’t what

you should worry about.

With a germ that spreads as easily SARS-CoV-2, he says, it’s important to frequently clean anything—hands, masks, doorknobs, phones—that receives regular human contact. “Don’t underestimate the possibility of a virus staying on something,” Lopez adds.

But your regular clothes aren’t what you should worry about. When respiratory droplets land on a textile such as cotton, it absorbs some of the moisture, drying out the droplets and exposing the virus particles and their fragile envelopes to the air.

“The lipid layer on the outside is going to dry up, and the protein it needs to attach to receptors become inoperable,” says Lopez. The virus’s genetic material might be left behind, “but it's no longer really viable,” he adds. And your washing machine will take care of it.","Wearing a mask in public once meant you were dressed for Halloween or to rob a bank.
But if you do venture out wearing masks and gloves, here’s how to clean them, when to dispose of them, and why you ultimately shouldn’t fear harboring the virus on the rest of your clothes.

“Access to clean water and adequate sanitation is a fundamental human right. Protecting and preserving the water resources we share with others is therefore a major priority for us. We believe that proactive, long-term engagement and partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders can help to define, implement and evaluate solutions to the complex environmental challenges that we face,” stated Bruno Olierhoek, Chairman and Managing Director of Nestlé: East and Southern Africa Region.

The donation will not only assist the community with clean drinking water but will further assist with preventative hygiene measures such as regular washing of hands, as part of the interventions to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The food and manufacturing company’s relief efforts were applauded and welcomed by the leadership of the Mosel Bay Municipality.

“We as the Mossel Bay Municipality and the village of Herbertsdale want to thank Nestlé for always willing to assist in our communities in times of challenges,” said Harry Levendal, Mossel Bay Municipality Mayor. “By assisting us in delivering a most critical resource like clean water, with your milk tankers during this challenging COVID-19 period, just re-confirms that Nestlé is taking the communities at heart.”

Mossel Bay is subject to regular droughts and was declared a disaster area after one prolonged drought a few years back. “This drought impact then prompted us to remodel our Nestlé dairy factory which is located in this town, to become self-sufficient in water as much as possible by using water recovered from the milk evaporation process. The factory now has excellent, quality recycled-water and is even able to generate energy from the process,” concluded Olierhoek.

The water donation forms part of the company’s ongoing coronavirus relief efforts, which included last week’s monetary contributions of approximately R15 million to various funds across the region.","Johannesburg, 20 May 2020 – The community of Herbertsdale, a small village approximately 40km from Mossel Bay received over 200 000 litres of clean water from Nestlé to help improve their livelihoods.

Wochit

It's almost impossible to find a hotel that hasn't introduced a new sanitation program, promising its rooms are squeaky clean and will be coronavirus-free. How do you know if your hotel room is really clean?

""It's difficult to distinguish between legitimate cleaning efforts and public relations,"" says Sheryl Kline, a professor at the University of Delaware who has researched hotel hygiene. ""Anyone can do a visual inspection, and it can look clean. Just because it looks clean does not necessarily mean that it is clean.""

Hotels have standard room-cleaning practices, which have been upgraded since the pandemic. But there is no universally accepted way to clean a hotel guest room, says Kline.

""Typically, cleanliness is based on visual inspection. This provides an aesthetic evaluation but not an assessment of the possibility of microbial contamination,"" she adds.

That hasn't stopped the hotel industry from trying to set standards during the pandemic. Consulting experts, a visual inspection, and taking quick action if you're in a place that doesn't meet your expectation can ensure that you stay in a clean room.

Cleaning programs by hotel: Hotels, resorts announce new cleaning programs amid coronavirus

How do you stay safe?

Last month, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) introduced an industrywide program called Safe Stay, which created new hotel post-coronavirus safety standards. Safe Stay hotels have ""enhanced"" cleaning standards throughout the hotel, use cleaning products with a higher concentration of bacteria-killing ingredients and encourage their staff to practice social distancing. The initiative will ""ensure greater transparency and confidence"" for guests, according to Chip Rogers, president of AHLA.

But how do you know if your hotel room is actually clean? It's not that easy, say experts.

""There is no road map and, frankly, no 100% agreement on the science and health concerns,"" says Carolyn Richmond, a partner at Fox Rothschild's Hospitality Practice Group. ""While guests certainly want to see that cleaning policies and other protective measures have been taken, it has to be more than just window dressing.""

Many hotels are going beyond the new industry standards. For example, the Salishan Resort, a golf hotel on the Oregon coast, has introduced stringent new cleaning measures. They include new health screenings for employees and the installation of touchless processes to reduce direct interaction with guests whenever possible.

""We've even created fitness guest rooms with their own dedicated, sanitized Peloton and TRX workout equipment,"" says Ken Cruse, president of SCP Hotels, which owns the Salishan Resort.

How do you know the hotel room is virus-free?

But then how do you know if a hotel room is clean? You can ask an expert. Travel agents keep lists of the cleanest hotels, based on their inspections and familiarity with properties.

""Our agency has a list of preferred hotels in each city based on past cleanliness, current mandatory hygiene precautions and following updated virus regulations,"" says Sangeeta Sadarangani, CEO of Crossing, a multi-national travel agency headquartered in London.

For example, hotels that have already started accepting guests in Hong Kong are following a weekly deep-clean policy. They're using sanitizing sprays in the rooms. Restaurant staff use gloves and face masks, even when they aren't on duty. Linens and towels are changed daily.

Guests and experts also recommend that you read hotel reviews from a variety of sources, including travel review sites, blogs and social media. Don't limit yourself to just one source.

Here are the signs that your hotel room is clean

You can inspect the hotel room, too. That's what Chip Bell does when he checks into a hotel. He looks for signs that the cleaning crew has done a thorough job. Are water glasses sealed? Toilet seats strapped? Is the toilet paper folded to a ""V"" shape?

""I also look for accountability,"" says Bell, a customer service expert. ""Is the housekeeper's name obvious and in multiple places in the guest room?""

Finally, is there an obvious commitment to hygiene? Can you find hand sanitizers in the public restrooms? Are employees wearing face masks and practicing social distancing? Bell carries a supply of sanitizer, face masks and gloves, in case the answer is ""no.""

Of course, there's no way to tell if your hotel room is contaminated with coronavirus. Truth be told, it's hard reliably tell if you are, either. But just like with people, there are symptoms. If your room looks clean and smells clean, chances are it is.

And if you have doubts? Carry your own cleaners – or stay home.

How professional cleaners can tell if a hotel room is clean

Go to the bathroom. Always start with the bathroom, says Diana Rodriguez-Zaba, president of ServiceMaster Restoration by Zaba, a Chicago cleaning service company that specializes in hotels. ""Check around the toilet seat for noticeable grime and lift the seat to check for stains. Check the shower, paying close attention to the corners where gunk and mildew tend to accumulate. Can you spot any hair on the bathroom floor? That's usually a telltale sign the hotel isn't being kept in the cleanest condition,"" she says.

Look for the little things. Details matter, says Abe Navas, the general manager of Emily's Maids, a house cleaning service in Dallas. ""The basics are changing your sheets, dusting and general cleaning. Someone put in real effort when you see clean door handles and clean toilet buttons – the little details,"" he says. ""If your room doesn't have any smudges or fingerprint marks, this is the way to know if it's properly cleaned.""

Give it the sniff test. Navas has one final test. ""Smell,"" he says. ""There is a certain smell that is not a chemical scent, but rather a nice aroma that comes when your room is properly cleaned."" He says it shouldn't be a chemical smell. That means someone has carelessly overapplied bleach or cleaning solution, which could cause problems for you.

The sniff test works the other way around. When Valerie Smith smells smoke or mildew, she turns around and walks back to the front desk. ""I ask for another room,"" says Smith, a retired real estate agent from Shepherdstown, West Virginia ""This time, I inspect it before I accept it.""

And if it's also smelly? Now more than ever, it's time to check out and find another place to stay.

225,https://news.samsung.com/global/tips-for-keeping-your-smartphone-clean,"Tue, 12 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Samsung Global Newsroom,Tips for Keeping Your Smartphone Clean,"Just as thorough hand washing and other hygienic practices have become key aspects of our daily lives, keeping our smartphones clean should also form a key part of our self-sanitation routines given just how much we interact with our mobile devices.

So, how exactly can you continue to use your smartphone and stay hygienic? Read on for some suggestions as to how you can effectively and safely clean your smartphone.

Why Do You Need to Clean Your Smartphone?

According to a study by global consultancy firm Deloitte, American users view their smartphones around 14 billion times a day, with each individual user picking up their phone 52 times a day on average. As we enter a phase of telecommuting and remote communication, these numbers are only set to increase.

“Our studies show us that viruses can survive on plastic or metal surfaces for up to 2 or 3 days,” highlights Dr. Doo-Ryeon Chung, Director of Center for Infection Prevention and Control at Samsung Medical Center. “In order to use your smartphone safely, it is imperative that you keep your device clean.”

Best Practice Smartphone Hygiene

The first thing to remember when looking to keep your Galaxy device clean is not to use general cleaners, compressed air sprays or disinfectant and bleach-based products. While these might be useful in keeping communal spaces around the home hygienic, these solutions can peel off or damage the oleophobic coating layer over your smartphone’s display that shields the screen from fingerprint smudging.

In order to keep enjoying the best experience with your Galaxy smartphone after cleaning, be sure to fully power down your device and remove its case, cables and other accessories. Once you have done this, use a lint-free microfiber cloth to wipe down the exterior of the device.

If needed, you can use a small amount of distilled water or disinfectant, such as a hypochlorous acid-based (50-80ppm) or alcohol-based (over 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) product – but always apply these to your microfiber cloth, not directly to your phone, and be sure to avoid getting any liquid in your phone’s openings. Dampen your cloth with disinfectant and gently wipe the front and back of your device to cleanse it.

You can use the same methods as above for cleaning the watch face of your Galaxy Watch once you have removed its straps. While such disinfection methods should be avoided for leather or rubber surfaces, they are suitable for glass, ceramic and metal surfaces, such as the display of your Galaxy smartphone and the watch face of your Galaxy Watch.","Read on for some suggestions as to how you can effectively and safely clean your smartphone.

14 May 2020

While global travel markets continue to wrestle with the implications of COVID-19, one thing is becoming increasingly clear - the crisis will have a deep and lasting impact on the industry. How the industry evolves to address the situation and future-proof their marketing, distribution, and hotel management strategies remains to be seen. But change is imminent.

Health and safety will have a profound influence on the traveler psyche and is consequently what travelers will look for when booking a hotel. To sum up the importance of this dynamic, let's look at it this way. The marketing strategy for pre-COVID-19 travelers will not work for post-COVID-19 travelers. Moving forward, marketing cannot just be focused on groups like Baby Boomers, Millennials, or Gen Xers. Operating standards for safety, security, and cleanliness will be subject to new, elevated expectations, and marketing practices are going to have to change accordingly. First and foremost there will be a singular segment that blurs the lines between travelers and that's ""Generation Clean.""

As the market rebounds, hotels that best meet new guest expectations for meticulous standards of cleanliness—as highlighted during the shopping experience and evidenced during their stay—will be best positioned to take advantage of upcoming emerging demand.

Shopping Implications

The current crisis has brought with it a newfound understanding of how vulnerable we are in daily life. Even in an impersonal setting such as a grocery store, we now wear masks, wipe down carts and baskets, and maintain proper social distancing as much as possible.

So, in the context of a highly personal setting such as a hotel room, these concerns become greatly amplified, bringing up many questions in the minds of guests. Who last stayed in this space? When was the bedding last sterilized? Can I trust that the cleaning and sanitation safeguards referenced by the property have actually taken place?

These concerns will begin even before guests arrive on property. They will become a primary consideration in the shopping and booking process, necessitating a new approach to the way we visibly communicate, market, and implement expanded sanitation safeguards.

Cleaning vs. Disinfecting

When it comes to housekeeping, there's a difference between cleaning and disinfecting. Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. Disinfecting, on the other hand, works by using chemicals.

To determine if a product is effective against germs such as the ones that cause COVID-19, review the product label and ensure it states ""EPA-approved emerging viral pathogen claims,"" or search in the agency's registered product database. Disinfectants should be applied during routine cleaning of guestrooms, common areas, fitness facilities, outlets, and meeting rooms. To make the process easier, consider using equipment such as electrostatic sprayers, foggers, and misters to make sure hard to reach surfaces are not missed.

Linens, towels, and clothing may also become contaminated with the virus, so it is important to add disinfectant when washing laundry. Bed scarfs and bedspreads should be washed using the warmest water setting and dried completely.

Make sure your staff is supplied with proper personal protective equipment and following specified procedures to remain safe.

Actions to Increase Cleanliness Visibility

Scrupulous cleaning and disinfecting processes and procedures are of course vital to execute the new cleanliness standards that ""Generation Clean"" will come to value. But those cleanliness standards need to be made visible or they didn't even happen from the guest's perspective. To make the most out of your new cleanliness processes, ensure that you're making your standards clear at all customer touchpoints. This will act as both a potential differentiator against the competition and a value-added benefit for guests.

Make It Part of your Brand

Make cleanliness a part of your brand promise to deliver subconscious reassurance for shoppers that your property will be clean, safe, and secure. Whether full service, luxury, limited service, wellness - brands that incorporate this into their DNA will eventually become synonymous with the higher standard of safety, security, and cleanliness necessary to attract a new generation of loyal guests.

Create ""Cleanliness Theater""

Cleanliness theater refers to visible queues provided to on-property guests that demonstrate you take cleaning seriously. Feature prominent signage highlighting any associated materials or technologies (antimicrobial surfaces, air/water filtration, etc.), display cleaning or sanitation-related industry certificates or accreditations. Ensure housekeeping maintenance , F&B staff, and other relevant team members are constantly seen cleaning and wiping down door handles, countertops, floors, and surfaces in high traffic areas. After all, perception is reality. Reinforce the brand promise you make by consistently demonstrating your commitment to cleanliness in a visible manner. To learn more about cleanliness theater, we recommend this article from Larry Mogelonsky of Hotel Mogel Consulting Limited.

Communicate a Culture of Clean

Meeting the new expectations of ""Generation Clean"" begins long before your guest's arrival. In addition to making cleanliness part of your brand promise, you'll want to highlight your unique ""culture of clean"" by leveraging the capabilities of your central reservations system and booking engine to make your property attractive to shoppers.

Use social tags to call out special cleaning technologies. Capture images and videos that show your sanitation procedures in action, and position your property as safe, spotless, and germ-free.

In-room cleanliness or wellness-focused amenities will likely be well received in a more health-conscious era. This can easily be personalized, communicated, delivered, and automated with the help of customer relationship management (CRM) and service optimization solutions. Thoughtful in-room offerings can be translated into meaningful hands-off experiences, ensuring guests return to where their individual needs are known and met.

Don't forget to support cleanliness perception in guest communications post-booking. Leverage your CRM solution to ensure that your pre-stay, on-property, and post-stay communications acknowledge your cleanliness procedures and point towards any additional information guests may require. Include questions about the cleanliness of your property in post-stay surveys and ask guests to point out any areas that require improvement to help stay ahead of the concerns of ""Generation Clean"".

Here are some of them:

Fairmont Hotels in Canada Reopen With New Protocols

Fairmont Hotels & Resorts in Canada’s Western Mountain Region—Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper and Whistler— will reopen on June 1. This includes guest services, select F&B venues and golf courses, as well as limited spa services.

The new operational standards being implemented at Fairmont Banff Springs, Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge and Fairmont Chateau Whistler, and at Fairmont properties across North and Central America, were developed and vetted by a team of expert advisors to ensure maximum efficacy in preventing the spread of all viruses and pathogens, including COVID-19, with oversight by Bureau Veritas; Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security & fellow with the Infectious Diseases Society of America; and Ruth Petran, Ph.D., CFS, senior corporate scientist, Food Safety and Public Health, for Ecolab.

At each touchpoint along the guest journey through the hotel, extensive measures are being taken to protect guests and employees, including physical distancing; mandatory screening for all guests and employees, which may include a temperature check; masks provided to guests and worn by all employees; a 48-hour “settling period” for occupied rooms post-departure; increased frequency of cleaning and disinfecting, with a focus on high-touch points; and continued use of EPA registered disinfectant chemicals, proven effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Hands-on training for all employees, a dedicated on-property rollout committee and a formal audit program, validated under the global Allsafe Cleanliness label, ensure initial and continued compliance.

Columbia Hospitality Launches Columbia Clean

Columbia Hospitality Inc. has launched Columbia Clean, a new protocol for health, hygiene, safety and sanitation, developed with Ecolab.

Columbia Clean spans the company’s managed hotel properties, restaurants, golf courses, conference centers, distinctive venues and high-rise residential properties.

Banyan Tree Introduces SafeSanctuary

In preparation for the return of travel, Banyan Tree Group, in partnership with Bureau Veritas, is launching the SafeSanctuary program, an integrated health and well-being protocol, which will be rolled out progressively from June 2020 throughout all properties.

The SafeSanctuary Seal demonstrates the rigor of Protect, Provide and Prevent, to assure all guests and associates of the group’s enhanced health and safety measures at all guest touchpoints. This program has more than 40 areas of enhanced protocols, including screening procedures, hygiene stations, and redesigned processes throughout the guest and associate experience. Highlights include the following:

Protective assurance protocols: Rigorous cleaning and distancing protocols will be applied through the guest and associate journey, focusing on high-traffic public areas as well as high-touch areas in-room with EPA-approved and recommended cleaning agents. Appropriate distancing will be encouraged through signage and with ambassadors in public areas such as pools, lobbies, restaurants and other facilities. There will be limited capacity quotas in enclosed areas and for group activities. Guest amenities, linens and bedding are thoroughly steamed and arrive fully protected in-room.

Providing for Contactless Journeys: Going contactless as much as possible, in-room directories and restaurant menus will be replaced with digital options for access on personal devices. Check-in and checkout processes and experiences such as personal health and fitness classes, cooking sessions or well-being consultations may be conducted in-room.

By Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, Youba Sokona and Yacob Mulugetta

The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken governments and people across the globe. It has overwhelmed health systems and hurt the lives and livelihoods of those most vulnerable, destabilised financial markets, triggered crises in oil and energy markets, and caused major disruption to economic activities.

The impacts so far have been profound, yet for many countries and people the worst is still to come. At greatest risk are the poor and vulnerable, and countries with limited capabilities and resources.

The crisis has exposed the highly interconnected nature of our world and the importance of building more inclusive, resilient and equitable economies and societies.

With limited exceptions, the pandemic reveals that all countries – irrespective of wealth, capacity, technology or infrastructure – were completely unprepared to mount a swift and effective response of the scale needed.

There is no doubt that in the immediate term, the priority must remain controlling the outbreak, saving lives and limiting cascading adverse impacts.

As part of the response, governments, particularly those in wealthy countries (e.g. members of the G7 and G20), are also considering packages to stimulate the economy and enable recovery, with a view to longer-term economic prosperity.

Yet, in the least developed countries (LDCs), where the economy is dominated by the informal sector, responses will remain haphazard at best, with efforts only concentrated on how to manage the immediate risks created by the pandemic.

The Covid-19 pandemic teaches us several vital lessons and presents a possible path forward for more resilient and prosperous societies:

Most countries have not built adequate response strategies and systems to deal with global crises, and that capacity is lower in the least developed countries;

The vast amounts of government stimulus and recovering spending occurring as a result of the pandemic presents an opportunity for investment in new development courses that are truly people-centred and sustainable; and

For the poorest countries, recovery efforts will need to be complemented by coordinated global support, based on inclusivity and human solidarity.

These lessons, if taken on board, should improve health outcomes, while setting the stage for longer-term development that enables wellbeing for all.

An essential part of the response measures to the crisis is the fundamental question of energy as the critical enabler of development and good health. Shifting from dirty to clean energy is a vital step towards integrating health, energy, climate and other priorities. Pollution from fossil fuels kills millions and has worsened the effect of previous respiratory diseases. The health impacts of escalating climate heating are unimaginable.

The model of energy provision is key. Decentralised, demand-driven renewable energy can power rural and peri-urban health facilities and systems for sanitation and hygiene, and enable effective irrigation and farming everywhere. Better access to clean energy makes communities more resilient to health and other shocks, and is essential for economic development.

The LDCs are the 47 poorest countries in the world, and face significant structural challenges to sustainable development. In the context of the Paris Agreement, aligned with the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and their national development priorities, they are pioneering an approach to the energy transformation that can serve as a model for poorer and wealthier countries alike.

However, solidarity and adequate support will be required in enabling LDCs to bring this vision to life, to build a more resilient post-Covid-19 society.

Through their “Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative” (REEEI), the LDCs are calling for a more integrated approach to energy and development. The approach focuses on three main goals.

It calls for 100% access to sufficient, affordable, modern and clean energy by all citizens in LDCs by 2030, recognising that access to energy is a key to meeting all needs, including those relating to public health.

to sufficient, affordable, modern and clean energy by all citizens in LDCs by 2030, recognising that access to energy is a key to meeting all needs, including those relating to public health. Second, it seeks 100% electricity from renewable energy sources in all LDCs by 2050 latest, that caters to all needs of their citizens, social services and industries – focusing on low-carbon energy systems that are people-entered and help to curb climate change.

sources in all LDCs by 2050 latest, that caters to all needs of their citizens, social services and industries – focusing on low-carbon energy systems that are people-entered and help to curb climate change. And third, it demands 100% utilisation of energy efficiency potential through full implementation of best practice measures and planning by 2040. It reflects that saving energy saves money, and liberates both energy and funding for other important goals.

This approach, pioneered by the poorest countries, includes elements that could be emulated by other countries as part of their just recovery plans.

All countries must move as rapidly as possible away from centralised fossil fuel-based energy systems towards more decentralised 100% renewable energy if we are to have any chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C or 2C.

The renewable energy system of tomorrow can also support the development of healthier, more resilient, prosperous and equal societies. The LDC REEEI specifically outlines a vision not only of changing fuels, but of moving to new people-centred, smart, distributed and mainly decentralised energy systems.

Fortunately, sun and wind exist everywhere and most LDCs have an abundance of these and other renewable energy sources. Renewable energy can be harnessed by communities, cooperatives, small-sized farmers, households, schools, hospitals and companies of different sizes everywhere.

These systems allow many consumers to also become producers of energy. Small-scale farming – the backbone of LDC economies – can become more resilient through locally available and controlled energy that drives solar pumps for irrigation, powers refrigeration and enables processing and transportation to local markets.

Locally produced and controlled energy will ensure clean water, as well as functioning health clinics and schools. Decentralised systems enable people to work remotely, localise production and become more resilient – all essential protections against future pandemics.

The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated that decentralised energy systems have enabled the delivery of reliable services at local needs for social services as well as sustaining local economies.

Through the initiative LDCs can avoid the rich countries’ detour into heavily centralised and fossil fuel dependent energy systems. Rather, their “leapfrogging” directly to this new energy model gives them the benefit of the latecomer.

While LDCs can build appropriate infrastructure bottom-up, rich and wealthy countries must transform, retire and dismount much of their dead-end fossil fuel investments.

Importantly, for the poorest countries efforts to cope with and recover from the crisis should also align with priorities set out in international agreements such as the Istanbul Programme of Action, the UN Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Ultimately rich and poor countries will need to converge – both in terms of achieving zero-carbon energy systems, and in terms of highly unequal per capita energy use. This formidable human endeavour must be achieved on a short timeframe to avert climate crisis.

While the LDC REEEI framework outlines a genuinely LDC-initiated effort with our countries in the driving seat, its implementation can only succeed through genuine collaboration and international support. The approach outlines a model for driving targeted public investments, climate finance and economic recovery measures where LDCs define their destiny and visions but the wealthier countries contribute their fair share.

The current, intertwining crises of health, development and climate provide an opportunity for LDCs to take leadership to inspire both each other and the rest of the world. Just as some LDCs have already demonstrated, it is indeed possible to formulate and begin implementing alternative development trajectories that firmly prioritise happiness and sustainability squarely at the centre of policy-making.

The initial phase of the crisis already teaches us important lessons. It demonstrates that early and informed action by leaders can save lives, costs and impacts. It has disclosed that governments can take action at scale, that public resources can be mobilised, that behavioural change is possible, and that people will answer crises with solidarity.

Support on a massive scale is now required to enable the LDCs to grapple with the immediate Covid-19 crisis, while simultaneously planning for a longer-term recovery that eliminates poverty and builds more resilient low-carbon economies and societies.

Tosi Mpanu Mpanu is ambassador for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and political champion of the REEEI. Youba Sokona is a Malian professor of sustainable development at the South Centre and vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yacob Mulugetta is an Ethiopian professor of energy and development policy at University College London and an IPCC AR6 lead author.","Shifting from dirty to clean energy is a vital step towards integrating health, energy, climate and other priorities.
Through their “Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative” (REEEI), the LDCs are calling for a more integrated approach to energy and development.
Renewable energy can be harnessed by communities, cooperatives, small-sized farmers, households, schools, hospitals and companies of different sizes everywhere.
The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated that decentralised energy systems have enabled the delivery of reliable services at local needs for social services as well as sustaining local economies.

The company will supply franchisees and their employees with the tools they need to help Choice-branded hotels achieve superior levels of cleanliness and address health and safety concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitment to Clean leverages Choice’s long-standing relationship with Ecolab, an expert in water, hygiene and infection-prevention technologies and services; guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Travel Association; and Choice’s membership in the American Hotel & Lodging Association Safe Stay Advisory Council, to provide hotels with the latest resources and training. In addition, Choice developed the Commitment to Clean initiative with insights from its franchisee advisory councils, which represent its hotel owners across the country.

“The health and safety of our guests, franchisees and their employees is always top of mind for Choice,” said Patrick Pacious, president/CEO, Choice Hotels. “The Commitment to Clean initiative bolsters existing best practice guidance, with enhancements advanced throughout the COVID-19 crisis, as our franchisees continue to provide accommodations for thousands of first responders, and front-line and essential workers. As our nation starts to reopen and the public resumes travel, we want guests to know that Choice-branded hotels are prepared to welcome them back.”

The Commitment to Clean initiative builds on Choice Hotels’ long-standing cleanliness protocols and enhances the existing program with guidance developed in response to the pandemic, including recommendations related to deep cleaning, disinfecting, hygiene and social distancing best practices and protocols.

Ecolab is helping ensure the company has the right infection-prevention programs and training in place to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes a new online resource hub available to franchisees, featuring operational best practices, training and resources from Ecolab’s experts. Additionally, every Choice-branded hotel will designate a “Commitment to Clean Captain,” each of whom will complete applicable best-in-class cleanliness training and will be responsible for incorporating the new protocols into their hotel’s operations.

Over the next few weeks, guests may experience a growing variety of new and improved protocols, products and communications, some of which are already in place, to promote health and safety, including:

Clock ticking for Lindiwe Sisulu

Sisulu is accused of overseeing the employment of 19 staffers in the National Rapid Response Task Team (NRRTT), seven of which were apparently hired without submitting resumes. This is said to have been an attempt at aiding her own presidential ambitions by gathering a “political war room” at taxpayers expense.

The DA has urged her to clarify the current status of the employment contracts of these members of the (NRRTT).

“Despite dozens of media enquiries regarding the nature and purpose of the NRRTT, the Minister went to great lengths to defend the appointments as necessary in the execution of the Department of Water and Sanitation’s core work. All claims by the DA that this R13.9 million team was in fact a political campaign team, irregularly appointed as auxiliary to Ministerial staff limit allowances, and remunerated at the taxpayers’ expense, were denied emphatically by Sisulu and dismissed as ‘false and malicious’.” Democratic Alliance

Presidential ambitions laid bare

The DA says it has been informed that several entities, including the media, have also sought clarity on this matter.

A memorandum issued out in April states that Sisulu had kept quiet despite being aware that members of the NRRTT had been raising money – using the department’s name – to bankroll her 2022 campaign for ANC presidency.

“It is clear that Sisulu is not only seriously compromised politically, but has attempted to execute a sloppy diversionary campaign intent on silencing the furore surrounding her slate of politically aligned appointments to tax-payer funded positions – including Bathabile Dlamini, Menzi Simelane, Mphumzi Mdekazi, 19 alleged political campaigners disguised as NRRTT staffers, amongst other,” the DA said. “It is further clear that Sisulu has no respect for the integrity of both the media and Members of Parliament, whose core mandates are to provide the public with factual information and hold the Executive to account.” Democratic Alliance

Sisulu ran for ANC presidency in 2017, alongside the likes of President Cyril Ramaphosa and Cogta Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.","The Democratic Alliance (DA) has given Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu a day to respond to claims about irregularities regarding deals entered into by her department and contractors.

While vacuuming or sweeping is usually enough to keep an uncarpeted floor looking clean , there are times when you have to go one step beyond that and get out a bucket to really wash them properly. Maybe it’s something you traditionally do as a part of spring cleaning, or before your parents come to visit—or maybe it’s something you’re thinking about doing now that you’re spending all your time in your home. Regardless of your reason for tackling it , washing your floors the right way may sound daunting, but it’s actually a relatively straightforward process, as long as you take your flooring type into consideration. Here’s what you need to know about cleaning all types of floors.

Start by sweeping

Before you get out the mop and bucket, you’re going to want to make sure all the dust, hair and other dirt on the surface of your floor is gone. Yes, one option is using a vacuum cleaner, but a good old-fashioned broom will also do the trick. If you’re not comfortable using a broom, we put together this video on how to make the most out of it, including techniques to help you clean your broom so you’re not just spreading the dirt around to different parts of your house.

Hardwood floors

Once you’ve swept a hardwood floor , spot-treat any sticky spots with a damp cloth and a small squirt of wood floor cleaner. When that’s done, use a flat-head mop and microfiber pad or a microfiber string mop that has been thoroughly wrung out—you don’t want any excess water on this type of flooring . Then follow these directions from Deborah Baldwin at This Old House:

Move with the grain and control the amount of cleaning solution by using a spray bottle, aiming for a heavy mist or gentle squirt of about a half teaspoon per 2 square feet. No need to rinse. No need to buff either, but cloth diapers and soft socks do work well here.

If you want to make your own cleaning product, don’t use a baking soda and vinegar solution. Instead, you can use a large batch of black tea to both clean your hardwood floor and help hide any scratches. As far as Murphy Oil Soap goes , experts are mixed on whether it’s a good idea: On the one hand, it’s safe to use on wood; on the other, it can also leave a residue.

Linoleum

Though hardwood floors were once common throughout the house, they fell out of favor in bathrooms and most kitchens about a century ago. Once germ theory caught on, people weren’t thrilled about having porous wooden floors—with cracks and gaps where germs could live—in rooms where sanitation was key. And that’s when a new material called linoleum became common. So how do you clean linoleum? As Leslie Reichert, the Green Cleaning Coach told Real Simple:

Mix up a spray bottle of just a few drops of dish soap and hot water, then spritz a section of the floor at a time and wipe with a damp microfiber mop. The floor should air-dry almost immediately, but if it feels slightly sticky to the touch just swipe it with another clean, damp microfiber mop or cloth.

Laminate flooring

Even though your laminate flooring may look like wood or tile, it’s actually much easier to clean. In fact, according to Bill Dearing, president of the North American Laminate Flooring Association, there are very few things that can damage a laminate floor. One of those is getting water underneath the flooring: don’t let that happen. Otherwise, use your favorite all-purpose cleaner to spot treat any especially dirty sections, then mop as usual. ( Dearing not es that you shouldn’t polish laminate flooring.)

Advertisement

Tile

Ceramic and porcelain tiles are also relatively easy to clean. A mop and a neutral floor cleaner are your best bets, making sure that you avoid using anything too abrasive that might scratch or dull the tiles’ finish. Do take the time to make sure nothing is stuck in the grout between the tiles. I f you really want to get in there for a super deep clean, you can use a steam cleaner on both the tile and grout.

Vinyl flooring

Similar to tile flooring, cleaning vinyl is straightforward as well: spot-treat any sticky areas, then mop it using a neutral floor cleaner (here’s a recipe for making your own). As with laminate, it’s not a good idea to p our water directly on the vinyl, as you want to ensure it doesn’t get underneath the flooring. Finally, if you notice mop streaks when you’re done, you can go over the floor again using a solution of white vinegar and water.","Hardwood floorsOnce you’ve swept a hardwood floor , spot-treat any sticky spots with a damp cloth and a small squirt of wood floor cleaner.

237,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/team-of-engineers-launches-copper-clean-and-puts-copper-to-work-in-fight-against-coronavirus-301065776.html,"Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",PRNewswire,Team of Engineers Launches Copper Clean™ and Puts Copper to Work in Fight Against Coronavirus,"CANYON, Texas, May 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ever wonder why copper has been so widely used over the years for doorknobs? Or why it turns up so often in kitchens? Well, it's not just for aesthetics. Copper just happens to have inherent antimicrobial properties that can dramatically reduce the spread of germs and disease. That fact was not lost on a team of researchers and engineers who first met at West Texas A&M University. Together, they formed a company and developed a copper-based product called Copper Clean™ - that they say can play an important role in the fight against coronavirus.

A team of engineers who first met at West Texas A&M University have developed a copper-based product, called Copper Clean? - that it says can play a role in the fight against coronavirus.

West Texas A&M has a long history of successful development of antimicrobial products and Copper Clean was created in direct response to the call for a higher level of sanitation to help slow the spread of COVID-19. It is an antimicrobial copper sticker and can be applied to door handles, push plates and other high-touch surfaces to kill surface-borne bacteria*.

The patent-pending stickers are made from American-sourced copper, using an EPA-certified alloy proven to kill up to 99 percent of bacteria*, fungi and other microorganisms*. The product is also described as long-lasting, easy-to-install and affordable. The product developers are quick to assert that Copper Clean is meant to complement and not replace proper cleaning of surfaces.

Dr. Emily Hunt, who is President of Copper Clean, explained that multiple studies published by the National Institutes of Health, The New England Journal of Medicine and other sources illustrate the superior effectiveness of copper for slowing the spread of COVID-19. That, in turn, reinforces that Copper Clean is a product poised to have a transformative impact in the battle against the spread of infectious diseases.

""Viruses simply cannot survive on copper surfaces the way they can on other hard surfaces. Based on our research and the natural properties of the alloy itself, we are excited about Copper Clean's potential to impact efforts to stop transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens as the country begins its restart,"" she said. ""It's time for copper to get its due.""

Dr. Harold Michels Ph.D., a consultant and retired senior vice president at the Copper Development Association, agrees. ""Copper can be a powerful weapon in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics, but we have to use it.""

For more information about Copper Clean, go to www.copperclean.com.

*Laboratory testing shows that, when cleaned regularly, antimicrobial copper surfaces kill greater than 99.9% of the following bacteria within two hours of exposure: MRSA, VRE, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli O157:H7. Antimicrobial copper surfaces have been shown to inhibit microbial contamination from these microorganisms, but do not necessarily prevent cross-contamination or infections. Antimicrobial copper surfaces are a supplement to and not a substitute for standard infection control practices. Users must continue to follow all current infection control and sanitation practices. Antimicrobial copper surfaces must not be coated or waxed in any way in order to be effective. The natural patina of antimicrobial copper does not compromise the antimicrobial capacity of the product.

By | Published: 12:52 am

Hyderabad: In a timely action to prevent seasonal diseases in urban areas of the State, the Municipal Administration department will kickstart ‘Every Sunday 10 minutes at 10 am’ programme on Sunday.

The programme is aimed at encouraging community participation in containing the viral fevers and taking up domestic sanitation including ensuring cleanliness and clearing all water stagnation points.

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao along with elected representatives and officials across the State, will participate in the cleanliness drive at their respective homes and drain stagnated water to avoid mosquito spread.

The Minister held a video conference with Municipal Commissioners and additional Collectors in the State here on Saturday. He wanted them to intensify awareness programmes and take up mass campaign to educate people to participate in anti-larvae activities to curb mosquito menace and thus, prevent spreading of viral fevers such as dengue. He asked them to work in coordination with the local elected representatives to motivate people to take part in the programme in a massive manner.

“All the Ministers, MLAs, MLCs, MPs and other elected representatives are requested to participate in the massive programme and clear water stagnation points at their respective homes. They must set an example to citizens of the State and create awareness in this regard,” Rama Rao urged.

All the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) will mandatorily conduct anti-larvae operations by clearing the drainage canals and sewerage pipelines including manholes. Having supplied necessary PPE (personal protection equipment) kits to all municipalities, the Minister warned that action will be taken against the Municipal Commissioner if any of the sanitation workers fail to wear PPE kits, masks, gloves and take other precautionary measures on the field.

He also asked all the Municipal Commissioners to submit a report on the works taken up in their respective ULBs with about Rs 830 crore sanctioned by the State government under ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme.

Rama Rao appreciated the efforts of Municipal Commissioners in containing the spread of COVID-19 and asked them to continue to take stringent measures during the forthcoming days as well. In the wake of the State government considering to phase out lockdown, he wanted them to implement the directions of the government strictly to avoid spread of COVID-19 and constantly monitor the initiatives such as Odd-Even system where 50 per cent shops are being allowed to operate in both orange and green zones.

Stressing that people will have to ‘learn to live with coronavirus’ until a vaccine or drug is invented, the Minister emphasised the need to strictly follow precautionary measures such as face masks, physical distance, and sanitisation among others. The Municipal Administration department along with the Health Department will release necessary guidelines for the ULBs to prevent spreading of the deadly virus.

Manila, 11 May 2020 – Chroma Hospitality Inc., the management company of Crimson Hotels and Resorts and Quest Hotels and Resorts in the Philippines introduces its intensified cleaning guidelines to ensure guest safety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with Culture of Clean.

Country Manager of Chroma Hospitality Inc. James Montenegro, shared that “As we gear up our hotels and prepare for the new era of travel during this pandemic, we have created intensified guidelines for sanitation and cleanliness to make our guests feel secure when staying in any Crimson or Quest hotel.”

The new Culture of Clean

The Culture of Clean was created to elevate the customer’s evolving expectations and answer the worries for frequent travelers during this pandemic. Guests can expect a seamless and safe welcome to any Crimson or Quest hotel starting from the airport pick- up and during their actual stay with these enhanced safety standards:

Enhanced Guest Experience

As soon as guests arrive in the airport and proceed to the hotel vehicles, each vehicle will have customized driver-passenger partitions to ensure safe distancing and will also include upgraded amenities for guests such as hand sanitizers and anti-bacterial wet wipes.

The hotel chauffeur will show guest a QR code which will inform guests of the new processes such as express check-in, new limit of guests per elevator, enhanced room sanitation and more.

When guests arrive in their hotels, all guests will undergo thermal scanning and a sanitizing footbath mat will be visible in all entry points to ensure that no viruses are carried inside the hotels.

There will be UV sanitizers which will be used to disinfect and sanitize all guest luggage before it is delivered to the guest room.

During the check-In process, an express check-in service will offer the convenience of a more efficient check-in, minimal guest-staff interaction and less congestion at the lobby. With the enhanced focus on sanitation, all front office counters in any Crimson or Quest hotel will be sanitized regularly.

Elevated Room Sanitation

All the guest rooms will be disinfected and will remain empty for 24 hours after thorough cleaning and disinfection before accepting another guest to check-in. The Housekeeping associates will wear personal protective equipment as part of their regular uniform and will ensure that high traffic areas such as elevators, hand rails, door knobs are regularly sanitized and disinfected every two hours.

Guests will also be at ease as the hotels implement sanitized tags placed in areas in the room including glassware. Even the toilet bowls will now be tagged with the sanitized label. Electrostatic sprays will be used around the hotels to sanitize rooms and public areas and aside from this, a UV bulb will be installed in the room lamp while cleaning as an added sanitization measure, the regular light bulb will be placed back once finished. After these safety measures are done, no one will be allowed to enter the room and a sanitized seal will be placed on the door.

As an option for guests, they will now be able to choose from housekeeping options of full service where the room will be fully made up or partial service where only the bathroom will be cleaned.

Another added amenity which guests can expect are sanitary kits which will include a hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and a QR code which they can scan to get CoVid Prevention guidelines.

Upgraded Food and Beverage Practices

To implement the elevated sanitation guidelines in the Crimson and Quest hotels’ dining outlets, the following will be the new normal:

• Strict social distancing will be followed by the hotel associates with guests.

• Automatic dispensers of hand sanitizers will be seen in public areas for easy access to all guests.

• Tables will be reduced to ensure social distancing and have a maximum of four persons for every 10 sqm.

• Condiments such as salt and pepper will be in single use sachets.

• Germicidal ultra-violet light system will be installed to disperse floating virus particles.

• Buffet set up will be restricted by discontinuing self-service keeping in mind the safety of both guests and hotel associates.

Chroma Hospitality reassures its guests and associates that their safety is and will always be the top priority even more during this COVID-19 pandemic. “We assure our guests that the hotels are ready with its new Culture of Clean, our strict sanitation protocols are set to welcome everyone into a safe and sanitized hotel as soon as we are all allowed to travel again.” As stated by Mr. Montenegro.

The Clean and Safe Ambassadors, with the Downtown Cleveland Alliance, are essential employees who've been working throughout the stay-at-home order.

The CEO of DCA, Joe Marinucci, said because there's less trash throughout the city, the ambassadors have shifted some of their efforts to make sure more public surfaces are clean.

""Adding another layer of cleanliness and sanitation, we think is a great value add. We again feel very, very good that people seeing the ambassadors psychologically they're going to say 'I've got comfort in that and therefore I'm going to feel more comfortable in being downtown,'"" Marinucci said.

The clean ambassadors are now disinfecting and wiping down door handles to businesses, crosswalk buttons, RTA bus stops and any other surfaces people may encounter while in the city.

Marinucci said this job is important now more than ever as residents and employees return to the city.

""They're going to continue to be out there, and hopefully make the people who live and work in downtown, as you know a lot of people working downtown, feel comfortable and providing another layer of security for them,"" he said.

The group of ambassadors are also working to clean several of Cleveland's neighborhoods, too. The DCA holds partnerships with Shaker Square, Gordon Square, Ohio City, Van Aken district, Little Italny, North Coast Harbor, University Circle and the Port of Cleveland.

If you're looking for a job, DCA is looking for additional Ambassadors for the summer months.

Marinucci said starting pay is $12/hour with full benefits. They search for outgoing and engaging people who can handle being outside walking several miles a day.

On this year's Hand Hygiene Day, the campaign carries more weight than ever.

Clean hands have become one of the most vigorously promoted and implemented measures in the fight against the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Today is #HandHygiene Day!



Hand Hygiene is one of the most effective actions you can take to reduce the spread of pathogens and prevent infections, including #COVID19.



Join the #SafeHands challenge and practice the right technique. pic.twitter.com/l7MDw1mwDl — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) May 5, 2020 Tweet by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the occassion of Hand Hygiene Day. VIDEO: TWITTER

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, front-line workers, especially healthcare professionals, fight the toughest battle that the world has faced in recent times. Hence, WHO tied in the 'Clean Your Hands' campaign with the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife being celebrated in 2020, to shine the spotlight on these health workers as being front-line heroes that are well-deserving of praise and acknowledgement for the critical roles that play in the prevention of infections.

In an exclusive interview with The Edition, WHO Representative to Maldives Dr Arvind Mathur stressed the importance of ensuring safe and quality care for everyone, adding, ""especially now, for COVID-19 patients"".

On May 5, 2020, as the world also celebrates the International Day of the Midwife, WHO calls to action five different groups of people including nurses, midwives, policy makers, IPC leaders and patients and families.

While ""clean and safe care starts with nurses"", and ""midwives' hands make all the difference for mothers and babies"", WHO also urges policymakers to increase nurse staffing levels to prevent infections and improve quality of care in addition to creating the means to empower nurses and midwives along with IPC leaders.

The responsibility that falls on the public's shoulders to contribute to the cause by taking personal responsibility for their own hygiene must not go unmentioned either.

Today is #HandHygiene Day & the International Day of the #Midwife. We call on:

-all health facilities

-all individuals

to stop what they’re doing at noon to clap for nurses & midwives, & to thank them for delivering safe & effective care – especially during #COVID19. — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) May 5, 2020 Tweet by the Director General of the World Health Organisation Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. PHOTO: TWITTER

Saving the front-line

""The current crisis is demonstrating the essential, tireless, innovative and too-often undervalued role of health workers in ensuring strong, resilient health systems for everyone, everywhere"".

As health care workers stretch themselves to their limits offering up their time, knowledge and energy in this time of crisis, it remains a necessity of utmost importance to ensure their safety in return for their services.

Dr Mathur listed the contributions WHO has made for the front liners in Maldives battling against COVID-19, including the procurement and distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, providence of training and supplies, and ensuring the availability of water, sanitation and hygiene - which is often taken for granted.

""Just by providing soap and water we are enabling our safety, thanks to their safe hands"".

With countries clambering to contain the outbreaks all over the globe, Dr Mathur emphasised on the importance of advocating on the appropriate usage of medical items, specifically medical gloves, which need to be reserved for health care activities only.

""Medical gloves should not be used in the community for the purpose to prevent COVID-19; frequent hand hygiene is necessary instead of glove use"", he stressed.

Dr Mathur also highlighted that universal access to public hand hygiene stations must be promoted, and their use made obligatory on entering and leaving any public or private commercial building and any public transport facility.

The WASH campaign

Congratulating Maldives on the country's achievements in providing clean health care, Dr Mathur emphasised that Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in every healthcare facility is a prerequisite for improving the quality of health care services.

Health care facilities that are clean and provide safe health care, ""increases trust and demand for services, improves the experience of care, strengthens staff morale and performance, and emphasizes the role of staff as a role model for the community for setting community hygiene norms.""

In order to raise the standards of healthcare in Maldives, WHO has supported the continuous WASH programme in healthcare facilities by conducting Training of Trainers (TOT) across every atoll in July last year, aiming to sensitise health workers on the importance of water, sanitation and hygiene as well as health care waste management.

""The Maldives has also already conducted the WASH in HCF assessment in 2018 for health facilities in the country for all WASH indicators and is, in fact, the only country in the world which has the information for all indicators"", Dr Mathur noted.

For the continuous assurance of clean health care, WHO intends to continue supporting the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Ministry of Health to roll out and implement the WASH facility improvement tool (WASH FIT) by conducting more training programmes across the country.

""This tool is able to provide data and information on WASH for all health facilities across the nation. This enables us to identify the gaps and understand the issues that needs to be addressed.""

The march towards SDGs

Despite the progress Maldives has made in the healthcare sector by working with multi-stakeholders, there is still much work to be done in regard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) envisioned by the United Nations.

Policies such as the existing health care scheme 'Husnuvaa Aasandha', IPC frameworks and WASH FIT are all monumental steps towards a brighter future, but such efforts must be carried out continuously to provide access to clean health care for everyone.

Dr Mathur pointed out that investing in the health work force is one of the most crucial steps that can be taken to accelerate the progress towards SDGs and to minimise the burden on health systems.

""Poor hand hygiene practice could also be due to overload and lack of time by clinical teams given the shortage of staff affecting the health systems"", he noted.

In this era of unprecedented technological advances, Dr Mathur also suggested complementing the existing efforts by the Health Ministry by enhancing the use of ""an integrated health information system"" to allow the monitoring of the progress made in real-time.

Undoubtedly, the ongoing fight towards transforming the world, even in one area, will be filled with a multitude of challenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic is evidently the toughest hand that the health sector has been dealt in recent times.

As the current circumstances expose the most detrimental practices in our community, it is our duty, as a people, to use this calamity as a catalyst for positive change - and on May 5, one can contribute by pledging to always practice proper hygiene by washing their hands.","On this year's Hand Hygiene Day, the campaign carries more weight than ever.

Their maintenance will be vital in the fight against Covid-19 in the city.Authorities have now asked healthcare centres (Aarogya Kothi) and ward offices to ensure the toilets are maintained as per high cleanliness standards. Supervisors have been told to ensure the facilities are sanitised throughout the day. They have also been asked to upload photos of the toilets into the PMC’s mobile app.Community toilets serve thousands of people in the city’s slum pockets where many households are still without attached loos.“During the third phase of the lockdown, the administration will focus on the condition of community toilets. Every toilet is expected to be deep cleaned at least five times a day,” a PMC official said.“Priority is on door handles and entry/exit points.”The official added that besides regular cleaning, teams have been told to ensure each toilet has functional wash basins, adequate supply of water and soap.“We have set up a system that will pass on complaints directly to supervisors. We will get regular updates on the condition of these toilets,” the PMC official added.But residents of slum pockets said much more needs to be done by the civic body to maintain effective sanitation and hygiene.In the past, community loos in the slums have had problems like leaky taps, missing doors and a range of other issues. There are over 1,200 such loos within PMC limits. “We still don’t have daily lifting of garbage from the slum pockets. These common toilets need to have more security and better maintenance,” said Sanjay Chavhan, a resident of the Yerawada slum.

Usually, national highways are dotted with brightly-lit restaurants and hotels, but the lockdown has meant they are not operational. Now, without these establishments, the highways look deserted and travellers finding it difficult to do long drives, as there is no food available and there are very few clean restrooms.

“I was stuck at a relative’s house for two months in Mumbai and finally managed to get the travel permit last week. It took us almost seven hours to reach Vadodara from Mumbai and on the entire route, we only managed to find a restroom once,” said 65-year-old Bhavna Vashi, a resident of Vadodara. Vashi made the journey home in a private vehicle last week. “While the drive was quicker than usual because there were fewer vehicles on the highway, the worry was that we could not find a single restaurant open and the only restroom we found was close to a police check point, almost four hours into the drive,” she said.

While Gujarat is still open to travel passes, some states, like Karnataka, have strict border entry rules in place which have pushed more highway hotels to remain shut as almost no vehicles are plying these routes.

For 55-year-old Sanjay Mehta, this proved to be problem when he drove to the Karnataka border last weekend to pick up his two children, who are students at a university in Bengaluru and have been stuck in their hostel for the past two months.

“Since Karnataka is not allowing vehicles, especially from Maharashtra, to enter, I first had to arrange for a vehicle to drop my children from their hostel to the Karnataka border [Belgaum]. My wife and I drove almost 500 kilometres and barely managed to find usable restrooms all the way,” said Mehta. With no hotels open, Mehta and his wife drove for six hours straight before parking their car on a petrol pump’s premises and resting for a few hours.

Last week, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said Maharashtra Police had issued over 3.5 lakh e-travel passes for those involved in essential and emergency services as well as those who need to travel to other states due to an emergency.

Vasant Pandharkar, from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Kolhapur district, said that with the number migrants walking on the roads declining sharply, the authorities and highway police are no longer arranging amenities along highways. “The number of migrants moving towards Karnataka through Maharashtra was huge between last week of March and end of April. That’s when we provided food water as well as sanitation facilities close to all our check posts at toll nakas. Since this population has declined and almost vanished in the last few weeks, we haven’t made arrangements for the same,” said Pandharkar.","Motorists travelling with special permissions during the lockdown have reported a major issue for road travel: Shortage of clean restrooms and amenities due to hotels along the highway being shut during lockdown.

This was according to co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha, who spoke on the audit report while delivering his department’s policy speech earlier this week.

Nqatha revealed there were two municipalities in the province that were under Section 139 administration and 14 municipalities that were financially distressed.

“In terms of the municipal audit report for the 2018/2019 financial year released by auditor-general [AG], out of 39 municipalities, only Senqu Local Municipality [based in Lady Grey] has received a clean audit outcome.

“Fifteen municipalities received unqualified audit opinion with findings, 14 municipalities were qualified; eight municipalities received disclaimers and one municipality has prejudice (disputing the audit outcome),” he said.

Reasons cited by AG Kimi Makwetu were non-compliance with legislation, weak governance, ineffective internal controls and flouting supply chain management processes.

Nelson Mandela Bay earned its eighth consecutive qualified audit opinion.

Nqatha said the challenges experienced by municipalities had a direct impact on service delivery, hence the increase in service delivery protests, and “unfortunately they have now become a destruction factor in our communities”.

“For example, in our province, poverty, unemployment and inequality remain our constant challenges that we must deal with aggressively.

“While at the same breath we observe political instability in local government sphere. Both these factors have a direct impact in the local government environmental narrative,” he said.

In working towards strengthening governance, Nqatha said to enhance efficiencies of basic infrastructure delivery, Cogta had introduced the provincial municipal infrastructure co-ordination guidelines.

The system would also help the department to support and monitor municipal infrastructure grant projects such as water , sanitation, roads, community halls, sport fields, land-fill sites and street lights.

“The goal is to detect early poor performance of infrastructure projects and service delivery backlogs.

“The province is allocated R3bn for 2020/2021 financial year for infrastructure grant projects and 36 municipalities will benefit from this allocation,” he said.

Nqatha said irregular expenditure in municipalities was increasing at an alarming rate.

The Bay has a R16.5bn irregular expenditure bill dating back to 2002 which was also cited in the auditor-general’s opinion.

He committed that Cogta would support the municipal public accounts committees (Mpacs) to investigate compliance with the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) and implement consequence management thereof.

“The department will continue to assist municipalities in collecting revenue from government entities.”

Nqatha also highlighted challenges experienced by amalgamated municipalities.

He said he had engaged Cogta minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and requested financial assistance for those affected to enhance their viability.

One of those is the Dr Beyers Naude municipality that owes Eskom millions and has been constantly threatened with power cuts by the power utility.

Dr Beyers Naude mayor Deon de Vos had previously blamed debt incurred by its smaller amalgamated municipalities.

Meanwhile, DA MPL Retief Odendaal has written to finance MEC Mlungisi Mvoko on the issue of integrated development plan public participation meetings.

Odendaal said it had come to his attention that a number of municipalities in the province assumed the exemption notice issued by finance minister Tito Mboweni in terms of Section 177(1)(b) of the MFMA exempted municipalities from the public participation process to draft the IDP and 2020/2021 budgets.

“[This] should naturally be a huge cause for concern as any draft IDP or draft budget that will be adopted by a municipal council without having first been subjected to a public participation process, would be unlawful.

“I trust that you and your officials will ensure that our municipalities are well aware of the prescriptive requirements in respect of public participation processes, even amidst the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.

He accused some municipalities of proposing tariff increases that were above the consumer price index, saying consumers were already under financial strain.","Senqu Local Municipality was the only one out of the Eastern Cape’s 39 municipalities to receive a clean audit outcome from the auditor-general during the 2018/2019 financial year.
Nqatha revealed there were two municipalities in the province that were under Section 139 administration and 14 municipalities that were financially distressed.
“In terms of the municipal audit report for the 2018/2019 financial year released by auditor-general [AG], out of 39 municipalities, only Senqu Local Municipality [based in Lady Grey] has received a clean audit outcome.
“Fifteen municipalities received unqualified audit opinion with findings, 14 municipalities were qualified; eight municipalities received disclaimers and one municipality has prejudice (disputing the audit outcome),” he said.
In working towards strengthening governance, Nqatha said to enhance efficiencies of basic infrastructure delivery, Cogta had introduced the provincial municipal infrastructure co-ordination guidelines."

Thanks to the sponsorship of the Marco Island Area Association of Realtors, their volunteers were ready to clean the beach. Many residents with their families and friends also showed up and were very happy to be on the beach. March 7th was the last beach clean-up they participated in.

Gloves were provided, social distancing was a requirement, buckets and grabbers were provided by Leadership Marco and the Chamber of Commerce and free t-shirts were given out to first time participants.

It has only been 8 days since the beach reopened on April 30th, but already it needed a clean-up. Large pieces of wood and metal were found on the dunes along with plastic water bottles, beer cans, liquor bottles and footwear. At the vegetation’s edge, smaller pieces of plastic and cigarette butts were trapped by the tall grass.

The Beach and Coastal Resources Advisory Committee (BACR) is the organizer for the monthly beach clean-ups soliciting monthly business sponsors. BACR recognizes that the key to Marco’s economic success is maintaining the health of its pristine beaches and the preservation of its unique wildlife.

Through its “Love Your Beach” monthly beach clean-ups, sponsors, such as the Marco Island Area Association of Realtors brought additional volunteers. Today, some 30+ volunteers have enjoyed the wide-open space and beach air while picking up trash left by others. The monthly clean-ups have become a popular community beach event.

Since the beginning of 2020, BACR has partnered with Marco Island Academy Key Club, Ace Painting, Cub Scouts Pack 234 and American Boating Club. Each new volunteer receives a neon green Love Your Beach T-shirt as a token of BACR’s appreciation.

According to Ruth McCann, Executive Director of MICA and a volunteer, at first glance, the beach looks so pristine but upon closer look, it was shocking to see how much trash was left behind. To think that the beach just reopened on April 30th.

With the closing of beaches in the Miami/Dade area, Marco’s beaches are seeing an increase in beach traffic reflected in the number of beachgoers with large coolers entering the South Beach Entrance.

A Collier County Parks & Recreation staff was stationed at the entrance to South Beach reminding visitors on sanitation guidelines and social distancing protocol. He was also taking a count on visitors entering the beach from this location.

Monrovia — Residents of Peace Island were delighted on Wednesday, May 20, 2020, when the National Housing Authority, Monrovia City Corporation and Habitat for Humanity International visited the community while monitoring ongoing water sanitation and hygiene activities during the regular community clean-up campaign.

The clean-up exercise held by community PASSA volunteers was marked by the installation of 20 signboards with the inscription ""NO DUMPING BY ORDER OF MCC AND EPA - Violators will be fined LR$500.00"" in the community. This work was carried out in the framework of the incremental slum upgrading support to the Republic of Liberia under the Liberia Country Program, co-funded by the OFID and European Union grants through Habitat for Humanity and Cities Alliance.

Speaking at Peace Island, the Commissioner of Congo Town Township, Mr. Mensah Suku, highly commended the community for initiating the project and continued engagement in their own development. He commended support of the government (NHA, MCC) and development partners (Habitat for Humanity and Cities Alliance) for facilitating exemplary integrated slum upgrading model and praised the donors (EU and OFID) for their support especially during difficult time posed by COVID 19 outbreak. Mr. Suku reiterated his commitment to support the community leadership in reinforcing of the recently developed community by-laws in accordance to city ordinances of the City government of Monrovia. He said ""the sign boards will enable us reinforce the rule laid down for door-to-door waste collection as the only way to keep a community free from waste, pests and disease vectors such as cockroaches, rats and mosquitoes"". He stated that this can help improve health for the local community residents.

Mr. Dkern Carlors, the coordinator at MCC taskforce on Covid-19, expressed his gratitude to the residents and commissioner of Congo Town for their tireless work on ground and appreciated he financial and material support which has also enabled the city government to deliver its mandate of waste removal from the communities across Monrovia.

According to the Chief of Party of Habitat for Humanity International, Mr. Mathew Ndote, residents of Peace Island and the leadership have been very involved in the whole process. He noted that over 36,000 cubic feet of accumulated of waste, since the foundation of the settlement in 2004, were removed from the site and encouraged the community to sustain their roles in reinforcing payment for door-to-door waste collection.","press releaseMonrovia — Residents of Peace Island were delighted on Wednesday, May 20, 2020, when the National Housing Authority, Monrovia City Corporation and Habitat for Humanity International visited the community while monitoring ongoing water sanitation and hygiene activities during the regular community clean-up campaign.

With 240 rooms, the hostel, as of Wednesday, caters to 450 Covid-19 patients who test positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus and mostly live in Tadiwala road and Bhavani peth slums. One of the patients recorded a video of his ordeal at the isolation centre and uploaded the video on his social media pages.

The video allegedly also shows how inmates have been made to clean the dirty corridors of the centre. Once the video was widely circulated on social media, the administration swung into action and cleared the garbage and sanitised the rooms. However, civic officials also stated that patients were the one to blame as they have been creating problems as they do not want to stay in the hostel.

The patient who recorded the video is a resident of Sant Gadge Maharaj Vasahat which is close to Koregaon Park. The patient said, “We were first housed at the Kasturba Civic School, where our swabs were collected on Friday and then till Monday, we were housed there. When the results were received, the positive patients were taken to the Sinhgad College hostel, which is an isolation centre. At least 100 people were kept in the school without following any social distancing and hence, suspected positive and negative cases were all huddled together.”

The patient further alleged that none of the positive patients were shown their results. “When we came here, we had only one drinking water tap for 450 patients and the sinks were stinking as they had not been cleaned, garbage and food packages were kept in the corridor. We did not get masks and we have been using the same mask since the past three days, we were not given any sanitisers and the clothes and belongings of other patients had not been discarded. We had to clean our rooms ourselves as none of the workers were ready to clean it. Once I put the video online, the sanitation workers came and cleared the centre.”

Civic officials blame patients for the situation and say that many inmates do not want to stay in the quarantine facility. (HT/PHOTO)

Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, said, “We will have to investigate this particular case because we do provide sanitisers and masks to everyone and have placed it inside each room and at the entrance too. This could be a complaint from one person out of the thousands, who have been isolated. The masks which we provide are reusable most of the time. It can be washed and reused. However, I will inquire into these complaints.”

Santosh Tandale, civic officer incharge of the centre, said, “Most of the patients are asymptomatic and would be discharged in just ten days. The patients did not want to stay here and so they are making these excuses. The garbage in the video had not been stacked for days, but were food packets from the same morning which were not cleared. We cleaned it in the evening. The sanitation staff regularly cleans the centre, but some of the patients want to be shifted to the Nicmar facility at Balewadi as some of their relatives are there, but it is full. Hence, they are raising these issues here. We have arranged for some counselling sessions to help them understand the issue and they will be discharged in ten days as most of them are asymptomatic.”","One of the patients recorded a video of his ordeal at the isolation centre and uploaded the video on his social media pages.

1. Introduction

In 2015, the international community agreed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – a list of 17 goals targeted to solve the problems of poverty and hunger, and tackle the effects of climate change, amongst others. Almost all the SDGs are embedded in one form of capital or the other: human (SDGs 1 – 6: poverty, hunger, health, education, water, sanitation, and gender equality); physical (SDGs 8 and 9: employment, growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure); natural (SDGs 13, 14 and 15: climate, life below water and life on land); and social (SDGs 10 and 16: social equality, peace, justice and strong institutions).[1] Amongst these, SDG 6—ensuring inclusive access to clean water and sanitation facilities—is of paramount importance as it is closely associated with a) health, in terms of water-borne infections and hygiene-related diseases; b) food security, for access to irrigation facilities; and c) livelihoods for millions of people across the globe, especially in the developing world.[2] In other words, SDG 6 should be viewed not only from the perspective of basic human rights but as a measure of how a country’s human capital base operates.[3]

Indeed, SDG 6 is a common developmental agenda in today’s world: to both ensure distribution, and sustainable demand management. Issues like water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater management impede sustainable socio-economic development. Since independence in 1947, India has been committed to provide water and sanitation to its people. After 1960, India started making progress on clean water and sanitation issues, keeping hygiene education as a primary goal. India’s water and sanitation program, supported by UNICEF, has provided not only services but also long-term training and technical support. The programs have also encouraged technological innovation and sought international expertise while at the same time strengthening inputs from the local communities and private sectors.[4]

The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s SDG Index Report 2019 places India at a rank of 115 out of 162 countries (score of 61.1 percent),[5] in terms of SDGs performance, lagging behind East Asia and South Asia’s average regional score of 65.7 percent. India’s massive population and its sheer diversity makes the implementation of policies a difficult task and progress on SDG 6 has been moderate. The same SDG Index Report observes that if India does not pick up its pace, the country will fail to reach the SDG 6 targets for 2030. At present, India scores 56.6 percent in terms of its SDG 6 achievement. The government think tank, NITI Aayog, has also published various reports on India’s water and sanitation situation—the Composite Water Management Index Reports and SDG India Index Reports – that will be discussed in the subsequent sections of the paper. Table 1 illustrates the major objectives of various goals under SDG 6.

2. Changing Paradigms in Water Management

Contemporary human history involves the evolution of human interventions in the hydrological cycle, enabled by their ability to build increasingly bigger engineering structures to modify the flows of streams and rivers. For example, human control over the aquifers was established through stronger pumping technologies to take water out from the deep levels. Dams were erected to control floods and generate hydro-electricity at a large scale. These offered reasonable protection against seasonal water shortages and even spatial inequities in water availability. Moreover, irrigation canals made it possible for humans to both expand the land area that can be grown to food, and lengthen the growing season as well.

At the same time, as demand for water for meeting basic human needs started being satisfied, the ill-effects of development showed its signs. As urbanisation increased, the massive water demand of these burgeoning populations has resulted in scarcity in the agricultural areas. Indeed, increasing water demand was not seen as a threat, as water was viewed as being “abundant”, and its supply was “spatial”: i.e., water can be diverted to the water-scarce zones from the water-rich ones, through appropriate supply augmentation plans. For water to be distributed equitably, according to this view, societies only need to expand supply through interventions in the natural hydrological flows.[7] Eventually, water resource planning became reliant on linear projections of future populations, per capita demand, agricultural production, and levels of economic productivity.[8]

This paradigm began to shift towards the middle of the 20th century. Despite the impressive short-term successes of these interventions in providing larger volumes of water supply, it became apparent that addressing the new and emerging challenges is no longer possible in the long term unless fundamental changes take place in the way humans viewed water resources, to begin with. The “business as usual” approach became counter-productive, and a new interdisciplinary paradigm gained ground over the years in the form of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM).

This changing water paradigm[9],[10] represents a real shift in the way humans think about water and is reflected in some of the policy actions of the developed world, primarily amidst worsening of ecological concerns.[11] The preoccupation with investments in huge engineering interventions is being challenged by those who believe that higher priority should be assigned to projects that meet basic and unmet human needs for water.[12] In contemporary history of modern technology, the United States (US), which started the global trend of large engineering interventions over stream flows, is following “… a new trend to take out or decommission dams that either no longer serve a useful purpose or have caused such egregious ecological impacts so as to warrant removal. Nearly 500 dams in the USA and elsewhere have already been removed and the movement towards river restoration is accelerating.”[13]

Following these paradigmatic shifts in notions worldwide, other means to conserve water instream are becoming evident in various parts of the world.[14],[15] In Australia, for example, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is contemplating on extending financial remuneration to farmers for saving on their allocation of irrigation water and to allow the savings to remain instream.[16] Meanwhile, Chile’s National Water Code of 1981 established a system of water rights that are transferable and independent of land use and ownership. The most frequent transaction in Chile’s water markets is the ‘renting’ of water between neighbouring farmers with different water requirements.[17] Helming and Kuylenstierna,[18] while cautioning against the damages that can be caused by supply augmentation plans, emphasise that “…Demand side management is therefore slowly becoming a new paradigm for water governance.”

Agriculture, for its part, has historically accounted for a big proportion of water demand all over the world.[19] Research has shown that water in agriculture can be used more efficiently as most of the water coming in agriculture through irrigation systems end up being wasted. Analysis shows that efficiency of water in agriculture worldwide is only 40 percent;[20] the situation is worse in India, where the efficiency of water in agriculture is 30 percent at best. The physical and economic water productivity of some of the most water-intensive crops like paddy is very low.[21]Agricultural fields in Punjab and Haryana, Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh with abundance of irrigation, see heavy use of water from the Himalayan Rivers. This has reduced the flow of water downstream and increased water scarcity in the plains. A similar situation prevails in the Kaveri and Godavari basins. Such “water stress” has led to animosity between regions that share trans-boundary water.[22]

The problem and its solution is evident using mainstream economic analysis. Traditionally, water was seen as a common property resource, and policymakers ensured access through subsidies and other supply-side arrangements, not putting any limits to indiscriminate extraction. This has resulted in the classic problem of the “Tragedy of Commons”,[23] where individual consumption of common property resources resulted in overconsumption and depletion of the resource. Economic theory prescribes two solutions: the command and control approach, which entails a tough implementation; or inducing excludability in the resource, which is easily implementable by treating water as an economic good. Efficient pricing decisions and ‘metering’ of water can help improve conservation efforts.

In many cities, like Bogor in Indonesia, this practice has already started.[24] Closer home, Delhi too has been practicing water pricing mechanisms for many years, coordinated by the Delhi Jal Board.[25] There is growing interest in using “block rates” or conservation rates, whereby as households increase the amount of water they consume, they are charged higher; this encourages conservation. This is another form of demand management. In building upon the economic solutions for water conservation, there is a need to think of comprehensive evaluation through the “inclusive valuation” framework in which ecological economics has an important role to play.[26] Water pricing entailing the operation and maintenance costs—and also recovering the environmental costs from users—has widely been acknowledged as an important mode of demand management. This helps not only in sustaining the resource for future use, but also in keeping water in-stream and ensuring “environmental flows”.[27]

3. The Tenets of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM)

The paradigm change introduced in the earlier section has been defined as the shift from a reductionist “hydrologic” paradigm to a “hydro-eco-social” paradigm.[28],[29] The objectives are clear under this new thinking: securing water for humans, securing water for ecosystems, and securing water for food. At the same time, the gender dimension in governance of scarce resources is also becoming more critical.

The professional and scientific views of water resource management are changing rapidly, based on scientific analyses of past mistakes and availability of new information. The new paradigm recognises human society as a subsystem of the biosphere in which water is a key element.[30],[31] Based on the various contending thoughts and ideas, the notion of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) has been conceptualised in the form of the following points:[32]

a) Water is viewed as an integral part of the global hydrological cycle, and not as a stock of material resource to be used for the satisfaction of human requirements: With continued emphasis on the economic benefits of water, its ecological functions in sustaining ecosystem health, and therefore human health, have been largely ignored. In the emerging holistic and interdisciplinary paradigm, water is viewed in the context of the broader global hydrological cycle. Neglecting to recognise the ecological cost of diverting water is internally subsidising the use of water for economic purposes at will.[33]

b) Supply of ever-increasing volumes of water is not a pre-requisite for continued economic growth. The availability of water has traditionally been seen as a pre-condition for continuing economic growth.[34] The new paradigm, however, suggests the opposite: economic growth is delinked from water supply augmentation plans. This helps shift the focus to demand-side management of water, an approach long overdue. It also helps create a pathway for low-carbon growth.[35],[36]

c) Clear and strict prioritisation of various types of needs and demands for water, including those by ecosystems, is needed. The new and interdisciplinary paradigm prioritises the various competing uses of water: one is between the needs of the ecosystem and the needs of human society; the other is among the needs of human societies themselves.[37] An important component of current water resource management is setting the right priorities by understanding the trade-offs involved.

d) There is a need for comprehensive assessment of water development projects within the framework of the full hydrological cycle. A crucial element of the new and holistic paradigm is the creation of an interdisciplinary knowledge base able to offer non-partisan and comprehensive assessments of the justifications and impacts of water resource development projects.[38],[39]

e) A transparent and interdisciplinary knowledge base for understanding the social, ecological and economic roles played by water resources is required. The complexities of managing water-related problems include a real understanding of the nature of water resources and their complex links and interrelations with other systems. This means that single-disciplinary approaches will no longer work and new, innovative strategies will have to be developed for coping with water problems, involving multidisciplinary approaches.[40],[41]

f) Droughts and floods are to be viewed in the wider context of the ecological processes associated with them.

g)Appropriate new social and economic instruments for promoting careful and efficient use of water resources or for the reduction of damage to their quality from pollution should be developed. The new paradigm emphasises the need for a new economic perspective evaluation of water. The question of pricing of water, the desirability, or otherwise, of the growing trend towards privatisation of water resources as the final solution, the ecological economic valuation of the ecosystem services provided by water systems, are all part of a rapidly emerging knowledge base of water economics.

h)There is a need to accept restructuring the institutional frameworks for water resource development at local, state, river basin and national levels for making it equitable, sustainable and participatory.

The above list is indicative and not exhaustive. The elements are subject to further refinement as the process of the shaping of a new paradigm progresses. Such a list, for the time being, can offer the fundamental guidelines for putting the new paradigm into force. Given the above, the new emerging paradigm recognises that irrigation development has often come with a high environmental cost,[42] including degradation of aquatic ecosystems, fragmentation and desiccation of rivers, and drying up of wetlands. In many cases the monetary values generated by irrigation have been less than the monetary values generated by the ecosystems they replaced.[43],[44] Falkenmark[45] stresses that by benefitting from the shared dependence of humans and ecosystems on water, IWRM can integrate land, water and ecosystems and promote the three E’s – two human dependent ones (social equity and economic efficiency), and one related to the ecosystem (environmental sustainability).

Fuelled primarily by industrial requirements, demand for water in India was projected to double from 23.2 trillion litres to 47 trillion litres between 2015 to 2025.[46] During the same period, domestic demand was expected to grow by 40 percent from 41 to 55 trillion litres where irrigation will require 14 percent more—592 trillion litres up from 517 trillion litres currently.[47] Indeed, demand for water has always been rising due to increase in population. The traditional method of meeting demand was through supply-side interventions. India has substantially increased its water supply coverage with bigger engineering structures built to modify the flows of streams and rivers. Groundwater is also used with the help of stronger pumping technologies. The annual groundwater resource of India has been estimated at 433 billion cubic meter (bcm), of which 399 bcm is considered to be available for various uses. The irrigation sector is the major consumer of groundwater, accounting for 92 percent annually.[48]

The drinking water problem has also been effectively tackled through these advance technological methods. This whole process could only be made possible by high-level political commitment and technologically strong experimentation. At the same time, excessive subsidisation of electricity and irrigation waters have led to unsustainable extractions of groundwater, and have even led to conflicts over transboundary water sharing.[49] The estimated rate of depletion of groundwater in north-western India is 4.0 centimetres of water per year, equivalent to a water table decline of 33 centimetres per year.[50]

b India’s Policy Challenges

Global estimates show that around 2 billion people drink water from sources that are contaminated by faecal matter.[51] Although since 2000, 2.1 billion people have gained access to basic sanitation facilities, some 2.4 billion people still lack access to basic sanitation as of 2017 – out of this almost 673 million people continue to practice open defecation.[52] In India, 163 million people do not have access to safe water and 210 million lack access to improved sanitation as of 2017.[53] According to the NITI Aayog in 2019, 75 percent of households do not have drinking water on premise and about 84 percent of rural households do not even have piped water access.[54] The government-commissioned survey, the National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) 2018-19, estimated that 93.1 percent of rural households now have access to toilets. The second edition of the survey also recorded that 96.5 percent of people who had access to toilets use these facilities.[55]

Building facilities for safe water and sanitation will not work without behavioural change. In majority of households, even if the source of water is safe, the water is contaminated by unhygienic conditions and practices by people in the households.[56] As early as in 2010, the World Bank estimated that inadequate water and sanitation facilities reduces India’s gross domestic product by about 6.4 percent.[57] Additionally, open defecation remains a major concern in India, despite the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan scheme (Clean India Campaign), of the Central government.

The UN points to India’s seminal mission – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in addressing SDG 6 in India. This flagship programme, launched on 2 October 2014 is aimed at promoting cleanliness and sanitation in a holistic manner. The programme claims to have built more than 100 million household toilets and created more than 700 open defecation-free districts across India.[58] In the Union budget 2020-21, approximately INR 123 billion was allocated to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.[59]

The major Union-level initiatives in the past two decades on urban water and sanitation needs are outlined in Table 2. Most of these policies depict an effort to provide guidance to the states and cities in adopting specific policies and governance structures for improving service delivery to the customers. As services are decentralised to the urban local bodies, appropriate institutions at the local levels are also needed which can implement them in a responsible, efficient, and accountable manner as per the Advisory Note on Improving Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Services (WSS) in India.[60] The Advisory guides cities in undertaking the Service Improvement Plans (SIPs) by focusing on outcomes rather than outputs and ensuring efficiency of capital investments. It also identifies policies and principles for clarifying the mandates, improving governance, financing and developing infrastructure, regulating services, and building capacity.

Water and Sanitation can solve public health problems significantly in India.[61] Globally, diarhhoea, a water-borne disease highly prevalent in the poorer nations, alone kills more children in a year than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, combined.[62] According to the United Nations, one-fifth of all child deaths in the world due to severe diarhhoea are in India. Hygiene, Sanitation and Water (HSW) interventions can reduce occurences of illnesses like diarrhoea, ascariasis, cholera, scabies, trachoma, amebiasis.[63] The benefits of HSW are not limited to these effects; it has positive spillovers as well. Malnourished children, recovering from diarrhoea, are vulnerable to pneumonia in 26 percent of all childhood pneumonia cases. Thus, preventing diarrhoea will help bring down the incidence of other dieases as well.[64] Reduction in health risks and malnutrition will also have positive effects in school performance and attendances of children,[65] mitigating development issues such as hunger and poverty in the long run.

The Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) was formed in May 2019 by merging the two erstwhile ministries—the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation – to deal with water and sanitation issues in India both at national and international levels.[66] Coincidentally, this move has also shifted the focus of the share of budget allocation away from drinking water (from 87 percent in 2009-10 to 31 percent in 2018-19). In the same period, the share of allocation to rural sanitation has increased from 13 percent to 69 percent.[67] Urban drinking water supply and sanitation are dealt with by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).

The flagship programme of the MoJS, NamamiGange in 2014 with a budget outlay of INR 200 billion, created an impetus for the implementation of SDG 6 by focusing on maintaining adequate water supply from the River Ganga and its tributaries which is an essential source of usable water for a large portion of the Indian population. A few key achievements of the Namami Gange programme in line with SDG 6 include, creating sewerage treatment capacity, river surface cleaning, river front development, and public awareness.[68] Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed with various central ministries for synergising the government schemes.[69]

The Estimates Committee of Parliament (2015) observed that piped water supply was available to only 47 percent of rural habitations, out of which only 15 percent had household tap.[70] As of February 2018, 74 percent of households have access to safe drinking water (receiving 55 litres per capita per day), and 22 percent are partially covered (receiving less than 55 litres per capita per day).[71] Under the Government’s Har Ghar Jal scheme (currently known as the Jal Jeevan Mission) initiated in the Union Budget 2019, the Jal Jeevan Mission aimed at providing Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to every rural household by 2024. It is estimated to be operationalised at an expected cost of INR 3.6 trillion that will cover 81 percent of all rural households in India.[72]

Under the Budget 2020-21, the Finance Minister declared the budget around ‘ease of living’ in synchronisation with the ‘ease of doing business’ for inclusive access to opportunities. Theoretically, the budget portrays a comprehensive framework that looks at addressing the interconnectedness between financial equity, economic progress, and a progressive society through its three main themes: ‘Aspirational India’, ‘Economic Development’ and ‘Caring Society’. Water, wellness and sanitation were identified as a key theme under ‘Aspirational India’ – highlighting the importance of enhancing the human capital base in the country. As expected, most of the policies announced under this sub-theme show a deep correlation[73]with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) but misses out on the larger concerns of demand-side aspects of efficient water management and enhancement of sanitation infrastructure – which forms the core of SDG 6.

5. Metrics of Water Management

Evidence from the poorer countries suggest that women and children spend a significant proportion of their productive time in procuring water for daily use.[74] Most economic analyses fail to either estimate these costs or incorporate them into the analytical framework. According to the capabilities approach to defining poverty, proposed by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, the real costs associated with procuring water in rural areas add to the opportunity cost that they have to bear in terms of access to opportunities for better education, health and food.[75] Concerns such as these link poverty, and its drivers, to water management in an equally significant manner. While many measures of poverty have identified its links with health, education, food, politics and vulnerability, related issues on water have mostly appeared in the fringes of these discourses. A more explicit link between water availability and poverty is the primary motive behind the creation of a Water Poverty Index of 2002.[76] Previously, most economic measures of poverty have been monetary in nature which resulted in a failure to attribute the non-monetary qualities of human well-being, and more so of the depreciation of natural capital. The health of an ecosystem is paramount in determining the health of human life-support systems.

A holistic water poverty index must include components that capture physical water availability, water quality, ecological water demand, social and economic measures of poverty, and institutional factors that influence access to water. When the link between poverty and water availability is established, effective water management will require an understanding of the relationship between water availability and water demand. Understanding patterns of water demand will in turn be essential in ensuring efficient use of the resource. Since human behaviour is a major factor influencing demand patterns of natural resources like water, achieving a sustainable development pathway will only be possible if humans can be incentivised to act accordingly. Quantifiable estimates from a water poverty index will help determine the exact nature and source of demand. Based upon information and indication from the WPI, sectors that have the highest impact on an economy can be identified. Subsequently, policies can be formulated to push[77] the economy in the desired direction of sustainability.

The index may be calculated using various methods such as the conventional composite index, capturing the gap between predetermined standards and actual empirical values for each parameter, matrix approach or time-analysis approach. It is a comprehensive tool that will aid water management decision-making and make a direct contribution to the alleviation of poverty in poor and water-stressed countries—the concentration of which is likely to increase with time.

In the same vein, the Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) was first developed by the NITI Aayog in 2018. The second edition of the report was launched in 2019 as a tool to assess and improve the management of water resources in the country. The CWMI 2.0 is an extended version of the previous report as it includes two new Union Territories—Delhi and Puducherry.[78] The index was calculated based on weights (in brackets) assigned to nine broad themes such as: source augmentation and restoration of water bodies (5), source augmentation for groundwater (15), major and medium irrigation (15), watershed development (10), rural drinking water (10), urban water supply and sanitation (10), policy and governance (15), participatory irrigation practices (10), and sustainable on-farm water-use practices (10). However, the CWMI framework has some weaknesses, outlined in the following paragraphs. (The SDG6 index constructed by the authors of this paper attempt to address these failings.)

There is lack of clarity on how the ranking scheme was conducted and why these parameters were included. Even if it is assumed that the CWMI paradigm has been unconventional in prioritising sustainability, water usage efficiency and the supporting policies, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the scientific reliability, authenticity and the completeness of this exercise by the NITI Aayog.[79]

For example, it makes little sense why the states are divided into ‘Northeastern and Himalayan states’ and ‘Non-Himalayan States’ where the river systems for the two kinds of region have been assessed. This seems like a redundant exercise as a river basin-based approach would have been more methodical.[80] The CWMI document has also missed out on Jammu and Kashmir in the states it has ranked.

Further, CWMI does not take into consideration the physical condition of the resource in terms of availability subject to the demand-side changes. This cannot provide a holistic picture for better governance mechanisms.to emerge. There needs to be a shift in the country’s policy of managing water crises—from an approach of “supply and supply more water” towards measures and interventions that improve water-use efficiency.[81] A holistic composite index will require a better representation of both supply, demand, and institutional interventions, as attempted in this paper.

The CWMI exercise fails to contain information needed to identify new opportunities and the requirement of new investments after identifying the gaps in the existing infrastructure.[82] It is for this reason that the SDG 6 index developed in this paper argues that a holistic water management score needs to include parameters related to sanitation alongside indicators of water demand, water supply, and other environmental concerns. The index developed in this paper contains indicators ranging from slum population to waste disposal which are elemental in prescribing water policies and also help in underpinning the importance of water and sanitation infrastructure in India.

6. SDG 6 in India: Sub-National Evaluation

The lack of data availability and monitoring heavily constrains measuring the implementation progress with regard to all the SDGs. The present sub-national evaluation of SDG 6 uses cross-sectional data on seven parameters (see Appendices 1 – 7) that were chosen as per the latest data availability with reference to recommendations from the Central Statistics Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.[83] For example, the Swachhata Report of 2016-17 is the latest database available at the state level in India and the successive Swachh Survekshan reports of 2018 and 2019 disaggregate the data across cities. The list of parameters in Table 3 is not exhaustive but is indicative of the ‘clean water and sanitation’ scenario in the 23 Indian states. The Union Territories and the Northeastern States (except Assam) have been excluded from the study due to unavailability of data.

Using the data[92] on these seven parameters,[93] weights were assigned to each of them by Principal Component Analysis[94] for statistical robustness. Finally, the state-wise composite SDG 6 indices are derived (See Figure 1.)

This index is an advancement over the NITI Aayog’s SDG 6 index scores both in 2018 and 2019[95] mainly on two accounts: (1) the “ad-hoc” nature of weight determination of the component indicators has been removed through robust statistical methods like principal component analysis; and (2) The NITI Aayog’s SDG 6 indicators are fewer in number, compromising on most of the aspects covered by the targets of SDG 6. Even the UN SDSN’s SDG Index and Dashboard Reports do not evaluate India at a sub-national level.

Figure 1. SDG 6 Index Scores (out of 1)

It is noteworthy that most of the states that are not performing well in SDG 6 are endowed with water resources as they lie along the Ganges basin (Bihar, Jharkhand,Uttar Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, West Bengal); while the better performing states are relatively water scarce. In the construction of the indices, greater emphasis has been given on the efficient use of water and its availability of improved sanitation facilities. Further, this study looks at the correlation between water availability in the states versus the management of water and sanitation facilities. In this context, SDG 6 is presented in terms of classifications delineated by the following formula. This analysis assumed the SDG 6 index to be a sample from a symmetric distribution (normal), and classifies the states as the following:

Top Performers: SDG6i > (μ + σ = 0.606)

Medium Performers: (μ + σ = 0.606) > SDG6i > (μ – σ = 0.363)

Bottom Performers: SDG6i < (μ – σ = 0.363)

where, μ (= 0.485) is the mean of the SDG6i scores across the states and σ (= 0.122) is the standard deviation of the SDG6i scores across the states.

Similarly, using a geographical estimation of water availability in India by the World Resources Institute (WRI),[96] the states are categorised into three sections: High Availability, Medium Availability, and Low Availability.[97] Finally, the water availability and the SDG6i are juxtaposed to arrive at the following matrix.

The matrix shows that the states of Gujarat and Telangana have the worst water availability but high SDG 6 index scores. Conversely, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, in spite of having high water availability, are the worst performers in terms of SDG6i. It is noteworthy that out of the 23 states studied for this paper, only one (Goa) shows a positive correlation between the two variables. Rather, there is some form of clusterisation of the states around the downward sloping 45-degree line, indicating a negative relation between the two variable classifications. Indeed, most of the states (12) can be found in the diagonal cells along the downward sloping 45-degree line – (Bottom Performers x High Availability), (Medium Performers x Medium Availability) and (Top Performers x Low Availability). Thus, this analysis re-establishes that the focus of water issues in India should be shifted from a reductionist supply-side perspective towards better management and governance of water resources.

These observations establish that scarcity drives better utilisation and management of resources since the marginal utility derived from the particular scarce resource is much higher than that of an abundant resource. In the Indian scenario, distribution of water resources is not uniform and therefore needs a differential approach towards water management by efficiently tackling the demand side. According to a study by the WRI[98], out of 17 countries facing the highest levels of water stress in the world, India receives the maximum amount of annual rainfall. Despite a heavy supply of water resources in many Indian regions, the Ministry of Water Resources points towards over-exploitation and mismanagement of water for the prevailing water stress in the country— where irrigation plays a critical role in contributing towards the deterioration of water resources in the country.

7. A Holistic Index in IWRM

This paper proffers that the SDG index developed here is a holistic index that is embedded in the notion of IWRM. A plethora of supply-side indicators exist, including the ones by Falkenmark et. al.[99] and another by Ghosh and Bandyopadhyay.[100] However, their application requires highly sophisticated mathematical and econometric treatments, and the use of extensive time-series data. NITI Aayog’s CWMI has a strong demand-side variable presence, but its weaknesses have already been explained earlier. Therefore, it is proposed that a holistic index like the ones represented by SDG 6 index taking into consideration both demand and supply is embedded in the emerging paradigm of IWRM. The elements are outlined in the following paragraphs.

a. Greater supply of water is not a pre-requisite

It is well known by now that supply development has led to disputes between regions that share water resources, as illustrated in the cases of Cauvery in India and Colorado in the US.[101] To obtain economic benefits, there was the associated social cost of conflicts, which led to unsustainable resource use and hostile and untenable hydropolitical conditions in the basins.[102] That supply augmentation plans can be counter-productive by raising the social and ecological costs, has been exhibited by these two cases. That proper demand management can lead to effective development is exemplified by Israel.[103] One needs to look at the performance of the index developed here that reflects on the overall water governance, rather than only per capita physical availability of water.

b. All water systems are viewed as integrally linked with the hydrological cycle and contribute to the ecological system

The rationale of water diversion and the pursuit of supply augmentation plans were based on the old paradigm of water resource development. The SDG 6 index, by taking into consideration the demand-side indicators, reinforce the fact that water can be left for the ecosystem so as to meet the ecological needs. In the process, it acknowledges the basic tenet of IWRM: addressing the trade-off between human economic needs and the broader ecosystemic needs for the concerns of sustainability.

c. Comprehensive assessment of the water development projects keeping the integrity of the full hydrological cycle

From the holistic viewpoint of eco-hydrology, human intervention in the hydrological process for extracting economic services has negative ecological consequences, which is in contravention with the principles of “sustainable development”. The attempt to diminish scarcity of water for the economic services imposes an inherent cost in the form of an enhanced “scarcity value” of the ecosystem services. This is captured in the SDG 6 index, albeit not strongly. Therefore, the need for understanding the optimal trade-off between the two “scarcity values” is important, and can serve as an important criterion in the comprehensive assessment of water development projects.

d. Prioritisation of water needs

This index, in a disaggregated format, helps in understanding the priorities in terms of water allocation. However, this is still at an emerging stage, and requires to be strengthened further.

e. The New Economics of Water

The index provides an overall assessment of the state of the resource, which helps in providing a means to understand and evaluate the emergence of institutional mechanisms for water resource management, provides institutions with an objective instrument for better management practices, and offers the foundation for a new ecological economic valuation through the scarcity valuation of ecosystem services provided by water systems.

f. An Interdisciplinary Knowledge Base

Transdisciplinary interactions, as argued by Falkenmark et al,[104] become extremely important in the context of IWRM. SDG6 index takes into consideration various variables, but the flexibility lies with making it more robust by bringing in more variables from the hydro-meteorological sciences and social sciences at the various levels. In the regime of the old paradigm, disciplines were not intersecting with each other in a way that truly understands the potential contributions of other areas of competence, not even from closely neighbouring disciplines.

The new paradigm demands a real understanding of the nature of water resources, their complex links and interrelations with other systems, and how societies manage them. Such complex interactions can no longer remain compartmentalised as a single-disciplinary approach. A holistic governance mechanism requires a transdisciplinary knowledge base (that requires interaction of social sciences, geophysical sciences, agricultural sciences, economic sciences, and ecology and the environment.) Simultaneously, it would go on to buttress the existing framework of water law, with the use of objective tools like this index.

8 The Way Forward

India’s progress towards the achievement of SDG 6 is subject to the type of federalism that exists in the country and its impacts on governance. In theory, a competitive economy produces outcomes that are superior and efficient; in a federal system, competition between states is likely to produce policy outcomes that will benefit the entire nation. The fact that the best and worst states are named in the public domain in terms of their SDG 6 achievements will lead to a competitive spirit amongst states which may be a way forward for connecting good water governance with good politics. It establishes that the concepts of regional competitiveness are gaining equal importance as national competitiveness.[105]

A caveat is in order: The index developed for this study does not consider eco-hydrological processes and environmental flows variables, nor shows its application at the basin scale. Yet, there is indicative evidence of the presence of such variables, as a lower human demand for water implies that more is left for the ecosystem. Leaving water instream and making them flow through the river channel for sustenance of the ecosystem so that its structure and functions are sustained, and ecosystem services are not disrupted, are the pillars of IWRM. From that perspective, however, this index can capture the performances of states which have done better in demand management as also being endowed with less natural supplies.

The Business and Sustainable Development Commissions Report[106] identifies immense business opportunities associated with the SDGs and estimates their aggregate global potential value in 2030 at US$ 12 trillion in current prices. More than half of these business solutions reside in developing economies such as India with large markets. International public-private, public-public, private-private partnerships leveraging on individual comparative advantages is the way forward to incentivise projects and successfully implement measures related to clean water and sanitation.

Apart from financial assistance from the multilateral development banks, many multinational companies in this sector such as AquaFed, Cargill and P&G are actively collaborating with state and non-state actors in developing nations for drinking water and sanitation facilities. For example, according to the US Council for International Business, the clothing retail company, Gap Inc. has partnered with Swasthi Health Resource Centre in building water filtration plants in rural India which already caters to approximately 5,000 households and 29 schools in 30 villages across India as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives.[107] Despite such measures, it must be acknowledged that private investment in water sector has not been adequate and it has mostly been concentrated in the urban spaces. Another policy which holds much relevance in contemporary India is pricing water across all urban regions for efficient utilisation and progressive distribution of funds for areas that are lagging behind in terms of water and sanitation facilities. However, water pricing is an increasingly competitive, state-specific political issue.

In the current scenario the importance of water and sanitation infrastructure is bound to grow—in order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the near future, and also to keep similar hygiene-related morbidities in check. In conclusion, it must be noted that implementation of SDG 6 will effectively influence the long-term capital infrastructure in India – physical, human, natural and social – and therefore the realisation of these goals are imperative for FDI inflows and enhancing the ‘ease of doing business’ in the long term. Earlier research by these authors has shown,[108] with the help of an econometric exercise, that promoting SDGs essentially improve business competitiveness in an economy thereby creating enabling conditions in India’s competitive federalist structure. Finally, there is a desperate need to realign India’s water and sanitation policies towards demand management and replace the myopic focus on supply augmentation.

[84] Originally expressed as Composite Water Index Scores, the values have been normalized to range from 0 to 1. The missing value of Delhi is substituted by the average values of its neighbouring states that are Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The missing value of West Bengal is substituted by the average of its neighbouring states – Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The missing value of Jammu and Kashmir is substituted by the average values of its neighbouring states that are Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.

[85] The Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) uses data collected at central and state level from 2016 – 2018. Their findings show that the water scarce states (Gujarat performs best) perform much better in terms of the CWMI than the relatively water abundant states (Meghalaya performs worst).

[86] In order to capture the total water availability in a state we have used the total area under water bodies as a measure. These figures were originally in hectares which have been converted into sq. metres and then the per capita values have been calculated (as per Census 2011) to remove scale biases. This data set has then been normalised to range from 0 to 1.

[87] Individual data for Ground Water Availability and Ground Water Withdrawal have been obtained from the mentioned sources. Water withdrawal as a percentage of water availability for each state has been calculated from the given data sets. These figures have then been normalised to range from 0 to 1. Andhra Pradesh values have been used as a proxy for Telengana. The normalised values have been subtracted from 1 to convert into its complement to make the score positive.

[88] Originally expressed figures are in percentage of total urban population. The values have been normalized to range from 0 to 1. The value for Andhra Pradesh has been used for Telengana. The normalised values have been subtracted from 1 to convert into its complement to make the score positive.

[89] Original figures were expressed in percentage. These values have been normalised to range from 0 to 1.

[90] Original figures were expressed in percentage. Missing value for Delhi has been replaced by the average of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana while missing value of Goa has been replaced the average of Karnataka and Maharashtra. These values have then been normalised to range from 0 to 1.

[91] Original figures are expressed as percentage of waste processed. We have normalised this data to range from 0 to 1.

[92] The data collected across 23 Indian states, owing to either the population size or geographical area in most cases, has inherent scale biases. The variables have been converted into per unit format (to remove the relevant scale bias). Further, all the data points have been normalized by the following formula to range from 0 to 1 (unit free). Now, for the negative indicators, the complement of 1 for their respective normalized values has been taken, so as to convert them into a positive indicator. This has been done so as form a uniform, unit and direction free, composite SDG 6 index/score.

Where,denotes the value of the component indicator k of SDG 6for state j; denotes normalised value of the component indicator k of SDG 6for state j; denotes the minimum value of the row vector of y kj values across the states; denotes the maximum value of the row vector of y kj values across the states. With ‘k’ denoting an indicator, it is defined by the closed set k = [1, 7] and ‘j’ denoting a state, it is defined by the closed set j = [1, 23]

[93]Principal Component Analysis is conducted on 7 component indicators. However, some of these component indicators are constructed using more than one indicator. All computations are performed on Stata 12.0.

[94] Calculation of weights for each indicator under SDG 6, for each of the 7 observations has been conducted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to rank the states. This methodology has been chosen over a simple average technique to understand the dominant patterns in the dataset, in terms of weights that should be assigned to each parameter. Now let us define the weight attached, by PCA, to an indicator ‘m’ in SDG 6 as w m wherew m = [max{component1, comp2,……, compm}]2 * explanatory power[94] of [max{comp1, comp2,…,comp m}]. Each of the weights has been scaled up to sum up to 1 (100%), in order to avoid under representation.

But for the one in three people around the world who do not have access to clean water, this simple step in disease prevention isn’t so simple.

Rural populations disproportionately lack effective water, sanitation and hygiene services — known collectively as WASH — due in large part to a lack of infrastructure, high costs and weak governance. Meanwhile, climate change, pollution and development are diminishing freshwater sources and ecosystems at a rapid rate, compounding the problem.

Conservation News spoke with the director of Conservation International’s WASH in Watersheds program, Colleen Sorto, about how when it comes to water and human health, where your water comes from can be just as important as how you use it.

Question: How big of a role does WASH truly play in preventing the spread of disease?

A: According to experts, handwashing can reduce the spread of disease by more than 20 percent — and using improved hygiene practices when managing human waste can reduce that risk even more. Delivering WASH is about providing communities with access to clean water through taps and pipes, as well as latrines and proper handwashing and hygiene education — because they all go together. Think about it as a three-legged stool: Access to clean water sources is one leg, healthy behaviors are another and infrastructure such as waste systems and latrines is the third. You need all three legs for the stool to balance.

Increasing WASH access in villages, schools and healthcare facilities to educate people on the value of hygiene in disease prevention is crucial, but only part of the story. Often people neglect to think about where the water for these services is coming from — and what happens to that water once we’re done with it.

Q: What does this have to do with conservation?

A: Water, poverty and the environment are interconnected, and the long-term sustainability of WASH depends on nature’s ability to provide reliable sources of water — which is where conservation comes into play. Through Conservation International’s WASH in Watersheds program, we help communities link WASH and freshwater conservation activities in a holistic way. In South Africa, for example, poor land and water management practices have impacted the catchment of the Mzimvubu — one of South Africa’s last free flowing rivers. Destructive grazing practices, invasive plant species and inadequate sanitation infrastructure have degraded the river and reduced the quality and quantity of water flowing to communities downstream.

Since 2015, Conservation South Africa (CSA) — Conservation International’s local affiliate — has worked with communities in this area to improve the well-being of local people by restoring the health of their watershed. Our first step: Separating the main water sources for animals and people to decrease the likelihood of contamination by livestock and potential disease outbreaks from animal waste. Then, we worked with local volunteers to remove water-thirsty, invasive plants in the region and restore natural springs, while collaborating with the local government to launch several education campaigns about good health and sanitation practices.

Q: What are the other benefits of conserving freshwater ecosystems?

A: Along with helping to ensure more reliable sources of water, protecting watersheds can mitigate local and downstream flooding, increase soil’s ability to absorb water, and sustain inland fisheries that contribute to food security. To help additional communities get these benefits, CSA is working to replicate the WASH in Watersheds program across the region. The municipality is also considering how they can link our spring restoration approach with their future investments in infrastructure.

Particularly in times of crisis, freshwater conservation can build resilience for rural communities and the species that inhabit these crucial ecosystems, while helping communities prepare for future pandemics.

Q: How?

A: Freshwater conservation can help us all prepare for— and mitigate the impact of — future pandemics by providing communities with the water they need to support WASH activities such as handwashing.","Meanwhile, climate change, pollution and development are diminishing freshwater sources and ecosystems at a rapid rate, compounding the problem.

257,https://theroanokestar.com/2020/06/22/virginia-tech-researcher-working-to-provide-clean-water-to-appalachia/,"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Roanoke Star,Virginia Tech Researcher Working to Provide Clean Water to Appalachia,"Krometis also surveyed people who drink untreated spring water, and found that most of them do have running water in their homes, often from wells. They said they preferred the spring water because it tastes better than their tap water, or because they don’t trust the quality and reliability of the water in their homes.

Fixing these two interrelated problems, of wastewater and drinking water, isn’t easy. The homes that use straight pipes and roadsides springs tend to be far away from the nearest municipal sewer and water systems, and often separated by mountains and ravines. It could cost $50,000 or more to hook one of these homes up to a sewer system, even if there is one nearby, Krometis said. Septic tanks are usually unsuitable because the soil isn’t deep enough.

“These are legitimately challenging engineering problems, and they require a lot of money, and these places don’t have a lot of money,” she said. “We haven’t figured out ways to get water and sewer to extremely rural areas, and there are also huge issues with the homeless and the working poor in urban areas.”

There are cheaper and easier solutions, of the type used in developing countries. Public water kiosks for drinking water are one, and are already in use in some parts of Kentucky and West Virginia; small water or sewer treatment devices installed for each home or cluster of homes are another option. Krometis supports these tactics, though she sees the political and cultural obstacles to using them in the United States.

“The technologies that are best practices in Africa or Southeast Asia, we don’t use in the United States. They’re unacceptable because we’re a developed country,” she said. “But in my mind, if you have somebody who’s impoverished and doesn’t have access to clean water, that’s a problem that we need to address.”

People are hesitant to give residents of Appalachian mountain hollows or California’s dry and dusty farm town water and sewer systems that aren’t up to the standards of their fellow Americans in cities and suburbs. Krometis understands that hesitation, but she also understands that many of those poor Americans are going without any access to reliable, clean water.

“I see both sides of the coin,” she said. “The problem is, we’re not even having that debate.”","Krometis also surveyed people who drink untreated spring water, and found that most of them do have running water in their homes, often from wells.

Some time ago I was reflecting on a recent advertising campaign by the charity WaterAid and the work that they are undertaking throughout the world in an effort to provide access to clean water for those that are deprived of it and suffering as a result.

Of course there are many worthwhile charities that grab our attention and convince us to donate but the fact that so many people were still being denied this basic commodity led me to enquire further. It came as a bit of a surprise to me to learn that as many as 785 million people in the world – one in ten – do not have clean water close to home, which is bad enough but with the current Covid-19 pandemic ready to hit Africa, the threat to health is set to seriously increase still further.

Some facts make for chilling reading and the lack of clean water for so many provides evidence that we are indeed in the midst of a worldwide crisis and one which will take an almighty effort by governments, the private sector and charities to mitigate.

Renowned international organisations have estimated that two billion people do not have a decent toilet of their own and three billion people do not have handwashing facilities at home, a problem which cannot be understated given the havoc that diseases wreak due to poor hygiene.

Every minute a newborn child dies due to infection brought on by the lack of clean water and an unclean environment. Diarrhoea caused by dirty water and poor toilets kills a child under five years old every two minutes. The scale of this problem has been recognised for some time and charities like WaterAid are committed to doing what they can to eradicate it.

So far it operates in 28 countries and since 1981 has helped provide 27 million people with clean water and is currently redoubling its efforts in attracting donors. The charity attempts to convince governments to amend or introduce laws which are of assistance and helps to link up those who develop policy with “people on the ground” in an attempt to ensure that expertise and resources are shared, and also to generate support from organisations and people throughout the world, ensuring lasting change on a huge scale.

WaterAid is only one of a number of charities that are intent on tackling this problem and all are worthy of support if a difference is to be made but it cannot be left to them alone.

Governments have a crucial role to play in ensuring that capital investment and environmental policies promote the provision of clean water and toilet facilities in deprived areas.

Diseases such as dysentery, polio, trachoma, typhoid fever and cholera, amongst others, all pose a threat and are prevalent in areas where the water is contaminated and hygiene facilities non-existent – but they can be overcome, not just by treating the symptoms but by eradicating the cause.

The current pandemic is naturally commanding massive media attention and, as a result, other world health issues have been temporarily marginalised but they have not gone away and still demand attention. However, alarmingly, it is predicted that Covid-19 is set hit some other poorest areas next, with devastating consequences. The continent of Africa in particular is one that is ill-equipped to deal with this virus to the same extent that some other countries have managed, with health services being predicted to be unable to cope.

Although the virus might appear to be on the wane in Scotland, unfortunately it is all set to do its worst to those that are least able to fight it off.

262,https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-clean-menstrual-cup,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Healthline,How to Clean and Store Your Menstrual Cup,"Share on Pinterest So you’ve decided to use a menstrual cup for your period. Great choice! Before you get started, there are a few things to keep in mind. At the top of mind: Since menstrual cups are reusable, you’ll want to prep yourself on the best techniques to clean and store your cup.

What you can and can’t use Do use a gentle, unscented, oil-free soap to maintain your menstrual cup. You can find cleaning solutions dedicated to menstrual cups, but if you don’t have one, don’t worry. You can use any mild, unscented oil-free soap. On the other hand, there are a few things you should stay away from. Many of the more common cleaning products can cause serious irritation if used on your cup. Avoid the following: antibacterial soap

oil-based soap

scented soap

baking soda

bleach

dishwashing liquid

hydrogen peroxide

rubbing alcohol

vinegar

Initial cleaning (before first use) Congrats on buying a menstrual cup! You’ll want to prepare the cup before your first use. Start by washing both of your hands and the cup with a mild, unscented cleanser. Next up: Boil a pot of water, and let the cup sit in the boiling water for no more than 10 minutes. Be careful to monitor the cup so it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot and burn.

Day-to-day cleaning Once you’ve successfully prepared your menstrual cup, you’ll also want to keep it clean every day after using it. Cleaning the cup removes bacteria and buildup, and prevents stains and odor. No matter where you are, you’ll want to always wash your hands before and after insertion of the cup. At home Remove the cup and empty the blood into the toilet. Then, rinse it out with clean water, and use a mild, oil-free, fragrance-free soap to give it a quick clean. Once it’s clean, you can reinsert the cup. In a public bathroom If you’re out and about while on your period, it might be harder to rinse your cup. If you’re unable to rinse the cup and use a safe cleanser, remove and empty the cup like normal. Then, instead of rinsing, use a piece of toilet paper to wipe the cup clean, making sure to remove any small pieces of tissue. Reinsert the cup, and go about your day. Remember to give it a proper rinse and clean once you get home. During travel or in nature On some occasions, you might not be somewhere where the water supply is safe to use. In this case, bring bottled water with you to rinse off the menstrual cup. You’ll also want to pack a travel-sized version of your favorite oil-free, unscented soap. If you’re hiking or camping, pour the blood into a cathole (a small hole in the ground) like you would with any other organic waste. Then, use water from a water bottle to rinse off the cup, and wipe it with a clean tissue before reinserting it. Don’t forget to pack your storage pouch, too, to ensure the cup remains sanitary when not in use.

Sanitizing at the end of your period To sanitize the cup after your period is over, rinse it thoroughly, then boil it for a few minutes. After the cup is boiled, set it aside to completely cool down and dry off. Some brands sell sanitizing cups that can be filled with water, placed in the microwave with the menstrual cup inside, and boiled for 3 to 4 minutes. Both processes remove all the bacteria to prevent bacterial growth before the next use.

How to store when not in use Most cups will come with a bag or pouch to store it in when you’re not using the cup. If yours didn’t come with one, you can use any breathable pouch. You want to make sure you protect the cup from dirt and germs, but that there’s still plenty of air circulation. Store the pouch in a cold, dry location (such as a vanity drawer) where the cup can properly dry out before your next use.

The difference between cleaning and sterilizing Daily cleaning of the cup only removes some of the surface bacteria, odor, and buildup. However, sterilizing completely removes bacteria and preps the cup to be stored for the next time it’s used again.

What to do if… Caring for your menstrual cup might not always be so black and white. Here are a few situations that may arise. The cup has a foul odor Some vaginal smells are completely natural. But if you notice your cup is starting to pick up a sour smell, there are a few things you can do. First, take note of how long you’re wearing your cup. If you wear it for too long, this can increase the chance of an odor developing. It’s best to change it every 4 to 8 hours, if possible. Never wear it for more than 12 hours. When you clean the cup after every use, rinse it with a shot of cold water first. Hot water can lock in smells. Then, take an unused toothbrush to scrub the cup thoroughly. Finally, make sure you’re sanitizing your cup after each period. This will help prevent odors from setting in for the long haul. The cup has discoloration or stains Slight discoloration will likely happen over time. Some discoloration is preventable with a thorough sanitization before and after every period, and continual thorough cleaning. Similarly to how you can prevent odors, you can also use a clean toothbrush to scrub away stains when you’re doing your daily cleaning. If you notice extreme discoloration, it’s time for a new cup. Simply recycle or dispose of your old cup and replace it with a new one. The cup has white residue on it If you notice a white film after boiling your cup, don’t fret. This is completely normal. The white residue comes from hard water in certain regions. Simply rinse off the residue before inserting the cup. The cup fell into the toilet Whatever you do, don’t reinsert it right away. If it fell into clean toilet water at your home bathroom, chances are that you’ll be fine after sterilizing the cup in some boiling water. But if you dropped the cup in a public restroom, or if there’s pee or feces in the toilet, you might want to replace the cup entirely. An at-home sterilization might not be enough to remove the bacteria from these situations.

What can happen if it isn’t cleaned properly If you don’t clean your cup properly, bacteria, odors, stains, and erosion can occur. This could lead to irritation, or, in more rare cases, infection. This also means that your cup will likely need to be replaced more often. That’s why it’s recommended to keep up with your daily cleaning and monthly sterilization.

What to do if you develop an infection during or after use If you develop any type of infection during use, stop using the cup immediately and talk to a doctor or other healthcare professional. They’ll be able to determine the best steps moving forward. Signs of infection include: unusual vaginal discharge

vaginal pain or soreness

burning during urination or intercourse

foul odor from the vagina Yeast and bacterial infections are treatable. Just remember to replace the cup before your next period.","What you can and can’t use Do use a gentle, unscented, oil-free soap to maintain your menstrual cup.

Clean the World will be sending 120,000 bars of soap to be distributed by CORE and World Central Kitchen to vulnerable people within the Navajo Nation.

Clean the World Foundation, a global leader in water, sanitation, hygiene, and sustainability, has partnered with CORE and World Central Kitchen to assist efforts to combat the coronavirus in the Navajo Nation. Clean the World will be sending 120,000 bars of soap to be distributed by CORE and World Central Kitchen to vulnerable people within the Navajo Nation. Soapbox, a personal care company that donates one bar of soap for every Soapbox product purchased, is sponsoring the collaboration to get critically needed hygiene supplies to those who are most vulnerable.

“The need for hygiene supplies is significant,” says Sam Stephens, Executive Director, Clean the World Foundation. “The soap we provide will be used in emergency kits to serve those who are most at risk of dying from the disease, including the elderly and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.”

The Navajo Nation has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases per capita in the United States. More than 40% of all residents there live in poverty, and roughly 33% lack indoor plumbing. In addition, there are only 13 grocery stores spread out across more than 27,000 square miles – an area larger than Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts combined – making access to hygiene extremely challenging both economically and logistically. Progress has been made in recent weeks to make water available for more households, but soap is urgently needed so that families can practice proper hygiene and prevent the spread of the virus.

“Soap is a commodity that should be easily available and accessible to everyone regardless of economic status and we have always felt strongly about that,” says David Simnick, CEO & Co-Founder of Soapbox. “Soapbox is so honored to partner with Clean the World, CORE, and World Central Kitchen to help provide essential hygiene products to the Navajo Nation. Every customer who’s ever purchased a Soapbox product has helped make this donation possible and we look forward to continuing to serve those who need it most.”

264,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/7-ways-clean-plastic-and-other-ocean-pollution-simultaneously,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,7 ways to clean up plastic and other ocean pollution simultaneously,"Plastic has gone from the greatest invention of the modern era to one of the most challenging materials to manage. Each year, up to 13 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean, the equivalent of one garbage truck of waste every minute. The world has responded with countless initiatives, campaigns and agreements to ban plastic straws and bags; 127 countries have introduced legislation to regulate plastic bags.

But here’s the thing: Plastic bags and straws aren’t the ocean’s only pollution problem.

Visible plastic waste near the surface of the ocean — the kind that makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and garners the most attention — makes up just 3 percent of total plastic in the ocean. Plastic also sinks to the ocean floor, stays suspended in the water column or gets deposited out of the ocean in remote places, making clean-up difficult. The U.N. Environment Program estimated the global damage to marine environments from plastic pollution to be a minimum of $13 billion per year. And a whole host of non-plastic pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous fuel harmful algal blooms, antibiotics, heavy metals, pesticides, oil and gas and other debris. These pollutants enter the ocean directly, through rivers, stormwater or the wind. These substances have been damaging the environment, human health and the economy long before plastics became so prevalent.

Protecting human and marine health and harnessing the full benefits of a sustainable ocean economy will require not only reducing plastic waste, but also all ocean pollutants.

Seven interventions to tackle all ocean pollution

The sundry pollutants making their way into the ocean often share common pathways and root causes, such as a lack of access to sanitation and wastewater processing or inefficient use of natural resources. Tackling these root causes can have a compounding effect.

For example, improving wastewater management at scale in a city or region can reduce plastic entering the ocean while also reducing nutrient pollution, which in turn improves the health of fisheries and coral reefs. This means that there is an opportunity to capitalize on the attention being paid to plastic pollution in order to tackle multiple ocean pollutants at once.

A new Blue Paper commissioned by the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy highlights seven solutions that can reduce plastic pollution while also curbing other types of ocean pollution:

Improve wastewater management by developing and building sustainable wastewater infrastructure for the 3 billion people who lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. Untreated wastewater contains a number of pollutants such as pathogens, plastics and chemicals. It can pose a severe risk to human and environmental health through toxic exposure, vector-borne diseases and eutrophication. Improve stormwater management by implementing stormwater and storm drain filtration and river mouth trash collection. This can prevent wastes such as macroplastics (littered items), microplastics (tire dust) and chemicals on roadways from flowing into rivers and eventually, the ocean. Regulating the use of nutrients and pesticides and shifting behaviors — for example, the cultural norm around having a manicured lawn, which can increase the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers — also can ensure that these pollutants do not enter the ocean through stormwater. For example, a toxic algal bloom caused by nutrient pollution in the western Lake Erie basin in 2011 disrupted water supplies for 400,000 people. Adopt green chemistry practices and new materials. This includes banning hard-to-manage substances such as expanded polystyrene (commonly packaging material), limiting the use of chemicals of concern such as phthalates, and supporting materials research. Developing new materials that maintain the desirable performance characteristics of plastics but not the problematic ones, such as true biodegradables, could prevent plastics from causing as much harm if they do enter the ocean. Practice radical resource efficiency through plastic-use reduction. This includes imposing fees on single-use plastics, encouraging voluntary industry standards to reduce fossil-fuel-based plastics and shifting cultural norms around waste generation, consumption and reuse. For example, introducing carrier bag charges in the United Kingdom reduced the number of plastic bags used there by 80 percent, with 9 billion fewer plastic bags used since the legislation was introduced in 2015. Recover and recycle the materials we use in both formal and informal sectors by implementing extended producer responsibility laws, providing incentives for waste segregation and recycling, strengthening markets for recycled plastics and implementing ""Fishing for Litter"" programs. Only 9 percent of all plastic discarded since 1950 has been recycled, while 12 percent has been incinerated and the remaining 79 percent accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. Implement coastal zone improvements by, for example, restricting open ocean aquaculture. Shifting to sustainable land-based aquaculture systems could reduce a number of pollutants associated with coastal aquaculture, such as plastic pollution from lost or discarded gear and untreated waste with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous. Encouraging participation in Adopt-a-Beach programs and clean beach certifications such as Blue Flag and Project Aware can reduce litter on beaches and make people more aware of pollution. Build local systems for safe food and water by establishing drinking water treatment systems where needed, and ensuring adequate drinking water standards. This solution not only can reduce pollutants entering the ocean from the reduction in single-use plastic bottles, but also help the 1 in 3 people worldwide who lack access to clean drinking water.

Reducing pollution for a better ocean economy

These tactics can’t be done on a small scale or by a single entity. In order to be successful, it is essential that solutions include cross-sectoral public-private partnerships, innovative financing arrangements and capital from a range of sources.

For example, in Muncar, a small village in East Java, Indonesia, public-private partnership organizers built a waste management system and strategy to optimize waste collection and processing for both inorganic and organic wastes, change behaviors, set regulations and build institutional capacity. In December, 47,500 people received waste collection services, mostly for the first time, from two facilities established by the project. These facilities employ 80 local people and have collected 3,000 tons of waste that otherwise potentially would have ended up in the ocean.

By taking bold, integrated actions that address pollution across sectors, we can help build a sustainable ocean economy that can expand economic opportunities and improve the health and prosperity of millions of people. But our road to recovery must include the development of a circular economy. The notion that things can be thrown away is a myth. Plastic and other pollutants continue to pollute long after their shelf life is over. We need to ""turn off the tap"" and prevent pollution before it happens in the first place.","Visible plastic waste near the surface of the ocean — the kind that makes up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and garners the most attention — makes up just 3 percent of total plastic in the ocean.

Hisham has been a cleaner for more than ten years in his home city of Mocha, in the south-west of Yemen. “I work every day from early in the morning until noon,” he says.

He is grateful for his job with the local council, which is the only source of income for his family of seven. But it is not an easy job. There is a lot of physical effort needed to sweep the streets and heft heavy rubbish bags. And at times it is made harder by the attitudes of Hisham’s fellow residents.

“Sometimes we can face insulting remarks from people,” he admits.

Perhaps for this reason, Hisham has always appreciated those who have been supportive of his work, helping him to clean outside their houses and shops. “When the community joins us in a cleaning campaign,” he explains, “it encourages us to work harder.”

But recently, Hisham has been aware of a shift in attitudes. Because Yemen is now battling what the United Nations has called “full-blown” transmission of the novel coronavirus: Covid-19.

A race against time

It was the moment everyone had feared.

National authorities, UN and aid agencies had been racing against time to put in place measures against Covid-19. But five years of debilitating war means that Yemen is at a terrible disadvantage: severely weakened by hunger and disease, with its health system decimated.","He is grateful for his job with the local council, which is the only source of income for his family of seven.

The government of this West African country has funds to help it meet part of its commitments to donors, particularly the social support component for people affected by the project.

It is 853 million CFA francs (over 1.3 million euros) lent by the French Development Agency (AFD). The financing agreement for the Hann Bay clean-up project was recently signed between the French financial institution and the Senegalese authorities.

Work carried out by the Ludwig Pfeiffer company

The Hann Bay clean-up project is also supported by the European Union (EU). Its financing will be provided via AFD in accordance with a delegation of funds agreement signed in December 2019. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) is also financing this sanitation project near Dakar.

All of these donors have agreed with Senegal’s National Sanitation Office (Onas) to choose Ludwig Pfeiffer to implement the project. According to the company based in Kassel, Germany, “the aim of the project is not only to protect the environment, but also to improve the standard of living of the population by improving the collection and treatment of wastewater”.

Specifically, the work will involve the construction of a 13 km-long wastewater interceptor. This will allow the effluent to be channelled into a treatment plant capable of providing primary treatment of 25 000 m3 of wastewater per day. The treated water will then follow a 3 km sea outfall.

The garbage piles lining the banks of this 330 km long river are being cleared away. The operation was launched on the 21st of June 2020 by the JKPFM (Kankan Youth for the Protection of the Milo River). Besides cleaning up the banks of the river, the members of the NGO have requested the support of the Guinean Ministry in charge of the Environment to raise awareness among the riverside populations accused of dumping waste around the river. The brick makers operating along the banks agreed to move up to 50 m away from the banks of the river, as their activity is one of the main factors in the degradation of the Milo.

The JKPFM is seeking the support of the President of the Republic

The clean-up operations on the banks of the Milo River represent the first major achievement of the JKPFM, just after its creation in September 2019. They were made possible thanks to funding of 10 million CFA francs (about 15,245 euros), given to the young NGO by Colonel Mamady Toure of the national border service. “We make an urgent appeal to the entire government, especially Professor Alpha Condé, whom we know is concerned about this river. We also appeal to all people of good will, whether native of Kankan or not,” said Lamine 1 Kaba, the president of JKPFM.

The efforts undertaken by the JKPFM are crucial for the Milo River. This tributary of the Niger River had already lost its navigability. The river port of Kankan, which used to receive ships from Mali, is now in ruins. It is also abandoned “because the river flow pattern only allowed the movement of ships in the rainy season”. The ships must have flat bases and not be rounded.

The river’s fishing resources are also dying out. Fish scarcity has made fishing activities almost non-existent.

The seeds of this effort were sown back in 2016, when Government Higher Primary School in Nagawara village in Ramanagara district got its first set of toilets built under Project ABCD, an initiative of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) in support of Swachh Bharat Mission.

In the school, students were told the importance of maintaining good hygiene and were taught how to use the toilet, in addition to being shown how to maintain it. “We taught the students how to maintain the toilets themselves. This served two purposes: the toilets remained clean and it also broke the caste stigma,” says a volunteer of Sneha NGO, TKM’s implementing partner.

For many students, the situation at home was different: many families believed it was impure to have toilets inside the house. In some houses, the newly-built toilets were being used to store grains or other items.

Sinchana, then in Class 6, and her sister were staying at their grandmother’s home, which did not have a toilet. Neither did the house of her classmate Deekshita have one. These girls, like many others in their village, had to go to nearby fields to attend nature’s call. Fear would grip them whenever they stepped out to relieve themselves: fear of insects, animals and of being seen by others.

Now, aware of the difference a toilet can bring in their lives, Sinchana and Deekshita kept asking for a toilet to be built but both their families kept putting it off saying, they cannot afford it.

The girls were tired of their families’ lackadaisical attitude. After discussing the issue at school, Deekshita concluded that just pleading will not work and decided to take a tougher stand. She decided to go on a hunger strike – after all her dignity was at stake. In solidarity, even Sinchana decided to fast until a toilet got built.

The two girls refused to go to school as well. Taking a cue, 30 other students from Classes 5 to 7 also refused to go to school until a toilet was built at their homes. The students, who went on a dharna, found support in their teachers. The teachers weren’t mad at their students for missing school; instead they were proud that their students were taking a stand on an important social issue.

Forced to yield to their children’s demands, the families made arrangements for the money and began construction of the toilets.

“We never had sanitation facility at home, so we didn't know the advantages of having one. We got a toilet constructed due to the insistence of our children. Now, we are experiencing the huge difference a toilet can bring about in a person’s life,” says a parent.

Project ABCD, started in 2015, has seen several such inspiring community-driven efforts as it covered 1004 schools in 92 villages and has impacted the lives of over 58,000 school children. As a result of the project and the efforts of the children, a total 13,518 household toilets have been constructed and all the children have 100% sanitation facilities at their homes. One important outcome of this initiative is that the girl child missing school hours has come down to zero in Ramanagara district.

“The aim of Project ABCD is to bring about ‘A Behavioural Change through Demonstration’. The Covid-19 pandemic has further reinforced the importance of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene practices and now we intend to expand our project to a higher level of hygiene activities, so that such practices become incorporated into people’s way of life,” says Vikram Gulati, Senior Vice President, Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

With a ‘functional’ toilet at their homes, the girls are now working towards achieving bigger goals. Deekshita wants to become a Kannada teacher, Sinchana a doctor and her sister a lawyer. Their families couldn’t have been happier.","The manner in which Sinchana and Deekshita, two school students, inspired their village to become Open Defecation Free would have made Mahatma Gandhi proud.

270,https://www.cateringinsight.com/the-cleanest-clean/,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Catering Insight,The cleanest clean,"With the coronavirus having transformed the landscape of practically every element of daily life, even if the hospitality industry gets up and running again, its operations will look very different. One appliance that is going to be key in the fight against further outbreaks in the foodservice industry is the humble warewasher.

Wares will need to be cleaned to the highest standards, so when dealers come to recommend the most hygienic warewashers to operators, just who can they rely on?

At Hobart UK, equipment division sales director Tim Bender believes: “Ensuring ware can be sterilised in temperatures of up to 100°C has long been a consideration in hospitals, hospices and care homes, so this type of functionality has been built into a number of specialist Hobart machines. The Covid-19 crisis has simply made this type of machine more in demand.”

Story continues below Advertisement

He reported: “Since the beginning of the crisis we have seen a steady rise in dealers coming to us for quotes on specialist machines. This swiftly ramped up as the scale of the challenge deepened, especially in healthcare sites. Because of this, Hobart ensured a significant stockholding of such machines early on, making sure supply could meet demand.”

One of the manufacturer’s most popular of these machine types is a compact undercounter warewasher specifically designed for use in the care sector. Hobart Care’s patented technology means it is designed to deal with up to 80 racks per day, thermally disinfecting soiled ware with 100°C steam.

The compact (h x 820mm / w x 600mm / d x 600mm) undercounter machine is claimed to be 90% faster than a household model, using 80% less water and 65% less than its semi-professional counterpart.

Alongside this, as part of Hobart’s new generation of smart undercounter warewashers, the firm recently introduced a Premax Care S model – a double rack thermal disinfection dishwasher.

The machine features Vapostop² technology, designed to end to clouds of steam being generated when the machine door opens. It also includes a new Top-Dry drying function which should help to eradicate hand drying, and Wash-Smart connectivity which lets operators control the integral functionality of the new undercounter machines at the touch of a button.

A new Visiotronic-Touch control should simplify the functionality of the machine with a display that visualises information using both text and symbols.

Over at Miele Professional, recently-appointed category manager Claire Humphrey emphasised: “Sanitation offerings within warewashing products are now more important than ever. The best way to ensure optimum sanitation is through the use of fresh-water dishwashers – using technology that changes the water at each stage of the cycle. Thorough rinsing is carried out at the suitable temperature, which ensures a high standard of hygiene with every wash, exceeding the minimum hygiene requirements (49-60°C with final rinse of 82-88°C).

“Our intelligent dishwasher technology incorporates hot water connections, a three-phase current and a powerful heat-pump, to ensure optimum programme durations and high sanitation results.”

But has the coronavirus pandemic elicited an increased hygiene consideration at Miele? “We have always produced commercial equipment with exceptional hygiene standards, and we will continue to do so,” responded Humphrey. “Our German manufacturing uses precision engineering to deliver quality products with the latest in dishwashing technology.

“We have always kept an optimum balance between wash process efficiency and hygiene standards. Advanced programme design within our design and manufacturing process allows us to achieve a highly efficient wash process and speed of cycle without compromising on the hygiene factors.”

Other hygiene-related product developments include optional drying at the end of a cycle to avoid the need for drying items by hand, automatic detergent dispensing, using a dispenser module to avoid the selection of a program with little to no detergent by mistake, as well as a final rinse temperature that can reach 85°C.

For Winterhalter, its models’ rinse cycle can reach 82°C, which it believes ensures that crockery is sanitised and is hygienically clean and safe. According to UK MD Stephen Kinkead: “Sites with high risk requirements may decide they need a machine that offers thermal disinfection. This means they meet HMT2030 regulations by washing at 73°C for 3 minutes. Winterhalter offers a range of thermal disinfection models.”

Thermal disinfection uses a combination of higher water temperature and longer wash times. Kinkead advised: “Obviously this will mean the machine will take longer to run through a wash cycle, and it will require more energy to heat up the water. Specifiers need to take these factors into account when selecting the machine, to ensure it is large enough to handle the expected load.”

He detailed that during the coronavirus crisis: “We have been contacted by customers wanting information and reassurance in terms of the effectiveness of the sanitising in a wash cycle. Provided the machine is operating correctly and has been well maintained, then the wash will be effective.”

Kinkead also believes the manufacturer’s Connected Wash remote appliance monitoring capability will be able to help with hygiene, as it can warn if a machine’s chemicals are not being topped up correctly, for instance, or can also monitor the temperature of a wash.

Winterhalter also recently launched the CTR, a compact rack conveyor system, showcasing the company’s latest washing innovation: hygiene mode. This is designed to detect change in the temperature of wash water, automatically slowing the rack speed down, to enable a thorough, hygienic wash, even if the temperature drops.

Over at Meiko, it claims its dishwashers are proven to deliver a high temperature wash and rinse sufficient to achieve sanitisation. UK MD Paul Anderson said: “Our machines are tested and certified to European standard DIN 10534 which kills coronavirus and a host of other bacteria such as E.coli.

“For Meiko, uncompromising hygiene is our first priority. This has become especially important recently. Our decades of experience in disinfecting medical devices has turned us into hygiene specialists – and we are in demand. This also goes for our commercial warewashing technology, which is coronavirus free at the end of the washing or cleaning process.”

Business at Meiko Group headquarters in Offenburg, Germany continued mostly as normal throughout lockdown, with social distancing measures implemented. The R&D team did not have to change its overall direction to respond to the coronavirus crisis though, according to Anderson: “Given that Meiko dishwashers are already proven effective against viruses etc, the question for the R&D and our marketing teams is: how do we better communicate that the machine has achieved sanitisation?

“Meiko leads the field in ‘hygienic features’; such as the colour coded handle on our M-iClean dishwashers which confirms from a distance to the customer and the user that the wash load has been successfully washed and sanitised. Records of final rinse temperatures are easily downloaded, and built-in safeguards ensure the rinse cycle will not start until sufficient temperature has been achieved.”

However, he underlined: “It must be emphasised that achieving ‘sufficient temperature’ is only ensured by the use of regular preventative maintenance by properly trained professional engineers. Their role includes calibrating the relevant devices in the machine to ensure continued accuracy.”

At Wexiödisk, it feels that its compact WD-4S model can help with sanitation concerns, featuring rounded corners plus a door which can be placed in a hygienic position in order to prevent the growth of bacteria.

David Glover, UK and Ireland country manager, analysed: “Whilst the coronavirus pandemic may have elicited an increased hygiene consideration for some manufacturers, at Wexiödisk, hygiene has always been top of the agenda. In fact, one of our company missions is to ‘always be clean’, with our products and our ethos.

“Still, that does not mean to say that there aren’t new solutions that we are currently looking at. Plus, at this time, we are encouraging dealers and operators to prioritise hygiene by investing in a complete warewashing solution, rather than just a single unit.”

When asked how the crisis impacted the Swedish manufacturer’s product development, Glover said: “Whilst the pandemic hasn’t yet prompted a change in direction from a R&D point of view, it has pushed us to launch some of our most popular public sector models here in the UK. This is due to increased demand for superior, sanitary systems. For example last month, we launched our automatic cutlery sorter, the ACS-800, to the UK market.”

However, he was also keen to emphasise: “It’s worth noting that it appears to be an industry-wide misunderstanding that commercial warewashers are capable of disinfecting items. Disinfection is a task required in medical environments. Still, whilst you cannot disinfect dishes in a dishwasher, you can ensure the highest hygiene possible, particularly when investing in a quality warewasher with HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) system such as those offered by Wexiödisk.

“Coming as standard with all of Wexiödisk’s UK models, this HACCP system automatically monitors a number of critical hygiene points such as water flow and temperature. These critical control points will then be flagged on the machine’s control, and will set off an alarm/automatically shut the unit down, depending on the severity of the issue.”

Elsewhere, Electrolux Professional’s design and product manager Steve Bowler urged: “One of the best ways to maximise sanitation is to ensure the design of a warewasher reduces the amount of surfaces within the machine that dirt can collect on. For example, Electrolux Professional’s green&clean hood type dishwasher has rounded corners in the cavity, and is designed to be as smooth and easy to clean as possible. The wash tank and bottom section of the cavity are pressed from a single sheet of stainless steel, meaning there are no dirt traps or corners that could impact on overall cleanliness.”

He added that on the double skin models of this warewasher, a slanted ceiling means the wash water runs down to the bottom of the slope, which should avoiding dripping.

Bowler underlined: “Electrolux Professional products have always been designed to provide the best wash results possible, with sanitation of the wares an integral part of this process. The main question that we are being asked at the moment, understandably, is if our dishwashers kill the virus.

“The rapid onset of Covid-19 means that we have not specifically tested our machines against the infection, but all of our warewashers have been designed to offer the highest levels of sanitation. In terms of medical-grade warewashing, we have the Medical Line undercounter dishwasher which fulfils hospital requirements over thermal disinfection levels.”

Over at Smeg, UK commercial channel director Phil Coulstock stressed: “Smeg has fortunately always considered high levels of sanitisation a priority in the design of our commercial tank dishwashers. It’s easy to go chasing the lowest rinse water consumption or lowest running costs but it’s vital to strike the right balance between the affordability of running a machine day to day and being able to guarantee high levels of wash performance and sanitisation of the things being washed.

“The key features Smeg uses to strike this balance are the high temperature rinse system (HTR) which ensures the water leaving the boiler during the critical rinse cycle is as hot at the start of the rinse cycle as at the end, as well as guaranteeing the water pressure via our rinse booster pump (standard on all Smeg machines) and the time it is dispensed for too. The guarantee in rinse temperature is achieved by preventing fresh cold inlet water into the boiler until the rinse cycle has finished avoiding contamination and dilution of the rinse water temperature.”

Coulstock commented: “I hope the devastating events of recent months help to improve the UK buyer’s considerations for sanitisation and hygiene features on the machines they purchase and specify, whether this is distributors, buyers for groups or single site end users.

“The health and wellbeing of the people they are catering for has never been in greater focus than now and although economically the world has suffered greatly, this situation should highlight the avoidance of buying equipment (not just warewashing) with just purchase price in mind. It is as much the duty of the buyer to insist on the right product for them as it is the role of us as the manufacturer to produce affordable, feature packed products able to do the job they were designed to do well.”

He concluded: “Smeg has a full range of machines designed by our instruments division, who for over 40 years have been designing and building machines capable of fully disinfecting medical and surgical instruments. Therefore, Smeg is extremely well equipped to offer high specification products such as our SWT range that combine the features and build quality of the instrument world with the disinfection requirements of the foodservice industry.”

Future features

How are warewashing manufacturers going to ensure that their machines help to maintain high hygiene standards going forwards? According to Miele Professional’s category manager Clare Humphrey: “We will continue to design and build our products with hygiene and disinfection at the forefront of our creative vision. Our dishwashers are designed to carry out thermal disinfection of their contents and are certified with WRAS Fluid Risk Category 5 approval. This is to the standard required for healthcare establishments and meeting these guidelines has helped us to be prepared for the effects of Covid-19 and gives us scope to adapt easily to any future government guidelines that may come about as a result of Covid-19.”

And at Winterhalter, UK MD Stephen Kinkead emphasised: “During new product development, all Winterhalter warewashers are tested and retested to ensure the disinfection and hygienic cleanliness of the wash results. It’s our mantra. To be fair, it is almost certainly the mantra of all quality manufacturers. That ethos will continue in the future.”

While Electrolux Professional’s design and product manager Steve Bowler explained: “Given that the primary function of a warewasher is to clean and sanitise its contents, our products have always been designed to provide the best wash results possible. Moving forward, there may be greater cooperation with test labs that are capable of testing for bacteria and viruses to certify the models, but purely from a design perspective it will be business as usual i.e. the highest standards of sanitation possible.”","For Winterhalter, its models’ rinse cycle can reach 82°C, which it believes ensures that crockery is sanitised and is hygienically clean and safe.

Their primary purpose is to sacrifice themselves to protect our noggins. When you bang your head, their outer shell crushes to spread out and lessen the force of the impact before the soft EPS liner compresses to mitigate G-forces before they reach your delicate brain. But that’s not all helmets do. They protect you from abrasion in a slide, keeping your face pretty, and they absorb all manner of small impacts from juicy or stinging bugs to pebbles that your riding buddy’s sticky rear tire kicks up to face level. On the inside, their padding helps keep you comfortable by wicking away sweat while doing its best to limit noise and protect your hearing.

All of this means that you need to care for the lid that cares for you. The exterior should be cleaned and polished regularly. Special care should be taken on the delicate surfaces, particularly the visor. The interior has its own set of needs. The intimate contact it has with your face and scalp means that the liner absorbs your oils and sweat, leading to the dreaded helmet funk. However, with a little love, you can keep your helmet looking and smelling great for years, extending the useful life of the most important – and often most expensive – pieces of protective gear many motorcyclists own.

Exterior Cleaning

When it comes to your helmet’s exterior, there are two levels of cleaning. The first is a quick post-ride cleaning/wipe down. The second, we’ll call a deep cleaning that you do a couple of times a season.

To keep your helmet clean and not allow the dead bugs to harden and possibly etch themselves into your helmet’s finish, we recommend a quick post-ride cleaning. Often, just wetting a paper towel or microfiber cloth and laying it over the goo for a minute or two will be enough to soften up the debris. Then use a cloth/towel or two to gently scrub the surface until it shines. Stubborn crust can be removed by using a motorcycle-specific cleaner, like our current favorite S100 Detail & Wax. Do not use harsh chemicals. Window cleaner and dish soap are too strong for use on your helmet. Window cleaner, in particular, can dry out and accelerate the aging of your helmet’s surface. If you ask the people who maintain helmets for a living, the Arai and Shoei support at racing series, they’ll tell you that they just use water and elbow grease.

A deep cleaning of your helmet starts out in a similar fashion with placing warm, wet microfiber cloths over the helmet’s exterior to soften the dirt. Start by removing your visor. We’ll wash it separately. If your helmet is extremely dirty, like a mud-covered off-road helmet, don’t be afraid to hold it under running water to flush away the biggest chunks of dirt. (Just be sure to remove any electronics, such as helmet communicators first.) Wiping built-up dirt off a helmet – even with a wet cloth – could scratch the finish. Don’t worry if you get the interior wet, it will dry out, and you can assist it with a fan (never a hair dryer).

Using microfiber cloths soaked in water and a mild soapy solution (baby shampoo works great), wipe away the dirt. Rinse the cloth frequently. Cruft caught in vents or visor seals can be removed with a soft-bristled toothbrush or Q-Tip. Once the helmet’s surface is clean, dry it off with a clean microfiber cloth. If you want to make sure the helmet is easier to clean in the future, you can give it a coat of carnauba wax or do it in a spray-on manner with S100 Detail & Wax.

The Delicate Visor

The visor gets special treatment because some manufacturers use special coatings on the interior to prevent fogging, and cleaning this with harsh chemicals could render it useless. With warm weather and mild soap on your fingers wet the visor and then clean it with the lightest touch possible. Rinse it with warm water, and dry it with a clean microfiber cloth.

If your faceshield uses a Pinlock Visor, you’ll want to wash it the same way, but you’ll need to be even more careful with the easy-to-scratch surface of the Pinlock. Do not dry it with a cloth, though. You can blow the excess water off with a hair dryer set to cool and then let it air dry before remounting it on your face shield.

Interior Rejuvenation

The easiest way to clean your helmet interior is to remove the liner and padding (if possible) and place it in a mesh garment bag. Then place it in your washing machine on the most delicate setting and wash with Woolite. Take it out of the machine immediately and let it air dry. If you want to speed it up, use a fan to blow air across it. Never use a hair dryer because it could damage the glues holding the liner and padding together.

If you can’t remove the helmet liner, you can still clean the interior, but it will take significantly longer to dry. You’ll need clean cloths and a bowl of mild soapy warm water. Remove any liner components that you can. Also, remove any electronics, like a communication system. Then with the soapy cloth, begin to scrub the interior of the helmet one section at a time. Don’t be afraid to saturate the liner as you scrub it. After each section is cleaned, scrub it out with clean cloths saturated with clean warm water. You want to get all of the soap out of the liner and the padding. Don’t be afraid to really saturate the liner with clean wet rags as the final step.

To dry the helmet interior, press the liner and padding with clean dry cloths until no more water comes out. Then place the helmet in a place with good air circulation to dry. Helmet manufacturers recommend that you not leave them in the sun to accelerate the process. Instead, put the helmet in front of a fan to increase the airflow over it.

Finally, a word of warning about helmet interiors. Only use cleaners that are specifically manufactured for helmets, but be careful, some cleaners are for the exterior only. So, make sure you’ve got the right type of cleaner. We are quite fond of Motorex Helmet Cleaner. Also, don’t be tempted to deodorize by wiping the interior with dryer sheets. It may smell good, but these fabric softeners contain chemicals that may irritate the skin in the concentrated form they are in on the sheets.

If you take care of the interior and exterior of your helmet, you can keep it looking new for many years. We certainly don’t want to ride around in a ratty-looking helmet, and we’re pretty sure that nobody wants to stick their head in one that smells like old socks. Go ahead and clean your helmet today.

272,https://news.samsung.com/za/tips-to-clean-your-smartphone,"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Samsung Newsroom South Africa,Tips To Clean Your Smartphone,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa – 29 June 2020

Just as thorough hand washing and other hygienic practices have become key aspects of our daily lives, keeping our smartphones clean should also form a key part of our self-sanitation routines given just how much we interact with our mobile devices.

So, how exactly can you continue to use your smartphone and stay hygienic? Read on for some suggestions as to how you can effectively and safely clean your smartphone.

Why Do You Need to Clean Your Smartphone?

According to a study by global consultancy firm Deloitte, American users view their smartphones around 14 billion times a day, with each individual user picking up their phone 52 times a day on average. South Africans spend more time using social media platforms than the global average, much of this on our mobile device*. As we enter a phase of telecommuting and remote communication, these numbers are only set to increase.

Best Practice Smartphone Hygiene

The first thing to remember when looking to keep your Galaxy device clean is not to use general cleaners, compressed air sprays or disinfectant and bleach-based products. While these might be useful in keeping communal spaces around the home hygienic, these solutions can peel off or damage the oleophobic coating layer over your smartphone’s display that shields the screen from fingerprint smudging.

In order to keep enjoying the best experience with your Galaxy smartphone after cleaning, be sure to fully power down your device and remove its case, cables and other accessories. Once you have done this, use a lint-free microfiber cloth to wipe down the exterior of the device.

If needed, you can use a small amount of distilled water or disinfectant, such as a hypochlorous acid-based (50-80ppm) or alcohol-based (over 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol) product – but always apply these to your microfiber cloth, not directly to your phone, and be sure to avoid getting any liquid in your phone’s openings.

273,https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/heat-make-german-buildings-nearly-climate-neutral,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Clean Energy Wire,The heat is on to make German buildings 'nearly' climate-neutral,"Fossil-fired status quo

At present, almost 65 percent of Germany's 20.7 million heating systems are fuelled by gas and about a third are oil-fired. Only about four and five percent are respectively biomass boilers and heat pumps. Renewables covered just above 14 percent of all heating in 2018, overwhelmingly supplied by biomass. This level is right on target, but has also stagnated for almost a decade.

Although some development is seen in the area of new buildings, existing German households' preferred energy source when switching has over the last ten years – with more than 80 percent – remained natural gas. Keeping in mind that heating systems often have a working life of 30 years, this is ""an unfavourable development, from my point of view,"" says Hufendiek, ""because all the heaters we install today will still be in operation or will only by replaced by 2050. By that time, we aim have to have eradicated all emissions from space heating already."" A dilemma known as the lock-in effect.

To avoid this situation, the UK, on its part, has announced a ban on gas boilers in new homes from 2025 while the Netherlands, a long-time major gas producer, aims for all of the country's residential buildings to be off gas by 2050. In Germany, however, government support for gas heaters is planned to continue for systems that can be made ""renewables ready"" within two years after installation.

The German heating industry, with well-known names like Bosch, Viessmann and Vaillant, is a market leader in classic oil and gas boilers, Volker Breisig, partner in business consultancy PwC’s energy practice told Clean Energy Wire. “You could compare it to the German car industry, which banked on what was successful for a very long time – the classic engine.” But by now, it has – like BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen – embraced the need for a swift transition to more climate-friendly solutions, adds Breisig. The sector still faces challenges in moving its focus to other technologies, more complex energy management systems and the many possibilities in sector coupling, however, he says.

Part of the slow development in the sector has been a lack of political direction, says Breisig. Although changes are happening in new buildings, “we still don’t have a clear roadmap for the existing building stock."" This has led to an overarching trend of “wait-and-see”, when it comes to both renovation and replacement of systems, he adds. ""Politicians have long failed to realise the importance of setting the right framework conditions."" If the electricity needed to operate a heat pump remains too expensive in comparison to the use of gas or oil, the industry will continue to have a hard time selling the more climate-friendly alternative.","Fossil-fired status quoAt present, almost 65 percent of Germany's 20.7 million heating systems are fuelled by gas and about a third are oil-fired.

For media mogul and entrepreneur Cathy Hughes, this year’s Mother’s Day was going to be difficult.

Last July, Hughes’s mother, Helen Jones Woods, 96, died from complications of Covid-19. For the 74-year-old Hughes, multi-millionaire and founder and chairperson of Urban One Inc., this year marks Hughes’s first Mother’s Day without her mother present.

And while many might consider those individuals able to spend more than seven decades with their mother as fortunate, Hughes said such longevity also created a startling realization. “The longer God blesses you with having your mother in your life, the more difficult it is to adjust to life without her,” she said.

It was during Hughes’s mourning, that she birthed an idea to not only celebrate her mother’s life with a national TV program, but to also celebrate and honor the lives of other African American women who -specifically during the pandemic – worked at protecting and spotlighting Black Americans.

On Sunday, May 16, 2012 at 9 p.m. (EST) Hughes’s cable TV networks, TV One and its sister network CLEO-TV, will air the network’s annual “Urban One Honors” celebration. The two-hour program this year will be a first; all honorees are African American women. The show is themed “Women Leading the Change.”

Hughes said the women honored left an indelible mark on the country last year, one of this nation’s darkest and most challenging periods in American history due to the deadly pandemic.

The show is co-hosted by Grammy-award winning singer and syndicated gospel radio show host Erica Campbell and award-wining journalist and news commentator Roland Martin. The recorded, virtual awards show will feature live performances by R&B saangers, Avery Sunshine and Jazmine Sullivan, gospel powerhouse Le’Andria Johnson and legendary rapper, Da Brat.

The program will honor six Black female leaders in business, politics, journalism and humanitarian efforts including Atlanta’s political powerhouse and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Stacey Abrams and Rosaline “Roz” Brewer, chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance and the nation’s third Fortune 500 company ever led by a Black female executive. The program will also honor the four African American, Greek sororities; Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho, Inc. and Zeta Phi Beta, Inc.

The show will also pay tribute to Hughes’s mother, who before becoming a wife and mother, was a famed trombone player who played with an all-girl, integrated swing music band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm in the 1930s and 1940’s. Hughes called her mother’s group, “the original Freedom Fighters” who traveled by bus through the South playing for audiences and even played clubs overseas. At one point, white and Hispanic band members had to wear dark makeup to look like their Black bandmates to avoid being stopped by police for promoting integration, Hughes recalled. The segment will be introduced by a longtime fan of the group, political activist, author and college professor Angela Davis.

Hughes’s excitement about the upcoming evening is electric. An hour before “Urban One Honors” airs, TV One will broadcast an exclusive, hour-long interview with legendary rapper DMX. The interview was recorded for the network’s weekly show “Uncensored” about three weeks before DMX’s sudden death April 9 at age 50. The show’s producers said DMX spoke, at times through tears, about his life, his music and his legacy. The producers said hearing DMX’s commentary just weeks before his death, is more sobering and haunting today.

After the celebration of one of the kings of rap music with “Uncensored,” the TV network will then celebrate its queens with the “Urban One Honors.”

“I think it’s going to be the biggest night in TV One’s history,” Hughes exclaimed.

Hughes, along with a group of Urban One executives chose the honorees because they wanted viewers, especially young girls, to see Black women who were not celebrated singers, dancers or actresses, but instead who were ideological firebrands, making differences in their communities and around the nation.

“These women aren’t the Real Housewives of you name the city. These women are working on improving the lives of Black folk,” Hughes said in a recent interview. Please encourage your young women to watch this show. We don’t know who the next Kamala Harris will be, a Black woman who became the nation’s first woman vice president or someone who changes the voting structure like Stacey Abrams.”

Hughes described Abrams as “voting rights champion” who not only changed the political landscape of Atlanta, but also helped ensure all voters were recognized on behalf of two U.S. Senate Democratic candidates and helped flip Georgia from majority Republican to majority Democrat.

When Walgreen’s selected Spelman College graduate Roz Brewer as its newest CEO in January, Brewer became the nation’s second Black female executive to ever lead a Fortune 500 company. Before being tapped by Walgreen’s, Brewer served as chief operating officer for Starbucks. Prior to that, she served as CEO of Sam’s Club which is owned by Walmart. In 2009, Ursula Burns, became the nation’s first Black female CEO of a Fortune 500 company when Xerox Holdings selected her as its CEO. Burns retired in 2017. The third Black woman CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company, Thasunda Brown Duckett, was named president and CEO of the retirement and investment managing company TIAA in February, a month after Brewer.

The TV One program is also honoring Ala Stanford, a Philadelphia-based physician and surgeon who last year founded the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium and used her own funds to ensure Black residents of the city – a group that was quickly becoming Philadelphia’s hardest hit by the pandemic – were able to be tested for the coronavirus.

Urban One, is based in Silver Spring, Md. about 30 minutes from downtown Washington, D.C. Last year, Hughes and other Urban One executives watched as Kim Ford, president and chief executive of Martha’s Table, provided healthy meals and fresh produce to needy residents in the nation’s capital during the pandemic.

For more than 40 years, Martha’s Table has ensured the neediest of Washington residents had healthy meals and clothing. Martha’s Table was named after the Biblical figure Martha who offered food to Jesus when he visited the home she shared with her sister Mary.

As a youth growing up in Washington, Ford volunteered serving and handing out meals with the non-profit organization. Then in 2019, she was chosen as the company’s president and chief executive. Prior to being named Martha’s Table chief executive, Ford served as deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education where she oversaw management of more than $2 billion in career and technical education, adult education, correctional and re-entry education and community college initiatives for more than 25 million students a year. Ford previously served as a member of President Obama’s Recovery Implementation Office, which was responsible for implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Last year, Martha’s Table reported a 400 percent increase in need from users, as thousands of residents sought assistance for themselves and their families enabling the program to feed as many as 2,200 residents a day, Martha’s Table reported recently.

Another honoree, Robin Rue Simmons, is an alderman in Evanston’s fifth ward in Louisiana. A champion of Black residents in the city, Simmons was elected alderman in 2017. Simmons then led Evanston to becoming the first U.S. city to approve a reparations program. Since taking office, Simmons led the passing of the nation’s first reparations program, which will be funded by the first $10 million of Adult Use Cannabis sales tax revenue. Simmons is also the director of the city’s innovation and outreach at Sunshine Enterprises, which has supported more than 1000 neighborhood entrepreneurs – 98 percent of whom are African American and 74 percent of whom are women – in starting or growing their own business ventures.

Also being honored is New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones. Hannah-Jones covered racial injustice for the Times’s magazine before convincing the paper’s top editors to create an entire investigative series tied to the U.S. slave trade. The enterprise was called the 1619 Project which was published by the magazine in 2019. Last year the project won Jones the coveted Pulitzer Prize. The series is now the subject of a documentary produced by Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Films and Lionsgate and is scheduled to air on Hulu.

“We wanted to spotlight Sisters who were getting the change accentuated and making sure the change occurs,” Hughes said.

The show will also feature several noted Black men honoring the sisters. Black Entertainment Television founder Bob Johnson makes his debut appearance on TV One. Also providing commentary on the honorees include Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Urban One CEO and Hughes’s son Alfred C. Liggins III and former Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond.

As co-host of the evening’s program, Campell said she hoped families with young daughters and young sons watch the program together and discuss the awardees and their work.

“I can have a conversation with my daughters to show them there is more to do than just look cute and wear nice makeup,” Campbell said. “They can literally shake up the world. Far too many of our girls look up to one dimensional type of celebrities or influencers. There is so much more than what we can be or what we can do. Offer this wide range of women who are changing the world.”

That was the impotence of the show, says Hughes. “Young people are so focused on celebrities. I wanted to focus this awards’ show on actions. The entertainment industry was shut down for the year. But these individuals we are honoring continued to work during the year,” Hughes said. “During the pandemic, these women were actively engaged.”

And while this year was for the ladies, what about the men? “Who knows maybe next year it will be brothers only,” Hughes said.","An hour before “Urban One Honors” airs, TV One will broadcast an exclusive, hour-long interview with legendary rapper DMX.

Superintendent Vincent said for several decades citizens continue to reside in the midst of abundant resources but their living condition remains the same year after year.

He made specific reference to residents residing around the concession areas of Bea Mountain Mining Company in the county.

He made these assertions recently in an interview with FrontPageAfrica at a ground breaking ceremony held in the county recently.

In 2013, Bea Mountain Mining Company, previously Aureus Mining, signed a Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) with the Government of Liberia (GOL) to extract minerals from western Liberia.

According to Superintendent Vincent, the corporate social development fund owed the county by the company has not been fully settled for a prolong period of time.

""It is true that we have all of the natural resources but we are far behind when it comes to development. We can attribute that to the lack of unity or togetherness,"" he said.

He pointed out that local authorities of the county will continue to engage authorities of the company to help improve the living condition of citizens within its concession areas.

""It is true that our people there are living in deplorable condition; they are in the darkness and they have been complaining about poor sanitary condition. But we will continue to engage them (company) because you can't be extracting our resources, 24 hours you are running current and you can't give the people lights"".

But responding to the Superintendent's allegations, Henry Vincent, Bea Mountain Community Relations Officer, said the company is working with the county to impact the lives of locals in its project affected communities.

""The company has established the community development fund, which five members representative from the mine and five members from the county are part to control the follow of cash, which the mine will put in cash yearly for county development,"" he said.

The Bea Mountain Community Relations Officer also said that the company is providing livelihoods opportunities for the project affected people by giving out micro loan program to five established groups, which he added is creating huge economic development for the people.

""The mine [company] has made arrangement with LBDI bank to provide more funding for the micro loan program at the end of coronavirus,"" he said.

""The company is also trying to establish the African for the women of Kinjor Town and agriculture program as well as long and short term job for the affected communities.""

The mine has always identified with all its project affected communities by donating rice at all time and also support community initiatives, he said, adding that the company has made several donations to the county since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Superintendent has called on ""sons and daughters hailing from Grand Cape Mount"" to desist from tearing each other apart and live in harmony to move the county and Liberia at large forward.

He added that the county can only be developed if citizens, regardless of tribal or political affiliations, put aside their differences and unite

""We need to come together and build the unity that we need. Let's forge ahead and build our county,"" he said.

Despite being one of the original counties of Liberia, residents of Grand Cape Mount remain faced with numerous constraints including bad road condition, lack of access to adequate sanitation, pipe borne water, electricity, modernized public high schools and health facilities, among others.

The lack of job opportunities in the county has compelled most young people to engage into illegal mining and fishing activities, while struggling mothers have to plant crops, particularly cassava, and sell other produce to provide food for them and their respective family members.","He made specific reference to residents residing around the concession areas of Bea Mountain Mining Company in the county.

During the session, the pair discussed the challenges of remaining operational during the pandemic and lessons on how the department has worked to overcome some of these issues.

Garcia says that early in March, DSNY recognized that the virus was going to pose operational challenges for the city’s waste workers as the pandemic spread through communities. To deal with these challenges, she says the department put specific plans and safeguards together to protect the city’s workforce. This included regular cleaning of all touch surfaces in the trucks, disseminating face masks, starting shifts earlier at 5 a.m. to avoid the public, limiting the number of individuals working at different garages to cut down on the potential spread of the virus, and encouraging social distancing whenever possible.

Despite the city’s efforts to protect all workers, Garcia says that around 628 workers have tested positive for the virus, with more likely to have contracted the virus in mid-March before ample testing was available.

The spread of the virus among workers led to approximately 25 percent of the city’s workforce being out at any one time. “[The spread among our workers] really required everyone who was here to shore up the difference, but while there were certain delays in collections, we pretty much got it every single day,” Garcia notes.

The worker shortage among frontline personnel, however, did not seem to noticeably compromise the city’s transfer and final disposal operations.

To help cover shifts for workers out sick, Garcia says DSNY’s budget did expand to cover overtime, but without federal intervention “there will be even bigger cuts to municipal budgets.” Already, the city has had to reduce its number of sanitation workers by around 400, suspend its curbside organics program, and close some special waste drop-off sites and composting sites. However, Garcia notes that she is cautiously optimistic that the federal government will provide financial assistance to rectify some of these issues.

One factor that was unique to New York City was that residential waste volumes actually declined during periods of the last few months. Garcia surmised this was due to factors including residents leaving the city and riding the virus out in their summer homes or other locations and citizens being more mindful of not wasting food due to not wanting to go to the grocery store.

Garcia also said that the economic fallout of closed businesses in the city resulted in a drop between 70 and 90 percent in private collection. Because Garcia says nobody knows how the business community is going to respond to the continuing spread of the virus, the city’s commercial waste zone implementation and request for proposals has been delayed indefinitely since “it will be very difficult to bid for work when nobody knows [when business activity is going to resume],” Garcia says.

Although Garcia says she doesn’t know when the city might issue RFPs for its commercial waste zones, the earliest could be late fall.

As to the city’s recycling, Garcia says that DSNY has been able to protect itself from market downturns thanks to its contracts.

“In New York City with how we’re structured, we have revenue contracts on all of our paper regardless of the market, and we pay a processing fee and share revenue, so when revenues are down, it’s not hurtful to us on the metal, glass and plastic front,” Garcia says. “So, what we see is that we’ll be able to continue to provide this [recycling] service to New Yorkers through the support that we have with those contracts. Obviously, we watch the market and understand the challenges we’ve had with paper over the last year and a half, but we continue to be willing to make that investment.”

Singling out the curbside organics program, Garcia says the city would have to be much more healthy fiscally to resume and that mandatory participation would be needed to ensure program efficiencies at scale.

When asked what lessons could be learned from the city’s response to COVID-19, Garcia says that protecting the jobs of sanitation and truck maintenance workers, having ample trucks to collect waste, and having technology to deploy routing instructions remotely and keep track of individual truck volumes and costs were all essential components for continuing the city’s collection.

“Investing in your team in good times, when you may need to be [talking about] the backup to the backup to the backup [staff member] is very, very important,” Garcia says. “The human capital part of this is where I would want to keep making the investment and make sure they have the tools they need to do the job.”

STEVIA FOR DAIRY

Brenntag North America said there is growing awareness among consumers about the health impact of empty calories, added sugar and nonfamiliar ingredients in food products. As a result, food marketers are eager to find solutions offering a clean, sweet taste with the least number of calories and a consumer-friendly ingredient statement. With these influences, the zero-calorie plant-based sweetener stevia is finding its way into many new dairy product launches. The main categories of stevia inclusion are spoonable yogurt with and without fruit prep, drinkable kefir-type yogurt, cultured milk drinks, flavored milk and plant-based milk alternatives. Brenntag’s Reb A, D and M stevia leaf extracts are all applicable in dairy foods, including sweet desserts such as frozen yogurt, ice cream and kulfi.

LIQUID CANE SUGAR

Sugaright, a subsidiary of CSC Sugar, said Sugaright L350 liquid cane sugar is an economical and sustainable alternative to traditional water-white liquid sugar. Innovative companies modified their decades-old liquid sugar color specifications when they discovered that darker color options have no significant impact on the color or flavor of their finished products. Sugaright L350 can be used in products such as ice cream, yogurt and beverages. Fair Trade Certified, Bonsucro certified and Non-GMO Project Verified options are available to meet sustainability demands.

RAW CANE SUGAR

Domino Foods Inc., a subsidiary of ASR Group, said golden granulated raw cane sugar is getting increased attention from food manufacturers eager to meet consumer demands for less-processed ingredients. Raw cane sugar is mill-made and undergoes a single crystallization process. Available in granulated, extra-fine, powdered and liquid variations, as a 1:1 replacement for white sugar, raw cane sugar is not just a source of sweetness; it also has a mild caramel color and flavor that can add a premium feel to a variety of food products such as yogurt and ice cream.

SUGAR SUBSTITUTE

According to Ingredion Incorporated, consumers have been choosing between the taste and mouthfeel of sugar and their desire to reduce sugar for years. The company offers Astraea allulose, which tastes and functions similar to sugar while adding only 0.4 kilocalorie per gram — and now with FDA draft guidance, no grams of sugar. Allulose is a rare sugar that exists in nature in small quantities, such as in figs and raisins. It has a clean sweet taste with no off-flavors and is about 70% as sweet as table sugar. It brings functional bulking and freeze-point depressions properties, enabling 1:1 replacement for sugar in many dairy formulations.

MONK FRUIT SWEETENER

Monk Fruit Corp. said it has an over 60% share of the global processed monk fruit ingredient market. Its monk fruit extract powder and monk fruit juice concentrate products are 100% natural clean-label solutions for sugar reduction and flavor modulation. Both products offer a clean taste without the bitter aftertaste associated with other natural sweeteners. Monk fruit is ideally suited to dairy applications in which consumers have an expectation of healthy nutrition. The low-calorie natural sweetness of monk fruit allows formulators to create great-tasting dairy products with less sugar and a better nutritional profile, while preserving the clean label that consumers expect in the dairy category.

NATURAL SWEETNESS FROM HONEY

The National Honey Board said formulating with honey gives dairy food and beverage processors the opportunity to use one of the most natural and unprocessed sweeteners on the marketplace. Most “natural” sweeteners have been significantly manipulated using either extreme heat, chemicals or machines. In contrast, honey is just honey. Honey bees do all the heavy lifting. Dairy processors may use a natural unprocessed ingredient consumers want — honey — to provide flavor, functionality and sweetness to milks, yogurts, spreads, cheeses and more.

FUNCTIONAL ALLULOSE

According to Tate & Lyle, allulose is a natural sweetening ingredient that provides the sensory experience of sugar without the calories. As a rare sugar, allulose is found in nature in small amounts in raisins and figs. It has 70% of the sweetness of sucrose and 90% fewer calories than sucrose. Tate & Lyle’s Dolcia Prima allulose offers functionality in sugar-reduced dairy applications, including imparting a similar temporal profile to sucrose, providing synergy with sweeteners such as stevia and sucralose, contributing bulk and texture, and depressing freezing point in frozen desserts. It also has a lower tendency to crystalize in high-solid systems.

As lockdown eases, people are starting to head outside and eventually, back to their designated offices. That can be scary; so be well-prepared with these quick sanitation tips that will keep you safe

Clean the soles of your shoes

Buy a foot bath or encourage your supervisors to invest in it, and make its use mandatory for employees. It's particularly useful especially when people choose to leave the office for any reason. If this isn't possible, you can create your own spray. The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using 70 per cent alcohol or a bleach solution made of five tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water or four teaspoons of bleach per quart of water. (Note that bleach solutions are good for only 24 hours.)

Disinfect regularly

The CDC differentiates cleaning and disinfecting as such: cleaning reduces the number of dirt, germs, and impurities on a surface while disinfecting is killing off germs (on said surface). They recommend cleaning then disinfecting high-touch areas such as doorknobs, tables, keyboards, and phones. Light switches, faucets, sinks must also be sanitised regularly especially after a person has left and then returned to the office. To make things easier, invest in wipes or alcohol spray bottles for easier disinfection.

Keep doors and windows open

It's always better to have good air circulation within a given space, so try cracking a window open to let some fresh air in. This is particularly useful for office spaces on high floors where it's unlikely to encounter other people near a window. If possible, consider vacuuming the office space with a high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter when no one is around.

Wash your hands

We cannot stress this enough. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or sanitise them whenever possible. Have a small bottle of alcohol and a pack of tissues at the ready for easy access. This can be particularly tough on skin, so it would be useful to have a personal bottle of lotion or skin balm nearby too.

Wear a mask

This has become standard protocol for most work areas and establishments in the Metro; its efficacy must never be underestimated. Of course, it's only efficient if people know how to properly use a mask. For starters, it's a good reminder to always bring an extra mask with you to work, just in case. Never touch the inside or outside of your mask. If you touch the outside of your mask, wash your hands right away without touching anything else. If you touch the inside of your mask, change it right away. Always hold onto its ear-loops or strings. When putting down your mask for lunch or for a drink of water, make sure to properly disinfect your table first. Afterwards, place a piece of tissue paper onto the table before setting your mask onto the tissue. Place another piece of tissue on top of your mask.

Never touch your face

This is probably common sense to you by now, but it's something we all have to unlearn at some point. Humans touch their faces for many reasons, sometimes to groom, sometimes as a self-soothing mechanism. Either way, we have to stop ourselves from scratching our nose, wiping our brow, or swatting away those annoying baby hairs. Our tip? Be conscious. If you feel the need to touch your face, wash your hands first or use alcohol. Simple things like being mindful of where we place our hands can save lives.

Be careful in communal areas","Be clean when you eat and be conscious of throwing your trash away properly (in the correct designated bins).
As the country heads towards Phase 2 of the safe re-opening, people will make their way back to their respective office buildings and business districts.
Light switches, faucets, sinks must also be sanitised regularly especially after a person has left and then returned to the office.
This is particularly useful for office spaces on high floors where it's unlikely to encounter other people near a window.
If possible, consider vacuuming the office space with a high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter when no one is around."

Washing our hands and face is something we do often and never think twice about. We sanitize high-touch surfaces in our household and spray disinfectants to keep germs at bay. What we don’t realize is that all of the precautionary measures we take might be easily reversed just by grabbing our phones, keys and other daily essentials.

A study conducted by the University of Arizona revealed that your cellphone is a hot spot for germs — in fact, they found that it can carry 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats.

While you might be familiar with using disinfectant wipes to clean your phone, another possible way to combat the germs that live on your phone (and even elsewhere in your home) is with UV-C sanitation.

What is UV-C?

“On the UV light spectrum, there are UV-A, B and C lights. Only the UV-C light can kill germs,” Philip Tierno, clinical professor of pathology and microbiology at NYU Langone Health, told Shop TODAY.

This means that the wavelength of UV-C light is strong enough to penetrate the nucleic acid of viruses and bacteria, either killing them or preventing them from becoming infectious.

“UV-C light has a wavelength between 200-270 nanometers, and a midrange between 250-253 nanometers which kills bacteria, viruses and some protozoan parasites,” Tierno said.

How do UV-C sanitizers work?

These essentially work by using special bulbs that can emit the proper amount of UV-C light needed to kill bacteria on smooth surfaces.

“UV light works because it damages the DNA of bacteria, and the DNA or RNA of viruses,” Donald Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and professor at Rutgers University, told Shop TODAY. “If you damage the DNA of the bacteria it dies, and if you damage the nucleic acid of the virus enough it cannot infect.”

Story continues

There are a few roadblocks to UV-C sanitizers if not used in the right way or with the right products. Since UV-C light works best on smooth, flat surfaces, it is important to note that a UV-C sanitizer may not work optimally if it is used on items with rough surfaces.

“If a surface is rough (even at the microscopic level), bacteria and viruses can hide in the valleys in the shade so that they are not hit by the UV rays,” Schaffner said. Because of this, Tierno notes that it may not be able to effectively clean phone cases or buttons on your mobile device.

Additionally, you should wipe down the item you want to clean before using a UV-C sanitizer. ""If microorganisms are going to be killed by this device, the surface needs to be clean of any material that is present on the phone such as dust, skin cells and skin oils,"" Donald English, a microbiologist and owner of Donald J. English Microbiological Quality Consulting LLC, told Shop TODAY.

Proper disinfection and preparation must be completed, before learners return as according to the protocols issued by the health department.

Cleaning manufacturer, Industroclean offered some tips to keep schools clean as “it is critical that school management teams have plans in place to keep their staff and learners safe from the Covid-19”.

“They must develop this plan, implement the plan, and make sure they maintain the plan,” according to Industroclean’s managing director, Emma Corder.

In a statement, she said schools across the country have varying degrees of access to proper sanitation and other assets needed to protect learners.

The managing director said it might be a daunting prospect for any school principal to try and prevent the spread of the Covid-19 if the school did not have access to running water.

“There are basic safety measures that can be implemented almost anywhere,” she said.

Corder said the essential first step is to stick to the basics.

“This being hand hygiene, correct mask usage, respiratory etiquette and physical distancing. When it comes to smaller children, it might be less easy to remind them to not share their lunch, stationery or even climbing structures, playgrounds swings and slides,” she said.

“Unfortunately, the above is just the basics and schools are going to need to develop a checklist that they can abide by on a daily basis.

“General engineering and administrative measures need to be implemented, to ensure that all classrooms have proper ventilation e.g. cleaning of air-conditioners with correct filter installed beforehand, or during school hours all windows are opened,” she said.

She further said all schools must have a dedicated isolation room; which is needed should a pupil or staff member show any symptoms of Covid-19.

“I strongly recommend that all staff and teachers be put through the correct training to make sure they understand and properly implement health measures. They will need to be intimately familiar with the basics such as the difference between cleaning and disinfecting a surface, as well as the safe disposing of any potentially hazardous medical waste,” Corder added.

However, she said there is also a responsibility on all parents and caregivers to ensure students are fully prepared, by creating a “Covid-19 back to school pack”.

“The use of a big sized pencil box is perfect to pack two clean masks, pack of wet wipes and hand sanitizer.

“It is also advised that the learners take their own water bottles so as to not fill them at the school or use public water taps, and especially to not drink directly from the mouthpiece of a tap,” Corder said.

Three best cleaning practices:

1. Prepare for cleaning and disinfecting.

Correct personal protective equipment (PPE) for cleaning

Use all chemicals correctly

Cleaning equipment must be clean e.g. mop sleeves must be soaked in cleaning solution before being used.

Disinfectants should be freshly prepared and National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS) registered.

2. Do the Job.

Top to bottom from clean to dirty.

For normal cleaning use the spray and wipe method.

And colour code all cleaning materials to prevent cross contamination.

3. End of Task

Dispose of dirty water and waste according to safe procedures.

Wash and dry all equipment before storing it in a clean space.

Dispose of all PPE wear before washing up.

“If headmasters or members of staff need any assistance or have any questions about measures that are planned for a school, they must get in touch with the Departments of Health or Education immediately. Proper disinfection and preparation must be completed, before learners return,” she said.

It’s important you know how to buy the right cleaning products and use them correctly during the COVID-19 pandemic, disinfectant expert Bill Wuest warns.

Many household cleaners, once ubiquitous and taken for granted, are flying off store shelves faster than they are restocked, as people strive to keep surfaces free of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

“I doubt that many people read the directions carefully on the cleaning products they use, but it’s important to do so…”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a survey on consumer knowledge and practices for disinfecting coronavirus and found that 39% of the respondents had misused cleaning products.

“This pandemic has caused me to think more about the knowledge of cleaning protocols of the everyday person,” says Wuest, an associate professor of chemistry at Emory University.

“It’s important to communicate our research to the general public to generate clear messages.”

Antibacterial products and the rise of resistance

An active ingredient commonly seen in household cleaners, including some disinfectant sprays and liquids, and antibacterial sanitizing wipes and soaps, are quaternary ammonium compounds, or QACs.

One of the first QACs to enter the marketplace as a cleaning agent was benzalkonium chloride. Known as BAC for short, it was introduced in Lysol around the beginning of the 20th century, became widely adopted by the manufacturers of a range of cleaning products, and has remained a staple ever since.

In fact, if you read the labels of the cleaning supplies in your household, you will likely see benzalkonium chloride listed among the active ingredients on at least one of them, if not more.

“There are basically four or five QACs, including BAC, that have been the workhouse disinfectants for around 100 years, on the frontline of most homes and hospitals,” Wuest says.

“Very little has been done to change them around, because they work so well against many common bacteria, viruses, molds, and fungi and they’re so simple and cheap to make.”

QACs are surfactants, or surface-acting agents, he explains. Their molecules have an ammonia atom at the center of two methyl stubs and two long carbon chains. In the simplest terms, the positively charged heads of the carbon chains are drawn to the negatively charged fatty membranes encasing many bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. The heads of the carbon chains act like spearpoints, breaking apart the fatty membranes and causing the pathogens to disintegrate.

The Wuest lab is a leader in studies of QACs. One issue Wuest and his colleagues have identified is the fact that a few bacteria strains are slowly developing some resistance to BAC. If that trend continues, it could cause serious problems years down the road for sanitation in hospitals.

In the US alone, at least 2.8 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, leading to more than 35,000 deaths.

Research has frequently confirmed that QACs work against influenza viruses as well as bacterial strains and coronaviruses that have similar outer membranes as SARS-CoV-2.

Wuest offers the following four tips for consumers:

1. Avoid ‘antibacterial’ sanitizers and soaps

BAC is the active ingredient in most “antibacterial” wipes, hand sanitizers, and soaps. Wuest recommends choosing plain soap or plain alcohol-based sanitizers whenever possible, to avoid potentially contributing to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. While products containing BAC are convenient and practical, especially for cleaning large surfaces, plain soap and water also work well against coronaviruses and other common pathogens.

2. Follow instructions closely

“I doubt that many people read the directions carefully on the cleaning products they use, but it’s important to do so,” Wuest says. He notes that some products state that, after application, the cleaning agent needs to stay on the surface being sanitized for several minutes before being wiped off.

3. Never mix cleaning agents

Consumers should never try to mix cleaning agents to try to “improve” them, Wuest stresses. Bleach combined with ammonia, for example, generates toxic chloramine vapor, which will cause chemical burns to the eyes and lungs and can permanently damage the respiratory system. Even mixing bleach with the seemingly innocuous ingredient of household vinegar is dangerous, because that combination creates deadly chlorine gas.

“Never mix any cleaning product with another cleaning product,” he says. “It’s an extremely dangerous thing to do, as many of the ingredients are hazardous if not used as directed.”

4. Check latest CDC recommendations

For more guidance on cleaning in the era of COVID-19, Wuest points to a web page, Cleaning and Disinfection for Households, outlining current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

285,https://www.loopjamaica.com/content/46m-difference-costs-portmore-and-ocho-rios-covid-clean-ups,"Sun, 07 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Loop News Jamaica,$46m difference in costs for Portmore and Ocho Rios COVID clean-ups,"Portmore Mayor, Leon Thomas, has said the Portmore Municipal Corporation (PMC) was able to undertake and complete a major sanitisation exercise at the height of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the municipality at a cost of under $400,000.

The stated figure was in stark contrast to the $46.7 million that was said to have been spent by the St Ann Municipal Corporation (SAMC) to sanitise sections of the town of Ocho Rios in that parish, the disclosure of which has raised eyebrows.

Thomas said once the Government announced that there was an outbreak of the respiratory disease in the parish of St Catherine, with the Alorica call centre company at the epicentre in Portmore, he quickly mobilised a roving crew of cleaners. The crew was said to have included staff members of the PMC, as well as members of the Jamaica Fire Brigade station at Waterford, who all pitched in to feverishly complete a two-week cleaning exercise all over the municipality.

The areas covered included the Naggo Head Transportation Centre, Portmore Mall, the Greater Portmore Health Centre, the Greater Portmore Post Office and library, Portmore Pines Plaza, as well as the bus shelters across the municipality.

""We also cleaned the piazzas, wherever we knew a lot of people would congregate or wherever there was heavy foot traffic,"" Thomas added.

The coronavirus outbreak in the parish was triggered largely by employees at the Alorica call centre. Of 787 listed employees at the time of the outbreak, 559 had St Catherine addresses. Of the local cases of COVID-19 so far, 235 have been linked to the Alorica workplace cluster.

Thomas said he realised quickly that it was imperative that the sanitisation exercise be done in the most frugal manner possible, given that the country was faced a looming financial crisis that was being triggered by the global effects of the pandemic which at that time, had necessitated the lockdown of millions of people and the closure of many businesses nationally.

More than 6.6 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, with almost 400,000 deaths.

""Based on what we knew we would be facing from an economic standpoint after COVID, we wanted to ensure that we budgeted properly for the exercise, so we engaged PMC staff, used our available resources, purchased our own chemicals, such as bleach and detergent soap in bulk, got the fire brigade to help us with water, and rented a truck when the fire brigade unit was not available,"" Thomas shared.

The mayor said it was a deliberate decision by the PMC to forego the use of a private contractor to undertake the cleaning exercise.

""We wanted to be able to keep costs down, and given the exigency and urgency of the cleaning exercise, it was not feasible to go to tender with contracts,"" Thomas stated.

During last week’s meeting of Parliament’s Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC), it was revealed that the approved chemical agent sodium hypochlorite, which was used for the Ocho Rios sanitisation exercise, is actually bleach, the same compound that was used in the Portmore sanitisation exercise.

Questions were raised publicly this week following the revelation of the cost that was associated with the COVID-19 cleaning exercise that was undertaken by the SAMC.

The Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF), which funded the Ocho Rios project, has sought to defend its allocation to the SAMC, citing that other municipal corporations have applied for similar COVID-19-related clean-up projects, but the St Ann application was among the earliest received.

A breakdown of the expenditure on the St Ann project, which was undertaken by Rahim’s Cleaning and Trucking Limited, included approximately $10 million being reportedly spent to clean and sanitise the Ocho Rios Market, and $7.5 million spent on the Island Village complex to sanitise handrails, gates and seating. Over $2 million was also spent on sanitisation efforts at the Turtle River Park in the resort town, while approximately $9 million was spent to clean areas of the Ocho Rios Pier.

The Ocho Rios project irked People's National Party (PNP) councillors in St Ann, who threatened to report the matter to the auditor general if clarity was not provided on the funding of the work and how it was carried out.

It later emerged during the PAAC meeting last Wednesday that the Ocho Rios project was implemented under emergency contract, which facilitates direct contracting as set out by the Public Sector Procurement Handbook.

The PAAC was told that a letter to verify the competency of Rahim’s Cleaning and Trucking Limited came from Tracy Fakourie, Regional Operations Manager of North Eastern Parks and Markets Waste Management Limited.

Companies Office of Jamaica records indicate that Rahim’s Cleaning and Trucking Limited was incorporated in August 2017, and is located in Cross Roads, St Andrew. Rahim Walker and Damion Shirley are named as directors and shareholders.

The agreement between the SAMC and the contracting firm was signed on March 26, 2020. However, the letter of recommendation from Fakourie was dated May 20, 2020, almost two months after the contract was signed.

In the meantime, the pressure has started to ramp up, as the Integrity Commission has notified the Government of its intention to ""comprehensively monitor"" the expenditures and contract awarding relative to COVID-19, given that the Government has spent billions of dollars to effectively respond to the pandemic.

According to a release issued on Thursday June 4, 2020 by the Integrity Commission, a formal notice was served upon several Government authorities through a letter dated and dispatched on June 2, 2020.","The mayor said it was a deliberate decision by the PMC to forego the use of a private contractor to undertake the cleaning exercise.
""We wanted to be able to keep costs down, and given the exigency and urgency of the cleaning exercise, it was not feasible to go to tender with contracts,"" Thomas stated.
During last week’s meeting of Parliament’s Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC), it was revealed that the approved chemical agent sodium hypochlorite, which was used for the Ocho Rios sanitisation exercise, is actually bleach, the same compound that was used in the Portmore sanitisation exercise.
Questions were raised publicly this week following the revelation of the cost that was associated with the COVID-19 cleaning exercise that was undertaken by the SAMC.
It later emerged during the PAAC meeting last Wednesday that the Ocho Rios project was implemented under emergency contract, which facilitates direct contracting as set out by the Public Sector Procurement Handbook."

Cecilia Aguillon is Director of the Energy Transition Initiative at the Institute of the Americas in La Jolla, California

LA JOLLA, California, Jun 22 2020 (IPS) - The COVID-19 pandemic and crisis has led to increasing attention and clamor to redouble efforts toward an energy transition that would help the world reduce C02 emissions. In many countries of the region, how to manage hydrocarbons, but with an eye on the energy transition has only been accentuated. We believe clean hydrogen is part of that broader policy and reconstruction debate.

Clean hydrogen markets can be a key part of the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerate the decarbonization of Latin America’s electricity and transportation sectors, attract investment and create jobs. Indeed, the possibilities for oil and gas companies to produce and deliver hydrogen should facilitate and accelerate its adoption in Latin America particularly when combined with the region’s considerable renewable energy upside.

As the US Energy Information Administration notes, hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and the simplest. Furthermore, the EIA underscores that “hydrogen, like electricity, is an energy carrier that must be produced from another substance.”

Clean energy policies with clear objectives and successful implementation have resulted in renewable auctions that were over-subscribed throughout the region. The policies also engendered competition and electricity prices among the lowest in the world all the while injecting billions of dollars of direct investment into their economies





According to the US Department of Energy, most hydrogen today is produced from fossil fuels, specifically natural gas, but there is also increasing production from electricity including renewable sources such as biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind.

With regards to technology, most hydrogen is produced through steam methane reforming, a high-temperature process in which steam reacts with a hydrocarbon fuel to produce hydrogen. Electrolysis is also commonly used to produce hydrogen by separating H2O into oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen can be compressed, liquefied, transported and used at gasoline stations to fuel vehicles.

Latin America counts some of the globe’s most abundant and cost competitive renewable energy resources including hydroelectricity, solar, and wind. The elements that make the region a world-leader in renewables can facilitate a similar ascension for clean hydrogen production this decade. But it is important to note that in order to spur investment, economies of scale must be supported and enhanced through policy and market incentive programs.

Take the photovoltaic (PV) industry. PV has demonstrated that policies with a well-conceived implementation strategy greatly incentivizes the market and leverages steep cost reductions. Average PV prices in the United States dropped 89% from $359 USD per MWH in 2009 to $40 USD per MWH in 2019.

Over the last ten years, most countries in Latin America enacted clean energy targets and laws that include fiscal incentives and goals to achieve a determined percentage of their electricity mix from clean energy sources by specific timeframes. Using a reverse auction mechanism, solicitations were announced attracting bids from mostly wind and solar developers. A major energy auction in Mexico in 2017 delivered prices in the $20´s USD per MWH.

Clean energy policies with clear objectives and successful implementation have resulted in renewable auctions that were over-subscribed throughout the region. The policies also engendered competition and electricity prices among the lowest in the world all the while injecting billions of dollars of direct investment into their economies.

Latin America’s power sector is well-positioned to be the main driver for a clean hydrogen boom as the pace of solar and wind energy projects continues to accelerate. In some cases, their intermittent nature, however, creates mismatches in the supply and demand of electricity in the system which prompts grid operators to temporarily shut down generation when it exceeds demand.

This reduces return on investments. Reliable and cost-effective batteries are needed to address the problem. Hydrogen-based storage is emerging as a technically viable and effective solution, but more has to be done to foster a competitive industry.

According to IRENA´s latest report on hydrogen and renewables, the lowest average cost of producing hydrogen from wind is $23 USD per MWH. There is consensus that reducing the cost of storage will help maximize the use of renewable energy generation, reduce energy imports, and contribute to economic prosperity.

There are natural allies in this effort. Policymakers and regulators together with power companies and renewable energy investors are increasingly aligned with similar objectives and goals. Latin America does not have to start from scratch; there are important lessons from around the globe.

Clean hydrogen projects being developed in Asia, Europe, and the United States could lead to policies, programs, and robust industries. Lessons learned and best practices from early adopters can be harvested and adapted to develop successful hydrogen markets.

In Latin America, Chile could emerge as the clean hydrogen market leader since the country has surplus production of solar and wind electricity that could be leveraged for producing hydrogen. The government is already developing its post-pandemic stimulus package with a heavy focus on energy decarbonization by 2040 backed by aggressive policies targeting growth and further deployment of renewable energy and electric mobility.

The Energy Ministry is even working on a specific plan to develop a hydrogen market. In addition, the Chilean government is enlisting the participation of its power and energy sectors to join the effort. Chile´s success with solar and wind deployment along with its new decarbonization strategy can be a template for developing sustainable and robust hydrogen markets throughout the region.

For many countries in Latin America, one of the thorniest challenges to reduce emissions is in their transportation sector. Even highly-touted renewable energy markets such as Costa Rica have struggled to reduce fossil fuel consumption for transport. Hydrogen offers an important possible solution. Indeed, hydrogen can help decarbonize the fuel sector, most likely as a source for heavy duty transportation such as long-haul buses and trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes.

The current environment of low oil prices is providing many countries relief from onerous fuel subsidies. Indeed, in some markets such as Ecuador have begun to remove them entirely. It could be wise to consider applying some of these savings to promote the modernization of their public transportation infrastructure to accommodate the use of clean fuels and by extension, support economic development and reduction of CO2 emissions.

Moreover, national oil companies have had to shut down refineries due to the recent drop in fuel demand caused by the lockdowns in the fight to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced shutdown could provide an opportunity to use the time to retrofit equipment and train workers on hydrogen fuel production.

Taking such measures in the near-term would allow for an important step towards diversification while transitioning to clean fuels. In some cases, oil and gas companies are able to obtain low-cost financing in addition to having the infrastructure, distribution channels, and know-how to produce fuels. As countries emerge from the pandemic and review policies and stimulus packages to reactivate their economies, governments should further consider designing road maps that include the promotion of clean hydrogen to decarbonize their power and transportation sectors.

Uruguay provides an example that public-private partnerships can work towards developing a local hydrogen market and one that can inform neighboring countries. The national oil company, ANCAP, together with the government, the national electricity company UTE, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and private investors are developing a pilot project to produce hydrogen using renewable energy to power trucks and buses, and to support green electricity through storage. This is to comply with the government´s goal of achieving 100% renewables by 2030.

In Uruguay, a comprehensive roadmap was enacted in 2010 with clear objectives and specific milestones that includes active collaboration of the various public agencies with specific roles to play to achieve the target. The policy also calls for regulations and standards that promotes the use of renewables throughout every sector of the economy making Uruguay a renewable energy leader in the southern cone. The inclusion of traditional energy sectors in the hydrogen pilot project could help the country achieve its decarbonization goal ahead of schedule.

As the example from Uruguay underscores, well-crafted policies and successful implementation of regulations are essential to attract foreign and domestic investments. The technology and resources to produce clean hydrogen are available. Scaling manufacturing to achieve cost-effectiveness is already taking place thanks to programs to promote hydrogen throughout the world.

The current investment profile and soaring amounts for renewable energy has shown the myriad actors and players – from Wall Street and private equity to multilateral agencies to local and international banks – willing to invest in renewable technologies particularly shown by the scale of deployment levels of wind and solar. Furthermore, the potential ability of oil and gas companies to produce and deliver hydrogen should facilitate and accelerate its adoption in Latin America.

Governments throughout the region should also consider direct participation in the clean hydrogen market. By serving as customers, governments can further support and develop critical mass for fast adoption through investment and modernization of state-own transportation infrastructure. Moreover, governments should consider fiscal incentives for heavy industry and traditional fuel suppliers to adopt the technology. Lessons learned from developing successful renewable energy programs should inspire political will to make clean hydrogen the next link in the chain to achieve zero carbon economies for this generation across Latin America.

Navigating the path forward from the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the persistent threat of climate change makes clean hydrogen a possible solution for the day after and the region’s energy and economic recovery.","We believe clean hydrogen is part of that broader policy and reconstruction debate.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has pledged the clean-up after the massive Black Summer bushfires will be completed by the end of July, a month after the original deadline. Around 2500 properties have now been cleared throughout NSW as part of a mammoth effort following the devastating fires. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian original set an ""ambitious"" deadline of June 30 for the clean-up to finish. But two weeks out from that date, hundreds of properties are yet to be cleared. Data provided to the Senate showed that, as of May 20, 23 per cent of properties in Bega Valley registered for the clean-up had been completed. In Eurobodalla, that figure was 28 per cent, while in the Snowy Monaro region the clean-up was yet to begin. But Senator Cormann said incredible progress had been made since that date. Under questioning from Labor on Tuesday, Senator Cormann revealed 11 properties had now been cleared in Snowy-Monaro, with 31 to be cleared by June 20. In Bega, 375 properties had now been cleared (up from 209 on May 20) and 431 would be gone by June 20. In Eurobodalla, 570 properties had now been cleaned up, with that number to rise to 600 by June 20. Only 331 had been cleared by May 20. READ MORE: Senator Cormann said the federal and NSW governments were working ""as fast as possible"" to support bushfire-affected communities. ""My advice is most debris will be cleared by the end of June and all is expected to be completed by July 31,"" he said. ""In all of the circumstances including the impact of COVID-19, I would have thought the Labor Party would understand that we are dealing in a particular circumstance that is more challenging than we envisaged back in January."" The Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Management has been told of the toll the delayed clean-up has taken on communities. In a newly released submission, the Cobargo Relief Centre told the commission it took four months for the clean-up to begin. ""This is not only a health and safety issue, but has had a very detrimental effect on residents' mental health,"" the centre said. People who were uninsured are living in tents on their properties without water or sanitation. ""Those people who were insured are still finding it very difficult to move forward, as their properties have not been cleared and they are unable to make plans to build new dwellings,"" the centre said. ""They, too, have been left to their own devices to try to source temporary accommodation while they wait for land clearing and other structural services.""

Frankfurt / Nairobi, Jun 10 2020 - As COVID-19 hits the fossil fuel industry, a new report shows that renewable energy is more cost-effective than ever – providing an opportunity to prioritize clean energy in economic recovery packages and bring the world closer to meeting the Paris Agreement goals.



Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2020 report — from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre and BloombergNEF (BNEF), available at www.fs-unep-centre.org — analyzes 2019 investment trends, and clean energy commitments made by countries and corporations for the next decade.

It finds commitments equivalent to 826 GW of new non-hydro renewable power capacity, at a likely cost of around USD 1 trillion, by 2030. (1GW is similar to the capacity of a nuclear reactor). Getting on track to limiting global temperature rise to under 2 degrees Celsius — the main goal of the Paris Agreement — would require the addition of around 3,000GW by 2030, the exact amount depending on the technology mix chosen. The planned investments also fall far below the USD 2.7 trillion committed to renewables during the last decade.

However, the report shows that the cost of installing renewable energy has hit new lows, meaning future investments will deliver far more capacity. Renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydro-electric dams of more than 50 MW, grew by 184 gigawatts (GW) in 2019. This highest-ever annual addition was 20 GW, or 12 percent, more than the new capacity commissioned in 2018. Yet the dollar investment in 2019 was just 1 per cent higher than the previous year, at USD 282.2 billion.

The all-in, or levelized, cost of electricity continues to fall for wind and solar, thanks to technology improvements, economies of scale and fierce competition in auctions. Costs for electricity from new solar photovoltaic plants in the second half of 2019 were 83 per cent lower than a decade earlier.

“The chorus of voices calling on governments to use their COVID-19 recovery packages to create sustainable economies is growing,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “This research shows that renewable energy is one of the smartest, most cost-effective investments they can make in these packages.”

“If governments take advantage of the ever-falling price tag of renewables to put clean energy at the heart of COVID-19 economic recovery, they can take a big step towards a healthy natural world, which is the best insurance policy against global pandemics,” Andersen said.

Renewable energy has been eating away at fossil fuels’ dominant share of electricity generation over the last decade. Nearly 78 per cent of the net new GW of generating capacity added globally in 2019 was in wind, solar, biomass and waste, geothermal and small hydro. Investment in renewables, excluding large hydro, was more than three times that in new fossil fuel plants.

“Renewables such as wind and solar power already account for almost 80 per cent of newly built capacity for electricity generation,” said Svenja Schulze, Minister of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Investors and markets are convinced of their reliability and competitiveness.”

“The promotion of renewables can be a powerful engine for the recovery of the economy after the Coronavirus crisis, creating new and secure jobs,” she added. “At the same time, renewables improve air quality thus protecting public health. By promoting renewable energies within the framework of Coronavirus economic stimulus packages, we have the opportunity to invest in future prosperity, health and climate protection.”

2019 marked many other records, the report finds:

• The highest solar power capacity additions in one year, at 118 GW.

• The highest investment in offshore wind in one year, at USD 29.9 billion, up 19 per cent year-on-year.

• The largest financing ever for a solar project, at USD 4.3 billion for Al Maktoum IV in the United Arab Emirates.

• The highest volume of renewable energy corporate power purchase agreements, at 19.5GW worldwide.

• The highest capacity awarded in renewable energy auctions, at 78.5GW worldwide.

• The highest renewables investment ever in developing economies other than China and India, at USD 59.5 billion.

• A broadening investment, with a record 21 countries and territories investing more than USD 2 billion in renewables.

Nils Stieglitz, President of Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, said: “We see the energy transition is in full swing, with the highest capacity of renewables financed ever. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel sector has been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis – with demand for coal- and gas-fired electricity down in many countries, and oil prices slumping.

“The climate and COVID-19 crises – despite their different natures – are both disruptions that command attention from policy makers and managers alike. Both crises demonstrate the need to increase climate ambition and shift the world’s energy supply towards renewables.”

The 2019 investment brought the share of renewables, excluding large hydro, in global generation to 13.4 per cent, up from 12.4 per cent in 2018 and 5.9 per cent in 2009. This means that in 2019, renewable power plants prevented the emission of an estimated 2.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, a substantial saving given global power sector emissions of approximately 13.5 gigatonnes in 2019.

“Clean energy finds itself at a crossroads in 2020,” said Jon Moore, Chief Executive of BloombergNEF. “The last decade produced huge progress, but official targets for 2030 are far short of what is required to address climate change. When the current crisis eases, governments will need to strengthen their ambitions not just on renewable power, but also on the decarbonization of transport, buildings and industry.”

A report by the Bank’s Independent Development Evaluation (IDEV) unit, which studied projects carried out since 2005, provides key lessons for improving the Bank’s water sector interventions and accelerating the longer-term transformation of Africa’s agriculture and health sector.

IDEV conducted four evaluations related to the water sector: three project cluster evaluations (water supply and sanitation in both rural and urban contexts, and agricultural water management) and one water sector evaluation.

These evaluations summarize the evidence, findings and lessons learned between 2005 and 2016, covering more than 400 operations across the continent with a total project cost of UA 6 billion ($8.2 billion).

Access to safe water and sanitation is particularly important in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, since the spread of the virus can be mitigated by good hygiene practices. Agricultural water management can also help African farmers to optimize production and reduce the pandemic’s negative impact on food security and nutrition.

Beneficiaries were key to the success of the projects, the report found. The extent and quality of collaboration with local stakeholders matters. In Ghana, for instance, there was active participation by over 600,000 community members in the various project activities thanks to raising awareness and understanding the demand-driven approach.

The evaluation also identified some barriers to the success of a water sector intervention. For example, outcomes can be undermined by poor service delivery, insufficient human capacity, limited financing and performance of the sanitation and hygiene component or lack of appropriate assessment of critical water sector risks.

Overall, having a long-term view is paramount for determining the success of water interventions. These lessons can provide some quick responses to the ongoing COVID-19 and food security crisis, and accelerate longer-term transformation of Africa’s agriculture and health sector.

Ensuring reliable access to clean water for drinking and handwashing can reduce the transmission of the coronavirus. But today, about 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed water supply, and most of these are in Africa’s poorest regions.

In addition, over 750 million Africans lack access to improved sanitation. These water and sanitation challenges are likely to be further compounded by Africa’s looming climate change crisis.

To address these challenges, the Bank has invested UA 4.5 billion ($6.2 billion) over the past ten years towards promoting universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation — one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6).

According to IDEV’s evaluation report, the Bank’s projects in agricultural water management played a role in reducing the drudgery of fetching water for domestic and agricultural use, and in increasing productivity and diversity of crops.","IDEV conducted four evaluations related to the water sector: three project cluster evaluations (water supply and sanitation in both rural and urban contexts, and agricultural water management) and one water sector evaluation.

As the disease continues to spread in northeast Nigeria, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is extending its water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) operations to reduce the spread of the virus.

A new IOM project will help prevent and control COVID-19 infections in three areas in Borno State with high concentrations of displaced persons; areas also deemed high-risk for disease spread.

In Borno, the largest state in the region, about 80 per cent of the estimated 840,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in makeshift and temporary shelters in overcrowded conditions where physical distancing is difficult, if not impossible.

Moreover, despite the pandemic, attacks by non-state armed groups in the north-east are ongoing, including in areas close to humanitarian operations. On 2 July, an attack in Damasak claimed the lives of two civilians, including a five-year old child, and damaged a humanitarian helicopter.

Earlier this week (14/07), the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control had recorded 591 confirmed cases and 35 associated deaths in Borno, where a decade-long humanitarian crisis has left 1.8 million people displaced and 10.6 million in need of assistance. The impact of an outbreak among the displaced populations in this area could be devastating.

“Without the availability of sanitation facilities and hygiene materials, IDPs are extremely vulnerable to disease transmission,” said Teshager Tefera, IOM Nigeria WASH Programme Manager. “Our teams continue working alongside displaced communities to bring clean water to camps and nearby settlements, but more needs to be done.”

Services will reach an estimated 420,000 IDPs in 120 camps and nearby communities in Maiduguri, Konduga, and Damasak municipalities in Borno State. The project will supply clean and safe water, as well as 22,000 hygiene kits with soap, buckets, and other items, to populations at risk.

On average, IOM supplies two million liters of water per day to 113,500 people in Borno where torrential rains and flooding have caused substantial damage to latrines, showers, handwashing stations and solar panels. The funding will allow IOM to train and mobilize displaced communities to repair and maintain these facilities and construct an additional 1,040 handwashing points using foot-operated water taps and soap dispensers to avoid contact with surfaces.

To complement these activities, IOM field workers are training local camp residents on risk communication and community engagement, reaching close to 20,000 people through door-to-door awareness raising.

“Even though I am blind, I always pay attention to the hygiene promoters who tell us how to properly wash our hands to avoid the virus. I spend most of my time at home, so I always look forward to their visits,” said Lariya Magaji, an 89-year old woman living with her granddaughter in Stadium Camp in Maiduguri.

To avoid mass gatherings, information will be shared also via loudspeakers mounted on tricycles to reach high numbers of IDPs in camps without exposing them to risks.

Recently, IOM Nigeria launched its COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan with a request of USD 19.3 million to mitigate the pandemic’s socio-economic impacts and ensure the continuity of life-saving assistance in emergency settings.

“This is our largest WASH donation since the programme began in Nigeria in 2018, and it arrives at a time when these services are most needed,” said Franz Celestin, IOM Nigeria Chief of Mission. “The support from OFDA will help ensure the sustainability of our life-saving activities in Borno,” he added.

The USD 6.22 million project Strengthening COVID-19 Preparedness and Response in North-east Nigeria Through Targeted Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Activities, funded by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), will be implemented over a twelve-month period.

It is essential to remove biofilms in the water system and submit water samples for analysis before birds arrive. It is also good practice to disinfect water lines once a month (for cleaning purposes) during the life of the flock and flush them a minimum of once a week to maintain good water quality in addition to daily routine water sanitation.

Procedure

Step 1: Drain water pipes and header tanks.

Step 2: Flush water lines with clean water or forced air. When cleaning the water lines with forced air, ensure the end of the drinker line is open so that the high pressure air can easily force the water out the end of the drinker line. Air pressure should be closely regulated so that it is not too high, which can cause damage to the drinker lines.

Step 3: Scrub header tanks to remove scale and biofilm deposit and drain to the exterior of the house.

Step 4: Refill the tank with fresh water and add an approved sanitizer. The sanitizer must be approved for use with the drinking system and used at the correct dilution for effective biofilm removal.

Step 5: Run the sanitizer solution through the drinker lines from the header tank, ensuring that there are no air locks.

Step 6: For disinfection after depletion only, fill the header tank to normal operating level with additional sanitizer solution at the appropriate strength. Replace the lid and allow the disinfectant to remain inside the tank for 24 - 72 hours.

Step 7: Drain the tank and drinker lines thoroughly and rinse with clean water.

Step 8: Refill the tank with fresh water prior to bird arrival.

Step 9: If physical cleaning of the inside of water pipes is not possible, biofilms can be removed by using peroxygen compounds.

This was an historic development in the long search for water justice. Water was not included in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights because it seemed to be a limitless resource available to all. But the “perfect storm” of global water depletion and destruction, growing poverty and inequality between and within nations, and rising water rates — often the result of the privatization of water services — led to a full-blown human rights crisis by the turn of the 21st century.

Our award-winning journalists bring you the news that impacts you, Canada, and the world. Don't miss out. The fight to recognize the human right to water was surprisingly fierce and bitter. It was opposed by the private water utilities and the bottled water industry, the World Bank that was promoting water privatization in developing countries, the World Water Council, and many wealthy countries of the North, including the United States, Great Britain and Canada.

Their opposition reflected a mighty contest about whether water is a commodity or a commons. In adopting this resolution, the nations of the world affirmed that it is not OK to watch your child die of water-borne disease because you cannot pay for clean water. They clarified that water is not just a “need,” but a human right, and that affected communities are demanding justice, not charity. In doing so, the human family took an evolutionary step forward.

Although limited amounts of fluoride are safe in water supplies, many regions have reached dangerously high levels. Removal and treatment of high-fluoride water has historically been difficult and expensive, but is generally preferred to importing costly and unreliable supplies from outside sources.

While these challenges are global, it is particularly prevalent in Africa’s Eastern Rift Valley, which spans from Ethiopia to Tanzania. Because of high fluoride levels, local populations are at high risk for skeletal problems, including significant muscle impairment, pain and changes in bone structure—effects that can be considerably worse in children, causing significant problems in neuronal and cognitive development with age.

A Global Challenge Localized

Situated in the heart of the Rift Valley, Kenya faces significant obstacles in delivering potable water to its residents, with only nine of the 55 public water service providers in the country able to offer continuous supplies. 41% of Kenya’s 46 million residents have relied on unimproved water sources, such as ponds, rivers and shallow wells to meet their most basic human need. These raw water sources and the high level of fluoride within them have left 30 million Kenyans living with dental and skeletal fluorosis.

In the Kasarani region of the capital, Nairobi, the Little Sisters of St. Francis (LSOSF) run a school facility and hospital training center, which serves more than 6,000 people every day. The volume of students and patients places high demand on the facility, requiring reliable access to clean water not only for drinking but to serve all day-to-day operations. Though LSOSF previously acquired their water from the city supply, the distance combined with numerous breakages led to contamination that yielded waterborne diseases and water-related illnesses.

LSOSF also provides water to the larger community through 24-hour-a-day kiosks. Fifty to 75 local residents now use the kiosks daily as their primary water source.

Collaborate to Innovate

In an attempt to access an underground reservoir in search of clean water, LSOSF initiated a borehole, but quickly discovered that the water source contained concentrations of fluoride that far exceeded the global standard for safety. To solve this issue, LSOSF reached out to the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) and its Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (KIWASH) project for assistance.

KIWASH, which strives to improve water and sanitation development in underserved communities in Kenya, formed a cooperative team with DuPont Water Solutions (DWS) and Davis & Shirtliff, a regional East African contractor, to commission the installation of a filtration system that would remove fluoride from the drinking water source.

Davis & Shirtliff, a leader in the search for fluoride removal solutions with decades of experience in Kenya’s market, provides deep familiarity with the challenges facing the local water sector. The company has also used DWS technology in a wide range of projects, uniquely positioning them to select the most advantageous products for an effective fluoride removal system. With Davis & Shirtliff’s knowledge and DWS’ global and technological expertise, the team was well aligned to implement a long-term solution.

A Simpler System

The partners involved constructed a new facility using USAID’s direct infrastructure investments, including pipeline expansion, an efficient pumping system and the construction of water kiosks, along with DWS’ high-recovery water purification technologies. The system uses ultrafiltration units for pretreatment of the water, removing silt from the borehole water and making it suitable to enter the fluoride removal system. A nanofiltration train then separates the water with the remaining fluoride molecules isolated on one side of the membranes and the pure water on the other.

These advanced water treatment technologies help create a simpler system, ultimately requiring lower energy levels and higher rates of recovery. USAID and DWS also offered training while onsite to ensure sustainability and continued effectiveness of the project.

“This was a challenge that could not be easily addressed by USAID alone,” said Joe Sanders, chief of party for USAID’S KIWASH. “In collaboration with [DuPont]Water Solutions and LSOSF, we were able to meet the immediate needs of the hospital and help improve the quality of life for the broader community.”

In just seven months, the facility produced approximately 2.8 million gallons of clean water, effectively reducing incidences of waterborne diseases while improving economic efficiency for the hospital and the community. Residents who previously paid up to four to five dollars for 20 liters of water now pay only 40 cents.

Soon after startup, LSOSF began providing water to the community through kiosks, using a water ATM to automate the process and allow residents to purchase clean water 24 hours a day. Fifty to 75 local residents now use the kiosks daily as their primary water source.

“It is wonderful to see our patients enjoying safe, clean water, and our pupils are very excited,” said Sister Esther Waithera of LSOSF. “Once the parents became confident in our water quality, our school quickly filled to capacity with new students.”

In just seven months, the facility produced approximately 2.8 million gallons of clean water, effectively reducing incidences of waterborne diseases while improving economic efficiency for the hospital and the community.

A Model for the Future

The public-private partnership has become a benchmark for other communities and organizations in the region. LSOSF regularly welcomes visitors who are interested in learning about the clean water program in hopes that it will be implemented widely across East Africa and regions facing similar challenges.

“I’m confident that nanotechnology will likely become the solution of choice to address fluoride removal in this region,” said Phillip Holi, technical director for Davis & Shirtliff. “Without water, no economic activities can go on.”

This clean water project serves as a prime example of how technology and expertise can be combined to encourage the growth of communities and the advancement of human progress. Developments of a similar scope have proven to be key to creating a more equitable, long-term water future.","Davis & Shirtliff, a leader in the search for fluoride removal solutions with decades of experience in Kenya’s market, provides deep familiarity with the challenges facing the local water sector.

The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs is already facing one of the largest case rates per capita in the state – with 2.8% of the population infected, the reservation has more cases per person than any Oregon county.

The tribal government has mobilized to help tribal members get drinking water and prevent the spread of infections, handing out sanitizer and clean drinking water to anybody who asks for it and delivering supplies to people who are under quarantine or are at risk of serious complications from an infection.

But health experts and tribal members say the effort likely won’t be enough to stave off increased infections. Without access to clean, running water, they said, people are less likely to wash their hands – the most important step to containing disease.

“When you can’t practice sanitation, then we’re in trouble,” said Dan Martinez, who is leading the tribe’s emergency response.

The Oregon Legislature’s emergency board approved more than $3.5 million this week for short-term fixes to the water system that should, in theory, return clean water to the tribes. But the repairs could take weeks, with every day a chance for the coronavirus to spread.

The anxiety is palpable.

A crisis point

Sitting in a Warm Springs office amid stacks of boxes of disinfectant, masks and gloves, custodian Marlen Miller said he’s afraid that children will catch the coronavirus, won’t wash their hands, then spread the virus amongst themselves as they play.

He hasn’t been letting his three children leave the house for fear they’ll get the disease.

“We need to have water to clean people up,” Miller said. “If they can’t clean themselves, it will spread like wildfire.”

Compounding the problem, locals said, is some tribal members’ attitude about the disease. Miller said some people aren’t taking the disease seriously, though he is: His brother-in-law’s father is infected and, as of Wednesday, was in a hospital under heavy sedation.

The reservation’s top health official, Caroline Cruz, said that out of the 120 residents who have tested positive, at least three have refused to isolate at home. She’s also had trouble convincing people to answer contact tracers’ questions when they get that call.

“Some people panic,” Cruz said.

The Warm Springs water crisis adds to multiple other factors working against the tribes.

Native Americans are more likely than whites to have some of the behaviors and health conditions that can make a coronavirus infection severe or fatal, data show.

About 30% of Oregon’s Native Americans smoke cigarettes, according to state data from 2017, compared to the state average of 17%. Native Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as whites, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a 2014 study found “profound” disparities in obesity and heart disease rates among Native Americans.

Recurring water issues

The reservation’s water troubles are not new, emergency manager Martinez said, even if this year they are particularly grave.

Pipes have burst every summer since 2018, just one of the many problems in the “ancient” system, Martinez said. It would take about $200 million to replace the system, including the water treatment plant and nearly eight miles of piping.

The immediate source of trouble is one particularly problematic pipe that runs underneath a creek. When it breaks, there isn’t enough pressure to get water into some people’s homes and creek water seeps into the water supply, which is what makes the water dangerous to drink.

More than 2,000 people have been told to boil their water, nearly 100 have lost all water, and others get water that comes out milky and smells like sulfur.

Supplies for the pandemic are stored at the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs reservation. July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

Experts and locals fear the problems with the water will spread disease, both because some people have no water and because those who do might not want to touch it.

There’s evidence “across the board” that poor access to clean water contributes to the spread of disease, said Dr. Melissa Sutton, a senior health advisor with the Oregon Health Authority.

Washing hands is the “single most important thing anyone can do to be healthy,” Sutton said. But, she added, people might be afraid to do that with water that they’ve been told is dangerous.

The tribal government has stocked up on a few weeks’ worth of water for people in need, turning what used to be a Warm Springs school building into a water depot.

Rows of full, five-gallon containers line the dim halls. People can come to the school and fill up gallon jugs of water, once a day.

Martinez also said he and others deliver bottled water to the elderly in their homes.

The federal government has also paid Warm Springs to set up two mobile shower trailers and wash stations people can use for free.

The staff and volunteers working the distribution center hand out prodigious amounts of sanitizer and personal protection equipment from the Oregon Health Authority – the next-best thing after 20 seconds of soap and water to kill the virus.

Martinez said that anybody who comes to pick up supplies has to maintain social distancing. Everyone has to wear masks.

But even with those efforts, Sandra Franks, a nurse and contact tracer for the tribe, said she believes the community is in danger.

Franks was at the school Wednesday to pick up food for a family on quarantine. Standing in the shade of the school building, she said that even with abundant availability of sanitizer, the community is at risk.

Some people might not get sanitizer because the school is too far of a drive for them, she said. Others risk spreading or catching the disease by going to the distribution center where the tribe employees and volunteers hand out jugs of water and bags of food, she said.

“I think it’s really going to spread,” Franks said.

A long-time failure

Warm Springs’ water troubles reflect a federal system that often fails to provide for reservations’ needs, said Celeste Davis, director of the environmental public health program of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board.

By law, the federal government has overarching responsibility for the well-being of tribes as well as the infrastructure on their land.

In reality, Davis said the federal government builds systems then hands over all control and responsibility to the tribes. Many -- including the Warm Springs tribes -- don’t have the money for repairs and maintenance because they don’t tax property or income.

The Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to multiple interview requests.

Shower and hand washing stations are on site and available at the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

But the federal government has stepped up to help Warm Springs manage the current crisis. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has paid for much of the bottled water the reservation now has in stock and has paid for two trailers with mobile showers, Martinez said.

The Oregon Office of Emergency Management has also offered to help, as it did during last year’s water crisis. Director Andrew Phelps said his agency is standing by to help if the tribes ask for it. But even if the state helps send in supplies, he said, that’s only a temporary solution.

“Providing bottled drinking water is not” going to resolve the underlying issues, Phelps said.

Potable water is made available to residents of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

The reservation is an independent nation, and the primary responsibility for tribal members’ well-being is with the federal government.

Nonetheless, Oregon lawmakers have decided to step outside of those theoretical boundaries and help Warm Springs.

Not that it has been easy, said state Rep. Daniel Bonham, R.-The Dalles, who has been pushing for the past year to help Warm Springs shore up their water system.

In 2019, Bonham helped push through $7.8 million for water and sewer projects, as Oregon Public Broadcasting reported at the time.

The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

But some lawmakers balked at the proposal, Bonham said, because the tribes are an independent, sovereign nation. Bonham explained that many tribal members work outside the reservation and pay state and federal taxes. Besides, Bonham said, the tribal members are Oregonians.

“The tribe is our neighbor,” Bonham said. “They are us.”

But that plan fell through this year after the pandemic upended the state’s entire financial picture. The Warm Springs money was supposed to come from Oregon Lottery bond sales. Those bonds won’t be sold because of a recent drop in the agency’s revenue, the Bend Bulletin reported.

Shower and hand washing stations are on site and available at the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

Just this week, however, the picture took a turn for the better.

Bonham and Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale, pushed the legislature’s emergency board to approve $3.58 million for fixes to the water system. The board voted unanimously to approve the money.

For Findley, approving the money is about far more than curbing the coronavirus.

“People should have a right to turn on their tap water and have good, clean drinking water,” Findley said. “It’s an inherent right people should be able to demand and expect.”

The money must still funnel through the state and tribal bureaucracies before contractors get to work. Martinez said he hopes that the faulty pipe, at least, will be replaced by the end of August.

And it won’t be a permanent fix, either, Cruz said.

“It’s only going to bandage part of the problem,” she said.

""I worry about it because I want to talk about our issues but I don't want to only be perceived for our problems,"" said Carina Miller. ""But that's what keeps me up at night."" Miller is part of the Warm Springs Community Action Team on the reservation and is running for the state senate. July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

The fix couldn’t come too soon for Carina Miller, who lives on the reservation with her son, who is almost 2 years old.

Miller, who is running for the state Senate District 30 seat, said she’s been trying to conserve water and avoids using it, when possible, because it could carry diseases from the creek.

July 15, 2020. Beth Nakamura/Staff

Standing barefoot in the grass outside her home, Miller said she doesn’t take her son out in public for fear he might catch the disease and pass it on to her or her parents.

The accumulation of crises has left her scared and anxious. A University of Oregon graduate, she has served on the tribal council and has been overwhelmed by the many needs of her community.

“We are trying to thrive,” Miller said. “Not just survive.”

Lowering cooling costs and reducing the carbon emissions associated with blasting air conditioning could be as simple as a coat of white paint. Replacing the often-used titanium oxide—a mineral found in countless sunscreens and reflective paints—with barite, (an artist’s pigment) and polytetrafluoroethylene (or Teflon), researchers from the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering have developed an ultra-white paint that reflects up to 98% of incoming heat from the sun. The paint's effective cooling stems not only from its reflective nature, it also bounces back the heat coming from infrared wavelengths, allowing for ""radiative cooling” in buildings. ""The potential cooling benefits this can yield may be realized in the near future because the modifications we propose are within the capabilities of the paint and coatings industry,” said Jyotirmoy Mandal, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar and the co-corresponding author on the research.

Assessing the damage caused to a structure immediately following an earthquake can be difficult and dangerous, but researchers from the University of Nevada, Reno and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have developed a new laser-based sensor that could transform the process. Using optical sensor technology that projects laser lights and detects the ""interstory drift"" or displacement in a building, the sensors can determine a structure's integrity after an earthquake, speeding the safety assessments and repairs that follow. Researchers began testing the laser system in 2019 and, with a new $240,000 grant from the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Safety, will continue testing the technology this summer on a bridge overpass in northern Nevada. ""This technology can transform the ability to assess damage and rapidly respond to earthquakes,"" said David McCallen, professor and director of the Earthquake Engineering Lab in the College of Engineering and senior scientist in the Energy Geosciences Division at the Berkeley Lab in a press release from the University. ""We are pushing towards broad application of this new technology.” [The University of Nevada, Reno]

Almost one third of the world's population still isn't guaranteed access to safe and affordable drinking water, but, with funding from the Army Research Office, researchers from the University of Rochester may have found a simple solution: sunlight. In the paper Solar-Trackable Super-Wicking Black Metal Panel for Photothermal Water Sanitation, researchers describe how a laser-etched aluminum panel placed in a contaminated body of water can concentrate the sun's energy, quickly evaporating and purifying the water. ""A solution to the global water sanitation crisis should realize efficient water sanitation with low cost materials, which should require low maintenance and should be universally viable to all types of contaminants,"" not just microbes, but industrial and heavy metal pollutants as well, the paper says. ""In a similar manner to the rain cycle, wastewater can be completely sanitized using solar energy for evaporating water and condensing vapour into drinkable water. "" [Nature Sustainability]

Stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic have changed how we move through the built environment and the sound levels of cities. But the remaining inescapable hum is still too much for some who are stuck inside, leading them to prioritize closing windows for quiet over fresh air. In Active Control of Broadband Sound Through the Open Aperture of a Full-Sized Domestic Window, researchers from the Nanyang Technological University School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in Singapore and the University of Southampton Institute of Sound and Vibration Research in the United Kingdom suggest a noise control option for naturally ventilated buildings: a grid of speakers that, if installed over a window, can reduce broadband noise while windows stay open. ""Our experiments show that up to 10-dB reduction in energy-averaged sound pressure level is attainable in the frequency range of typical urban transportation noise, with a fully-opened two-panel sliding window,"" the paper reads.

Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are working on a new model that gives robots ""human-like perception of their physical environments,"" according to a press release. Dubbed 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs, the model helps robots generate and gather information from a 3D map of their surroundings, mimicking how humans navigate their surrounding world. Part of the model's effectiveness stems from Kimera, an open-source library mix of 3D mapping and semantic segmentation that helps the robot create a 3D, meshlike digital map: ""“With this work, we are making the leap toward a new era of robotic perception called spatial-AI, which is just in its infancy but has great potential in robotics and large-scale virtual and augmented reality,"" said lead author and MIT graduate student Antoni Rosinol in the same release.

""We have employed an incredibly powerful process that eliminates even the most persistent non-biodegradable pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides, as well as various classes of organic compounds that can be found in many industrial effluents,"" she said.

""The process is relatively simple, does not require the addition of chemicals or severe operation conditions, and does not produce additional waste streams.""

""Wastewater is a significant issue for our environment, as well as for many industries who use substantial volumes of water in their processes, such as in reactions, transport, and washing and cooling. Finding suitable solutions for reuse or disposal is often very challenging and costly.

""The electrochemical method that we used can be readily applied to industries that must comply with strict regulations for wastewater disposal, such as pulp and paper processing, wineries, as well as pharmaceutical production facilities.

""Worldwide, researchers are investigating methods for the development of biofuels from algae. Developing alternatives for the treatment and reuse of this industrial effluent is a hot research topic and can bring opportunities for energy and resource recovery within a circular bio-economy framework.""

The team will soon carry out research focused on specific contaminants to better understand the chemical transformations that take place during electrochemical oxidation and will upscale the process.

A 2017 UNESCO report found that the opportunities from exploiting wastewater as a resource were vast, and that safely managed wastewater is an affordable and sustainable source of water, energy, nutrients and other recoverable materials.

Providing Al Shubelaih HF with Clean Water

Mahwa’a Al Khulaif village, At Tuhayta District in Al Hudaydah Governorate, is one of the country’s poorest areas. Many communities have been made more vulnerable by the ongoing conflict. It remains one of the most difficult areas for humanitarian actors to access to provide life-saving assistance. Access to health services and water points has deteriorated, leading to increased caseloads of cholera. From Aug to Oct 2019 alone, there have been 227 suspected cases of cholera in Al Shubelaih HF, which is situated in Mahwa’a Al Khulaif Village. Children under five and elderly people represent the most vulnerable populations when exposed to water-borne diseases.

Both, contamination and shortage of water could negatively affect education as well as health within the communities. Unfortunately, girls and boys are disproportionately affected, often sacrificing their education to trek long distances in search of water for their families. In the same vein, it is not common for pregnant women to go into labor while searching for water, but giving birth in established health centers that lack water can be equally dangerous. Lack of basic cleanliness and sterilization put both the mother and baby at risk.

“When a baby is born in a health facility that paucities sufficient water and hygiene, the risk of infection and death for both the mother and the baby is high,” said Fatmah Mohammed, a midwife at Al Shubelaih HF. She also added saying, “In the past, Al Shubelaih HF lacked basic services, and there was no water at all, which made me and other midwives go fetching clean water in jerry-cans from nearby wells.”

Health facilities without clean water can spread disease instead of preventing them, the availability of clean water in health facilities is critical to providing quality health care. No one goes to a health care facility to get ill. People go to get better, to deliver babies or to get vaccinated. Yet, hundreds of people encounter an increased risk of infection by seeking care in health facilities that lack basic necessities, including water, sanitation, hygiene, health care waste management and cleaning (WaSH) services.

“We accustomed to use the clean water for principle purposes, such as washing hands and cleaning the medical equipment since the source of clean water was limited,” said Fatmah Mohammed, “Now, we have a cleaner who cleans the whole HF every day, and there is no need to go fetching few liters of water, clean water is at hand due to the intervention of BFD.’’

BFD in partnership with YHF did not stand idly by and let 95,86 HCs and IDPs in Mahwa’a Al Khulaif village suffer more. Therefore, a project named “Integrated Health, Nutrition and WaSH Project in worst affected areas in At Tuhayta, Ad Duraihimi and Al Hali districts of Al Hodeidah Gov.” was launched to help those in dire need. BFD could help 95,86 HCs and IDPs in Mahwa’a Al Khulaif village by rehabilitating an elevated reservoir with a capacity of 75 m3, installing water networks to each HH with a length of 700 m, and installing a solar energy system that produces 34,125 Watt to operate the water pump. Not only did this project provide each HH with clean water, but it also provided Al Shubelaih HF.

At present, the HCs and IDPs in Mahwa’a Al Khulaif village breathe a sigh of relief since clean water reaches every HH with quantities no less than 37L per person, and most importantly, BFD conducted a training course for WaSH Committees on how to operate, manage and maintain the project.","Success Story of Mahwa’a Al Khulaif Village Project, At Tuhayta District, Al Hudaydah Gov.

Credit: Courtesy of University of Rochester

Providing clean water to soldiers in the field and citizens around the world is essential, and yet one of the world's greatest challenges. Now a new super-wicking and super-light-absorbing aluminum material developed with Army funding could change that.

With funding from the Army Research Office, an element of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Laboratory, researchers at the University of Rochester have developed a new aluminum panel that more efficiently concentrates solar energy to evaporate and purify contaminated water.

""The Army and its warfighters run on water, so there is particular interest in basic materials research that could lead to advanced technologies for generating drinking water,"" said Dr. Evan Runnerstrom, program manager at ARO. ""The combined super-wicking and light-absorbing properties of these aluminum surfaces may enable passive or low-power water purification to better sustain the warfighter in the field.""

The researchers developed a laser processing technology that turns regular aluminum pitch black, making it highly absorptive, as well as super-wicking (it wicks water uphill against gravity). They then applied this super absorptive and super-wicking aluminum for this solar water purification.

The technology featured in Nature Sustainability, uses a burst of femtosecond (ultrashort) laser pulses to etch the surface of a normal sheet of aluminum. When the aluminum panel is dipped in water at an angle facing the sun, it draws a thin film of water upwards over the metal's surface. At the same time, the blackened surface retains nearly 100-percent of the energy it absorbs from the sun to quickly heat the water. Finally, the wicking surface structures change the inter-molecular bonds of the water, increasing the efficiency of the evaporation process even further.

""These three things together enable the technology to operate better than an ideal device at 100 percent efficiency,"" said Professor Chunlei Guo, professor of optics at University of Rochester. ""This is a simple, durable, inexpensive way to address the global water crisis, especially in developing nations.""

Experiments by the lab show that the method reduces the presence of all common contaminants, such as detergent, dyes, urine, heavy metals and glycerin, to safe levels for drinking.

The technology could also be useful in developed countries for relieving water shortages in drought-stricken areas, and for water desalinization projects, Guo said.

Using sunlight to boil has long been recognized as a way to eliminate microbial pathogens and reduce deaths from diarrheal infections, but boiling water does not eliminate heavy metals and other contaminants.

Solar-based water purification; however, can greatly reduce these contaminants because nearly all the impurities are left behind when the evaporating water becomes gaseous and then condenses and gets collected.

The most common method of solar-based water evaporation is volume heating, in which a large volume of water is heated but only the top layer can evaporate. This is obviously inefficient, Guo said, because only a small fraction of the heating energy gets used.

A more efficient approach, called interfacial heating, places floating, multi-layered absorbing and wicking materials on top of the water, so that only water near the surface needs to be heated. But the available materials all have to float horizontally on top of the water and cannot face the sun directly. Furthermore, the available wicking materials become quickly clogged with contaminants left behind after evaporation, requiring frequent replacement of the materials.

The aluminum panel the researchers developed avoids these difficulties by pulling a thin layer of water out of the reservoir and directly onto the solar absorber surface for heating and evaporation.

""Moreover, because we use an open-grooved surface, it is very easy to clean by simply spraying it,"" Guo said. ""The biggest advantage is that the angle of the panels can be continuously adjusted to directly face the sun as it rises and then moves across the sky before setting—maximizing energy absorption.""

Rabat – Morocco’s National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) is launching a local drinking water project aimed at contributing to water infrastructure development throughout the country.

According to a recent press release, the director general of ONEE, Abderrahim El Hafidi, and the governor of Guercif province, Hassan Belhami, launched a project under the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water to provide Guercif residents with a clean drinking water supply by 2022.

Totaling MAD 95 million ($9.8 million), the project includes the construction of four new boreholes that will pump 80 liters of water a second into the city’s pipes from the “Targa” or “Madi” dam. As well, project designers involved a plan to construct a water tank with a capacity of 6,000 cubic meters, with its pipes stretched across 32 kilometers.

In addition to strengthening the water distribution network, the project could help reduce the country’s 35% drinking water production deficit and significantly improve quality of life for the city’s 143,200 inhabitants.

The provincial authorities of Guercif, relevant companies, and other stakeholders involved are collaborating with ONEE to carry out the project — a critical effort to promote health and hygiene while mitigating the negative impacts of drought.

Following the height of the COVID-19 crisis, the government notes the need to continue securing clean drinking water, liquid sanitation services, and electricity to protect the population from contagions such as the novel coronavirus.

The endeavor also addresses Morocco’s general need for water infrastructure development and addresses the critical need for sustainable socio-economic development within the region.

In the Western side of the Oriental region, Guercif is the capital city of Guercif province. Like many residing in rural Morocco, residents of the less-developed town struggle to access clean drinking water. In August 2019, the World Resource Institute ranked Morocco 22nd on their National Water Stress Rankings.

On the same timeline as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal number 6, calling for the sustainable availability and management of clean water and sanitation for all by 2030, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah announced on June 30 that ONEE investments in the water and electricity sectors are set to reach MAD 25 billion ($2.6 billion) by 2030.","ONEE is launching projects and making significant investments in mitigating Morocco’s water stress in the country’s Guercif province, contributing to water infrastructure development nationwide.

Under the terms of the settlement, the company will spend about $2 million in upgrades to reduce the amount of pollutants the facility sends to the David City wastewater treatment system. The company also agreed to pay a $827,500 civil penalty.

“We are encouraged by Henningsen’s willingness to upgrade its own facility and assist with upgrades to the David City wastewater treatment system,” said EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Gulliford. “These actions will protect the residents of David City and Nebraska waters.”

Henningsen processes approximately 1.2 million eggs per day and is one of the largest egg processors in the state. The facility is subject to Clean Water Act regulations that prevent industries from overloading municipal wastewater treatment systems with industrial pollutants.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), high loads of egg-processing waste and cleaning solution generated by Henningsen are sent to the David City wastewater treatment facility. Since at least 2014, this waste has caused both Henningsen and David City to violate the Clean Water Act on multiple occasions by discharging pollutants in excess of state and federal limits to Keysor Creek, which flows into the North Fork Big Blue River. These pollutants included ammonia and oxygen-depleting substances that are toxic to aquatic life and potentially harmful to people. Further, EPA alleges that Henningsen repeatedly failed to submit timely and accurate pollutant monitoring information required by law.

As a result of this enforcement action, Henningsen has installed pretreatment equipment at its facility and agreed to operate and maintain it in order to reduce pollutants before they reach the David City wastewater treatment facility. The company will also continue to pay for its share of upgrades to the David City wastewater treatment facility to adequately treat Henningsen’s wastewater, and will increase the frequency of its pollutant monitoring and reporting.

The settlement is detailed in a Consent Decree that was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska on July 7, 2020, and will be subject to a 30-day public comment period before final court approval.","LENEXA, Kan. – The United States and the state of Nebraska have reached a settlement with Henningsen Foods Inc. to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Water Act at the company’s egg processing facility in David City, Nebraska.

7 July 2020

Geneva - Continuously striving to reinforce its commitment to improve environmental impacts and support social initiatives is a key objective of Kempinski Hotels. To further expand the partnership with Clean the World , a leader in global health dedicated to sustainability around water, sanitation and hygiene, in the past six months more Kempinski hotels have joined the programme and the number continues to grow. Europe's oldest luxury hotel group is committed to further enhance its activities in the field of recycling and helps to fight the spread of hygiene-related illnesses.

Clean the World's hospitality programme takes discarded soap bars and bottled amenities and recycles them in order to protect the environment, preserve natural resources, help communities in need and to reduce costs. The seamless process starts with a housekeeping service collecting the used soap and amenities and sorting them into Clean the World-provided bins. Once full, the bins are shipped to one of six Clean the World warehouses, where the soap is then run through a special filtration process, whereby all debris is removed and filtered into 'grind'. The grind is then mixed with a lab-tested sanitation solution and pressed into new soap bars. The bars are cut, packed and shipped to one of the many distribution partners around the world, including UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency), Children International , Global Medic , World Vision and the Red Cross , to name a few. From there, the bars are then put directly into the hands of vulnerable ones who so desperately need them.

""We are incredibly excited to be working with with Clean the World, whose commitment to sustainability and continued support for impoverished communities around the world amplify our corporate social responsibility,"" said Benedikt Jaschke, Chief Quality Officer and Member of the Kempinski Management Board. ""At Kempinski Hotels, we strive to promote a sustainable future for our industry and assist in helping fight the global spread of preventable diseases. We look forward to continue building a strong partnership with Clean the World as we collectively work to raise awareness and support such an important cause which is even more vital as we face the current global pandemic.""

Commenting on the partnership, Shawn Seipler, Founder and CEO of Clean the World, said, ""We are thrilled to be partnering with the luxury brand Kempinski Hotels. Their forward-thinking and corporate sense of responsibility to enhance their sustainability efforts to now include soap recycling speaks volumes about who they are as a brand. They are prioritising putting life-saving soap into the hands of people who need it, while also protecting the environment from harmful waste.""

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Clean the World has continued to work tirelessly to distribute over 3 million bars of soap to homeless shelters, food pantries, refugee camps and emergency healthcare facilities around the world. In the next 90 days, the organisation will distribute another 4 million bars of soap to the highest-risk and most vulnerable populations globally to help protect them from the spread of the deadly disease. Clean the World is calling on all hotels to recycle their soap rather than dispose of it, so they can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and prevent a future resurgence of the virus within vulnerable populations.","Press Release7 July 2020Geneva - Continuously striving to reinforce its commitment to improve environmental impacts and support social initiatives is a key objective of Kempinski Hotels.

THE Department of Water and Sanitation will host its annual Clear Rivers campaign online this year.

The campaign, which aims to raise awareness about South Africa’s water resources, sees thousands of locals celebrate Mandela month by cleaning the country’s rivers and other polluted water sources.

Due to lockdown rules that prohibit mass gatherings, the department has appealed to South Africans to mark the 30th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s release from prison by keeping the rivers in their neighbourhoods clean.

“They should not litter or throw foreign objects into rivers that will impact negatively on the lives of downstream users. Rivers carry water and nutrients, and they play an important part in the water cycle. We use rivers for water supply, which we use for drinking in our homes, watering on farms, making products in factories and generating electricity,” the department said in statement on Monday.

The department has called on all South Africans to be mindful of the pollution of water resources, including rivers, as this may also jeopardise government’s efforts to fight the spread of Covid-19 at a time when 197 000 people have contracted the virus, which has claimed the lives of 3 199 people to date.

“Fostering volunteerism among communities is actively encouraged as part of this is a proactive approach to protecting our rivers, streams, wetlands and other water ecosystems,” said the department.

In September 2019, the department released a quarterly report, known as the River Ecostatus Monitoring Programme (REMP).

According to the report, most of the country’s rivers fall under Category D/E of the generic description of ecological conditions.

Managing waste more efficiently through a systemic and people-centric approach will help India curb greenhouse gas emissions

At a global scale, the waste management sector makes a relatively minor contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, estimated at about 3-5% of total emissions caused by human activities in 2005. However, the waste sector is in a unique position to move from being a minor source of global emissions to becoming a major saver of emissions.

Although minor levels of emissions are released through waste treatment and disposal, the prevention and recovery of wastes (as secondary materials or energy) avoids emissions in all other sectors of the economy. A holistic approach to waste management has positive consequences for greenhouse gas emissions from the energy, forestry, agriculture, mining, transport, and manufacturing sectors, according to a report by United Nations Environment Programme.

Over the past decade, India has fared well with its commitments to the climate action targets of Paris Agreement, especially with the adoption of National Electricity Plan in 2018. While the reforms in energy sector backed by strong policy commitments are commendable, it is high time for India to reform policies in the area of waste management to augment its efforts on climate action.

The expanding landfill sites in the country are posing a threat to environment, biodiversity and human health. Of the total waste generated in the country, only 46.03% solid waste is processed, according to data available on solid waste generation and processing. Chandigarh and Chhattisgarh lead the table, standing at 85% and 84%, respectively, while states like West Bengal are at the bottom, processing only 5% of the solid waste generated.

Nuances of Clean India Mission

While the problem has captured attention of policymakers and finds mention in national level programmes like the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM or Clean India Mission), there is a lag in policy implementation due to hidden challenges that we now try to unfold here.

With the culmination of providing household level sanitation facilities in 2019, the Ministry of Jal Shakti — which was formed in May 2019 by merging the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation — has geared up to move towards its next agenda of facilitating solid and liquid waste management in rural and urban areas.

The release of Rural Sanitation Strategy document 2019-29 in September 2019 indicates the aspiration of the ministry towards sustaining the attained ODF (Open Defecation Free) status and move towards addressing waste management issues in urban and rural areas of India.

Before we plan to step higher on the SBM ladder, it is important to understand the difference in complexity of issues in sanitation and waste management. While the former held the challenge of scaling up sanitation facilities to 102.8 million households as on March 2020, the latter is a more complex problem, having challenges beyond that of scale, as it entails identifying and implementing area specific technological solutions.

There is an urgent need to view the issue through a systemic lens, not a systematic one. The agenda of providing toilets at household level required investment of time and finance on a large scale. There were huge administrative overheads in reaching out to every village, reiterating the process of disbursing funds to the beneficiaries and building capacities of stakeholders for toilet construction, but technical barriers were minimal as toilet designs were specified by the government based on land topography.

With appropriate designs at hand, efforts were directed mostly towards replication. In contrast, solid and liquid waste management demands exhaustive technical skills and specialised knowledge. Each town or village differs in terms of the quantum of waste generation, extent of drainage system coverage, existing capacities of solid waste collection and geographical challenges. This necessitates area specific solutions, indicating the need for decentralised knowledge management support at the ground level.

Support at the grassroots

In India’s three-tier governance system, knowledge support organisations hold a key position, whether it is assisting in formulation of policies and laws at the central and state level or devising and implementing innovative solutions fitting the local context.

While the former is aided by institutions like NITI Aayog and Parliamentary Standing Committees, the latter largely depends on the willingness and participation by local support systems like civil society organisations, technology experts and community-based organisations.

The knowledge management support to the first tier of governance is well institutionalised and regularised, contrary to that at the second and third tiers, where such support is rare. However, it is the third tier which has a direct interface with the beneficiaries and faces implementation challenges.

To succeed in the mission of waste management, a sustainable source of support in terms of domain expertise, knowledge sharing, and planning is essential at the third tier. In this context, the guidelines of the first phase of SBM suggested formation of special committees for SBM at district, block and village levels.

However, these committees have not been very effective. This apart, many states are yet to form even the District Planning Committees (as per Article 243ZD of the Constitution of India) that aim to consolidate the development plans of panchayats and municipalities into comprehensive district development plans.

People-centric approach to manage solid waste

The constitution of legislated committees and knowledge groups at the third tier are vital to ensure that permanent support system for planning and directions regarding waste management are in place. Andhra Pradesh recently launched a village-level secretariat system to ensure effective last mile delivery of 500 types of services.

This is a welcome move pertaining to administrative decentralisation. A similar model for decentralisation of knowledge support can be considered. The presence of such a system shall further help to mobilise and regularise the support from technology partners and NGOs.

A dedicated, responsive and active governance system committed towards the purpose of waste management is expected to boost the confidence of external partners to invest their resources even in remote regions, which remain neglected so far.

In the absence of a comprehensive support system, the how and whereabout of technological solutions and fund mobilisation towards managing waste remain unaddressed and stalls implementation of waste management projects. Taking elements from different solid waste management models in the country, the gradual step should involve moving towards an inclusive system where all three tiers of governance are able to solve locally arising waste management problems in a people-participatory manner, so that the attained solutions are sustainable.

It is then that India shall move towards waste processing rather than mere waste dumping and also complement the agenda of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants along with sustainable land management highlighted by United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.

Sanitation is important until, and after, utilities such as water and electricity are restored.

Dirty surfaces or items can spread sickness and disease, resulting in everything from stomach aches, nausea and diarrhoea, to more serious ailments that require medical attention.

Food

Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water, perishable foods and those with an unusual odour, colour or texture. When in doubt, throw it out.

Cleaning products

Bleach is your friend during and after a hurricane. After washing surfaces with soap and water to remove dirt and debris, sanitise with diluted household bleach. This can be applied to everything from food surfaces to food cans and sinks, toys, flatware, plates and tools. It can also be used to combat mould on hard surfaces.

Have plenty of soap on hand as well as detergent, sanitising wipes and hand gel. The latter will keep the germs at bay without requiring water, which may be in short supply.

Make sure you also stock up on paper towels and toilet paper as laundering towels could be difficult for a while, and lots of strong plastic bags and garbage bags.

Wear rubber gloves, boots and even goggles whenever possible during a cleanup of an affected area. The more you protect yourself, the more chance you have of escaping nasty and dangerous germs.

Temporary toilets

If water is in short supply, flushing toilets is a wasteful and possible hazardous thing to do. Each flush takes about a gallon of water, which is a lot when there are limited amounts around.

For a temporary solution, you can line the dry toilet bowl with a garbage bag, and then use it to remove the waste from the house.

A five-gallon bucket lined with a garbage bag also makes a good makeshift toilet.

Water

Do not ever use water you suspect may have been contaminated to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, make ice or make baby formula.

Finding safe drinking water is paramount, particularly as your body requires constant hydration.

If you don’t have safe, bottled water, boiling is the surest method to make water safer to drink by killing disease-causing organisms, including viruses, bacteria and parasites. Bring water to a rolling boil for three to five minutes.

Pay attention to Cayman’s authorities about the status of your water supply. Use only bottled or disinfected water for drinking and cooking until the public water supplies have been declared safe.

Boil-water orders are often issued after a hurricane. That’s usually because the public water utility has lost pressure in its water-moving systems, making it possible for contaminants to enter water lines.

Water saved in bottles before the storm should be good for up to six months, if properly stored.

Always wash hands with soap and clean water that has been sterilised. If there is no water, use hand sanitiser.","One of the most important things to prepare for when a hurricane is approaching, or another natural disaster strikes, is the ability to keep everything you use clean.

As practitioners of a health care modality, massage therapists must conform to health regulations and standards of practice created by their regulatory body. As a profession, we need to come to one standard, and that must be the highest standard recommended.

6 Steps

1. As cups are medical devices, they must be reprocessed — cleaned and disinfected — accordingly. Where massage therapy is regulated in Canada and the U.S., such regulation generally falls under the auspices of the local health department. There are two classifications that cover cups; however, one covers them in all instances, while the other does not.

A semicritical medical device is defined as: “Medical equipment/device that comes in contact with nonintact skin or mucous membranes but ordinarily does not penetrate them … Reprocessing semicritical equipment/devices involves meticulous cleaning followed by, at a minimum, high-level disinfection.”(1) This is the category that covers a cup all the time. As a standard practice, the classification of cups should cover the cups at all times. One standard is the best standard.

2. The reprocessing effort begins with cleaning. Wash your cups thoroughly with soap and water. This may need to be done more than once, since lubricants that are used in manual therapy treatments are difficult to remove entirely on the first wash. The washed cup is rinsed and then put through the disinfection process.

3. For high-level disinfection, the cups need to be placed in a bath of one of the following chemicals: 2% glutaraldehyde; 6 to 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (the CDC in the U.S. recommends use of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide as opposed to the 6.0% recommended by Canadian regulatory bodies.); 0.2% peracetic acid; or 2 to 7% enhanced action formulation hydrogen peroxide and 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA).

Each of these chemicals has a specific contact time, or the time in which it must be in contact with the cups in order to reach high-level disinfection.(2) Pasteurization also achieves high-level disinfection.

4. I recommend hydrogen peroxide as the disinfection agent. This product is easy to get and relatively inexpensive, breaks down into water and oxygen, does not smell, and is easily disposed of in most places. It can be picked up locally in higher concentrations at hydroponics stores, some pool supply stores, and some pharmacies.

The bottle that you purchase will be good for two years from the date of manufacture. It can be disposed of in most municipal plumbing or into rural septic systems as long as it is diluted with running water as it is poured in. It is good as a disinfectant bath for multiple uses for 21 days from when it is diluted down from a higher concentration or is used the first time. Please note that higher concentrations are not necessarily better, as higher than 10% can cause the breakdown of some types of cups.

Cups are left in a bath of 7.5% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes to reach high-level disinfection. If cups are left for six hours, they are considered sterilized, which is the next highest level of disinfection. This is good for when the cups do inadvertently come into contact with blood or body fluids. If any of the other disinfectants are used, follow appropriate guidelines as to the contact time of that disinfectant.

5. It is important to remember that these disinfectants, no matter which, are meant to kill organic matter. Please respect them, and wear the recommended personal protective equipment to handle them appropriately. Gloves, goggles and sometimes a gown or apron are a good idea when working with disinfectant chemicals.

6. From the disinfection bath, the cups need to be rinsed, so the disinfectant agent is rinsed off, or neutralized. Cups are then left to dry. Once dry, the cups are safe to use on the next client without worry of cross- contamination.

Prevention of coronavirus spread: FSSAI shares guidelines for cleaning of vegetables and fruits! Since the early days into the spread of coronavirus, experts and health authorities have been asking people to be very cautious and maintain cleanliness on all surfaces and objects around them, including food items. Now, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has shared some guidelines for the proper cleaning of vegetables and fruits to prevent the spread of coronavirus through them, even as there is no certainty yet about whether the virus can be transmitted via food items or not.

In a Twitter post, the official handle of FSSAI shared a 5-tip graphic to guide people on how they should wash their fruits and vegetables to maintain their safety.

FSSAI directed people to keep the fruits and vegetables, recently purchased from vendors, in their packaging itself in an isolated corner of the house for some time.

Consumers should then wash the vegetables thoroughly using lukewarm water. Alternatively, consumers can also put a drop of 50-ppm chlorine in warm water and dip the produce in the solution.

The vegetables and fruits should be cleaned using clean drinking or potable water.

Consumers should be very careful and should avoid using disinfectants, soaps or cleaning wipes to clean produce.

The vegetables and fruits that need to be kept in the refrigerator should be stored there and other produce should be kept at room temperature in racks or baskets, FSSAI said.

FSSAI had recently also issued guidelines to be followed after returning from shopping trips.","FSSAI had recently also issued guidelines to be followed after returning from shopping trips.

After all, somebody needs to water the CHOP garden plots.

CHS reported earlier this week on the repair and clean-up work underway to restore E Pine and Cal Anderson — and some of the unintended consequences of good intentions leaving Black Life Matters organizers with a bad feeling about the city’s commitment to meeting the goals of the movement.

Seattle Parks has responded to make it clear that Cal Anderson is still not technically open to the public.

“The park remains closed for the time being,” a spokesperson tells CHS. “Our crews have at least another week (maybe two) of work to do—repair damage to the shelterhouse and restroom, repairing the irrigation system, and further repairs and professional sanitation of the turf field, along with additional graffiti removal.” The city says it is also working to preserve some of the CHOP art and “memorialize aspects of the community protests at Cal Anderson park, such as a garden, art and/ or speaker’s corner.”

CHS has found the park in use by neighbors and visitors out for a walk or taking dogs for a romp. We’ve also heard from a few people asked to leave the park by police — some, gasp, mid-picnic.

Some residents will need to access the space. Seattle Parks is telling neighbors that the community garden plots established by urban farmer Marcus Henderson in the park during the weeks of CHOP occupation and camping won’t be maintained by city staff.

“The current plan is to leave the garden in place until the late summer/fall harvest, and then work with Marcus and interested community on a longer-term plan,” the parks representative tells CHS.

The city has been reported watering some of the plots — and we’ve seen a few volunteer efforts from city employees — but residents are being encouraged to help take care of the plots.

Meanwhile, more substantial — but perhaps less unpleasant — work will be taking place at Seattle City Hall Wednesday, where the City Council’s budget committee will dig in on a core element of CHOP demands — the fight to defund SPD and cut the policing budget in Seattle by 50%.

Several Ugandan and British companies from the renewable energy sector took part in the discussions which focused on the challenges of electrification through clean, affordable and sustainable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, etc….

Challenges related to the popularisation of renewable energies

The Ugandan and British companies that participated in the online event believe that renewable energy could make a difference in many countries around the world and more specifically in developing countries as they have enormous potential. These sources of electricity are cheaper and competitive with fossil fuels. However, the deployment of renewable energy is hampered by three challenges according to the World Bank. These are “technical constraints on grid integration, risks related to weak procurement capacity, and the planning of national power companies. The financial institution says countries could increase their renewable energy production at lower cost and in a sustainable manner by developing “an appropriate enabling environment, in particular improving the financial viability of national utilities and their planning capacities, as well as the key public investments needed to integrate renewable energy production. The alternative would be the balanced and equitable sharing of risks between public and private stakeholders through transparent and competitive procurement systems”.

In addition to exploring ways and opportunities, the virtual trade mission introduced 12 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the renewable energy sector to investment opportunities in Uganda. The virtual exchange also aimed to engage with British organisations that are candidates for the Energy Catalyst Round 8 (ECRP) programme on Uganda’s electricity access challenges.

The competition aims to support innovative and sustainable electricity access technologies and business models to accelerate the transition to clean energy in developing and emerging economies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme is currently funded by the UK Government’s Global ChallengesResearch Fund (GCRF) and Department for International Development (DfID) under its Transforming Energy Access programme.

Rabat – Approximately 88% of Moroccan beaches have clean waters and sands, according to the 2020 National Report on the Quality of Bathing Waters and Sand in Moroccan Beaches.

The figure translates to 370 beaches that comply with Morocco’s quality standards, while 52 do not conform to the standards.

The Environment Department at the Ministry of Energy prepared the report in collaboration with the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment and presented its results during an online press conference on July 6.

Statistics presented in the report were based on a study conducted between 2016 and 2019 through analyzing water and sand samples from 422 Moroccan beaches and comparing them to the Moroccan quality standards. Thirty-nine beaches were excluded due to insufficient data collection.

Most of the beaches that do not conform to quality standards have reached that stage because of wastewater pollution, mass tourism, poor sanitation, and climate change, Minister of Energy Aziz Rabbah explained.

Plastic and polystyrene waste is the most common pollutant in Moroccan beaches, making up 84% of waste found in the monitored beaches.

To counter the effect of water pollution, Morocco has launched several pilot projects for collecting waste from beaches, Rabbah revealed, giving two examples.

The first project, “Adopting the Beach,” was piloted by the ministry’s regional directorate in Tangier and the local Association of Science Teachers. The project benefited four beaches along the Mediterranean coast, enabling them to meet Morocco’s quality standards.

The second project, “Waste Fishing,” was implemented by the Fnideq Association for Underwater Fishing Champions and local authorities. The project turned three sites near the fishing port of Fnideq, in northern Morocco, into clean beaches.

Morocco and the Blue Flag label

During Monday’s press conference, a representative from the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Protection of the Environment presented the evaluation of Moroccan beaches nominated for the Blue Flag label.

The international label, first established in 1985 through the Foundation for Environmental Education, testifies for the quality of beaches according to several criteria.

According to the foundation’s representative, 39 out of 102 Moroccan beaches that applied for the label in 2020 obtained it. In 2019, only 21 Moroccan beaches earned the Blue Flag label.

The recently-published report presents a series of recommendations to maintain the quality of waters or improve it.

The recommendations include removing drainage systems that unload wastewater into swimming areas, continuously monitoring drainage and water purification networks, equipping beaches with appropriate infrastructure and hygiene facilities, and raising awareness on ecological behaviors among beachgoers.

Regarding communication tools, the report announced that the National Laboratory for Pollution Study and Monitoring has compiled all available information on Moroccan beaches on a website, ma.gov.environnement.labo, and a smartphone application, “Iplages.”

The information available on the platforms includes itineraries for beaches, the quality of their waters, and an overview of the services available on-site.","Researchers behind the report analyzed water and sand samples from 422 Moroccan beaches over three years.

The task force’s climate-change mitigation recommendations, out this week, push further than any policy proposed in previous general election platforms. They call for carbon-free power production by 2035, net-zero emissions for new buildings by 2030 and accelerated adoption of zero-emission vehicles. The authors frame the national climate response as a matter of equity for communities that have suffered disproportionately from pollution and climate impacts, as well as a form of economic rebuilding after the coronavirus pandemic.

The climate task force brought together Democrats from across the political spectrum to hash out a shared vision for action on climate change. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the Obama administration’s negotiations at the Paris climate summit, co-chaired along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution. Varshini Prakash, co-founder and executive director of the youth activist group Sunrise Movement, also participated.

The input from progressive climate activists successfully pushed the platform toward faster decarbonization than Biden had previously envisioned.

The result would allocate an unprecedented amount of federal support to reshaping a low-carbon economy, should a Biden administration take power next year. But the plan still looks to industry to do most of the work of installing and operating clean power plants.

Here’s how some of the ambitious new goals compare to what the clean energy industry has accomplished so far.

Zero-carbon grid by 2035

Eight states have already committed to eliminating carbon from their electrical systems, including the economic powerhouses of California and New York. In the last couple of years, most of the largest utility companies have also pledged to eliminate carbon from their operations.

But these commitments almost always pick a deadline of 2045 or 2050. The Biden-Sanders taskforce pushes up the timeline by 10 or 15 years.

It’s worth noting that the platform affirms “technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency.” That’s a break from requiring renewables only, which would limit the tools available. This also means that the country needn’t ditch the carbon-free nuclear power that delivers one-fifth of annual electricity production right now. The Sanders campaign called nuclear a “false solution” that it wanted to do away with, but keeping that resource in the mix makes the carbon-free overhaul less difficult.

A recent study from the University of California, Berkeley sheds light on the overall feasibility of this timeline. When researchers updated their models with the latest cost projections, they found that the U.S. could achieve a reliable 90-percent-carbon-free grid by 2035 and that wholesale prices would actually decrease by 13 percent.

That leaves some room to push harder.

Reaching 90 percent clean requires doubling the highest historical yearly wind and solar deployment through the 2020s and tripling it in the 2030s, explained Sonia Aggarwal, VP at Energy Innovation, who researched the policies needed to achieve the scenarios in the Berkeley study.

“If we accelerate that deployment rate just a bit — say, triple the historical best deployment for solar and wind in the 2020s, make sure not to retire any existing nuclear as long as it stays safe, and pour some funding into [research and development] focused on the last 10 percent — it’s certainly feasible that we would have solutions for the last 10 percent within the next decade, putting us on track to achieve 100 percent by 2035,” she said.

As Aggarwal noted, that last 10 percent is the big question mark. The grid needs to work 24/7, so a system of cheap wind and solar needs complementary resources to deliver power on demand.

Options on the table include long-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear reactors, super-deep geothermal and emissions-free gas power. None of them have achieved widespread commercial success, but there hasn’t been much demand for them yet, either. Investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into developing these technologies as the market opportunities become clearer.

“If history is any indication, we will be surprised by how fast technology moves, and we will see more options open up to solve the last 10 percent the sooner we get moving on the first 90 percent,” Aggarwal said.

Eight million solar roofs

The report calls for installing “eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems” within five years. The wording leaves room on whether that could mean 8 million new installations or 8 million cumulative.

The U.S. hit 2 million solar installations in May 2019, and since then residential installations alone have passed that threshold. Based on current conditions, the solar analysts at Wood Mackenzie estimate a cumulative total of approximately 4.6 million residential solar systems installed by 2025. That projection includes assumptions about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer spending in the ensuing economic recession and the stepdown of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit.

The target also includes community solar, but that doesn’t add much: The U.S. had installed 1,623 community solar projects through Q1 2020, according to WoodMac’s count.

“The U.S. would need substantial policy supports to achieve this goal, because under current conditions we are over 3 million shy of reaching that goal — if the goal is to mean cumulative installations and not additional,” said senior analyst Austin Perea.

The solar industry is pushing Congress to extend the Investment Tax Credit, and Democrats added that to their infrastructure bill in June. But even bold assumptions about residential solar growth with a prolonged ITC aren’t enough to hit 8 million systems in 2025.

“If you wanted one policy to help achieve this goal, the easiest would absolutely be a national rooftop solar mandate,” Perea noted. “The U.S. could absolutely hit these goals by 2025 with the passage of a national rooftop solar mandate implemented within the next few years.""

California enacted a solar mandate for new homes this year. Advocates are pushing at least 10 other states to pass similar rules.

Increase zero-emission vehicles

Compared to the aggressive clean power goal and net-zero emission building codes by 2030, the task force set humbler objectives for the transportation sector. It does not phase out emissions from vehicles overall but tackles public-sector fleets with specific targets.

The national school bus fleet, which comprises 500,000 vehicles, will have to transition to zero-emission vehicles within five years. Local, state and federal fleets will transition as well, though on an unspecified timeline. The federal government will partner with local governments to invest in 500,000 public charging stations and in public transportation.

A WoodMac report from last fall predicted 40,000 heavy-duty electric vehicles will hit the roads in Europe and the U.S. by 2025. In other words, business as usual would get nowhere near 500,000 school buses in the U.S. alone.

That said, electric vehicles are already competitive in the bus market.

They still cost more upfront, but the cost of batteries falls every year. Lifetime costs are often lower than diesel buses, due to decreased fuel and maintenance costs. Virginia utility Dominion Energy is studying the use of electric school bus batteries as a grid asset, to help defray the cost of converting. And there’s a strong public-health case to be made around eliminating air pollution for the children the buses carry.

It’s not clear from the plan's wording if the 500,000 charger installations have to happen in five years, as the bus fleet conversion would. A Department of Energy database lists just 25,804 public charging stations in the U.S. currently.

That means there’s plenty of work to be done, but the small number of installations completed is not necessarily reflective of future potential. New investment is flowing to the sector, and startups are forming to tackle different challenges associated with charging infrastructure and business models. Utilities across the country, such as Dominion, have also taken an interest in this new type of grid investment.","But the plan still looks to industry to do most of the work of installing and operating clean power plants.

But be careful what's used to clean certain things, including child car seats.

Wipes, if still available, are a go-to for a quick clean and disinfectant, but some experts say don't use them on a car seat.

“When it comes to car seats, each component must withstand high forces and repeated use in order to keep kids safe during a crash, so you don't want to use any cleaners or disinfectants that could compromise any of the seat's components in any way,"" says Emily Thomas, Consumer Reports' auto safety engineer.

What should be used?

Check the owner's manual. It has washing and drying instructions specific to the model and each of the seat's components.

Go online if the manual is unavailable.

Most manufacturers say it's ok to machine wash and air dry the car seat cover, but don't put the harness in the washing machine.

Instead, follow manufacturer instructions to clean the harness by hand. Most recommend a mild soap and water.

Same for plastic components.

CR says if harsh chemicals have already been used, reach out to the manufacturer for replacement covers and parts.","But be careful what's used to clean certain things, including child car seats.

Securing supplies has been complicated enough, but Finnair is going further than just ensuring it has enough supplies to fill the “Clean Kit” it is handing out to passengers: the airline is supporting local businesses and reducing its ecological footprint in the process.

The kit contains two sachets of hand sanitizer, an isopropyl wipe to use on surfaces like tray tables and armrests, an information leaflet about the protective measures in place, and a small paper envelope (with a pattern from Finnish textile and print designer Reeta Ek) to contain items as waste. While Finnair asks passengers to bring their own masks, it has a supply of the same masks used by crew on board, all of which are sourced and manufactured in Finland.

David Kondo, head of customer experience product design, tells Runway Girl Network that “we’ve changed a number of our processes in response to COVID-19, particularly with increased cleaning measures and reducing and minimizing contact in the air and on the ground. By distributing the ‘Clean Kit’ we provide even further reassurance to our passengers. It’s a very visible and tangible token of our commitment to the safety of our customers and a safe flying environment.”

There are certainly challenges to deciding on the items to be included, especially around what kind of materials or solutions are safe to be applied to seats, covers and structures in a disinfectant wipe.

“There are plenty of sensitive components on an aircraft and around your seat area so we needed to be very careful with what we were applying to these surfaces to avoid corrosion, discoloration or damage of parts. The airframers had guidance and standards in place but it was a pretty extensive procedure that certainly was not designed for passengers to be doing every flight,” Kondo explains.

Finnair consulted widely with airframers, inflight entertainment system suppliers, partner airlines and seat manufacturers to arrive at the decision to use isopropyl alcohol. That’s a basic commodity product, but one that has been and remains in shortage within Europe, so it is the only part of the kit that Finnair could not manufacture locally — although the airline is trying to do so. But why even try, when it’s not like any airline has a shortage of aircraft to use to transport it?

“An important part of sustainability,” Kondo says, “is sourcing and transport of goods for your business. The ‘Clean Kit’ proved to be a good test case of just how far we could take sourcing locally. The kit was also developed at the peak of demand for PPE and hygiene products and the quotes and lead times from overseas were quite challenging so in this case it actually made sense to source locally.”

Surgical masks, for example, spiked in demand, with little or no price capping and high minimum order quantities, so Finnair found a domestic supplier to reduce lead time and price.

In a similar shortage was hand sanitizer, so Finnair turned to its gin supplier, Kyrö, which pivoted from making award-winning booze to producing alcohol hand sanitizer. When Finnair spotted it, Kondo says, “it was a partnership that made complete sense and a fun extension of the other products that appear in the Finnair customer journey.”

Finnair highlights the benefits of local sourcing and production: shorter lead times, more cost effective transport and a smaller environmental footprint.

“​A key challenge,” Kondo notes, “is the labour cost in Finland, which is relatively high. Individual commodity products are fine but once you involve labour — for example packing of the kits — then the price starts getting quite high. This has probably been the biggest challenge with the current kit as the labour is the single largest cost component of the kit.”

Aviation will be forever changed by COVID-19, and it will need to return cleaner (literally and figuratively), greener and as a more responsible industry. Local sourcing like this seems set to be part of the picture.

The bank obtained more than 4 million USD (N$66 million) in the form of market debt to finance renewable energy projects, thereby helping to reduce the carbon footprint of this southern African country.

According to Bank Windhoek’s report published in July 2020, the N$66 million was raised within 12 months of the initial issuance of the green bonds.

Renewable energy projects

Bank Windhoek reports that several solar photovoltaic projects have been financed with the funds raised. These include the installation of three solar photovoltaic systems to improve agricultural production in Namibia. The solar photovoltaic systems at various locations in the country have a capacity of 69.8 kWp and can produce up to 123,570 kWh of electricity per year.

According to the analysis paper produced by the Namibian Commercial Bank, several solar systems have also been connected to the grid of the utility Namibia Power Corporation (Nampower). The other project financed by Bank Windhoek’s green bond is the installation of a solar photovoltaic system in Okatope in the Ohangwena region of northern Namibia. According to Bank Windhoek’s report, the installation has a capacity of 5.74 MWp and will produce 14.6 million kWh of electricity while reducing carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 ) emissions by 14,350 tonnes. The Okatope solar project has absorbed N$57.2 million of the funds raised by the green bond.

Presently, some projects are still in progress. All the renewable energy projects completed are expected to generate 77.9 million kWh of electricity over the next five years and reduce 305,710 tonnes of CO 2 over the next 25 years in Namibia.

The 11th edition of this scheme was launched on 4th July and will run until 13th September. Two cone-shape ashtrays have been installed on Larvotto beach. It is also possible to obtain pocket ashtrays from a dispenser located at the Solarium de la Nouvelle Digue, which smokers will then be able to keep due to current COVID regulations. Ashtrays are also available at three TCA information points.

Raising awareness of the environmental impact of cigarette butts

Cigarette butts are a real scourge for the environment. According to a study by the European Commission, they are the most common type of plastic waste found on beaches after plastic bottles. In France, 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of cigarette butts are thrown away every year. In addition to being unpleasant for beachgoers, this waste pollutes rivers and oceans and is dangerous for birds and fish.

The Monaco Plage Propre operation led by the Principality is part of a wider programme called “Monaco zéro mégot” (Monaco, cigarette butt free). In addition to maintaining a clean space, the long-term objective is to alert smokers to the impact of cigarette butts on the environment.","As every year, the Mairie de Monaco, the Tourist and Convention Authority (TCA), and the Monegasque Sanitation Works (SMA) are joining forces to raise awareness among smokers about maintaining the cleanliness and quality of the Principality’s beaches with the “Monaco Plage Propre” operation (Clean Beach Monaco).

These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs.

New report highlights emerging challenges and opportunities for India’s transition to clean mobility and power systems in the context of Covid-19.

Thereport identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country’s leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy.

Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India’s transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences.

Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said that he is confident that India’s economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. “India’s strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country’s growth rate ahead of peers,” he said.

“Clean energy will be a major driver of India’s economic recovery and international competitiveness,” added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. “We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses—the transport and power sectors—and emerge stronger.”

The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support India’s clean energy future: 1. invest in least-cost-energy solutions, 2. support resilient and secure energy systems, 3. prioritize efficiency and competitiveness, and 4. promote social and environmental equity.

“India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities” said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog.

Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub.

In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies.

“The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India’s public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India,” said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India.

“Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone’s lives,” said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. “As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.”

The report states that India’s transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.","NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities for India’s Energy and Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India.

When you are running a business in the foodservice industry, you need to take care of the health and safety of employees and clients of your establishment. These aspects depend on the cleanliness of tools. Stainless steel restaurant equipment is one of the highly popular choices among business owners. Work surfaces made of this type of material is stain and rust resistant. Scratches and dings won’t disturb you with time. Durability is another benefit that makes, for example, a stainless steel table a valuable investment. So, it’s not just an aesthetic option that can match with any type of design and décor. Stainless steel restaurant equipment will enhance the optimization of meal preparation works withstanding temperature fluctuations, effects of abrasion, and regular use of cleaning chemicals. However, the washing, sanitation, and disinfection procedures must be a top priority. As even if dirt and harmful microorganism cannot destroy the integrity of professional metal furniture, it can negatively affect the food prep process.

The right procedure of cleaning and care for stainless steel restaurant equipment

To maintain a safe and clean environment, there are different suggested methods depending on the problem. For example, to remove fingerprints, it is necessary to use warm water, soft cloth, and the appropriate detergent. Polish cleaner can come in handy when caring for tables made of stainless steel, metal shelf, and, generally metal surfaces and tops, where fingerprints are a common visual defect that requires daily care. To eliminate oil marks, you should apply effective hydrocarbon solvents. The other more serious signs that signal about the need for full and careful washing activities of your furniture are corrosion, poor laboratory test results, age, accumulation of dirt, grime, and dust due to active food prep processes. Remember, poorly cleaned surfaces will have bad consequences. The following recommendations are for proper and wise cleaning of your stainless steel restaurant equipment:

Use bacteria-killing cleansers. Chlorine-based solutions can be quite effective for your stainless steel tops. However, it also can harm the metal surface, destroying its protective layer. For disinfection, consider chlorine-free options with antibacterial effects.

Ok. Whatâ€™s up? he asked.

You are entering a store and are greeted by the sanitizing dispenser. What do you do?

He mimes pressing the pump, receiving the imaginary glop onto the palm of one hand, and then proceeds the cleansing hand dance, vigorously rubbing the palms together, round and round, over and up and down. He then sits back and grins with satisfaction, Iâ€™m sanitized.

I smiled. An almost perfect demo, but you forgot the most important parts. Your fingertips.

He grimaced. You mean, I should have done this?

He then began to embrace the 8-finger mamba, squishing and rubbing fingertips against finger joints, fully ensconcing the tips and nails in a thorough cleaning ritual, finalizing in a thumb rub on each palm.

â€˜Eureka! You pass.

But most of us do not pass this test. Think back when you last sanitized using the squirt pump. Your palms received the primary attention. Then you rubbed the top of your hands and slightly up into the wrist area but never directly onto THE FINGERTIPS?

Fingertip cleansing requires a concentrated attention, training.

I watched (behind my mask) over 10 people enter a Canadian Tire store the other day, robotically squirting the required sanitation. Each commenced the palm rub. But not one person attacked the fingertips properly.

Most of us have not been taught to remember the fingertips.

The fingertips are our scratchers, itchers, hair sorters, eye rubbers. We think with our fingertips as we tap our checks, our mouths. We touch our eyes, nose, mouth, sometimes well over 300 times a day. While our fingers function beautifully in this manner, they are also the transmitters of the unwanted, colds, flu, viruses.

Our face touching is done unconsciously. When you don a pair of gloves the face touching will become obvious to you. When wearing a mask, it will become obvious too. We must try not to touch our face masked or not. But to be on the safe side, sanitize.

Watch a health care worker scrub their hands. They do clutch their fingertips together as part of their 20 second ritual.

Thank you front liners for reminding us to REMEMBER OUR FINGERTIPS.

While I dislike the commercial sanitizers, because of the chemical harshness on the skin, I realize the necessity and I squirt along with everyone else when I venture out into the public. When at home I clean well with good old fashion soap and water. Homemade soap is best, especially with pure and natural ingredients.

331,https://theecologist.org/2020/aug/07/coronavirus-and-access-clean-water,"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Ecologist,Coronavirus and access to clean water,"The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting every aspect of living — from the smallest moments like grocery shopping to the bigger dilemmas like clean water.

As a global health crisis, the coronavirus has reached every continent except for Antarctica. Similarly, access to clean water is another global health crisis. Both crises similarly affect millions of people.

The problem of clean water, though, has had a slower build — which means it has not had the same prominent presence that COVID-19 currently does. However, the pandemic has exposed the overlap between the two.

Action

Access to water, in general, is necessary. Access to clean water, however, is an additional issue that requires urgent global attention. Both issues are prevalent throughout the world and are now being affected by the pandemic, harming communities and individuals alike.

Water crises did not arrive with the pandemic — they have been ongoing for decades. In fact, globally, one in three people do not have access to clean drinking water. With such a drastic discrepancy in availability, water crises exist all over the world.

In the United States, Flint, Michigan, has been the center of attention in terms of its water crisis.

For years, the city has had lead contaminating its water supply, with few solutions to reverse the situation. Residents have had to boil water, obtain filters or use bottled water instead.

Newark, New Jersey, has its own water crisis. In 2016, 30 public schools tested positive for lead contamination, which exposed the inadequate infrastructure within the city. A lack of government and legislative action caused a significant delay in taking action.

Dangers

In Mexico City, one in every five citizens does not have access to clean drinking water. These patterns continue across continents and cultures.

These three examples barely scratch the surface of the lack of water accessibility. In general, water poverty is deadly. During the pandemic, it is only worsening.

Sanitation requires water. When communities and individuals do not have this access, their risks from the virus compound.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing one's hands for 20 seconds using soap and clean water.

Without water, people cannot properly take the basic steps to protect themselves from the virus. Furthermore, if the water has contaminants like lead or chemical treatments, they could carry dangers of their own.

Solutions

Therefore, providing water is not enough — ensuring that the water is clean and sanitary is also key.

Individuals are not the only ones in need of water, either. Agriculture and gardening require water to keep land and gardens productive. Without water, the system breaks down and the food supply chain begins to weaken.

During this pandemic, countries cannot afford to have broken agricultural production pipelines — and the virus has already compromised capacity throughout the world.

These crises are not new. COVID-19 is merely exposing their depth and expansive effects.

Furthermore, while some communities are in need, other areas waste water. The average family wastes around 9,400 gallons of water annually. Coming up with solutions for wastewater and providing better access to clean water can no longer wait. The pandemic requires immediate action.

Spigots

In order to properly address the water crises during COVID-19, governments must introduce immediate legislation and direct the necessary funds. Solutions must be long-term, as well. Any decisions made today will affect citizens for decades to come.

One example is wastewater treatment. Some forms of treatment use both mechanical and chemical methods to deliver greater sustainability and performance.

The more plants that have proper filtration and treatment, the more communities have reliable access to clean and healthy water.

For short-term solutions, organizations have been taking action. Groups like the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the American Red Cross are focused on boosting their outreach through actions like installing spigots with chlorinated water.

Governments and organizations must pursue multiple paths simultaneously.

Oppress

As a case study, Melbourne, Australia, has accomplished an exemplary feat. The city took proactive action to implement legislation that protects residents in the event of draughts.

New investments, new infrastructure and new agricultural and recycled water programs are all part of the robust plan.

Though not explicitly for a pandemic, the rest of the world can follow these steps to provide individuals and communities with clean water. To prevent unnecessary disease and death, the time to act is now.

Addressing the pandemic requires addressing water crises around the world, too. Environmental challenges and social and economic justice all play a key role in providing access to clean water for everyone.

On the road back to recovery, water access must be a central focus. If it's not, these issues will only worsen and water poverty will continue to unnecessarily oppress billions of people.

332,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/matt-damon-is-bringing-clean-water/,"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Matt Damon is Bringing Clean Water to the World’s Poor,"SEATTLE, Washington — Matt Damon is best known for his A-list acting and Academy Award-winning screenwriting, but he is also a co-founder of a global nonprofit organization working to bring clean water and sanitation to those that need it most. The nonprofit Water.org is currently operating in 13 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America. The results have been inspiring. Thanks to the efforts of Water.org, 30 million people can now “turn on a tap” for clean drinking water “and safely use a toilet.”

Matt Damon, Gary White and Water.org

As Matt Damon rose to prominence in Hollywood, he recognized the impact of the global water crisis in impoverished countries and resolved to make a change. The result was Water.org’s predecessor, H20 Africa Foundation. Damon helped found H20 Africa in 2006 with a core mission to raise awareness about the lack of global access to clean, safe water. The organization had some success, but Damon realized he needed expert personnel on the ground to tackle the global water crisis and improve the lives of those lacking access to safe water.

The end of that search came during the 2008 Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York City. There, Damon met Gary White, an engineer internationally recognized as a water and sanitation expert. The two realized that together they could bring clean water to millions. In 2009, they united H2O Africa and Water Partners International to create Water.org.

Water.org and Microfinancing

The success of Water.org is powered by its microfinance programs, which provide affordable loans to households that lack access to clean water and sanitation. The process is simple and effective, breaking down financial barriers for people living in poverty.

Water.org’s WaterCredit Initiative uses its resources and expertise to help local financial institutions add water and sanitation loans to their portfolio of offerings. The majority of people living in impoverished countries with limited access to clean water pay high rates to obtain clean water and household water and sanitation solutions when in reality the cost of having daily access to safe water is substantially lower.

Affordable financing that allows those in need with the opportunity to pay back their loan through a long-term plan can provide many with dependable access to water. As a result of microfinancing, households in need can access these manageable loans and purchase clean water taps or toilets. After a borrower repays the loan that money then becomes a loan to another household in need. In total, Water.org has helped distribute more than $2.3 billion in loans, and 99% of those loans have been repaid.

Those loans have many positive ripple effects. When a household stops spending countless hours in search of water it can focus on other activities such as education and entrepreneurial ventures. Additionally, increased accessibility to clean water and sanitation is directly linked to increased life expectancy. Furthermore, local contractors are installing the systems these loans help purchase. All of those ripple effects have massive health and economic benefits for local communities.

“Access to water is access to education, access to work, access above all to the kind of future we want for our own families and all the members of our human family,” states Damon in Water.org’s platform.

The Long Road Ahead

Water.org has made tremendous progress, but more work is needed. About 801,000 children under the age of 5 die from diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe drinking water each year, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, approximately 10 million people become visually impaired or irreversibly blind due to a trachoma infection brought on through poor sanitation. Additionally, unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation contribute to at least 9.1% of all global diseases and 6.3% of all deaths.

Obstacles to Global Water and Sanitation Access

Poor infrastructure is one obstacle to accessing clean water across the globe. Many developing countries simply lack the necessary structures or funding to provide clean water access. Moreover, many households in need lack the required funds to purchase adequate sanitation or reliable tap water systems. Addressing that obstacle is Water.org’s main concern.

Another looming obstacle to globally accessible water is the increase in the global population. Most of the population increase will come from developing countries where water is already an extremely scarce resource. The issue of clean water and sanitation is daunting. However, there is hope that global efforts will lead to global accessibility as more people begin to understand its importance and more resources are available.

Looking Forward

Water.org is not alone in its fight to provide clean water worldwide. It has partnered with large corporations like Ikea and Stella Artois as well as received $7.6 million from individuals in 2019. Other notable nonprofit organizations striving to provide clean water and sanitation to the world’s poor are Water for Good, Blood: Water and Pure Water for the World.

Clean water and sanitation are basic human needs. With support from nonprofit organizations, funding and innovative loaning strategies such as Water.org’s microfinancing, global access to clean water and sanitation could soon be within reach.

333,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/29/pacifics-fight-against-covid-19-hamstrung-by-lack-of-clean-water,"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Pacific's fight against Covid-19 hamstrung by lack of clean water,"Papua New Guinea’s battle against a climbing rate of Covid-19 infections is being hampered by the most basic of shortages – access to clean water –public health experts have warned.

Case numbers have jumped from just 11 cases two months ago to 424 on Friday, with four deaths. And efforts to contain escalating case numbers throughout the archipelago, and to prevent outbreaks across the Pacific region, are being hamstrung because thousands cannot access clean water for hand-washing and cleaning, the region’s key development agency says.

“The latest statistics indicate that 55% of people in the Pacific have access to basic drinking water … the lowest in the world,” said David Hebblethwaite, leader on water security and governance at the Pacific Community. “In terms of access to sanitation, we have crept just below sub-Saharan Africa … this is clearly a health issue related to hygiene and handwashing.”

After an initial outbreak in the capita, Port Moresby – with cases centred on healthcare workers at the country’s largest hospital – infections have now been detected across PNG, including in rural provinces such as the southern highlands, Morobe and the autonomous region of Bougainville. The actual rate of infection is likely many times higher than the official figure: fewer than 16,000 tests have been conducted across the entire country since the pandemic began.

PNG’s outbreak is a tiny fraction of the more than 24 million coronavirus infections worldwide, but the risk lies in the fragile ability of Pacific island nations to control rapid infection through vulnerable communities.

Many rural villagers in Morobe Province in the north-east of the country do not have a source of water close to their communities. In Intoap village in Morobe’s Markham Valley, Maria Linibi tells the Guardian that access to water during the pandemic – when having clean water was even more vital – was an even greater struggle.

“The rural women would like to have access to water and sanitation so they can protect themselves and their families from Covid-19, but this is very difficult because the movement of people is restricted and so is transportation,” she said. “We cannot go and get it.

“The carting of water is done by women. Some have to carry a 20-litre water container on their back a long way from the village to the stream or the well and back and they usually take their children, too, so they can help with the carrying.”

World Vision’s PNG national director, Heather MacLeod, says without access to clean water “our people cannot wash their hands and protect themselves against the spread of Covid-19 and other diseases”.

“The eventual result would be a spread of the disease on a massive scale.”

It is something of a paradox that Pacific island countries, scattered across the vast “Blue Continent” that is 165m sqkm of the Pacific Ocean, struggle to find enough water to drink and stay healthy.

Small and low-lying island countries, such as Nauru, Kiribati, and Tuvalu, have scarce surface reserves of freshwater and rely on rainwater, which can be affected by droughts, and the desalination of seawater.

PNG, by contrast, receives more than 3,000mm of rain a year, but the country’s infrastructure to store and distribute safe treated water is under-developed.

Efforts to improve the supply of piped water in the ballooning informal settlements of towns and cities, and ensure the safety of water in rural villages separated by long distances and arduous terrain, have not kept pace with population growth.

Here, residents often fend for themselves, collecting water from ground wells prone to contamination by human and man-made waste, or by capturing rain.

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, waterborne and related diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera and malaria were already endemic across the Pacific.

Children are especially vulnerable: diarrhoea is a leading cause of death in those under five years of age in PNG and the Solomon Islands.

The survival rate of young children has increased in recent decades, but the under-five mortality rate in PNG is still about 47.8 per 1000 births, above the world average of 39.

One of the most neglected diseases in the Pacific is childhood stunting, Hebblethwaite says. The impaired physical growth and development of children is often due to malnutrition and repeated infections, such as diarrhoea, and there has been little progress in reducing its rate. “Access to safe water and hygiene in communities is a key factor,” he said.

Already fragile, water security in the Pacific will be weakened further by the impacts of climate change, with rainfall forecast to become less reliable over coming decades.

Chalapan Kaluwin, professor of environmental science at the University of Papua New Guinea, says “climate change, variability, sea level rise and warming of the oceans with temperatures greater than 4℃ will influence the quality of freshwater and water resources of all Pacific island countries”.

A severe drought during an El Nino weather pattern in 2015 and 2016 caused life-threatening water and food shortages across PNG.

Cyclones and storm surges can also damage rainwater tanks and render freshwater reserves unusable in rural and coastal areas.

While scaling up water coverage will require greater investment, Hebblethwaite argues there is room, too, to better manage existing resources.

Desalination plants across the region have broken down or fallen into disrepair, while more robust water tanks will better withstand extreme weather.

“And there is a lot that communities can do to get the most out of what they already have,” he said. “There are ways of collecting more groundwater and there are simple rainwater harvesting techniques.”","Papua New Guinea’s battle against a climbing rate of Covid-19 infections is being hampered by the most basic of shortages – access to clean water –public health experts have warned.

334,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/clean-water-in-bolivia/,"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Citizens Seek Access to Clean Water in Bolivia,"SEATTLE, Washington — Having access to clean water should be a basic human right for people all over the world. However, obtaining clean water is not always so easy in developing countries like Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in South America. In 2000, especially during its water war in Cochabamba, Bolivian citizens had a limited supply of clean water in Bolivia. After the privatization of the water system, prices surged and it became illegal to collect rainwater. This led to extreme protests in Cochabamba where protestors spoke out against abusive water laws. As a result, the government decided to stop increasing the prices of water and vowed to eliminate its privatization program.

Even after the water war, many citizens still grappled with access issues. As of 2017, more than “three million people in rural areas” did not have clean water. For this reason, many people who live in the countryside suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses from contaminated water. Contamination has the potential to increase since Bolivia faces environmental threats that can greatly deplete or harm already existing water sources.

Drought Threatens Water Security

The year 2016 brought the worst drought Bolivia has seen since the ’80s. More than 400,000 people in cities across the country did not have an adequate water supply. As explained by the United Nations, an important cause of the decline is that 40% of Bolivia’s glaciers have melted in the last 20 years. Water rationing is common in urban areas and the lack of water also impacts rural areas and small farms where crop yields diminish yearly

Clean Water Initiative

A project called WEAP, or the Water Evaluation And Planning tool, helps the country foresee and plan the future of water security for its citizens. This tool provides officials with a detailed model of Bolivia’s lakes, streams and rivers to calculate water security at the current moment and in the years to come. WEAP, formed in efforts to improve water conditions in areas all over the country, gives measurements about the available water supply using satellites. The program also trained 40 water planners to process the data.

The Bolivian government vowed to allocate millions of dollars to resolving water scarcity concerns. Under the leadership of President Evo Morales, it has kept its word by dedicating almost $3 million in the past 13 years towards securing access to clean water, sanitation and irrigation systems. Investments are also still rising, which is promising for the citizens of Bolivia.

All of these steps have put Bolivia on the right path toward ensuring clean water for all of its citizens. Around 86% of the entire population now has access to safe drinking water, and more than 95% of city residents can obtain clean water. Additionally, 78% of rural residents no longer have to worry about water security, which is almost a 35% increase since 2005.

So far, the Bolivian government is seeing great success in reaching its goal to provide clean water access to the entire population by 2025. In 2009, the Bolivian Constitution officially declared access to drinking water and sanitation a human right. The Bolivian people came together to form “water committees” to spread information about the management of water resources, sanitation and environmental challenges.

Also when it's dry, it will also affect the water”, Jinalyn says.

Proper coverage and access to clean water supply is lacking in rural areas in the Solomon Islands.

Leona village in Vella la Vella, in the Western province is a classic example of the typical challenges faced by rural villages in the Solomon Islands.

A stream that runs past the village is the only source of water for the people there.

“After the tsunami, our water supply was damaged. So we now rely on the stream for drinking, cooking, and to wash dirty utensils”, Jinalyn Nonita says.

Jinalyn comes from this village in Vella. She says in the past, they had pipes that were connected to the stream.

But now she says things have changed and the issue of water is more challenging.

“When there is heavy rainfall it affects the water. Also when it's dry, it will also affect the water”, Jinalyn says.

She says they have water tanks that are shared between the people in the community.

“Sometimes when there is no water, we have to climb up the hills to find other water sources”.

Jinalyn says it is tiring for them to fetch water on a daily basis.

""So at times we share tanks with those who have tanks if we are faced with bad weather,"" she adds.

Leona village has a lot of streams surrounding the community, but only one stream is used most often - this has led to sickness for some.

""Diarrhea is the main sickness experience here since we do not access proper water and sanitation facilities”, she says.

The stream is used by more than 700 people in the village.

Despite receiving a lot of support in the water and sanitation area, communities in rural areas continue to face issues such as this.

In its National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016 - 2035, the government has established targets to achieve water and sanitation for all Solomon Islanders.

The NDS is said to be in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 6 seeks to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030.

It was only this month, the European Union released the final payment of EUR 6,450,000 (nearly SBD 60,000,000) to the Government of Solomon Islands as part of its partnership signed with the Government in 2014 to improve access to water and sanitation in rural areas, under the European Development Fund (10th EDF).

The EU has been supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to provide safe drinking water and promoting sanitation and hygiene in rural areas.

The release of these funds are said to be timely as it will allow work to be done to continue providing access to safe, sufficient and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene facilities that are essential to protect the population from several diseases, including COVID-19.

Under the 10th and 11th EDF, the Government of Solomon Islands and the EU have been working together to improve living conditions of the rural areas through better community infrastructures and services, including water and sanitation.

The EU will continue to accompany the efforts of national and provincial governments to bettering quality and availability of essential services with new projects.","Source: Jeremy GwaoProper coverage and access to clean water supply is lacking in rural areas in the Solomon Islands.

Charities have stepped-up free water deliveries to poor neighborhoods but, authorities say social distancing is a challenge at public water points.

Recurring droughts and failure to import water chemicals has resulted in some parts of Harare without tap water.

Residents have to depend on open water sources or overcrowded manually pumped boreholes.

Twenty-three-year-old Chester Musha is one of those that wake up around 3AM to queue for water or the borehole dries up that day.

“We really need serious assistance. You see people are disregarding the coronavirus measures put on to keep us safe,"" said Musha. ""Constitutionally I know we are entitled to safety health or environment by this is not giving us that as promised by the constitution. Also, we cannot sit there and relax. Recently we had a girl from South Africa. She was under home quarantine. She had no water and no electricity and you cannot expect a person to live under such circumstances. So we really need serious assistance here in Mabvuku.”

In some areas, underground water tables have gone down and boreholes are struggling to provide the precious water. Some organizations like Clean City - have chipped in with four buckets of free water per family. Forty-five year old Florence Phiri says residents appreciate that gesture.

""That results in them looking for water in open sources like wells. Our troubles are less when they come. But we wish Clean City would come daily. They are really helping us. If they keep coming, we will be able to contain COVID 19 in this area.”

Clean City said it would not comment on residents’ appeal for more supplys

Michael Chideme, is the spokesman for the City of Harare. He says Zimbabwe’s capital is failing to get adequate foreign currency needed to import $3 million worth of water treating chemicals every month.

“So we end up buying very little and also treating restricted amounts of water so that we can last longer with the amounts that we have,"" said Chideme. ""Our other problem has to do with our water bodies, Seke and Harava dams which complement Manyame and Lake Chivero dams have already dried up and we are no longer drawing water from there. We also have a problem of a dilapidated water reticulation system. Most of our pipes were layed way back in the 1970s or early 1980s. Now they have outlived their lifespan. Hence the water bursts that we are experiencing almost on a daily basis.”

With rains not expected until October in Zimbabwe, that means Harare’ water shortages are likely to worsen. That certainly should be bad news when the country is battling to contain coronavirus which requires strict hygiene practices.","Recurring droughts and failure to import water chemicals has resulted in some parts of Harare without tap water.

And while substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation in the country, thousands of rural dwellers mostly in rural areas still lack these basic services.

In our Mondays edition, we reported about water shortage that hits Wellingara village in Sami District. It is high time, government and development partners’ harmonies’ swift strategies to address the water crisis in this rural settlement.

But then again, water crisis reminds us all that climate change is real and not a joke. We are all living witness to the climate variances sweeping across the globe.

Unusual temperatures caused by climate change have made rainfall unpredictable with significant changes in rainfall patterns making droughts and floods more common in many parts of the country.

Globally, is estimated that over 880 million people–about one in every nine people in the world- do not have access to clean water within 6 km of their homes.

However, this should not be taken granted as every household needs water to survive.

Just imagine, a village of more than 300 people having to depend only one well. And this excludes animals that also depend on the same well to survive. This is indeed alarming.

And what is even more worrying is the fact that children sometimes after drinking the water, complaint of stomach ache, which may be a sign of water contamination.

Water is a foundation of life and livelihoods, and is key to sustainable development. Successful water management will serve as a foundation for the achievement of many of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as for SDG 6 - which is to ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

However, this lofty ambitious Sustainable Development Goals will still be an elusive dream in the country if communities continue to lack and grapple with access to clean and portable water.

Walking for long distances, dirty river water and constant diarrhea linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation, all defined their quest to access safe water.

The most affected areas were Butandiga, Bukiise, Bumalimba, Bukyabo, Bumasifwa, Bugitimwa, Busiita, Busulani, Zesui and Masaba sub-counties, which ironically are bordered by Rivers Soloko, Kado, Gogkyi, Namili, Zebugusi-all flowing from Mt Elgon.

Mr Joseph Gimanga, the LCI chairman of Kitwe village in Bukiise sub-county said politicians have for decades used lack of water in the area as a campaign tool but then vanish as soon as they are elected.

“We appreciate Mr Masereje’s intervention and urge him to continue providing for us as far as water, hygiene and sanitation are concerned,” said Mr Gimanga whose village Wogubuka spring well has been built for the first time since 1970.

Mr Francis Walyamboga, the LCI chairman Gibinda and NRM chairman Gibinda parish in Butandiga sub-county said that locals had had to walk long distances in search of safe water with the most affected being women and children.

The absence of water and sanitation facilities meant they walked hours each day for water and would go to the bathroom anywhere in the hills or in the bushes in running water.

But the 2020 politics brought into limelight a man; Mr Richard Masereje who has built spring wells and latrine pits across the constituency to enable local residents get safe water, the situation has greatly improved.

Mr. Masereje is an Advocate and Chartered Valuation Surveyor and a managing Partner at Masereje & Co Advocates has drilled spring wells across the Budadiri West constituency, sank pit latrines in all trading centres to improve the hygiene and sanitation situation in the constituency.

DRAINAGE

Mr Oliver Nabukwasi from Bukiise sub-county told PML Daily that the project has changed lives by improving water supply in all the eight sub-counties.

“Our water is now clean and safe for drinking and in the near future Budadiri West constituency might not see the need to buy bottled water just because of Mr Masereje,” said Ms Nabukwasi who used to walk about 5km to fetch clean water for her family.

Ms Nabukwasi is not alone, many women, thousands of villagers in the nine sub-counties have celebrated this gift of safe clean water and named it “Masereje water” across the ridges on Mt Elgon in Budadiri East.

Mr Nimrod Magomu, 85, “said that Budadiri East constituency had never had access to clean water “And I want express great appreciation to Mr Masereje for this, thanks for providing for us these spring wells, they are ours today but will also be for our children, for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren,”

Villagers said openly about the occurrence of domestic violence in the homes and that women and children are the main gathers of water for families.

“Since their source of dirty water has been miles away, it can take several hours to gather water and return home and both women and men admitted that sometimes husbands assume their wives have been cheating and will beat their wives,” said Mrs Abigail Nakayenze from Bukyabo sub-county.

Mrs Evelyn Masaba from Bumalimba said that given their new sources of clean water constructed by Mr Masereje, beatings have been stopped and domestic relations are going to improve greatly.

Ms Anet Negesa, 47, a mother of six from Kizinga village in Bumalimba sub-county, said during the rainy season the water sources are hard to reach because of the steep roads and the slippery, soggy grounds.

“I am happy that Nambalenze spring well will help daughters to be secured from defilers who usually waylaid them on the way to fetch water,” said Ms Negesa.

First time to get clean water

Residents of Budadiri East County are for the first time since independence enjoying access to clean water for domestic and livestock use, following the completion of various spring wells by Mr Masereje in the region.

The community has for decades relied on water supply from Rivers flowing from Mt Elgon and unimproved water sources, such as ponds, shallow wells and rivers which have been murky and dirty indicating high contamination levels.

Mr Herbert Mulekwa, the LCV chairman for Sironko said apart from being the only source of water for the people in the hills, it was also used by animals for drinking.

Mr Mulekwa explained that the water from the swamp, rivers flowing was unfit for human consumption as it caused diarrheal diseases which led to deaths of individuals but that without choice, the people kept using the water for their daily needs.

“I want to thank Mr Richard Masereje for this initiative that is going to change these sub-counties because our people are now taking safe clean water,” said Mr Mulekwa.

Eng Andrew Wasukira, the Sironko district Water engineer said with the intervention, the water burden is lightened adding that the women will now use the time saved to become more productive.

He said safe water coverage in the district will rise from 65% to 77% and urged residents to conserve the environment to sustain the supply of water.

He revealed that WHO date indicates that more than five million people die each year from diseases caused by unsafe drinking water, lack of sanitation, and insufficient water for hygiene and that over 2 million deaths occur each year from water-related diarrhea alone.

Mr Masereje who is aspiring to be the Member of Parliament for Budadiri East said that he has a programme to provide clean water and sanitation in Budadiri East and the entire Sironko district.

He said his target is to improve sanitation facilities by providing toilets and latrines, promote good hygiene habits through education, implement rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store rainwater for drinking and provide home water-treatment capability through the use of filters, solar disinfection, or flocculants, to make drinking water safe.

He explained further that he would also promote low-cost solutions, such as chlorine tablets or plastic bottles that can be exposed to sunlight, to improve water quality and proper hand washing with soap and water to reduce diarrhea cases by up to 35 percent.

“It is in my target that by 2025our people will not walk more than half a kilometre to get water and will have a pit latrine in every trading centre to improve hygiene and sanitation,” said Mr Masereje.

“We also intend to extend piped water systems in rural and urban areas and also develop the sewerage systems to serve our people across Mt Elgon hills,” he added.

Mr Masereje said that even when he is voted into Parliament, he will is push for the enactment of a National Community Works Bill that envisages promoting public hygiene and sanitation.

He urged that while there are costs incurred in the production and transportation of clean water, the ideal is for his constituents and Ugandans to access it without pay.

According to a 2017 World Health Organisation report, 80 per cent of the people who have to use unsafe and unprotected water sources live in rural areas with around 159 million people collecting their drinking water from surface water such as ponds and streams.

Data from UNICEF indicates that more than 700 children under five years die every day from diarrhea linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation.

It is also true that a poor water supply impacts health by causing acute infectious diarrhea, repeat or chronic diarrhea episodes, and non-diarrhoeal disease, which can arise from chemical species such as arsenic and fluoride. It can also affect health by limiting productivity and the maintenance of personal hygiene.

In medical settings, they’re worn when the chances of bodily fluids or hazardous substances getting into the eyes, nose and mouth are pretty high. But in recent months, you’ve probably seen other essential workers and even loved ones wearing face shields.

Advertising Policy Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy

“Face shields offer healthcare providers another layer of protection,” says Steven Gordon, MD, Chairman of the Department of Infectious Disease. “They’re already a necessity for surgeons. And now with COVID-19, you’ll see providers who are testing or even intubating patients wearing them along with their masks for additional protection from transmission.”

How to wear a face shield

Face shields are fairly easy to wear. They’re made up of a plastic or Plexiglas panel that curves around the face and an elastic band or adjustable strap that holds the panel in place. To ensure that you’re well protected while wearing one, the panel of your face shield should extend well past the chin and curve around the sides of your face. There also shouldn’t be any gaps between your forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

Outside of healthcare settings, the CDC does not recommend that face shields be worn during daily activities. Face shields also shouldn’t be considered as alternatives to masks. Advertising Policy

How long can you use your face shield?

The CDC recommends wearing disposable face shields once. You can use a non-disposable face shield repeatedly as long as it’s not warped, damaged or cracked. If your face shield becomes damaged, don’t try to fix it. Pitch it and get a new one. Face shields are reasonably priced and easy to replace. You can even buy disposable ones in bulk.

What’s the best way to clean a face shield at home?

If you decide to purchase a face shield for personal use, wear it with a face mask to reduce your risk of exposure to COVID-19. You’ll also want to clean it after every use.

To do this, submerge the protective panel in warm, soapy water first to get any surface contaminants off and then gently clean the surface with a soft sponge or cloth. After that, rinse and gently dry your face shield with a soft towel (cotton or microfiber). You can clean the headpiece separately.

It’s possible to clean a face shield with antibacterial wipes, but be careful because they can leave a residue. You can also sanitize your face shield with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes. If you’re tempted to use a window or household cleaner on your face shield, don’t. Harsh cleaners could potentially damage it.

How to clean a face shield in a healthcare setting?

The CDC recommends the following steps in the event that the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and disinfecting face shields aren’t available:

While wearing gloves, carefully wipe the inside, followed by the outside of the face shield using a clean cloth saturated with a neutral detergent solution or a cleaning wipe. Carefully wipe the outside of the face shield using a wipe or clean cloth saturated with EPA-registered hospital disinfectant solution. Wipe the outside of face shield clean with a towel and water or alcohol to remove residue. Fully dry (air dry or a use clean absorbent towel). Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene.

Your workplace should have a protocol for cleaning or replacing face shields. If you’re not sure how to handle either, check with your supervisor to find out exactly what you need to do.","You can use a non-disposable face shield repeatedly as long as it’s not warped, damaged or cracked.

After spending a three months in Uganda last year, Georgia Higgs has helped initiate a project to help its rural communities.

The former International Citizen Service volunteer from Reading, Berkshire, teamed up with others on her placement to launch a scheme called Equal Aqua.

In Uganda, over half of the country’s 42 million people struggle to access safe drinking water.

After seeing the challenges that people in rural Uganda face firsthand, the team wanted to enable better access to water and sanitation facilities.

Access to clean water and sanitation facilities is crucial

This has recently become a matter of life and death as the natural resource is at the centre of the ongoing fight against the pandemic.

Georgia said:

“We have started with small deeds to address short-term needs. For instance, we have been installing handwashing centres with soap in communities and helped distribute over 300 face-masks to vulnerable communities.”

Through Facebook, they have also conducted training to help young people make liquid soap to ensure personal safety but also sell to earn a living.

Fundraising face masks are being sold in the UK

Working closely with local government authorities, Equal Aqua have made brochures with messages of how to wash hands and avoid contracting Covid-19.

As a longterm solution, Georgia is keen to mobilise resources to build eco-friendly 5000-litre water-tanks to serve communities.

These will ensure schools have higher sanitation when they reopen in a few weeks, after months of lockdown.

Recycling plastic bottles to make a water tank

If the challenge of water storage is addressed, it would reduce the long distances that children and women trek for their daily water supplies.

Georgia said:

“We have a water tank model that we are promoting – using discarded plastic water bottles as bricks to build water tanks by interlocking them into stabilised soil blocks – which is a low-cost and carbon-saving alternative to the environmentally damaging baked bricks.”

After launching operations in January 2020, Equal Aqua have successfully raised money for eco-friendly water tanks at a Ugandan school.

Georgia said:

“We needed about £650 for the project. We were pleased to raise more than £1000.”

In addition, the charity has already enlisted the partnership of well-established agencies in the water sector, including Water Action Hub, Getway 2 Missions and Water With Blessings.

The funds come at a time people living in slums are grappling with congestion, disease outbreak and fires, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Rapid urbanisation and an increasing share of the poor living in urban areas has outpaced services and infrastructure provision, and this project will contribute to reducing this infrastructure and services gap,” said Camille Lampart Nuamah, World Bank Operations Manager and Acting Country Director for Kenya.

The loan will be channelled through the second phase of Kenya Informal Settlement Improvement Project (KISIP), an action plan to improve conditions of the settlements in Nairobi, Machakos, Mombasa and Kisumu.

Phase one of the project saw the laying of water pipes, provision of tanks, yard taps, water kiosks and installation of ablution blocks.

The second phase of KISIP will see residents get livelihoods support and community engagement to assess and address risks, including the impacts of covid-19. “The project will also cushion urban informal settlement residents who depend on daily earnings against the negative socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.

Additionally, project seeks to regularise titling for slum residents to enhance the tenure security.

Regularisation of tenure is expected to increase property values, access to credit for the titleholders, increase tax revenues for the local administration and access to urban infrastructure services.

A UN Habitat report shows that Kisumu has seven informal settlements namely Nyalenda “A” (including Nyamasaria), Nyalenda “B”, Manyatta “A”, Manyatta “B”, Obunga, Bandani, Manyatta-Arab, and Kaloleni. Nairobi has several informal settlements including Kibera, Mathare, Kawangware, Korogocho and Mukuru.","Economy World Bank approves Sh16bn loan for roads, clean waterThe World Bank has approved a Sh16.2 billion ($150 million) loan for Kenya to upgrade infrastructure and improve access to basic services in slums.

Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, said on Friday (Aug 21) that Singapore's battle against Covid-19 and dengue had highlighted the importance of public hygiene, vector control, clean sanitation, quality water and safe food.

""These are all important basic necessities in life that we shouldn't take for granted. And I would like to work on that,"" she told the media in her first virtual press conference as Sustainability and Environment Minister.

Ms Fu had taken over the portfolio from Mr Masagos Zulkifli, who is now Minister for Social and Family Affairs, during the Cabinet reshuffle last month.

She said the upcoming changes to the Environmental Public Health Act will look at improving standards of public hygiene, especially in areas with more vulnerable users, such as childcare and eldercare facilities.

""I think we have realised that it's not just about the frequency of cleaning, or the number of cleaners we have, but it's really about how we clean better as well,"" said Ms Fu.

She added that her ministry will also look into how technology can be leveraged to help improve public hygiene standards.

Public cleanliness in Singapore has remained lacklustre despite many initiatives to get people to clean up after themselves in public areas such as hawker centres.

Asked how the renewed national cleanliness campaign, SG Clean, could actually change things, she said that Covid-19 has elevated expectations of what being clean and hygienic means.

She cited how the emphasis on hand hygiene during the pandemic has led many people to wash their hands with soap and water more often.

And one simple way to raise public hygiene standards is to ensure that hawker centres and coffee shops provide soap and toilet paper for users.

""Sometimes operators, if they're too busy, may overlook simple things like that. So we need to, again, re-emphasise their importance.

""And we're looking at how legislation change can make more effective requirements on the facility or the venue owner,"" she said.

But customers also have a part to play, she added.

Diners sometimes claim that returning their trays after their meals would take away jobs from cleaners, who are often elderly.

But with seniors being more vulnerable to infections, as is the case for Covid-19, diners could actually help protect the cleaners by returning their own used crockery to centralised cleaning stations.

""We should look after their interest and their health because for them to come across soiled tissues and used masks at the hawker centre... it's really not fair to them. That's not a job hazard that they have bargained for,"" said Ms Fu.

During the hour-long interview, Ms Fu also fielded questions on a range of other sustainability issues, from climate change to green jobs.

She highlighted how the renaming of her ministry, formerly known as the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, was to reflect the growing importance of sustainability in Singapore.

""We are coordinating among the ministries, to look at how we can put sustainability really at the heart of many of our policies, from investments to energy, transportation and buildings,"" she said.

And there would be opportunities for jobs in these areas, said Ms Fu, citing the growth of certain sectors, such as in food production, the circular economy, and research into climate science, for example.

She also touched on the growing youth climate movement, and how her experience at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, which she previously helmed, could inform outreach efforts.

She noted how there were already ongoing dialogues in the ministry, such as on Singapore's zero-waste ambitions.

But she said her experience with the National Youth Council, or the Youth Action Challenge, could come in handy, in terms of getting people with different ideas to come to the table, discuss those issues, and understand why certain decisions are made - even if they do not always agree.

""This understanding of policy rationale, why we have decided on certain things, is important because like many of the decisions that we make, it's about trade-offs,"" said Ms Fu.

And there are many different trade-offs to consider, whether social or economic trade-offs, or inter-generational equity, she said.

""These are all trade-offs and there is no right or wrong, but a spectrum. And where we land, sometimes may not be ideal or perfect for some groups, but at least I think they will understand, as it's because we have made those trade-offs.""","SINGAPORE - Keeping Singapore clean will be the priority of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in the months ahead, with new legislation in this area to be introduced in the next three to six months.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

JAMAICA, Queens — There have been a lot of changes since the pandemic hit New York City, including more trash on the streets.

The Department of Sanitation says they’re doing their best, despite budget cuts. They’re asking New Yorkers to do their part too. In Jamaica, Queens, one group is certainly doing that.

Frank Wallz is on a crusade to clean up his Queens community and other neighborhoods that may need a broom and some caring hands.

The Queens barber spent the day with a few men on a good mission — cleaning up 142nd Street near Rockaway Boulevard in Jamaica. They did everything from sweeping, to picking up piles of trash, to trimming tree branches.

“Since the coronavirus we been out here,” Wallz told PIX11 News.

Sanitation workers who have been working throughout the pandemic tell PIX11 budget cuts have heavily impacted their jobs. Still, they’re working their hardest to keep the city clean but they say New Yorkers, many who have been working from home, have been adding to the litter, throwing used masks and gloves on the ground and leaving junk on the sidewalk instead of placing it in bins or dumpsters.

“This is our community, why would you want to add more trash to it?,” asked Wallz. “We trying to keep it clean and safe but y’all adding to the problem.”

And that’s why when he’s not working, he’s still rolling up his sleeves, getting rid of garbage left on the pavement, one neighborhood at a time.

“Demolition, cutting down the trees, cleaning all the garbage, anything from wood to TV’s they dump. It’s the right thing to do.”

The 35-year old who has been volunteering with his church for years, says it’s a dirty job, but he’s not going to stop and encourages others to do the same.

“If there’s a garbage can throw it in the garbage can,” Wallz said “Everyone should be cleaning up after themselves, anywhere. Queens, Brooklyn, if you see something, pick it up.”

The men in this community say they’re not done, that they’re going to continue to clean up these streets and they’re hoping more people join the work.","JAMAICA, Queens — There have been a lot of changes since the pandemic hit New York City, including more trash on the streets.

Normal routine cleaning with soap and water alone can reduce risk of exposure and is a necessary step before you disinfect dirty surfaces.

The COVID-19 crisis has put workers in hazardous industries and essential services such as utilities, healthcare, public safety, transport, and logistics at increased risk. Likewise, the stress and worry over catching the virus has alarmed citizens in virtually every country on the planet.

The world is literally awash in cleaning protocols aimed to protect us. We hear admonitions to give our hands a minimum 20-second soap-and-water wash and scrubbing frequently throughout the day, and to regularly clean and disinfect often touched surfaces.

So, while we are busy cleaning and sanitizing, let’s not forget a key tool used every day in the above industries and by many individuals: rugged mobile devices — such as laptops and tablets — that help companies and individuals all around the world to innovate faster and be more productive.

The first part of this article pertains to what Durabook Americas suggests users of our rugged mobile devices do to clean and disinfect their units to protect themselves and reduce the spread of contaminants — like the COVID-19 virus — while ensuring continued performance. While this information is largely the same for rugged units made by other companies, users of such devices should always check their owner’s manual for details. The second portion of the article provides general details and guidelines on what the CDC and EPA suggest regarding COVID-19 related cleaning and disinfecting.

Cleaning and Sanitizing Rugged Mobile Devices

The standard industry method for cleaning electronic equipment is to use a clean microfiber cloth with a mix of 70% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol and 30% water.

Areas to be cleaned include: the cover/housing, touchscreen, button panel, keyboard, and touchpad.

The device should be switched off and all cables removed before using the cloth, damp with the alcohol solution, to gently wipe down all surfaces. Before switching the device back on, all surfaces must be completely dry. Liquids should not be sprayed directly onto the device, and moisture should be prevented from entering ports or dripping into the keyboard.

Using this method, we tested many of the most commonly found sanitization products across our full range of rugged devices. To test that devices would hold up to the sanitation procedure across their lifetime, it was completed 10,000 times at a pressure of 1kg/cm2. Tests and results were carried out and verified by an independent third party.

Disinfecting rugged mobile devices in line with the above guidance will ensure they remain fully operational and safe for use. For optimal safety, follow further guidelines for disinfecting workplaces and individual organizational health and safety or operational procedures.

Active ingredients and the specific brand items we tested were alcohol prep pads using 70% isopropyl alcohol, a 75% ethyl alcohol sanitizer, Caviwipes that use 17.2% isopropanol and 0.28% ammonium chloride, 0.55% sodium hypochlorite Clorox wipes, 0.25% ammonium chloride sani-cloths, and 0.21% ammonium chloride disinfectant wipes. Durabook does not endorse a specific commercial disinfectant or a particular brand, and cannot warrant their effectiveness.

COVID-19 Virus

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.

Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but removes them and lowers their numbers, reducing the risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting refers to using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.

According to Kinnos, an infection prevention company and maker of Highlight, a patented color additive for disinfectants, scientists know that COVID-19 is an enveloped virus, meaning that it is protected by a fatty lipid bilayer. Fatty layers are easily exploited: when you wash your hands with soap, what you are really doing is creating a fat-soluble layer for the virus’s fatty layer to bind to so that it will wash away with the soap.

Unlike more robust pathogens like non-enveloped viruses and bacterial spores that contain layers of tough protein, fatty layers are susceptible to bonding with alcohol, which causes the fat to un-bond with each other, opening up the envelope and allowing the alcohol to go in and denature proteins. Stronger oxidizing disinfectants, like bleach and hydrogen peroxide, literally rip electrons off molecules to destroy the structure of the pathogen. All of this to say that using a disinfectant to inactivate droplets on surfaces seems like a good way to prevent COVID-19 transmission.

EPA List N

The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed if you use the right products. EPA has compiled a list of disinfectant products that can be used against COVID-19, including ready-to-use sprays, concentrates, and wipes. Each product has been shown to be effective against viruses that are harder to kill than viruses like the one that causes COVID-19.

All disinfectants listed on the EPA’s list N meet the agency’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2,

the virus that causes COVID-19. To find a product, simply enter the first two sets of its EPA registration number into the search. The number can be found on the product label by looking for the EPA Reg. Number (e.g. Reg. No. 12345-12). When using an EPA-registered disinfectant, follow the label directions for safe, effective use.

Products may be marketed and sold under different brand names, but if they have the same EPA registration number, they are related products. Some products have EPA registration numbers that contain three sets of numbers. If the first two sets of numbers match a registration number that is on List N, the product is the equivalent to the listed product.

The EPA gives six steps for safe and effective disinfectant use: Check that the product is EPA approved, read directions, pre-clean the surface, follow the contact time directions, wear gloves and wash hands, and keep lids tightly closed.

When EPA-approved disinfectants are not available, alternative disinfectants can be used (for example, 1/3 cup of bleach added to 1 gallon of water, or 70% alcohol solutions). Note: Do not mix bleach or other cleaning and disinfection products together. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.

While surface disinfectant products on List N have not been tested specifically against SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, EPA expects them to kill the virus because they demonstrate effectiveness against a harder-to-kill virus; or demonstrate effectiveness against another type of human coronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV-2.

Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, this pathogen is not readily available for use in commercial laboratory testing to see if a certain disinfectant product is effective at killing the virus.

Routine cleaning and disinfecting are an important part of reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Normal routine cleaning with soap and water alone can reduce risk of exposure and is a necessary step before you disinfect dirty surfaces.

Consider choosing a different disinfectant if your first choice is in short supply. Make sure there is enough supply of gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the label, the amount of product you will need to apply, and the size of the surface you are treating.

“There are many different ways to sterilize something, but most of them will destroy the filtration or the fit of an N95 respirator,” Verma said. “Any sanitation method would need to decontaminate all surfaces of the respirator, but equally important is maintaining the filtration efficacy and the fit of the respirator to the face of the wearer. Otherwise, it will not offer the right protection.”

Nguyen and Verma found the dry heat of the electric cooker maintained at 212 F for 50 minutes “decontaminated the masks, inside and out, from four different classes of virus, including a coronavirus — and did so more effectively than ultraviolet light.”

This method used no chemicals and left no residue. The professors noted there can be no water in the cooker, and the masks should not touch the inside. However, numerous masks can be stacked inside and sterilized at the same time.

Not only were the masks decontaminated, but they also “maintained their filtration capacity of more than 95% and kept their fit, still properly seated on the wearer’s face, even after 20 cycles of decontamination in the electric cooker,” Verma said.

As states begin lifting stay-at-home orders and allowing facilities to reopen, facility managers will need to plan for how to safely and sustainably reopen public spaces such as fitness and recreation centers. Safety policies and protocols for these areas will need to be implemented to keep these environments safe for all staff and facility users.

Recreation centers and facility fitness areas have many “moving parts”, and present some unique challenges for maintaining a safe and clean facility. For facility managers in the planning stages of reopening fitness centers and recreational facilities, the following actionable steps can help them navigate the reopening process in the COVID-19 environment:

Remain up to date and follow guidelines

Remain up to date on state and local guidelines for reopening, and follow CDC recommendations for protecting all facility users.

Establish proper procedures for cleaning and disinfecting

The CDC notes that “cleaning and disinfecting are important steps to reopening public spaces that will require careful planning.” Facility operators should follow CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting public spaces by using EPA-approved disinfectants to eliminate COVID-19 on surfaces. Facility services should be sure to carefully read and follow instructions on these disinfectants to ensure maximum effectiveness of these cleaners. The CDC also stresses that frequent disinfection of high-touch surfaces—such as doorknobs, counters, toilets, faucets, and sinks—is important for helping reduce transmission of the virus.

Facility managers should also:

Consider establishing set times for closing the facility to complete deep cleans between uses

If budgets allow, consider electrostatic sprayers to quickly and effectively clean every surface of an area and the equipment within it

Deep clean everything. Don’t overlook things like functional trainer attachments, bands, mats, weight pins, and grips

Train facility staff responsible for regular cleaning of the facility and equipment in proper cleaning and disinfection procedures and protocols

Develop facility use policies and procedures

Establishing facility usage policies and procedures is critical to maintaining a safe and healthy facility during COVID-19. Procedures that can help safeguard staff and facility users include:

Providing personal protective gear like face masks and gloves for staff to wear

Setting capacity limits on the number of people that can be in the fitness center or recreational facility at one time to adhere to social distancing guidelines. To determine capacity limits, facility operators can reference the U.S. Fire Administration’s advice for calculating social distancing occupant loads

Develop a reservation system for workout spots, strength and conditioning room and fitness classes

Training staff on all safety protocols, including how to look for and identify COVID-19 symptoms

Posting signage throughout the facility on all recreation and fitness center policies and procedures

Establish safety protocols for each area of the fitness or recreation facility

Each area of the recreation facility will present challenges for maintaining social distancing and keeping up regular cleaning and sanitation. Outlined below are cleaning recommendations for each of these areas (click here to view a full checklist).

Cardio area Space cardio equipment at least 6′ apart. If there is not space to do so, turn every other piece of cardio equipment over and place a not-in-use signs on the consoles of the equipment Instruct facility users to follow traditional gym etiquette and wipe down machines after use. This will keep them safe and help protect recreation center staff Provide an abundance of wipe stations and antibacterial wipes that will not hurt the equipment that facility users can easily access to clean their workout stations

Source: 3 News

Executive Secretary of the Coalition of NGOs in Water and Sanitation (CONIWAS) Patrick Apoya has said he cannot be sure if the government is 85 per cent through with its plans to make the capital city the cleanest in Africa as the Minister of Sanitation, Cecilia Abena Dapaah, is claiming.



He, however, said on the Community Connect programme on 3FM Friday, August 14, that the government has taken prudent steps to achieve the target of the president to make the city the cleanest in Africa.



He explained that one of the measures being implemented aggressively is the recycling of wastes instead of dumping.



This he said is an important thing to do if any country wants to makes its surroundings clean.



In 2017, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo declared his government’s intention to make Ghana’s capital city, Accra, the cleanest on the continent by the end of his first term in office.



Speaking to the media as part of a sanitation tour and clean-up exercise in parts of Maamobi in Accra, on Tuesday August 11, the Sanitation Minister revealed that 100 per cent cleaner city was achieved during the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.



But she said after the restrictions were lifted, the dirt started emerging.



Regarding the grading efforts to make Accra the cleanest city, she said, “I will give it 85 per cent because at the end of the day you saw the 100 per cent we did during the lockdown.”



But her comments has attracted criticism from a section of Ghanaians including the Member of Parliament for Tamale North Constituency, Alhassan Suhuyini, who said on TV3’s New Day Thursday, August 13, that the minister was dishonest in the comments.



Alhaji Suhuyini said: “This is dishonesty because you move around and bins are not even everywhere,” adding that the president should be blamed for this development.



Sharing his perspectives on this matter, the CONIWAS boss, Mr Apoya, said the 100 per cent target “is achievable. The measures that have been put in place to achieve the target is good at it. The institutional reforms, the shift towards recycling instead of dumping are the right things to be done



“Unfortunately, these have not been backed by the level of resources we require to drive such an initiative. You only saw it during the Covid-19 as the minister said.”



He added: “Moving towards the achievement of the president’s promise, we are not in position to establish how the 85 per cent was arrived at.



“We want to see the indicators which were used and what was used in computing it. If it is just for one week or two months cleaning to achieve cleanest status then I am sure several African countries would have already achieved it before us.



“But all the same, the things that the ministry is putting in place are the right things to achieve the president’s agenda.”

It is of the utmost importance these days to maintain clean and safe food practices. Thus, people are increasingly preferring to buy their food produce locally from trusted sources, without compromising on the quality of the produce. However, there are a number of ways that kitchen spaces can also prove to be a source of infection. It is equally important to keep surfaces at home disinfected and clean in order to prevent contamination of food.





The Food Safety and Standards Authority India (FSSAI) has released some steps to keep your kitchen surfaces and area clean and disinfected during the Covid-19 pandemic. These tips are recommended for households and homes specifically. Take a look:

Here Are 3 Tips To Keep Kitchen Counters And Area Disinfected And Clean:

1. Kitchen counters and slabs are where we prepare all the dishes and keep our produce. These may accumulate dust or dirt over time, which is why it is important to wash kitchen counters/slabs and stove thoroughly with water and detergent at least once every day as per FSSAI.





2. Once the meal is prepared, it is a good practice to clean not just the kitchen counters, but also the gas stove after preparing every meal as per the FSSAI. This will help lower the risk of germs or infections from spreading and help maintain good cleanliness and hygiene at all times.





3. Another important facet is the utensils and equipment that we use. FSSAI recommends washing utensils and equipment throughly with soap/detergent and water after every use.

Abu Dhabi: The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, ENEC, on Wednesday announced that its operations and maintenance subsidiary, Nawah Energy Company, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Transmission and Despatch Company, TRANSCO - a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Energy Company - has safely and successfully connected Unit 1 of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant to the UAE grid, and is despatching its first megawatts of clean electricity to the nation.

During the process, the generator in Unit 1 was integrated and synchronized with the requirements of the UAE’s national electricity transmission grid.

Unit 1 connection, also referred to as ‘grid synchronisation’, marks the first time that clean electricity produced at the plant is delivered to the UAE national grid. This follows the safe and successful start-up of Unit 1 at the end of July 2020 by Nawah.

Since then, the operations team has run a series of tests, steadily increasing the power levels to ultimately generate the first megawatts of baseload electricity produced by the Barakah plant, located in the Al Dhafrah Region of Abu Dhabi.

With clean electricity from peaceful nuclear energy now being delivered to homes and business across the UAE, this milestone is a significant moment in the continued safe, secure, and quality-led delivery of the UAE Peaceful Nuclear Energy Programme and its cornerstone, the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant.

Commenting on the announcement, Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, Chief Executive Officer of ENEC, said, ""The safe and successful connection of Unit 1 to the UAE grid marks the key moment when we begin to deliver on our mission to power the growth of the nation by supplying clean electricity, around the clock. Grid connection of Unit 1 really is the beginning of a new era in our project, which is built upon years of preparation and adherence to the highest international safety and quality standards.

""We are confident in our people and our technology to continue to progress to reach commercial operations, and the completion of the remaining three units, with the goal to power up to 25 percent of the UAE’s electricity needs for at least the next 60 years. This project, in addition to the UAE’s efforts made in implementing other forms of clean power generation, delivers one of the most ambitious clean electricity transformations in the region and the world, setting the Nation on a new track of sustainable development and electrification.""

He added, ""The successful delivery of electricity to the nation is the result of strong and sustained collaboration with our local and international partners. We extend our full appreciation to TRANSCO, and our Prime Contractor and Joint Venture partner, the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), as well as the many other UAE-based stakeholders and numerous international nuclear organisations who have worked closely with us over the past decade. Their experience, and that of the wider global nuclear energy industry, has supported our adherence and commitment to ensuring the highest safety, quality, security, transparency, and non-proliferation standards throughout the development of the UAE Peaceful Nuclear Energy Programme.""

TRANSCO’s role in this effort is both critical and extensive, having constructed 952 kilometres of 400 kV overhead lines to connect the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant Unit 1 to the Abu Dhabi electricity grid – ensuring the power generated at Barakah is safely, securely and reliably delivered to consumers across the UAE.

For his part, Dr. Afif Saif Al Yafei, Chief Executive Officer of TRANSCO, commented, ""TRANSCO plays an important role in facilitating a more sustainable energy future for the UAE. As the country forges ahead with utility-scale clean energy projects, TRANSCO continues to ensure these projects can effectively integrate with our existing network infrastructure to provide a secure and stable supply of power to the community. The integration of Unit 1 of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant is an important step towards increasing clean energy generation capacity to the grid.

""TRANSCO is proud to have partnered with ENEC and its operation and maintenance subsidiary, Nawah, on such an important project for the UAE, and we look forward to advancing our partnership for the next stages of the project,"" Dr. Al Yafei added.

With the integration and connection complete, Unit 1’s nuclear operators will begin the process of gradually raising the power levels, known as Power Ascension Testing, PAT. Throughout this process, the Unit 1 systems follow international best practice to safely progress and test the unit as it proceeds towards full electricity production. Once the process is completed, Unit 1 will deliver, at full capacity, abundant baseload electricity to power the growth and prosperity of the UAE for decades to come.

This testing will be conducted under the continued oversight of the UAE’s independent nuclear regulator, FANR, which has now conducted more than 280 inspections since the start of Barakah’s development. This is in addition to over 40 missions and assessments by the International Atomic Energy Agency and World Association of Nuclear Operators.

Al Hammadi concluded by saying, ""I am especially proud of the talented UAE National engineers and nuclear professionals who contributed to the construction and commissioning of Unit 1, as well as the UAE National Reactor Operators and Senior Reactor Operators who have trained for many years across the world and today have the nuclear intellect and know-how to safely manage the plant, to reach the key milestone to power the growth of the UAE with safe, clean and reliable electricity to the UAE grid, working alongside our international experts.""

Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy worldwide, as it is increasingly used to power different aspects of our lives and the economy. The Barakah plant is supporting electrification and the decarbonisation of the UAE’s energy sector while also advancing economic diversification by creating thousands of high-value jobs through the establishment of a sustainable local nuclear energy industry and supply chain.","Unit 1 connection, also referred to as ‘grid synchronisation’, marks the first time that clean electricity produced at the plant is delivered to the UAE national grid.

AMSTERDAM, Aug 4 2020 (IPS) - The Sustainable Development goals on energy speak clear: universal access energy and clean cooking by 2030 (SDG7). But the current efforts are still lagging several steps behind the specific needs of the communities and are not enough to achieve energy access for all, especially clean cooking solutions.

Numerous studies have been done and plans have been developed how to do this, but most of them have overlooked people and their needs. The energy transition affects daily lives and we cannot ignore those who are potentially on the receiving end of these interventions.

We know that people can provide better guidance on how to move forward. This can be achieved by asking people themselves how they see this transition to clean cooking, how this would affect their habits and traditions, who can drive this change, and how they can actively promote it



We see a big gap between the sustainable objectives and the reality on the ground, and we know that people can provide better guidance on how to move forward. This can be achieved by asking people themselves how they see this transition to clean cooking, how this would affect their habits and traditions, who can drive this change, and how they can actively promote it. And this inclusive process should start now.

Indeed, despite the progress and the essential role of clean energy services to spur socio-economic development, approximately 2.8 billion people lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.

Access to clean cooking solutions remains particularly challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has barely kept pace with population increase. Almost four million of people die every year for causes attributable to indoor air pollution, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), and most of them use traditional cooking fuels like firewood, charcoal and kerosene.

The COVID19 pandemic has stressed the fragility of the current socio-economic system, revealing the profound existing inequalities and questioning the pace of the efforts in achieving universal clean cooking access.

Empower small communities

Electric cooking has proven to be a cost-effective and feasible alternative, but a long-term successful energy transition must also address social impacts, behavioral and cultural factors.

These factors may be a barrier to the cooking transition, which should be dynamic and supported by other collateral needs, such as wider electrification in the communities. Scaling up these technologies requires a strong political will, targeted investments and policies, but also a better understanding of the socio-cultural aspects of cooking, such as taste, cooking practices, cultural norms, and gender roles.

In Kenya, a group of people who currently do not have access to clean cooking technologies has been asked to plan a transition to clean and 100% electric cooking. The group explored ways to reach this.

During work sessions, the villagers use “backcasting” as methodology to explore possible pathways. In their view, the transition to electric cooking would not change food habits but would improve family safety and health.

It is also seen to leverage changes in the gender roles by relieving women of some of the household burdens, reducing the amount of time required for collecting fuels and doing chores, and allowing them to pursue income-generating opportunities, such as selling cakes and cookies.

The community envisions this change to be linked with access to a broader range of electrical appliances associated with modern living, and most of all they consider the community itself as a driver of change.

The backcasting research with the Kenyan community showed once again that the clean cooking transition should start by empowering villagers, by supporting early saving and working with early adapters, and by building the know-how and confidence to engage with government entities to access key services.

NGOs can play a crucial role in introducing new cooking transition technologies, demonstrating mini grids and training communities, but the community and specifically the early adopters of these technologies are those who can make this change real.

Governments and development partners, in turn, are called upon to spur progress on multiple levels, from public services and large-scale infrastructure to full electrification, to improved education and health facilities. All these sectors are profoundly interlinked and require cross-sectoral cooperation.

Next steps

Our study in Kenya with the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) shows that people can imagine, envision and plan for a clean cooking future beyond fire. Once set goals, and given the technologies, fuels and finance availability, we have to make sure that investments are channeled into well-targeted measures that enable people in driving this change and make it happen.

Our study is an initial step towards stressing the need of building a knowledge on the behavioral and cultural aspects of transitions to cooking with electricity.

Governments and donors must consider the household and community perspective, how the transition to electric cooking is perceived locally, and take actions based on the role and responsibilities of various actors engaged in the system, from the household to civil society.","Clean Cooking Transition: Pathways as Seen by Kenyan VillagersEco Matser is Program Manager at HivosAMSTERDAM, Aug 4 2020 (IPS) - The Sustainable Development goals on energy speak clear: universal access energy and clean cooking by 2030 (SDG7).

Freeport, Bahamas – The Grand Bahama Port Authority, Limited (GBPA) is progressing on its initiative to rid Freeport of the unsanitary and unsightly problem of derelict vehicles in and around residential and commercial areas and on verges.



“In June 2020, we advised that the GBPA was partnering with the Royal Bahamas Police Force and Department of Environmental Health to bring resolve to the ongoing issue of illegal dumping of vehicles,” said Ian Rolle, President of the GBPA. “At that time, we also designated land in the Civic Industrial Area for the temporary disposal of such vehicles, many of which were destroyed by floodwaters during Hurricane Dorian, until they are able to be shipped to a US-based facility for crushing.”



The GBPA advised that its City Maintenance and Management section has completed the clean-up of abandoned vehicles in the area of Queens Cove and at Poor Man's Auto located near Solomon's food store on Queens Highway. Additionally, progress has been made in cleaning up Freeport’s roadways. “The GBPA is grateful to Mr. Dudley Seide and his team at Reach Out Youth Ministries, who are contracted as a part of Sanitation Service Company litter crew, for their assistance with clean-up of litter and other small vehicular debris along our streets,” added Mr. Rolle.



The City Management section will erect signage to discourage the continued practice of dumping derelict vehicles throughout Freeport’s residential and commercial communities.



“Today, with the help of four tow trucks supplied by licensees (Self Made Towing), the team moves onto Kent Motors to rid that area of abandoned vehicles,” explained Troy McIntosh, Deputy Director & City Manager of Building and Development Services at the GBPA. “Once we have completed our work there, Mr. Seide and his team will provide detailed cleaning of the area, and we’ll post signage to dissuade others from further illegal dumping.”



The GBPA advised that, following clean-up around Kent Motors, clearing of vehicles will continue on Forest Avenue and Mahogany Street opposite Dolly Madison.

Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (OSDGI) has kicked off the 2020 Community based clean-up campaign.

It implored residents to take pride in the cleanliness of their communities.

Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals and Investment, Mrs. Solape Hammond, described the initiative as an important platform to accentuate needs for attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

She said the current negative trends of environmental abuse is undermining progress towards 80 per cent of the assessed targets of the Sustainable Development Goals related to poverty, hunger, health, sustainable consumption and production, water, cities, climate, oceans and land.

She stated the essence of the campaign was to unite and inspire Lagosians to cultivate the habit of caring for the environment, adding that developing robust, coherent and coordinated solutions that jointly address the menace of the environment further makes the state resilient.

“Lagos residents need to note that protecting the environment is, without doubt, the best way to protect themselves against diseases and other harmful environmental hazards.

“We should be a community that cares for the environment and work together to make a different,” she stated.

Highlighting significance of sustaining a healthy ecosystem in an economically viable city like Lagos, the Special Adviser noted a clean environment underpins the delivery of quality socio-economic services and provides reliable solutions to challenges related to urban well-being.

Hammond disclosed further the multiple economic, social and health service a cleaner environment delivers is overwhelming and as such, the comprehensive plan of action to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals must revolve around the people.

“One of the main challenges of sanitation is sustainability, especially in a metropolitan city like Lagos State. In order to serve the city’s growing population sanitation has to be adapted to several specific contexts.

‘’Increased investment in sanitation must be complemented with citizens’ resolve to approach the environment responsibly,” she explained.

Chairman Alimosho Local Government Area, Hon. Jelili Adewale, applauded the noble role the office of SDGs towards creating conducive atmosphere through community mobilization and public sensitisation.

The annual sanitary campaign, which is expected to be carried out in all the 57 Local Government Areas and Local Council Development Areas, will significantly complement government’s efforts towards the regeneration of the environment.","Our ReporterLagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (OSDGI) has kicked off the 2020 Community based clean-up campaign.

The thousands of islands dotted around the Pacific Ocean managed to stave off devastating coronavirus infections during the early stages of the pandemic while much of the rest of the world struggled. However, many of the main countries in the region are now reporting problems of rising caseloads that are threatening to overwhelm the already-fragile health systems.

When COVID-19 and Hurricanes Collide

READ MORE

While the Pacific region is still recording lower infection rates than the rest of the world, countries such as Papua New Guinea, Guam and French Polynesia have all reported surges in the past couple of months. Whereas many of the islands were virtually coronavirus-free until as late as May, they were reporting a combined total of over 2,500 infections and 19 deaths by the end of August. The problem is that the Pacific has one particular risk factor that leaves it especially vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19: It has the lowest rate of access to clean water anywhere in the world.

Where Can I Wash My Hands?

Only 55% of the largely rural islanders in the Pacific nations have access to basic drinking water facilities, while 70% don’t have access to basic sanitation. This puts the region below sub-Saharan Africa in terms of clean water access and is one of the reasons why it is the worst-scoring global region on the 2019 World Risk Index. Poor sanitation is well known to be linked to the transmission of many deadly diseases such as cholera, typhoid and polio. Lack of access to clean running water also presents barriers to carrying out basic preventative hygiene measures when it comes to COVID-19. From the start, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasized the necessity of regular handwashing to prevent the spread of the virus.

Water access problems have been identified as a contributing factor in the spread of COVID-19, not just in the Pacific but elsewhere, with poor quality water supplies at risk of chemical contamination exacerbating problems. But lack of adequate sanitary hygiene poses a potentially more serious risk when it comes to combating the coronavirus. Research being carried out by environmental biologists at the University of Stirling suggests that the virus could be spread through untreated wastewater and sewage.

Professor Richard Quilliam, who is leading a £1.85-million ($2.4 million) study into the transmission of viruses and bacteria in water-based environments, said: “It has recently been confirmed that the virus can also be found in human faeces — up to 33 days after the patient has tested negative for the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.” Professor Quilliam’s paper referenced examples of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), which is closely linked to COVID-19, being detected in hospital sewage systems in China back in 2003. Faulty sewage pipelines were also implicated in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-1 through Hong Kong apartment blocks in 2003, which led to 329 infections and 42 deaths.

Although there is so far limited research into the persistence of COVID-19 in aqueous environments, other coronaviruses are believed to survive in sewage for up to 14 days. Furthermore, there is evidence of COVID-19 surviving in wastewater and sewage systems. Back in February, traces of COVID-19 were discovered in the bathroom of an unused apartment in Guangzhou, China, leading researchers to believe that it had traveled through drain pipes. The novel coronavirus has also been found in sewage samples in places such as Paris and Queensland.

The dangers this could present to developing countries attempting to control the spread of COVID-19 are obvious. Many of these countries already experience high death rates from diseases that are rife amid poor sanitation, have health systems and facilities that already struggle to cope with existing pressures and have higher percentages of their populations vulnerable to the worst effects of COVID-19. Zimbabwe, for example, is one country still recovering from recent fatal cholera outbreaks caused by bacteria-infected water supplies. The country is now battling to contain a spreading coronavirus pandemic without adequate clean water.

Worldwide Measures

But it’s not just poorer nations that are at risk. Even wealthier countries have millions of people who are struggling to get access to clean and affordable tap water. In the United States, approximately 67 million people could be at risk of having their running water supply affected as coronavirus moratoriums on disconnections come to an end in several states. The US already has the worst COVID-19 death and infection totals in the world, as well as one of the highest death rates. Exposing millions of households to water poverty is likely to make things much worse.

Diseases and viruses thrive where there is no clean running water supply. With the world facing up to a potential global water shortage crisis in the coming decades, it’s going to give epidemiologists plenty to chew over when it comes to the ongoing battle against COVID-19 and any future developing coronavirus strains.

While things such as bottled water and purification tablets can provide short-term solutions, this pandemic has highlighted how important it is to make drastic investments in improving water infrastructure around the world. The UN has already estimated that $6.7 trillion needs to be spent globally on water infrastructure by 2030. This includes not just the provision of basic sanitation in the most deprived countries but on worldwide measures such as better irrigation and industrial water practices to cut down on waste, as well as improved water recycling and reuse to try and avert a future crisis.

A second wave of the pandemic will make their situation worse.

A recent report published by the Slovak Academy of Science in collaboration with the Open Society Foundation shows that Roma in segregated settlements or on the outskirts of towns lack access to clean drinking water. They are also victims of environmental discrimination and often forced to live next to toxic landfills and flood-prone neighbourhoods.

“Although the right to water and sanitation are rights recognized by the UN, European Roma are being left to live in unsafe environments detrimental to their health and wellbeing. In fact, lack of concrete data on access to sanitation for Roma made it easier to neglect this issue,” commented Marek Szilvasi, team manager on environmental justice for Roma at the OSF.

The increased incidence of infectious diseases in localities with Roma population is one of the indicators of structural inequalities in Slovakia. According to the report, the core of the problem is the absence of basic infrastructure for access to water, sewage collection and waste treatment. The report focuses on the infrastructure but puts the problem in an economic-social context.

Approximately 300 Roma settlements in Slovakia do not have access to the public water supply; moreover, in approximately 650 Roma settlements, residents do not have access to sewage. The researchers identified almost 50 segregated Roma settlements that had no infrastructure at all — no asphalt road, no water supply, no sewage, and no gas.

Similar problems exist in other new EU member states with significant Roma minorities. According to the report, EU is providing significant funding to infrastructure projects but the money is rarely reaching the Roma settlements. In Slovakia, government funding has so far not specifically targeted the settlements.

“The European Green Deal must not lead to more job losses among the poorest segments of the population and in turn, pit poor non-Roma against poor Roma,” commented Zeljko Jovanovic, director of the Open Society Roma Initiatives Office. “It must not lead to forced evictions but affordable green housing and infrastructure deserving of 21st century Europe.”

Update: Asked by The Brussels Times to comment on the report, a source at the European Commission commented that EU member states have primary competence for the integration of Roma in society and therefore bear the responsibility for improving their living conditions, including providing essential services.

That said, during the 2014 – 2020 budget period, the European Commission has funded dedicated actions in Slovakia to address the issues mentioned in the report, such as access to water, sewage and waste treatment in municipalities with high share of Roma communities, totalling ca €52 million.

Access to tap water and sanitary infrastructure will be some of the many issues addressed in a new EU Roma Strategic Framework due to be adopted soon, according to the Commission.

It will accomplish this using technology developed by a UK-based firm called Aqua Africa.

The UK Export Finance (UKEF) green loan to the Ghanaian government comes after an agreement between the country’s sanitation & water resources ministry and Aqua Africa in support of a project that has goals to alleviate roughly 225,000 people in Ghana from day-to-day water poverty.

The project will start this month with a ground delivery plan and community engagement drills. By January next year, filtration units will be installed to deliver water to 75 communities, providing clean water to 22,500 people. The 18 months that follow will involve five more phases that will deliver the water pipe system to the remaining 200,000 people.

Cecilia Dapaah, Ghana’s Minister of Sanitation & Water Resources, explained:

The fulfillment of our basic human needs in our environment is essentially dependent on adequate clean water. Increasing water coverage requires a consistent investment on year to year basis since population growth and demand for water keeps increasing. That is why we welcome wholeheartedly the investment in the Aqua Africa Project.

The UK government also stated that the water sanitation loan is part of a £140M (US$184M) package of financial support for Ghana, which also includes:

Over £70M (US$92) in guarantees and direct loans to fund the construction of a new main commercial road between Tema and Aflao,

More than £50M (US$65.8M) to build a new local hospital in Koforidua.

According to the UK’s Exports Minister, Graham Stuart, the direct loans come at zero cost to the taxpayer. It shows how the UK “is making a lasting and real difference to communities across the globe.”

Stuart said:

We are proud to lead the world in our efforts to transition to net-zero emissions, and UKEF is backing British exporters to support other countries to meet their Paris climate goals. UKEF’s support for Aqua Africa demonstrates this government’s commitment to exporters with green credentials by ensuring they have the support needed to win international business during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

The green loan is the first of its kind in Africa. It will play a vital role in the push to deliver on the UN Sustainable Development Goals covering clean water, sanitation, and climate action.","On August 29, the UK government announced it would provide a £27M (around US$35.5M) green loan to fund the use of solar energy to sterilize drinking water for rural communities in Ghana, Africa.

The groundwater reeked with an unbearable odour. Yet, the family had no choice but to drink the well water — their only source of water.

Their village, Kampung Terubing 2 in Pahang had neither piped water nor electricity supply, putting a damper on their hopes of embarking on farming activities.

This is the sad reality faced by many Orang Asli communities in Malaysia.

According to the Statistics Department, 53% of Orang Asli communities do not have access to piped water.

Besides the lack of access to clean water and sanitation, the Orang Asli are at higher risk of contracting water-borne and water-washed diseases.

Infant mortality is reported to be double the national figure while parasitic infections are as high as 90% in certain Orang Asli communities.

The lack of access to continuous, clean water supply is also identified as the key contributor to the problem of household food insecurity among these communities.

Since 2017, Coway Malaysia’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative “Happy Water Project” has been serving the country’s Orang Asli communities.

Now, in its fourth instalment, Coway, as a “Life Care Company” continues its efforts in providing clean and safe water to the communities in need across the country.

By year end, Coway’s Happy Water Project will have benefited about 700 Orang Asli families.

Despite the challenges, Coway remains committed and on track to achieve its five-year target of ensuring 1,000 Orang Asli families are given access to clean water by the end of 2021.

Today, Coway supplies household appliances to over 1.5 million homes across Malaysia and endeavours to bring “Life Changing Water” to all Malaysians.

With the Happy Water Project, the company is serious about its responsibility and mission to safeguard the basic human necessity, while ensuring a continuous, clean supply of water.

Coway’s efforts are aligned with United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goal 6, which emphasises the importance of clean water and sanitation.

This will ensure that more families, like Surayati and her family, would be able to benefit and enjoy access to clean water and ensure their families are safe from water-borne diseases.

The company is addressing the issue of water scarcity and water poverty which is not unique to Malaysia as it affects more than 40% of the global population.

These numbers are predicted to escalate with increasing global temperatures.

For the third consecutive year, Coway Malaysia is partnering with Global Peace Foundation Malaysia to empower Orang Asli families through its Water, Sanitisation and Hygiene (WASH) Training programme.

The programme includes activities to promote proper handwashing, teeth-brushing, and a healthy diet.

The public may also contribute to the Happy Water Project by joining the Coway Virtual Run: Change The Game, scheduled from Nov 1 to 29.

The public can run for a cause as RM10 from each participant’s registration fee will be donated to the Happy Water Project.

The run will present an interesting gamification twist for runners who will earn achievement badges through the course of the virtual race.

The Fresh Start WASH & Wellness Program will be the driving force towards a successful transition to housing, treatment, and job placement services for this underserved community.

Access to clean water, soap, and washing facilities reduces the risk of infection and illness from within the homeless population, as well as the spread of viruses like COVID-19 to the community at large. In addition to daily access to ADA accommodating showers, these individuals will also be able to access additional wrap-around services at the scheduled host sites including free mental health or substance abuse assessment, food assistance, help getting identification, clean clothes, healthcare, veterinary care for animals, job placement training, and housing assistance. The Fresh Start WASH & Wellness program in Las Vegas saw a decrease homelessness by up to 35% when hygiene and wellness services were offered to the community. The program aims to transition members of this community to permanent housing and, ultimately, self-sufficiency.

In 2017, Clean the World launched its first Fresh Start WASH & Wellness Program in Las Vegas, Nevada. Over the past three years, the program has delivered over 16,000 showers, distributed over 20,000 hygiene kits and has seen a 15% decrease in the rate of homelessness in the Southern Nevada area. Through this program, partner service providers have seen an increase of over 55% in referrals on the days that the mobile showers are scheduled.

Over the past two years, Clean the World has been working with Donna Wyche, Division Manager, Mental Health and Homelessness, Community and Family Services Department, Orange County Government to bring this program to Orange County. Orange County Government, through the federal CARES grant, provided the funding needed to fabricate the Fresh Start Mobile Showers and has been a significant partner in launching this program across the greater Orange County area.

Donna Wyche says of the expansion, “We’re so pleased to partner with Clean the World on this project. It’s been something we’ve discussed for a couple of years, and now due to some additional federal funding to address the Covid19 pandemic, it’s come to fruition. There are so many community partners who will be a part of this mobile unit, whose relationships and hard work will lead us to some positive outcomes for our most vulnerable homeless population”.

“Expanding the Fresh Start WASH & Wellness Program into Orange County means connecting the vulnerable population to critical hygiene and wellness services that will offer a comprehensive approach to both physical and mental health. We cannot do our amazing work without our service partners. Together, we will serve the unsheltered population by providing over 20 additional services to ultimately help them get back on their feet and into housing. Ultimately, it is about supporting this community with the resources needed to transition out of their situation and making them healthier and more confident in the process,” says Shawn Seipler, Founder & CEO, Clean the World.

You can make a difference in your local community. Clean the World is looking for sponsors to help cover the operations of the Fresh Start WASH and Wellness Program.

Recently, Stiltz, a supplier of home lifts, announced that the company will be working alongside other companies to offer needed financial sponsorship for Africa-based projects initiated by The Africa Trust.

Projects All Over the Continent

As a financial sponsor of Africa Trust's many economic improvement efforts around the continent, Stiltz will be helping to fund well construction and other projects in Malawi, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique, and Liberia. Stiltz already has its own business presence in numerous African nations, especially on the eastern side of the massive landmass. Operating in more than 40 nations worldwide, the lift company has always sought connections with organizations that help those in need, wherever they might be.

More Than Just Clean Water

The trust does much more than building wells, so financial assistance from any source can go a long way toward bringing many different kinds of projects to completion. For example, since its founding in 2010, the trust has emphasized bringing sustainable solutions to locations in Africa where poverty, and the lack of clean water, is most critical. That means not only constructing wells but also working to bring the overall level of sanitation up to livable standards. That's why most pump projects include entire water-related infrastructure for small villages, including fresh drinking water, toilet facilities, and all the supplies required to keep the systems running for years to come.

Making Life Better for Everyone

With financial help from key sponsors like Stiltz, trust is able to survive and thrive. That's good news for people in all the nations the trust serves. In addition to wells and sanitation facilities, the aid organization helps local adults who need business training so they can start their own companies and bring economic relief to the community. What's more, they make educational and counseling resources available for adults who were forced into military service as young child soldiers.

Waterborne disease is another problem that plagues many poor villages in Africa, and the trust works to build filtration systems using local ceramics and other commonsense technology. Behind everything, the organization does is the idea of long-term sustainability and giving local residents the power to take charge of their own destiny. Sometimes that simply means building a well and turning its operation over to the community. In other situations, it means job training, education, installing sanitation systems, and helping people who were pressed into military duty when they were only seven or eight years old.

Corporate Responsibility

Stiltz and other companies who see the need to support charitable entities like The Africa Trust have the chance to assist people who need help with life's basic necessities. Sometimes that means nothing more than being able to drink clean water whenever they need it or learning how to build several wells in a large village so everyone has access to essential human needs that so many people take for granted.","A global supplier of residential lifts has teamed up with corporate partners in an effort to develop sustainable sources of clean, potable water to some of the remotest parts of Africa.

I-CARD set up 38 hand water pumps for people in the villages of Tanuchuk and Eporia. The water pumps are easily repairable and can be handled by the young and the old. The water from these pumps is safe and clean, although sometimes it may contain some iron residue. Most families construct water filters with empty containers filled with brick pieces, coal, stone chips and sand. Some use only sand for this purpose. The water can be used for their toilets, hand-washing, bathing and cooking without having to go far away from their homes.

The hand water pumps were installed toward the back of the houses. Mising tribal village people do not have bathrooms of their own, and their bathing is usually done in public near the water source either at the hand pump or by the rivers.

Salesian missionaries also set up a water tank reservoir that can hold approximately 20,000 liters of water. This is sufficient drinking water for a large village of about 200 families. The water source is from a bore well and is fitted with a submersible pump inside the pipe. This ensures a constant supply of water.

The final part of the project provided 29 individual household with toilets constructed in Eporia for the families. There is no water supply to these toilets, but families can carry water in buckets from the hand pumps. There is a small tank for water outside each toilet so that water can be stored.

“We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Salesian Missions on behalf of the tribal community impacted by this project,” said Father K.A. Thomas, the director of I-CARD. “Before the project, these families practiced open defecation. With the dwindling forest areas and the increase in the number of households, people were facing immense problems. Now with funding from Salesian Missions, people have been given dignity and privacy and a sense of self-worth.”

With more than 1.3 billion people, India’s growing population is putting a severe strain on the country’s natural resources. According to Water.org, close to 77 million people do not have access to safe, clean water and 769 million have no sanitation services. Most water sources throughout the country are contaminated by sewage and agricultural runoff.

While India has made some progress in the supply of safe water, there remain gross disparities in safe water access across the country. The World Bank estimates that 21 percent of communicable diseases in India are related to unsafe water with diarrhea alone causing more than 1,600 deaths daily. Access to proper sanitation is extremely poor, particularly in rural areas where only 14 percent of the population has access to a latrine.

In response to this crisis, Salesian Missions has developed a “Clean Water Initiative” that has made building wells and supplying fresh, clean water a top priority for every community in every country in which Salesian missionaries work.

India has the world’s fourth largest economy but more than 22 percent of the country lives in poverty. About 31 percent of the world’s multidimensionally poor children live in India, according to a report by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative. A multidimensionally poor child is one who lacks at least one-third of 10 indicators, grouped into three dimensions of poverty: health, education and standard of living.

A clean public toilet is not a rarity anymore in India. We find them in malls, theatre complexes, corporate offices, among other upscale spaces. But I will not exaggerate when I say that the average Indian steels himself to unsee and overlook the dirt at a public toilet.

A child who goes to a school is used to a dirty toilet, some sort of baptism by fire which educates them about what to expect from their country in terms of sanitation standards and prepares them for similar experiences ahead. The average Indian who travels on the state transport bus is used to dirty, stinky urinals at road side dhabas.

An interesting incident an acquaintance told me about involved a public washroom that was clean but had no water supply. When reprimanded, the attender retorted, saying we could use Bisleri bottles for Rs 20.

Then there is another ingenious way to avoid sanitation-related work — breaking the toilet door or take away the bolts. Broken toilet seats, soggy floors and lack of soap / watery solution passing for soap are some other shortcomings one faces while using a public restroom.

All said and done, Indians have infinite tolerance for all things bad. For me, however, conversations around the lack of cleanliness in public places and dirty toilets, particularly by foreign tourists, are perturbing.

I remember watching a programme wherein a foreign tourist was talking about having been warned about the state of public washrooms in India and then her own experience of having used a toilet with urine seeping out from under the door.

A good thought behind Union government’s Swacchh Bharat Abhiyaan cannot be appreciated enough; but despite the good intent and constant effort to improve the system, it seems like an inadequate attempt at improving the situation.

As late as November 2019, a survey by the Union housing ministry showed that 55 per cent of public washrooms were either extremely dirty or completely unusable in Delhi. Media reports have alleged that quarantine facilities used to keep patients of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have dirty toilets and no soaps.

I want an answer to a simple question: Why cannot we levy a fine or fix a jail term for a dirty public toilet? Travelling without a ticket is a punishable offence, so is drunken driving and spitting in public (during the pandemic). Not wearing a mask at a public place is punishable with Rs 10,000 fine in Kerela.

So why cannot it be the same for a poorly maintained public washroom? Broken fixtures and lack of water supply are glaring shortcomings that can be easily identified, verified and acted against in the form of a fine / prison term.

Malodour is another issue that needs to be tackled. Research done on this aspect has identified the compounds responsible for the malodour and their odour threshold. Currently, there are facilities in India and abroad that use sensors that monitor the odour emanating from public washrooms. Unacceptable levels are conveyed to the monitoring authority electronically.

We need to come up with similar low-cost solution that could either be installed in washroom just like a deodorant.

Alternately, this sensor could be made available to municipalities that can then use it to monitor, regulate and fine facilities that do not satisfy the set criterion, pretty much like how a policeman uses an alcohol meter to catch drunk drivers.

A clean washroom is a matter of national honour. It should be.

The flatbed landing craft is ideal for helping the local communities cross the river to transport goods when not in use. It is estimated that between 8 and 12 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean every year. Further, 70% of all ocean plastic originates from rivers. A low-maintenance, solar-powered solution, the River Plastic Recovery System tackles this problem by removing surface plastic from rivers.

Clean the World Foundation, a global leader in water, sanitation, hygiene, and sustainability has partnered with Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) to facilitate The Drop by Drop Project. A collaboration between Clean the World Foundation and initiative co-founder Sands, The Drop by Drop Project will reinvest capital from water stewardship efforts into three innovative projects supporting local water champions in Las Vegas, Macao, and Singapore. Managed and operated by Clean the World Foundation, The Drop by Drop Project will be supported in part by savings from Sands’ conservation programs.

Following previously announced grant recipients University of St. Joseph Macao (USJ), Institute of Science and Environment, and Get Outdoors Nevada, the third organization selected for funding is Seven Clean Seas, a Singapore-based social enterprise that is tackling plastic pollution. The organization will use the funding to support the development of The River Plastic Recovery System (RPRS), a floating plastic collection system that captures river plastic before it reaches the ocean.

It is estimated that between 8 and 12 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean every year. Further, 70% of all ocean plastic originates from rivers. A low-maintenance, solar-powered solution, the RPRS tackles this problem by removing surface plastic from rivers. Its design will be modular and cost-effective, with the aim of enabling widespread adoption throughout areas with high plastic pollution. It will also be manufactured and installed using local shipyards and infrastructure, supporting local job creation.

The floating system works by catching suspended plastics just below the water’s surface and then channeling it to a conveyor which removes the plastic and deposits it into a holding bin. “To date, Seven Clean Seas has recovered 54,000 kg of plastic from water sources around the world through its beach clean-up activities. The River Plastic Recovery System is a breakthrough cleanup technology that brings automated high-volume plastic recovery at a price point which makes it truly scalable in the developing locations most in need. Seven Clean Seas will install units on the world's worst plastic polluted rivers over the next 5-10 years,” says Tom Peacock-Nazil, co-founder and CEO, Seven Clean Seas.

“Sands ECO360 is tackling single-use plastic at each of our resorts through our E3R strategy – eliminate, reuse, replace and recycle,” says Katarina Tesarova, senior vice president of global sustainability at Sands. “We are excited to support Seven Clean Seas in this new innovative project which addresses single-use plastic beyond our own four walls and prevents plastic pollution in our ecosystems.”

The work of Seven Clean Seas to address the global plastic pollution crisis will also be featured at an upcoming exhibition at the Marina Bay Sands ArtScience Museum, Plastic or Planet by National Geographic, running September 12, 2020 – March 28, 2021.

“Seven Clean Seas is reimagining a clever solution to a problem that is killing our rivers and oceans. The Drop by Drop Project was created with the intention of helping to solve these critical and time-sensitive challenges. The RPRS eliminates one of the super-highways of plastics from entering the ocean. Slowing down this source is critical to the health and vitality of both the ecosystems of the rivers and oceans,” says Sam Stephens, executive director of Clean the World Foundation.

Impacts of PM10 on child health outcomes did not vary between cities that come under the National Clean Air Programme and those that are not under its ambit, the survey said.

Experts call for addressing the data gap for air pollution levels in rural India by applying a mix of technologies such as satellite data and low-cost sensors, integrated with the reference-grade monitors.

Exposure to fine particles (PM 10 ) found in the air increases the risk of harm to child health irrespective of hygiene practices, said a survey of 184 Indian towns and cities. The survey also calls for addressing the air pollution data gap in rural areas.

Published in the BMJ Global Health journal, the study notes that the effect of PM 10 on child health outcomes did not vary between cities that come under the National Clean Air Programme and those that are not under its ambit (NCAP and non-NCAP cities).

“Air pollution has its impacts on child health irrespective of hygiene practices. Regardless of hygienic practices, breathing in filthy air (with high PM 10 levels) increases the risk of adverse child health outcomes. These are premature birth, acute respiratory infection (ARI), low birth weight, and more,” said study author Bidhubhusan Mahapatra of the Population Council at New Delhi.

“So, improved sanitation combined with clean air can prevent loss of several newborn lives. Both aspects are important for better health of children,” Mahapatra told Mongabay-India.

Overall, with every ten µg/m3 (microgram per cubic meter) increase in the PM 10 level, the risk of neonatal mortality shot up by six percent, the odds of experiencing ARI symptoms by seven percent, and premature births by eight percent. “We find that exposure to PM 10 not only impacts children but also pregnant women, resulting in premature births,” said statistician and study co-author Monika Walia, formerly with the Population Council.

PM 10 are particles ranging between 2.5 and 10 micrometers and common sources include vehicular exhausts, smoke from fires, dusty industrial areas among others. Particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5 ) are particles of a smaller size. “PM 2.5 particles are lighter than PM 10 and go deeper into our body, causing more harm than coarse particles. So if PM 10 can cause such adverse effects on child health as shown in our study, then PM 2.5 will lead to more severe impacts,” cautioned Walia, currently Data Manager, Poverty, Health, and Nutrition (PHN) Division at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), New Delhi.

The study builds on a growing body of research that hammers in the linkages between air pollution and health in India, particularly for vulnerable communities. For example, in a 2019 study, IIT-Delhi’s Sagnik Dey and colleagues warned that improved sanitation access for children in rural areas might arrest stunting. Still, early-life exposure to high levels of air pollution could play spoilsport in realising these benefits. Their study found that foetus and newborns’ exposure to outdoor air pollutants (especially PM 2.5 ) is significantly associated with child height deficits.

India is today the world’s second most polluted country. Stubborn air pollution robs the average Indian of more than five years of their life expectancy, according to the Air Quality Life Index 2020 Annual Report published by the Energy Policy Institute of University of Chicago (EPIC).

The researchers measured the effect of PM 10 exposure on various child health outcomes by linking two sources of data: National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) and air quality data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board. NFHS-4 observations for rural areas were removed from the study as PM 10 data is only available for urban areas. “We considered carrying out the analysis using PM 10 because it has greater coverage i.e. PM10 data were available for longer durations and for lot more cities than PM2.5,” said Walia.

The 184 districts/towns covered 24 states and three union territories of India. The survey covered districts in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and others. Of these 184 towns, as many as 95 are priority districts under the NCAP.

The NCAP launched in 2019 is a long-term, time-bound, national-level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across India in a comprehensive manner. It targets 20-30 percent reduction in PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations by 2024, keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration. It includes 122 non-attainment cities- cities that violate the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The plan proposes the implementation of city-specific air quality management plans for non-attainment cities.

The authors emphasise stepping up efforts to measure air pollution in rural areas, at least in the rural areas located on the peripheries of urban areas, because the lack of data on air pollution levels in rural areas remains a critical gap in India’s efforts to address air pollution. Studies have shown that while sources may be somewhat different, polluted air “kills as easily in the rural areas as in the cities” in northern India. “The effects of air pollution were not limited to metro cities in our study; rather, it was pan-India. So the focus should be expanded to reduce air pollution in fast-developing second and third-tier towns,” said Walia.

Disease burden and air pollution levels

Three factors shape the air pollution burden or the cumulative impact of air quality on life. “The level of exposure, the population exposed to a particular level, and the background disease rates, which is a reflection of the overall healthcare systems. It means that even if the air pollution level remains unchanged, the burden will increase because the population will keep growing. Also, if the population age structure shifts to an older age, the risks increase,” said Dey.

Unless the air pollution level goes down substantially, the impact will not reduce. And this is not possible if only the urban centres are targetted. This is the first challenge.

The second challenge is poor healthcare in rural areas. “In the India Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) exercise, it is realised that the air pollution burden is much higher in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than in Delhi, although the pollution level is higher in Delhi. This is because the background disease rate is much lower in Delhi, and Delhi has a smaller population,” explained Dey.

In rural areas, household air pollution exposure is also higher than in urban areas. Therefore, the overall exposure (a combination of outdoor and indoor) remains high. But, this presents an opportunity to deploy clean fuels and electrification to do away with kerosene and firewood use which will clean up the household air in the rural area. The outdoor air will also be cleaned as household sources contribute 50-70 percent to outdoor air pollution.

Dey, who was not associated with the PM 10 study, agrees with the researchers that urban boundaries do not limit air pollution impacts. “NCAP, though focused on the urban centres, is a good start because it acknowledged air pollution as a national problem. However, as the NCAP is evolving, it should connect to the other programs such as Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and rural electrification scheme for an integrated regional plan,” Dey said.

Addressing the data gap in rural India

An analysis of action plans of 102 NCAP cities points out the absence of cost estimates for the execution of the action points listed in the plans as the “most glaring shortcoming.” State budgets need to account for the expenses that implementing clean air plans will incur, especially since some actions call for core infrastructural development and the purchase of expensive assets like mechanical street sweepers and real-time monitoring stations, the analysis said.

Officials of pollution control boards of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, for example, also discussed the funding challenges of the action plans, including cost-effective monitoring technologies, at the India Clean Air Summit 2020 held online by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP).

One way to circumvent the investment challenge is to evolve a hybrid monitoring system with satellite and low-cost sensors integrated with the reference-grade monitors to expand air pollution monitoring to rural areas.

“In the NCAP, the Central Pollution Control Board network will be expanded to cover some rural areas. However, realistically, the investment would be huge and unsustainable for India to maintain an adequately dense network of reference-grade monitors across the country,” he said. However, each component in hybrid systems has its strength and weakness.

“What we need is a system that harnesses the strengths of all these three. We should have reference-grade monitors at strategic locations within each air shed covering both urban and rural areas. Satellite data should be calibrated to provide the regional coverage and help to track the changes in pollution levels,” said Dey. Efforts are on to identify major airsheds in India. Airshed refers to a geographical region that tends to share the same flow of air. The airshed approach was also brought up by researchers for managing future air quality in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area.

“For any mitigation efforts, both local and regional sources need to be tackled. However, with few reference-grade monitors, we cannot interpret which strategy (local vs regional) is more successful. Low-cost sensor (calibrated against the reference-grade) network should be built around the reference-grade monitors to capture the local factors.”

“We (joint efforts with CEEW, colleagues in the USA from NASA, RTI, and UC Berkeley) are planning to deploy an array of low-cost sensors across the Indo-Gangetic plain (Punjab to West Bengal) in the coming months to explore the feasibility of an integrated system. Most of these low-cost sensors will be hosted by citizens, thereby enhancing their engagement and creating awareness. All the data will be available online,” he added.

The norm is always to ensure proper cleanliness of the surfaces around. Simple practices such as washing hands, maintaining distance and wearing mask are being implemented stringently to avoid health being compromised. The risk of contamination and spreading germs even further is very real. Food safety, in particular, has also come under the lens, as people are attempting to follow the best sanitation practices for what they eat. Food safety ultimately boils down to the source of food - the kitchen; where food is prepared, processed and packaged. What can we do to make sure that our kitchen adheres to the best standards of hygiene?

Here Are 5 Tips To Keep Your Kitchen Sanitized, Clean & Germ-Free:

1. Gas Stove

The gas stove is one area which can become a breeding ground for infections over time. Experts suggest cleaning the stove after every meal with a mix of soap or detergent and water. This simple practice is a good way to maintain cleanliness and hygiene of the kitchen and the food that is being cooked.

2. Kitchen Counters And Slabs

Kitchen counters and slabs is where vegetables, fruits and other ingredients are kept before being washed. It is important that the kitchen slabs should be spick and span in order to prevent contamination of produce with germs at the preparation stage of recipes. The chopping board, too, is one surface which is integral to cooking, and must be cleaned regularly. Use a mixture of salt and lemon water for best results.

It is important that the kitchen slabs should be spick and span to prevent germs

3. Vegetables And Fruits

When it comes to food safety, not just the surrounding areas but the food itself should be of the highest quality. To combat the risk of contamination in food, it is advisable to take the necessary precautions by cleaning your vegetables properly before they are consumed. Home remedies may not prove effective in this case, which is why experts highly recommend Marico's Veggie Clean. This 100% naturally derived fruits & vegetables cleanser helps remove 99.9% germs, pesticides & waxes without the use of chlorine, alcohol and chemicals.

Nutritionist Nmami Agarwal explains, ""In the current scenario, we often opt for healthier eating habits, use of superfoods and addition of more greens to our diet but take the most fundamental step of cleaning our produce rather lightly. I believe in using a product that is scientifically proven and certified by Indian labs and international bodies. Veggie Clean from Marico is a specialized fruits & vegetables cleanser which is made with 100% naturally derived ingredients and is proven to remove 99.9% germs, pesticides and waxes from the surface.""

Marico's Veggie Clean is 100% safe to use & is certified by Indian & International experts. It's also great on the consumer's pocket giving you 40 washes in just Rs 99. Click here to buy the product.

4. Utensils And Storage

An important facet of food safety is the utensils and containers it is stored in. Lentils and flours often get infested with pests over time which may lead to diseases and infections. Thus, it is absolutely essential to ensure that utensils and containers are washed after every use with a soap or detergent-based solution. Also, they must be completely dry before putting ingredients in them in order to reduce chances of spoilage.

5. Equipment

Blenders, mixers, refrigerators, microwaves, ovens, grills, toasters and more - whatever equipment is used in the kitchen must be spotlessly clean as a thumb rule. The microwave specially can often become messy and dirty, and must be cleaned often with a cleaning solution. Experts suggest using a vinegar and water based cleaner for the same. Simply heat up the bowl in the microwave for a few minutes and use a sponge to get rid of the stains quickly.

The idea is to keep the kitchen neat and clean at all times. Once kitchen tools and raw materials adhere to the highest sanitation standards, you will be rest assured of a germ-free, healthy kitchen always.

As many greenhouse vegetable crops start to wind down, it is critical to conduct a thorough clean out between crops. Not only can this reduce carryover of arthropod pests and plant pathogens, it also improves the success of integrated pest management (IPM) programs in the next crop.

Here are three critical steps to a thorough cleaning:

1. Remove organic matter (OM): Why?

Because OM protects pests and can neutralize/inactivate disinfectants.

Advertisment

2. Wash with detergent, rinse, dry: Why?

Because washing/scrubbing with detergent first can eliminate more OM and begin to break down pathogens.

3. Disinfect, rinse, dry: Why?

Because this final step can catch what was missed in steps 1 and 2.

Tips to keep in mind during clean out:

Maintain warm temperatures to starve pests and increase efficacy of disinfectants

Monitor for residual pests

Maintain sanitation and hygiene (e.g. footbaths, hand sanitizers, freshly laundered clothes, clean footwear, etc.)

Heat and vent to rid greenhouse of pesticide residues after clean out to avoid phytotoxicity in your next crop

Clean out Checklist



Keep this checklist handy to make sure you’ve covered all your clean out tasks.

Crop disposal

♦ Treat crop before removal to kill active pests

♦ Remove and properly dispose of:

Old crop – do not pile or spread infected plant material behind your greenhouse

Other materials (clips, slabs, strings, etc.)

♦ Remove remaining plant residues; sweep and vacuum focusing on gaps in floor covering, walkways, corners, ledges, etc.

Clean irrigation system

♦ Remove drippers from media; keep lines slightly charged to maintain moisture

♦ Disconnect pH and EC sensors

♦ Remove filters

♦ Flush lines:

Flush with water Flush with acid (e.g. nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric/muriatic acid); check the emitter manufacturer for pH requirements Pulse several times at 1-hour intervals for 24 hours Flush with clean water Flush with disinfectant Flush again with clean water when specified by the product label

♦ Clean and disinfect:

Stock tanks, return/dirty leach tanks, freshwater tanks

Pump sets

Emitters stakes (soak in acid solution for up to 48 hours, rinse well, disinfect, rinse well when specified by the product label)

♦ Replace emitters and other parts when necessary

Washing and disinfection



When washing and disinfecting different parts of the greenhouse, be sure to let soak (wet) for a minimum of 15 minutes up to 60 minutes. Though longer contact time is generally more effective, be mindful of corrosiveness of disinfectants. Rinse well with water and let dry completely between steps. Do not forget door handles, keyboards and other surfaces touched by employees.

♦ Wash and disinfect structure

Use a power washer or some specialized equipment on low pressure with large opening tip

Start at the point of the roof and work down

Replace old floor covering when necessary

♦ Wash and disinfect all horizontal surfaces, including:

Rafters

Pipes

Troughs

Concrete walkways

♦ Wash and disinfect all tools and equipment, including:

Scissor carts

Picking crates

Wires

Machinery

Vehicles

Fork lifts (including forks)

Pallets

Knives and scissors

♦ Wash and disinfect other common areas, including:

Offices

Washrooms

Lunch rooms

Packing lines

Boiler room

Gone through the checklist above? Now you are ready for planting!

Disclaimer: Always check federal, provincial and municipal regulations when choosing pesticides and disinfectants. It is critical to store, handle, apply and dispose in a proper manner to avoid or eliminate negative impacts on personal health and safety and the environment. Always check safety data sheets (SDS) recommendations before using any product. Check warning labels for required personal protective equipment (PPE).

The blue skies that appeared in Delhi, Mumbai and other previously polluted cities this year because of the COVID-19 lockdown offered a tantalizing but temporary vision of how bright our future might look. If India can speedily and successfully transition away from fossil fuels and ensure that all families have access to clean cooking technology, those blue skies could become permanent instead of ephemeral.

The world has made uneven and unsatisfactory progress towards the goal of blue skies for all people. As leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly to forge recovery from this pandemic and build resilience to future shocks like it, they have the opportunity — and duty — to simultaneously tackle the deadly pollution our economy spews and work to achieve everyone’s right to breathe clean air.

Every day, thousands of people in India die of illnesses caused by air pollution. According to the best available evidence, air pollution causes between 1,241,000 and 1,795,181 premature deaths annually in India. The global total, 7 million premature deaths, vastly exceeds the death toll of COVID-19. It also exceeds the combined total of deaths caused annually by war, murder, car accidents, plane crashes, Ebola, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Among its terrible toll, air pollution kills hundreds of thousands of children aged five and under.

Clean air is critically important to human life and wellbeing. Scientific research on the adverse health effects of air pollution reveals ever greater impacts. It is now indisputable that breathing dirty air causes respiratory illnesses, heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer, while new evidence suggests links to premature births, diabetes, and damage to the brain. It could even increase the risk of death from COVID-19, by causing the underlying health conditions that make people more susceptible to respiratory illness, early research suggests.

Here’s a strange paradox: in 2010, the United Nations passed a pioneering resolution, recognizing for the first time that clean water is a basic human right. Yet no similar resolution has ever been proposed, let alone passed, for clean air. There are two main categories of air pollution. Outdoor air pollution is caused largely by industry, coal-fired electricity generation, and transportation. Household air pollution is mainly a result of cooking and heating with solid fuels, as well as burning kerosene for lighting. Outdoor and indoor pollution mix together to produce worse air quality. For example, in India, the indoor burning of solid fuels is a major contributor to outdoor air pollution.

It is shocking that nine out of 10 people globally live in regions where air pollution exceeds World Health Organization standards. The worst air quality is not on the streets of the India’s smoggiest cities. It is in people’s homes, where solid fuels are used for cooking, exposing women and children to fine particles and other pollutants at levels hundreds of times higher than outdoors.

The good news amongst is that air pollution is almost entirely preventable. Proven solutions exist, from strong regulations to clean technologies. As an added bonus, many of the solutions to air pollution also address climate change.

There are seven key steps that states need to take to protect human rights from air pollution. These include: establishing air quality monitoring networks; quantifying the main sources of air pollution; engaging and informing the public; enacting laws, regulations, and air quality standards; developing a national action plan to achieve the standards; allocating adequate resources to implement the plan; and evaluating progress, and if necessary, taking stronger actions.

Because cooking with solid fuels causes millions of premature deaths annually, switching to clean cookstoves and fuels needs to be a global priority. India has made impressive progress by providing free LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) stoves to over one hundred million poor families. These stoves dramatically reduce pollution, deliver major health benefits and save time cooking and gathering fuels such as firewood, a benefit that largely accrues to women. LPG stoves also produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than burning solid fuels. This may be the only situation in the world where subsidizing the increased use of fossil fuels makes sense.

Switching all remaining Indian households to clean stoves and clean fuels by 2030 would require an investment of approximately US$2 billion per year. In light of the reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, health benefits, time savings and associated economic opportunities for women, quality of life improvements, reduced pressure on forests (for firewood), this is a fantastic investment. This sum also fits easily within the $100 billion in annual financial assistance that wealthy nations have committed to mobilize for low-income countries to address the challenges of climate change.

Other proven solutions include replacing coal-fired electricity with renewables, emphasizing walking and cycling in cities, electrifying public transit, ending fossil fuel subsidies, improving waste management, and helping farmers to shift to cleaner practices.

More than 850 civil society groups have this month signed a letter calling on the Human Rights Council to guarantee our human right to a clean, safe and healthy environment. We can’t have a healthy environment without clean air.

Air pollution clearly violates the rights to life and health, the rights of the child, and the right to live in a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. The human rights perspective changes everything, because governments have clear, legally enforceable obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.

Everyone has the right to breathe clean air. That billions of people today are breathing dirty and deadly air constitutes a global health crisis and an egregious violation of human rights. Urgent action from governments across the world is needed. Not only do we have an opportunity to save millions of lives and trillions of dollars in the next decade by reducing air pollution, we have a moral obligation to do so.

With trash piling up in Queens neighborhoods since the NYC Department of Sanitation’s budget was slashed by more than $106 million due to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 shutdown, Councilman Daniel Dromm secured funding for additional cleaning services on the streets and sidewalks Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, two of the hardest-hit neighborhoods during the pandemic.

Dromm allocated $160,000 to the Association of Community Employment Programs for the Homeless, Inc.(ACE) for 128 hours a supplemental cleaning services each week.

ACE employees are now regularly sweeping community streets and sidewalks, periodically removing taped flyers from lampposts, and emptying trash bins to prevent them from overflowing. ACE has resumed cleaning services in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst while wearing personal protective equipment and adhering to social distancing practices to keep residents and workers safe.

“These thousands of dollars in funding mean a cleaner Jackson Heights and Elmhurst for everyone,” Dromm said. “We are in the middle of a financial crisis. The restoration of these dollars was not easy. I fought long and hard to ensure that my district receives the funding we need to increase these important services. I want to thank ACE for their impeccable work which keeps our streets and sidewalks clean.”

ACE employees will clean along Roosevelt Avenue and 37th Avenue from 69th Street to 81st Street; 73rd Street through 77th Street between Roosevelt Avenue and 37th Avenue; Broadway from 72nd Street to Elmhurst Avenue; and Diversity Plaza. Dromm also secured $30,000 that will enable the NYC Department of Sanitation to conduct additional weekend garbage pick-ups along Broadway from 69th Street to Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst, and additional Saturday pick-ups along 37th Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights.

“These additional pick-ups will help reduce trash bin overflows in my district’s busy commercial corridors during hours that see high foot traffic,” Dromm said. “Overflowing trash bins are not only unsightly, they attract rats, sicken our pets and wildlife, and contribute to water contamination. There is no denying that strewn trash has had an adverse impact on our environmental and public health.

The African Development Bank (ADB) is releasing 500,000 dollars to assist the authorities and the international community mobilized to repair this disaster. The AfDB has carried out this operation through its Special Relief Fund, which supports the countries of the continent in case of disaster.

“This emergency aid of 500,000 dollars provided by the African Development Bank in Mauritius is an important contribution to the clean-up operations carried out by the international community aimed at rehabilitating marine biodiversity. It is important for the livelihoods of the population in the blue economy and tourism sectors, which are now threatened by this unfortunate oil spill,” said Martin Fregene, the AfDB’s Director of Agriculture and Agribusiness.

A real ecological and economic disaster for Mauritius

Since the beginning of the oil spill on July 25th, 2020, daily life in Mauritius has been punctuated by the clean-up operations of the oil spill caused by MV Wakashio, a Japanese vessel flying the Panamanian flag. The bulk carrier sank off the southeast coast of Mauritius (at the Pointe d’Esny). Following bad weather in the lagoon, the Mauritian government announced that all attempts to right the ship had failed. At the time, the vessel was carrying 3,800 tons of fuel oil and 200 tons of diesel.

The ship finally ran aground on the reef, causing a major oil spill. Faced with the magnitude of the situation, the Mauritian government declared a state of emergency and ordered fishermen and residents to stay away from the beaches and lagoons near the communities of Blue Bay, Pointe d’Esny and Mahebourg. On site, the oil spill is being cleaned up by the local populations accompanied by ocean protection organizations.

According to the ADB, the oil spill has caused a difficult health, environmental and economic situation. The country is heavily dependent on the blue economy, particularly for food and tourism, and its coastline is home to some of the most intact coral reefs on the planet. The entire population continues to be at risk of serious diseases due to the presence of oil and its derived pollutants. The $500,000 from its Special Relief Fund is also expected to complement on-going interventions by the Government of Mauritius, development partners and various stakeholders to carry out salvage and clean-up operations, estimate damage and losses, and carry out various socio-economic assessments.

Once pandemic shutdown orders were issued in Pennsylvania and nationally, any health and safety issues that existed prior to COVID-19 were more noticeable, industry leaders said. Truck drivers have told them it’s difficult to maintain the highest standards of cleanliness on long hauls or local deliveries because some private businesses have closed or others have limited the number of people allowed inside at one time.

There also was the challenge of public rest areas and welcome centers being shut down for two months from March to May.

“The problem is that people who are not permitting the drivers into their warehouses are being very shortsighted,” said Joe Butzer, president of the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association. “You can’t ask somebody to pick up or drop off your product and not support them. There’s nothing human about that.”

Looking ahead to the fall and winter months, drivers are concerned that they may not be allowed to use clean indoor facilities at rest areas and welcome centers again or park their trucks in safe places for an extended period of time.

Throughout the summer months, Butzer said drivers told him they were forced to stand outside in the heat while waiting to use an indoor facility or were forced to stand in rain to comply with state guidelines. The limited access to clean facilities doesn’t allow drivers to wash their hands, which is the most commonly repeated recommendation by both the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Butzer said.

As essential workers, truck drivers have been hustling to make sure customers receive their orders, he added. His organization represents 1,100 members, which are made up of a combination of companies and individuals.

“If you eat it, wear it or use it, it came on a truck,” Butzer said. “The drivers are human beings. It’s that simple to me and it should be that simple to all of us. About 1 out of 17 jobs in the commonwealth have to do with trucking. Pennsylvania has over 300,000 truckers.”

And that’s concerning to him because if truck drivers are refused access to clean facilities during a pandemic, not only are they at risk for contracting COVID-19 but also for spreading it to anyone they have come into contact with.

“It’s affecting drivers’ physical health; if you can’t drink water all day,” he said. “They’re fearful and I don’t blame them.”

Butzer said he receives phone calls often from companies all across the United States, as well as Canada and Mexico, to complain about how unfriendly Pennsylvania is to truck drivers.

“Truck drivers, if they get off an exit, they have no idea if there’s going to be enough room for their trucks or if there’s even going to be an open facility here,” he said. “They have no idea. We’re trying to get our federal highway administration, PennDOT, and the Pa. Turnpike to understand there are not enough places for drivers to park safely and have facilities to utilize.

Butzer continued: ""Truck drivers are unique. They can sit in their cabs for days and not interact with anybody, except to buy fuel and food. I think people overall are losing sight that these guys and gals are the ones out there making the world move.”

Out of the 35 rest areas statewide in addition to 14 welcome centers, two rest areas in Dauphin County are currently under construction, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

“PennDOT’s rest areas and welcome centers are staffed with cleaning and maintenance personnel who ensure that cleaning of restroom facilities is completed routinely,” said PennDOT press secretary Alexis Campbell. “These protocols have become more stringent since COVID-19 began.""

PennDOT hasn’t received complaints or negative feedback about the cleanliness of public facilities, Campbell said. The department encourages customer feedback, she added.

“Public rest areas and welcome centers in Pennsylvania are not designed to be long-term truck stops, but rather are intended for relief and respite for truckers and motorists — by law, customers may stay at our facilities for no longer than two hours,” Campbell said.

PennDOT closed all rest areas and welcome centers on March 17 to “ensure proper sanitation, safety, and maintenance at these facilities,” according to the department. Public rest areas began to slowly reopen on March 18. Two months later, all of the state’s public rest areas and welcome centers had reopened.

PennDOT officials said they currently do not see them closing any rest areas in the near future.

The alternative for truck drivers while rest areas were closed could have been truck stops — for example, Love’s in Middletown, Dauphin County — and other public locations, according to PennDOT.

“We recognize that drivers need and deserve access to rest areas, which is why we began reopening rest areas in key locations the day after they were closed,” Campbell said.

Truck stops like Love’s are requiring drivers to wear masks at their locations. And, Walmart, which has its own fleet of truck drivers, has kept distribution center showers and facilities open for their employees.

“Our shower facilities are for Walmart drivers,” said Walmart spokesperson Robyn Babbitt. “Other drivers have access to a driver breakroom with vending machines, self-service food options, and a restroom.”

Babbitt declined to comment on the number of Walmart drivers who have tested positive for COVID-19.

“That is not a number I can provide,” she said. “Our practice is to leave COVID-19 confirmations up to the local health officials out of respect and privacy for our associates’ personal health information.”

Robert LaRochelle, who drives locally, said he generally works five to six 12-hour days per week. He said he hopes that if abrupt changes do occur, that there is more thought put into the wellbeing of truck drivers.

Most of the changes are commonplace now, from being buzzed in when dropping off a load to encountering plastic shields that separate him from another person.

LaRochelle, 44, describes himself as “a bigger guy with diabetes.” He said he falls into the high-risk category for contracting COVID-19 but he has been a truck driver for 10 years.

“A lot of places have moved restrooms outside and they are overrun and not in the best of conditions,” he said. “They get treated maybe once a week; they are not cleaned daily. They are not sanitized well. It’s stuff like that that I’m worried about.”

He said some businesses and warehouses in central Pennsylvania have made drivers wait outside, sometimes in the rain or thunderstorms, to use the facilities because they have a limited number of people allowed in a building at one time.

LaRochelle has a hand sanitizer pump in his cab at all times and his wife recently purchased him an N95 mask.

“We need to find a solution because people need this stuff,” he said.","There also was the challenge of public rest areas and welcome centers being shut down for two months from March to May.

Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration is proposing a plan to purchase 11,813 MW of electricity from 2022. The authorities intend to rely heavily on independent power producers (IPPs), which already have numerous concessions in this southern African country.

In its plan, the South African government plans to purchase 6,800 MW of electricity from renewable sources. The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has also approved the construction of storage facilities for 513 MWh of electricity; as well as the production of 3 000 MW from gas-fired power stations and 1 500 MW from coal-fired plants.

As for renewable energies, the 6,800 MW will be obtained from new solar and wind farms. “Work has begun with key stakeholders, including the buyer [Eskom], to strengthen the framework essential for the programme’s bankability,” says Gwede Mantashe, South Africa’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy. The South African government’s new energy plan paves the way for a new round of tendering to qualify IPPs for the construction of future facilities.

The new plan is being announced as the fourth round of tendering for the Independent Purchase of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (IPPERP) programme continues to deliver results. Recently, the Bokamoso solar power plant was commissioned by a consortium formed by the Ideas Fund (managed by Old Mutual), Reatile Solar Power, Phakwe Solar, Business Venture Investments and the Cicada Community Trust.

The two agreements provide for loans worth a total of 336 million euros from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the French Development Agency (AFD).

Through its 182.9 million euro loan, the EBRD is helping to finance a project aimed at strengthening Egypt’s electricity network through the construction of five substations in the governorates of South Sinai, East Sinai, Port Said, Assiut and Minya. The European Bank’s package also includes a 150,000 euro grant for capacity building within the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC).

Electricity sector reform

The House of Representatives also validated a 150 million euro loan from AFD. The funds will be used to implement reforms in Egypt’s electricity sector. In concrete terms, the aim is to improve the sector’s financial viability, management and operational efficiency. The program launched by the Egyptian government in 2016 also aims to support renewable energy production.

According to the Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat, the implementation of reforms in the electricity sector and the production of renewable energy will “launch Egypt’s green transformation”. These initiatives are part of the “national sustainability program Vision 2030” that AFD is also supporting through a 1 million euro grant that it will provide over three years.

For Minister Rania Al-Mashat, the EBRD and AFD financing is intended to help Egypt achieve several Sustainable Development Objectives (SDOs) simultaneously. “These include Goal 7, which aims to ensure access for all affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy; Goal 9, which aims to promote industry and innovation; Goal 12, which aims to promote responsible production and consumption; and Goal 17, which aims to form partnerships to achieve the SDGs,” Rania Al-Mashat said.

It was the second time in two weeks that has happened.

Lou McKee was there handing out garbage bags and informing people about their rights. She said she experienced homelessness for a few months almost 15 years ago.

“You realize, in an instant, you are one of these people,” Mckee said. “You are no different from these people, and that these are your neighbors.”

Marvin Oliveros said he and others regularly bring supplies to people experiencing homelessness. It's not a protest in the way people often think about it — instead, their goal is to show up at the cleanups with great enough numbers to get the county health department and police to stop displacing people and leave them alone.

“For those folks that can’t move fast enough or can’t move at all, we’re here to stand with them while they’re here,” Oliveros said. “For their safety.”

Dale Keller, environmental health manager for Salt Lake County, said the county has been conducting camp cleanups to pick up needles and waste multiple times a week for more than a decade. They respond to complaints from neighbors, businesses and city agencies.

“Our focus is two-fold: public and environmental health,” Keller said. “That’s the only reason why the health department is involved in this.”

Keller said the health department posted notice of the cleanup the day before as well as talking with people at campsites throughout the city about what would happen. But he said the intention Thursday was not for people to vacate the area.

“We just wanted people to consolidate their belongings and get them on the sidewalk,” he said. “The ultimate goal is to move them along because [in the] parts of the city that we were at — the neighbors are just really getting fatigued with the garbage and the trash and the other difficulties that are there.”

Recently, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall announced a plan to increase encampment cleanup efforts throughout the city, particularly in areas where a lot of unsheltered people live. In response to the protests, Mendenhall said the cleanups are important for both campers and the community as a whole.

“We’re coordinating with the county to get better, clearer messaging to people so they know exactly what to expect when these cleanings are happening,” she said. “The health department asks people to move for sanitation to take place, but these events are not intended to threaten campers in any way.”

Keller, the county’s environmental health manager, said although they didn’t complete encampment clean up Thursday, the abatements will continue to happen, after the health department strategizes with social service providers and public safety stakeholders on how to move forward.

Dozens of local residents spent their Saturday morning cleaning up trash on Polecat Bench north of Powell. As perhaps a testament to both their hard work and the scope of the illegal dumping in the area, the volunteers filled an industrial-sized roll-off container and a trailer within a couple of hours. Everyone seemed a little bit shocked at how much trash they’d picked up.

“Obviously the community came out [and] they’re super interested in cleaning up this area,” said Rebekah Burns, executive director of the Powell Economic Partnership (PEP)/Powell Chamber, which organized the cleanup.

Burns added that event “is really PEP’s kickoff to developing some more outdoor opportunities on the bench.”

A total of 44 adults, plus some young helpers, split into a half-dozen teams and participated in a friendly competition to see who could collect the most trash in two hours. Teams included representatives from Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Rotary Club, the Northwest College volleyball team, AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), PEP staffers and board members and Burns’ own family.

A group of local mountain bikers, going by the team name CFH, wound up crushing the field by returning to the collection site with two trucks crammed full of rubbish — including a futon and multiple mattresses.

The bikers have been unimpressed with the amount of people using the Polecat Bench’s patchwork of public and private lands as a personal dumping ground; CFH team member Ben Borcher wrote in a Facebook post ahead of the event that, “dumping a mattress or appliance off out there for dead is just one step above punching puppies on the lowlife scale.”

Compared to a trip to the Powell landfill, “it takes more of an effort to come out here, find a ridge, to drive out in the mud and kick it off the [vehicle],” Borcher said Saturday — shortly after helping heave a bullet-riddled water heater into the bin.

“Everyone likes to shoot a washing machine, but just pick it up,” he said.

For its part, the Bureau of Land Management would prefer that folks use a gun range or, alternatively, bring a target system they can take with them when they leave.

“I have a, ‘You catch it, you clean it’ model,” said local BLM Ranger Robert Lind. “And that is, if you shoot someone else’s mattress and I drive up and you’re shooting that mattress, it’s your responsibility to take it home with you.”

Fines for illegal dumping can vary based on the weight or the material being abandoned. The citations and fines that a person risks far outweigh the cost of a trip to the landfill, “so it’s definitely not worth it by any means,” said Lind, who assisted with Saturday’s cleanup as part of “Team Awesome.”

Lind praised the Park County Sheriff’s Office for the regular presence it provides on the bench, but it still remains difficult to catch people in the act of dumping trash across the area’s vast amount of public lands — which is one reason why he said education is key.

“Our community does a good job of keeping the area clean as much as they can,” he added, commending recreationists for their efforts in “maintaining order out here” and helping to clean up messes left by other users.

The BLM ranger also said that dumping on public land tends to beget more dumping.

“When they see trash, then that brings more trash,” Lind said, adding, “Ideally, if we can keep it cleaned up and do more events like this, it helps out.”

PEP hopes to make the clean-up an annual event, Burns said, “but potentially not pick up as much trash” in subsequent years.

Beyond cleaning up the area, PEP hopes to work with the BLM and the Bureau of Reclamation — which owns much of the land on Polecat Bench — to develop some official, maintained trails.

As PEP seeks to boost outdoor recreation in the Powell area, “one of the biggest hurdles for tourists and for residents is knowing where to go,” Burns said, “where’s safe, what lands they’re on and what trails they should ride.”

The ultimate aim for the economic development group, she added, is “you build trails, you build an attraction, then comes the rentals, the retail [business] and at the very end of the game is an outdoor rec manufacturer” coming to the area.

“That’s the long game, for sure,” Burns said.

Now that South Africa has unlocked Level 2 of lockdown, intra-provincial leisure travel is allowed and hotels are eager to welcome guests back. Extensive health and safety procedures are being implemented to ensure visitors’ comfort – and confidence.

Blast from the Past is a 1999 movie starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. Short story: the dad, a nuclear scientist, believes war with Russia is imminent so he builds an underground bunker where he takes his family to live, time-locked for 35 years. When the son eventually emerges, he finds a world very different to the 1960s culture with which he was brought up.

This reminds me a bit of our current lockdown situation. For months, we were urged to stay at home, but as restrictions have gradually lifted, we’re coming out into a very strange environment. We know – or at least, we should – that Covid-19 is not over, but you’d think that it is; that it was just some horrid nightmare from which we’ve recently awoken. People – so many people – are still walking around in public without masks. They socialise in bars and restaurants, with zero physical distance, as in hugs and embraces. The shops are crowded, 50 people look like a lot more than they sound on paper, and rush hour traffic has returned, ugh. It’s all anxiety-inducing for anyone who has thus far remained fairly self-isolated, and it transpires that some people think your request to have your personal space respected is a joke.

Life, however, since we should be grateful to have it, must go on. I know I’ve said this many times to many people so forgive me if I am repeating it now: we all have our own personal requisite comfort levels. Since my first lockdown weekend away in Stellenbosch at the end of July 2020, I’ve been to a further three guesthouses, and I grow increasingly confident with each trip. Yes, all right, I do still take my own sanitiser but I’m definitely not as skittish as I was.

Slowly but surely, hotels are gearing up to reopen, some sooner than others, and they have been hard at work during the past few months making sure they are doing everything possible to help their staff and guests feel secure when the time arrives. “What’s important to us is that the staff feel comfortable and can talk with confidence – and then the guests will feel safe,” said Joanne Selby, GM of The Table Bay hotel in the V&A Waterfront.

“We are hopeful that the curfew will soon be relaxed as it has hurt our business by reducing operating hours at a time when numbers at our properties already have to be limited. But we are grateful and relieved that our restaurants can again serve alcohol,” said Sun International Group Hospitality COO Graham Wood.

“Our current health and safety protocols will remain in place, and all Sun International properties now bear the World Travel and Tourism Council’s (WTTC) safe stamp of approval, verifying that the Covid-19 health and safety protocols we have in place meet international benchmarks.”

The Sun City resort has already opened and The Maslow Sandton will open on October 1, followed by The Table Bay on November 1, 2020.

Properties in the group are following the guidelines of the Tourism Business Council of South Africa, a document being used by all the big players in terms of the minimum standards in the industry, said Selby. “We’re probably doing a little bit more. I think it needs to become part of our DNA for the foreseeable future.”

Measures include walk-off mats at all the major entrances to the hotel – the front, the back which leads to the quayside, and at the top of the escalators which lead to the shopping mall. These follow a dry-wet-dry procedure which will remove the last dregs of “outside” contaminants. “Theoretically, they’ll have masks on, hands will be clean, their luggage will be sanitised. And their shoes too. It’s not invasive and will give an additional sense of comfort,” said Selby.

All staff members have to complete a comorbidities questionnaire to make sure it is safe for them to come to work. “Based on that, we get doctors to make sure they are fit to work, if they need to work in a specific area, and how we accommodate those requirements in the workplace,” she said.

Then there are four training modules, from mask protocols to cleanliness to hygiene, to rules of engagement in terms of social distancing. About half the staff have completed this training so far. Only once they have done this, can they get in a vehicle and come to work. But wait, there’s more: an online self-assessment has to be done every day, and presented on arrival at work. It will show a red screen, or a green screen, and guests will be required to carry out the same assessment.

“A red screen means you might be denied access or deferred to a holding area for further analysis,” said Selby. Those cleared will still have their temperatures taken and hands sanitised before beginning their shift.

“If your temperature is high, then we will take you to a secondary area – the first conference room, that’s our Covid holding room – where we’ll have another, differently calibrated, thermometer and oximeter. There will be more in-depth screening and questions before check in is allowed, or a referral for a second opinion; we’re not medical professionals,” said Selby, because statistically, there is always a chance someone will get sick.

Check-in, wherever possible, will be contactless. Where a stanchion and a guard once stood at the lifts, they will be replaced with glass sliding doors with key card access. Escalators to the mall will be open, with the walk off mats at the top, and users will be required to leave two steps distance between themselves and others on the escalator.

Guests will be given the option of whether they’d like their rooms serviced or not. If not, there are self-cleaning kits with disposable cloths, and such. Yes, people. It has come to this. After checkout, no one goes into that room for 24 hours, thereafter it will be cleaned. Once the rooms are clean, the last person to leave the room will seal the sanitised door hanger and no one goes in after that. The next guest breaks the seal.

“We like seals,” smiled Selby.

It is relevant: outside, on the Waterfront side, stands a huge bronze statue of the hotel’s mascot, Oscar the seal. It’s a tribute to a real Cape Fur Seal whose adventures and his unlikely friendship with a lonely fisherman are told in a children’s book, Oscar! by award winning photographer and publisher, Marc Hoberman.

Inside, in the lobby and lounge, blue inflatable seals are being used to assist with physical distancing. All the scatter cushions and objet d’arts have been removed from this area – as well as in the rooms – as the hygiene guidelines specify that unnecessary items that can harbour germs are removed. Magazines are gone, and the directory of services and menus become digital.

“It’s about preventing transmission. The seals are good because they can be wiped down or sprayed. We wanted the lounge to have a bit of a personality; without them it would be sad and bare. This is not a hospital; it needs to still feel like warm south African hospitality,” said Selby.

There are so many rules, but they are there for your safety and comfort, emphasised Selby.

“The macarons with your coffee will be in little jars – cute, really nicely done; high tea items will be under glass cloches. There won’t be a breakfast buffet. Rather than a bowl of yoghurt you dish up it will be individual pots, individual juices, and a hot menu,” explained Selby.

Table cloths are not a thing anymore, and cutlery is individually wrapped. Disposable bamboo napkins which are 100% biodegradable will be used. Butter is still in individual packs – not ideal but it has to be done this way, it’s a recommendation. Reusable glass will be utilised wherever possible.

Meal sittings will initially take place in the lounge and not the large dining room or Camissa restaurant. The hotel, which has 329 rooms, will initially open with two or three floors. “It will be a slow process as recovery takes place,” said Selby.

High tea will be available to non-resident guests as well, and even though there won’t be the glorious buffet display of the past, all the cakes will be available to order and brought to the table.

The pool will be open, with loungers appropriately distanced. Apparently the chemicals in the water are adequate to protect against the virus. The gym will be open too, but not the steam rooms. There’s not enough clarity regarding heat and air circulation to be 100% sure of the safety. However, should a guest wish to book a private session, this can be arranged.

In the rooms, along with the cleaning supplies, hand sanitiser and masks have been added to the in-room amenities, snacks will be in sealed containers, and all the linens will have been laundered and sealed in plastic beforehand, and again when removed from the room.

This was another area which required thought. Nanotechnology in fabrics was an option for a moment but it would only last for about 30 washes. “Then we looked at disposable linen, which is used in hospitals and hospices, but it’s not the great quality you expect in a 5-star hotel,” said Selby. Quite right. You’ve got to be able to slither around on those high thread count sheets.

So laundering at the right temperature is still the answer.

Hotels have always been clean, said Selby, with microbiologists coming in regularly to test things like the tap water, swab the chefs’ hands, swab the cutting boards… “That’s standard stuff. We’ll carry on with that.”

The Table Bay’s “secret weapon” in the housekeeping department are its electrostatic sanitising units. They look like guns, and when the contents are charged with static, they wrap around the item being sprayed. By all means, be skeptical, but I witnessed this with my own eyes. No charge, the spray sits on the surface. Charged, it coats the item and you can see and feel the moisture on all sides. This gadget will be used in the rooms as well as public areas, between service periods, and staff areas.

To educate guests, as well as reassure them, The Table Bay has made a video which will be online, and also sent when a booking is made. “Although we’ve got a 30-page document of protocols, who’s going to read that?” said Selby.

“Our greatest asset is our staff. They are the ones that are going to sell it. This is just bricks and mortar,” said Selby, indicating the quiet expanse of the lounge. “They’ve got to feel safe to make our guests feel safe.”

Steenberg Hotel & Spa in Tokai has already reopened and GM Catherine Schulze said it has been wonderful to gradually have guests back.

“South Africans are having the best time with us as Covid has been really hard for all. I think everyone in the service industry is energised by making others happy. I must say, the joy on our local visitors’ faces when they are shown their upgraded room or the treats we have surprised them with, is so heartwarming.

“Often the guests we are now hosting would not normally be in the position to stay in this caliber of hotel or would spend their money on other luxuries. I believe it is an opportunity to showcase our entire offering to a consumer who might have not normally thought about visiting and we are all reveling in that.”

Travelling within South Africa is a winning situation at the moment. You can get some amazing accommodation discounts and special offers, and despite the endless stream of bad news stories, we’re still lucky to be living in one of the most beautiful countries in the world, which is filled with diversity. Local road trips are the best, whether for a weekend or a week. Even if you opt for a staycation close to home, it will make a welcome change from your own four walls.

“We opened the spa the moment we could and I really thought that would be a challenge for our guests, to adapt with all of our strict health and safety measures,” said Schulze. “But they have been amazing and I also believe many were in need of pampering and care.”

Being a small hotel, and having a flexible team all trained in various skills, meant Steenberg could minimise the risk to them and to guests, when first opening for business travel. Occupancy has increased now of course. The layout is quite spread out, and with private patios and some in-room facilities it could almost be “self-catering”. Both restaurants on the estate, Tryn and Bistro Sixteen82, are open now, and wine tasting as well.

“As a boutique hotel, it has always lent itself to a service which is curated around the guests’ needs so nothing has changed in that arena. There are some services which we are so accustomed to doing but have had to adapt for the safety of all – like parking of guests’ cars on arrival, and turndown,” said Schulze.

“Our check-in process and all requests and requirements are done before arrival, including the Covid questionnaire. All staff have done training prior to being placed on shift by our Covid Officer (a newly created position in this period to ensure all are adhering to the correct regulations and that this is strictly monitored).

“Guests have their temperature taken, and at the spa a register is filled in by all guests. Housekeeping services are limited and rooms are fogged after every stay and then left for 24 hours to ensure the highest level of control. All refreshments and additional toweling are placed in the room before arrival so that guests have sufficient supply in the event they need to prevent any staff coming into the room.

“As far as servicing of rooms, we are following what our guests want and need, which differs depending on them. All linen is placed in secured bags and this is then sent directly to the laundry company which washes it at a very high temperature. We have as little contact with anything coming out of the rooms as possible. We have never had a tray charge for room service but most guests are opting to eat at Tryn. What we are experiencing is increased use of our areas for morning and afternoon walks by all our guests and our gardens.”

This I can vouch for, having taken some lovely strolls on the property, which also has a golf course. There’s a small dam with the most amazing view of False Bay and you don’t even need proper hiking boots to get there.

“Every person in service is dying to delight their guests, so you should be experiencing the best of everything at the most affordable prices – and feel fantastic that you’re supporting jobs,” said Schulze.

Pierre Van Heerden, programme coordinator and senior lecturer at The Private Hotel School – Rosebank says they are working “very closely” with the hospitality industry on reopening to leisure travellers. According to Van Heerden, the most prominent changes to take place in the hospitality industry will revolve around hygiene practices.

“With the reopening of leisure travel, it has increased the risk of spreading the virus. I can however say that wearing a mask is non-negotiable, and having sanitisers available for your staff and guests is a must,” he said.

“We must be extremely cautious to ensure that the rise in positive cases are controlled and that we are not pushed back to the higher levels, and our industry is shut down again. We have thousands of people that have lost incomes due to this pandemic. We need to rebuild this industry, and assist where training is needed.”

Despite all the guidelines, advice and training, there are still so many areas which remain fuzzy. As Selby said, table clothes are a thing of the past, and I heard the same from a restaurateur last week. Mere hours later, I walked past tables set up on a stoep – with clothes, condiments and cutlery.

“Being an overthinker and slight germaphobe, I would feel more comfortable with a bare table. The reasoning behind this is that I would have a greater ease of mind knowing that my table is clean, especially if the waitron sanitises it before you sit down,” shared Van Heerden. If the table is set with a tablecloth, decorations on the table etc, there would be a greater opportunity for missing a spot when cleaning/sanitising.

“Creating awareness is a powerful tool to use. Explain to your guests why the items on the table are minimal, and that it is for their safety. I have been to a few restaurants in Sandton and Parkhurst and have also had mixed experiences regarding this. I honestly can say that I felt a lot more comfortable with the restaurants that usually would have table cloths and flower arrangements on the tables that have removed these and have their cutlery in a sealed container (preferably biodegradable) because I know that the chance of these items being contaminated is less.

“There is no rule that states you have to remove the condiments of the tables. However, I do not see the purpose of leaving it on the table, if you need to sanitise it after each guest has used it. Guests will remove their masks while dining, and when speaking there will naturally be tiny particles of saliva that would be spread, thus we social distance. These particles would remain on the table, condiments etc for the next guest to touch.”

Erring on the side of caution should be the order of the day, and you can never go too far, said Van Heerden. “You should pride yourself on the measures you have put in place to keep your guests safe. Hygiene and safety has always been in the back of people’s minds and has now been brought to the forefront of people’s attention. Good hygiene and good safety only brings assurance to guests staying at your establishment, thus it is an added advantage of the experience. No guest would be able to fully relax on a beach vacation if they know that the necessary precautions have not been taken when it comes to the Covid pandemic, or safety in general.”

Van Heerden pointed out that travellers should prepare themselves for delays, and to be patient. “With all the regulations regarding temperature checking, contact tracing and additional sanitation there could be delays when it comes to entering the facilities, and checking into your room.”

Some larger hotel groups provide guests with a welcome “wellness” kit for personal use, and their luggage would also be sanitised on arrival before it is taken into the hotel.

High touch points, (lift buttons, hand railings etc.) would be sanitised multiple times a day, and more often than in the past, said Van Heerden, who is a Covid Compliance Officer, an extremely stressful job.

“You are solely responsible for everything in the facility. You need to ensure social distancing is taking place, and that all the relevant documentation is in place and recorded in accordance with legislation. It is the Covid Compliance Officer’s responsibility to ensure that any close contact cases and any positive cases are reported to the department of health.”

Although leaving a room vacant for 24 hours after checkout is not a regulation, it is recommended and “sensible”. I know I’d certainly feel happier knowing that buffer existed.

“The time can be used to deep clean and extensively sanitise the room before the next guest checks in. Some larger property groups are doing this as an added safety precaution,” said Van Heerden. Keys and key cards, door handles, telephones, TV and air conditioning remotes all need to be thoroughly cleaned. One would hope this was always standard practice.

Besides being aware of all these potential biohazards, you should also be looking out for who is wearing a mask – we’re talking restaurant or hotel staff here, not the average moron on the street.

“I was in a coffee shop a few weeks ago, and while waiting for my coffee the manager walked out from his office to address the barista with no mask on. Wearing a mask is a clear regulation,” said Van Heerden.

“Being an internationally trained chef myself I understand how challenging it can be to wear a mask in a hot, loud, and busy kitchen. This is a non-negotiable requirement for me. Thus, if you are dining in a restaurant with an open kitchen, pay close attention to what is happening in the kitchen.”

The Private Hotel School is part of the Independent Institute of Education (IIE) and ADvTECH Group and has been prepared for the return of its students. “We have done training with every single staff member and student that has returned to campus, and are extremely proud to say that we have no active positive Covid cases on our campuses,” said Van Heerden. “This is a direct reflection of the protocols that we have put in place, and how seriously we are taking the health and safety of our staff and students.”

Which goes to show, by exercising proper and effective prevention methods, transmission of the virus can be controlled within the hospitality environment, and we can all breathe a little easier. DM/TGIFood

393,https://www.pbmonthly.net/news/story/2020-09-28/pacific-beach-groups-take-clean-streets-and-sidewalks-into-their-own-hands,"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",pbmonthly.net,Pacific Beach groups take clean streets and sidewalks into their own hands,"The streets of Pacific Beach are getting some extra attention lately.

Efforts led by groups such as the Pacific Beach Town Council and Street Stewards are cleaning the streets and sidewalks of litter, stains, sticky gum residue and other eyesores.

The Town Council is tackling dirty sidewalks much like its weed abatement program trims overgrown vegetation on traffic medians throughout Pacific Beach.

Town Council President Brian White said the sidewalk cleanup project is long overdue.

“It’s something that has been talked about for decades really. Our sidewalks have been neglected for a very long time,” he said. “With years and decades worth of gum and grime on the sidewalks, our Town Council is stepping in to clean things up. Gum removal is a hot topic. When you have a lot of it on the sidewalks, it’s noticeable. People want to have clean sidewalks. It’s really just the basics. They make people happy.”

“Cleaning sidewalks isn’t normally in our lane as a Town Council,” he added. “But since the city isn’t delivering better services, we’re getting it done ourselves. Some of this gunk on the ground has been there for 10 or 20 years ... so removing it takes extra time. It’s a process; it doesn’t happen all at once.”

San Diego city spokesman Anthony Santacroce told PB Monthly that the city doesn’t provide sidewalk cleaning or power-washing services. According to City Council policy, maintenance and repair of sidewalk space is the responsibility of the adjacent property owners, he said.

“Typically, business improvement districts and community groups such those in Pacific Beach are formed in part to provide an enhanced level of service to community members — including sidewalk cleaning,” Santacroce said. “Any health hazard or safety issue regarding sidewalks can be reported to the city through the Get It Done system. However, cleaning and beautification services are left to the particular community to determine.”

The Town Council’s sidewalk power-washing program is funded through donations on its website. The service comes with added costs because it requires a skilled hand and specialized equipment.

“As people have been seeing the results, they’re encouraged, they love it, they’re donating because they want to help out,” White said. “We’re also going to businesses and property owners and saying, ‘Hey, we’re doing this, we’re trying to remove the gum; do you want to chip in?’”

A professional power washer (who happens to be a Pacific Beach resident) has been handling the Town Council projects and was referred by fellow business owners because he already does cleaning in front of area bars, banks and shops that want clean sidewalks to help attract more business.

But simply cleaning the sidewalks isn’t enough to achieve the desired results, White said. Maintaining the clean sidewalks is another important aspect. He said his group regularly advises businesses on how to do that.

The council has suggested things such as cleaning out trash cans and double-bagging trash so the bags don’t leak, thereby reducing drip lines that stain the sidewalk over and over again.

White said the idea of using volunteers and hand tools in certain areas for gum removal isn’t out of the question, but he isn’t sure how feasible it would be. More research is needed before going that route, he said.

“I’ll probably actually go out myself pretty soon and give it a test,” he said. “And then once I see and document how it works and how hard it is, if it works well, we’ll buy 20 of those tools — 20 scrapers, 20 wire brushes — and then say, ‘Hey y’all, whoever wants to come out … .’

“And then we’re dealing with a dirty sidewalk, right? ... That’s also a sanitation issue, so I don’t know, when you bring volunteers in, do you want to expose them to a very dirty ground? So I think we might have a power washer clean the sidewalk so that we’re not all working on dirty ground.

“These are things to work out, and I just need ideas on how we can do it. But I want to make sure that it’s safe for people to even be touching the ground.”

Removing gum is no easy feat. It involves different techniques, vendors and price points.

“There are a number of techniques for removing gum,” White said. “Power washing is one technique, and another technique that we’ve looked at is dry ice blasting.”

The latter uses pressurized dry ice to clean a surface. It’s considered effective for removing gum from sidewalks, but it isn’t cheap. While dry ice blasting doesn’t leave a residue, power washing can remove gum more cost-effectively, White said.

Santacroce offered a reminder that power-washing activities are subject to state, regional and city regulations, including that no water from the cleaning may enter the storm drain system, including the curb and gutter next to the sidewalk.

Another effort to clean up Pacific Beach is the Street Stewards program, started in 2018 by Ocean Beach resident Aaron Null.

Null, a graphic designer, came up with the idea of a volunteer-based adopt-a-street program. The idea started in OB, but he has led efforts to spread it to other San Diego neighborhoods, including Pacific Beach, Hillcrest, North Park, Point Loma and Normal Heights/Kensington, he said.

“The model has worked, so we’re just running with it,” Null said.

Null created community maps that enable people to choose streets they want to be responsible for cleaning on a weekly basis.

“I pick up [litter] in front of my house, but I saw all this energy on social media, these groups on Facebook, these people that are complaining,” he said. “There’s a lot of energy. There’s community spirit, but we didn’t really have a way to transfer that energy into something positive. So the idea of the map was to say, ‘OK, these are people who have signed up; are you going to do it?’ That social pressure really did kind of work out.”

Volunteers can use the Street Stewards neighborhood map for Pacific Beach to choose streets to clean up. (Courtesy)

“There’s a form for each neighborhood [on the group’s website]; you can select which neighborhood you’re in and then you can fill in which streets you’d like to take,” Null said. “And there’s a link to the full-resolution maps for each neighborhood so you can see where is open and where you might fit in.”

It’s all based on the honor system. “We don’t really check in or anything. We just bank that people are honest about it, and it kind of handles itself that way,” Null said.

He said he’s working on a Street Stewards app to help spread the mission.

Street Stewards attracts volunteers ranging from stay-at-home moms to young families who want to teach their children about community service, Null said.

In Pacific Beach, he directs volunteers to Don’t Trash PB, another grassroots group dedicated to cleaning up the streets.

Don’t Trash PB has a program in which, for $15, it will send cleaning supplies to volunteers, including a bucket and a grabber stick. Participants who send a photo of a bucket filled with trash will get $5 back. After three times, the tools are essentially free.

For White, the Town Council’s sidewalk cleaning won’t be considered a success unless it continues.

“People are literally donating to the cause. They want to see this, so if we can’t provide sustained cleanliness at a higher standard, then we’re not successful,” he said. “We have to do right by these community donations. ...

“It’s all pieces of a puzzle and they all need to come together, because it can’t just be us covering the cost ... for the indefinite future. It’s not sustainable. We’re putting in money, we’re getting these initial cleans in, the community is supporting with their portion of donations, some businesses are chipping in because they realize it’s a good cause. We need a combination of all of it to maintain it for the future, and costs will come down because maintenance cleanings will be less.”

Clean Energy For Eternity (CEFE) has provided solar panels to power the Kiah and Quaama fire sheds, with the aim of supporting the communities in both regions as well as the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS). With the $10,000 for the project coming from CEFE donations and the net earnings from the Tathra Community Solar Farm, two 3.3kilowatt solar panel systems have now been been installed at both fire sheds. READ ALSO: Shelter, water and sanitation prioritised as SJA hit the burnt roads CEFE project manager and secretary Prue Kelly said the panels will cover the sheds' power requirements under normal circumstances. ""We wanted to show our support for the Kiah community, which has been so badly affected [in summer's fires],"" she said. ""The people in Kiah are very depressed, they went through a heck of a lot. ""Quaama is a different story, as more attention has been given to the Cobargo region. ""I feel they are responding much better than poor Kiah."" The panels were provided to Quaama in June while those in Kiah were installed in September. Ms Kelly said earlier this year CEFE renewed its memorandum of understanding with Bega Valley Shire Council regarding the Tathra Community Solar Farm, adding a ""significant"" clause. The clause means the net savings from any installation on RFS shed or public building will go to CEFE to be channelled back to that particular brigade, which Ms Kelly said was ""very generous"" of council to do. She said Lakeside Electrical supplied the solar panels and installation at both Quaama and Kiah fire sheds.

Monaco’s population came together on 19 September to take part in World Cleanup Day, a worldwide waste collection event which aims to raise awareness about pollution. Prince Albert took part in the event, along with his two children.

They could be seen wandering through the winding streets of Monaco’s old town, looking for cigarette butts and other types of waste. True to his dedication to the environment, Prince Albert took part in the eco-walk event, accompanied by the twins Gabriella and Jacques.

210 kg of waste cleaned up in a single day

Plastic and glass bottles, face masks, cigarette butts, cans, cups… In a single day, volunteers throughout the principality collected over 210 kg worth of waste. Four initiatives were organised in and around Monaco: an eco-walk, and eco-run, an eco-hike…

In Monaco, World Cleanup Day was organised by Sébastien Uscher, member of the Stand Up for the Planet organisation, in partnership with Monaco’s townhall, Decathlon, The Energy Transition of the Principality of Monaco, Monaco’s sanitation body as well as Eco Angels, an initiative run by Stars’ N’Bars.

He made the disclosure while speaking to members of the media on the sidelines of the launch of the Lions Club of Barbados South’s Home Garden Project, which kicked off recently in his Christ Church West Central constituency.

According to the Minister, the preparatory work for the project has already started and he anticipates that in a few months’ time Barbadians should start seeing movement in the communities. With that in mind, he said the goal of the project will be to rid communities across the island of bulk waste, while also planting trees. He made the point while noting that the lead state agencies in this initiative will be the Sanitation Service Authority and the National Conservation Commission.

“...Every week we will ask residents to come on board, the communities to come on board, the community activists to come on board, the groups to come on board, because there must be a sense of altruism across Barbados; where in that one week in a community we ask persons to bring out all of their bulk material, all their waste... we collect that waste and at the same time we allow our tree planting department to come in and plant trees to green the community,” he explained.

Minister Forde’s comments came as he made it clear that the trees will not be planted willy-nilly, noting that the types of trees and greenery planted in particular areas must make sense.

His remarks came as he also said that through the Government’s thrust to plant more trees, will come an educational component to make persons aware of the best types of trees to plant, where to plant them and the soil treatments to be used.

“..Trees that require a lot of sunlight you would know the time of year to plant those trees, trees that are responsible for the removal of phosphates and nitrates from the soil, certain areas again you would plant those trees. Trees that absorb a lot of water and are able to use that water into food production, those are the trees you would plant in the rainy season,” he stated.

He added that through the Clean and Green Drive, the goal is to make the country more aesthetically pleasing and clean, while giving the people a sense of ownership, by carrying it out at the community level. Forde made the point while noting that his Ministry also wants to introduce community refuse hubs, such that where waste skips are placed in communities, those areas can be painted and beautified.

“We are taking away from those overfilled garbage skips as we know it and enclosing them with proper hubs... Barbados must change its appearance, that is the bottom line and we can only do that if every single person understands the importance of doing it,” he added.

The Minister added, “I am willing, ready and able to lead that charge because we must have Barbados as a beautiful country. It makes no sense having an iconic song called Beautiful Barbados and Barbados looking the way it does. Not acceptable”

Forde said his ministry will work to change the country’s appearance and he is urging Barbadians to “walk hand in glove” with him on that journey. (JRT)","Minister of Environment and National Beautification, Adrian Forde says his ministry will soon be commencing a ‘Clean and Green Drive’.

Patients at Raigad Dnyanpeeth Mulinche Vastigruh likened their stint to a nightmare; finally, with no rest in sight, 8 of them took to cleaning up the place by themselves

While any patient recovering from the novelinfection is ideally expected to spend most of their time resting, at a COVID-19 care centre in Bhor, the exact opposite is taking place.Inmates here have been forced to take brooms and mops into their own hands after the entire building has been left leaking in light of rains, and has consistently been in a state of appalling filth.Some 100 patients are admitted at thein Bhor. While some of them are asymptomatic cases, the rest have developed mild symptoms of the virus, likeand weakness.However, contrary to the restful sojourn expected to prevent their condition from worsening, many have likened their stay here to a nightmare. Sinks are overflowing with gunk, dust and sludge is everywhere, and no cleaning has been done for ages.For days now, amid ongoingshowers, they say that despite reaching out to the authorities several times about rainwater and leakages around the building, the patients finally gave up on hope of receiving any help. Instead, they formed a group of eight and cleaned up the entire building themselves.A 30-year-old corona-positive patient, who has been admitted to a ward here since the last five days, shared, “Getting admitted here is horrible. The floor is always wet due to water leaking and major drainage issues. We called out to staff for help multiple times but our pleas were always ignored. That is when we decided to take things into our hands. Eight of us decided to clean the entire ward.”He added, “There are children here who are also forced to live in this filth. At a time when a patient should be doing nothing apart from resting, we are cleaning the whole building because authorities aren’t interested in doing their work.”A 27-year old man, who tested positive around a week ago and is also at the CCC, echoed, “My father is a sanitation worker and had worked at this very centre for five months without any break. A contractor has been assigned this work, but they don’t do any cleaning. It is like a punishment for us. There is dirt all around us. The worst part is that on the first day here, we were not even given any bedding.”Apart from these worries, the patients have also complained that besides hot water given for bathing, staff do not provide patients with any other hot water for drinking or steam inhalation, which is advised to COVID-19 patients. They further stressed that their drinking water bottles are filled only in the morning — once that gets consumed, they do not get a refill immediately and have to keep begging for something as basic as drinking water.Speaking on the case, Bhor tehsildar Ajit Patil said, “I will check the conditions there personally. Our staff have been given strict instructions to keep the place clean. I will also check with the contractor and follow up on the work done from his side.”","Instead, they formed a group of eight and cleaned up the entire building themselves.A 30-year-old corona-positive patient, who has been admitted to a ward here since the last five days, shared, “Getting admitted here is horrible.

Clean drinking water is a basic human right, yet more than 2 billion people globally lack access to safely managed water sources. The United Nations urges all countries to make clean water access universal. You can join us in taking access on this issue here

There’s water for cooking, cleaning, and household chores, and then there’s bottled water for drinking. The Indigneous Binta’t Karis people in the Palawan province of the Philippines — like billions of others worldwide — had to follow this rule because local water supplies would make them sick if they drank from them.

These days, however, the community has an abundant and renewable source of crystal clean drinking water. That’s because Source Global (formerly Zero Mass Water) partnered with Conservation International earlier this year to install hydropanels — atmospheric water generators that rely on solar energy — near the local school to generate clean drinking water for years to come.

The project is a marvel of engineering and sustainable development that provides a roadmap for empowering communities in an increasingly water-stressed world.

“We see huge potential for us and other technologies to reframe the way we look at water solutions in remote communities,” Rob Bartrop, chief revenue officer at Source Global, told Global Citizen. “One being places that don’t have access to water pipes. Two being places that do have access to pipes but don’t necessarily have quality or resilient water to flow through those pipes. And three, to replace the half a trillion plastic bottles used to provide water to communities.”

Remote Communities

The Binta’t Karis project is a case study in the advantages of hydropanels.

Located deep in the mountains of the island of Palawan, the Binta’t Karis people have faced many challenges to water access.

Because they’re hundreds of miles away from the nearest major city, they had no access to government water supplies and the cost of installing traditional water systems in the small community didn’t make sense financially.

As a result, people had to either buy bottled water, which has led to a growing plastic pollution crisis, or collect it from a local river in heavy containers, which could lead to waterborne illnesses if consumed.

Around 80% of illnesses in developing countries are linked to poor water and sanitation. Throughout the Binta’t Karis community, waterborne illness was a regular problem and particularly affected children and immuno-compromised populations.

When Conservation International reached out to Source Global to collaborate on a new project, it suggested the Binta’s Karis community in Palawan and noted that the school would be a particularly good spot for an installation.

But when the project was scheduled to proceed, the COVID-19 pandemic intervened.

“We then faced the challenge of installing this project through a local and national lockdown in the Philippines,” Bartrop said. “We were able to use local installation labor and partners in the Philippines and Palawan to do this remotely.

“We shipped the goods from the US but we were able to use fully local installation teams,” he added. “That allowed us to navigate the COVID problem and provided long-term employment opportunities.”

Now that the project is installed, Bartrop said, it’s become an essential part of the community. The panels produce more than 40,000 liters of clean water every month, which is roughly 40 20-packs of water bottles every day. Over the course of the project’s lifetime, 2 million water bottles will be averted. For a small community, this new supply of water largely covers the demand, quenching thirst and fueling good health.

“They love the taste of the water,” he said. “They already see the value both from everyday life and also conservation from the plastic offset perspective.”

How Hydropanels Work

Source Global Hydropanels look like solar panels, but they're really atmospheric water generators.

The panels harvest the sun’s energy to power fans that pull moisture from the air. This water vapor is then gathered into a reservoir of clean water held within the panel, and then minerals are added for taste. Water is then transported for easy consumption.

The panels are able to generate water in even the driest conditions in the world.

Source is currently installing hydropanels throughout Navajo Nation in the Southwestern United States, for example, where tens of thousands of families lack access to clean water and drilling for new wells is an arduous and fraught process because so much of the groundwater throughout the reservation is contaminated.

More Than Clean Water

The benefits of clean water are immediately apparent in the Binta’t Karis community.

Waterborne illnesses are down, Bartrop said, so people are more healthy on average. As a result, people are more likely to attend school and go to work.

For children, protection from waterborne illnesses means they no longer have to worry about falling behind in school. Globally, children living in rural areas often fall behind their peers in urban areas because of issues like lack of access to water, electricity, and transportation to school. These disparities have increased amid the COVID-19 crisis as schools shut down and families have to engage in remote learning. By expanding access to clean water, the urban to rural education gap can partly close.

The gender gap around water is also able to close. In communities around the world, including among the Binta’t Karis, girls and women are usually tasked with fetching water, which can take up hours of their day and prevent them from going to school or engaging in economic enterprises.

Finally, the new source of drinking water cuts down on water bottle use, which saves people money and limits pollution. Globally, plastic pollution has heavily contaminated land and marine environments, threatening the future viability of entire ecosystems. The Philippines faces especially severe plastic pollution and conservation efforts in Palawan have been threatened by plastic waste.

“So by removing [these obstacles] we’re not only freeing up more time for people to learn and work and do things that they choose to do, but we’re also protecting the cornerstone of their community which is this fantastic landscape,” Bartrop said.

The Future of Water

Mobile phones have helped rural and developing communities leapfrog, or skip, the installation of massive telephone lines and accompanying telecommunications infrastructure. Solar panels have helped these communities leapfrog centralized energy grids that rely on destructive fossil fuels.

Now hydropanels could help communities leapfrog costly and often unreliable water pipeline systems, according to Bartrop.

Decentralized and easy-to-install clean water solutions will play an increasingly vital role for countries facing the prospect of a growing water crisis.

Already, 2.2 billion people do not have access to safely managed drinking water sources.

The United Nations warns that water scarcity could affect 5.7 billion people by 2050 as climate change causes extreme droughts, pollution contaminates existing water supplies, and mismanagement of water supplies dries up rivers and reservoirs.

Various cities aroud the world, including Cape Town and São Paulo, have had to impose water lockdowns in recent years to preserve rapidly dwindling water supplies.

This growing water crisis has led to a surge in bottled water consumption that in turns leads to plastic pollution.

Hydropanels could theoretically be installed in communities around the world, providing people with a guaranteed source of clean water, while also minimizing plastic pollution.

“We can compliment rainwater and well water and provide high quality, climate-proof drinking water at the household level that saves money, plastic, and allows people to go about their lives and work without stressing about water daily,” Bartrop said.","The United Nations urges all countries to make clean water access universal.

PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--One in nine people around the world currently lack access to clean water. As communities grapple with the impacts of climate change, economic recessions and public health crises, the need for access to clean, safe water is more crucial than ever. On the sixth annual Imagine a Day Without Water, Ecolab is announcing a partnership with Water.org to help enable access to sustainable water and improved sanitation in at-risk watersheds in India.

Water.org, an organization co-founded by Matt Damon and Gary White, leverages a scalable, microfinance-based model that has mobilized billions in capital to support small loans that bring access to safe water and sanitation to millions of people in need. The Water.org partnership will contribute to Ecolab’s recently announced 2030 Impact Goals, which include having a positive water impact in at-risk watersheds where Ecolab operates. Ecolab is also a co-founding member of the Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative of the United Nations Global Compact’s CEO Water Mandate, which calls for industry leaders to set similar goals.

“Our work with the Water Resilience Coalition ultimately focuses on improving the availability, quality and accessibility of water for all,” said Meredith Englund, vice president of water partnerships at Ecolab. “This partnership with Water.org is one tangible way we are taking action to help build community and economic resilience and equitable access to freshwater.”

Ecolab’s contribution to Water.org aims to enable access to sustainable drinking water and improved sanitation for 100,000 people living in poverty in India, while contributing more than 26.4 million gallons of water per year to watershed health in extremely high-stress river basins in which Ecolab operates, including Chennai, Mumbai, Konnagar, Delhi, Baroda, Jamshedpur, Kolkata and Pune.

“Access to clean water and sanitation is still not a reality for hundreds of millions of people in India,” said Vishal Sharma, senior vice president of the India, Middle East & Africa markets for Ecolab. “The need is immense across the country. It’s important for us to play a role driving water and sanitation solutions not only for industry but in the surrounding communities to ensure greater water resilience for India.”

The partnership has three objectives:

Social responsibility: Supporting communities, families and workers living in areas where Ecolab operates in India.

Accessibility: Providing equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene solutions to people living in poverty.

Quantity: Enabling positive recurring water benefits in high-stress basins and watersheds.

“Access to safe water and sanitation is critical to the health and well-being of families around the world,” said Jennifer Schorsch, president of Water.org. “Ecolab’s partnership comes at a time when health and hygiene are top-of-mind and their support will provide lasting solutions to build more resilient communities in India.”

‘Clean water for all by 2025’

Wateraid Cambodia’s country director Chat Sophiep said about 72 per cent of Cambodians have access to clean water and sanitation, while about 28 per cent still do not have access to clean water.

Meanwhile, officials have put in place a plan to ensure every Cambodian has access to clean water by 2025.

This statement was made during a dialogue on Tuesday initiated by WaterAid with the Club of Cambodian Journalists (CCJ) which was attended by officials from the Ministry of Rural Development and relevant institutions. The purpose of the meeting was to share information about the rural water and sanitation sector in Cambodia.

Sophiep said the government and civil society organisations needed to cooperate to find a solution soon.

“A lack of clean water and sanitation is a barrier to the development of our country on the whole because this problem is related to the public health of our people. The World Bank has found that our people lose millions of dollars a year in healthcare costs,” Sophiep said.

Sophiep added that in order to achieve the planned goals, stakeholders need to establish mechanisms for creating conditions for clean water supplies and sustainable sanitation in rural areas. They also need to increase funding for the water supply and rural sanitation, increase water supply services and encourage people to change their attitudes about water and sanitation.

Rural development ministry secretary of state Chhrun Therawart said at the meeting that rural sanitation is a task that requires the participation of all stakeholders, especially the media, to change the people’s attitudes.

He said the cooperation of the media is very important because this work needs to be completed by 2025.

“Currently, we still have some challenges, such as poverty, and the poor are lacking the ability to connect to clean water services. We need to provide them with access to clean water. Another factor is that indigenous people also have problems. They live in isolation, so it’s difficult to connect them to a clean water system,” he said.

CCJ president Pen Bona urging the media to share information on the clean water issue.

“We are meeting today to share information about the situation of rural water and sanitation in Cambodia and to call on the media to disseminate information about this topic. We want to encourage our people to change their attitudes towards the use of clean water and sanitation in line with the government’s national development policy on water and sanitation,” he said.

WaterAid Cambodia issued a press release during the 73rd World Health Assembly in May saying the poorest people around the world were facing Covid-19 alone without access to the most basic protection, such as clean water and soap.

Health facilities are most likely to be spreaders of the disease, putting the lives of doctors, nurses and midwives at risk while saving patients’ lives. The organisation has supported the government in disseminating and promoting the practice of hand hygiene and other protective measures. But there is also a concern that more than three million Cambodians are lacking clean water and soap in their homes.","Hean Rangsey‘Clean water for all by 2025’Wateraid Cambodia’s country director Chat Sophiep said about 72 per cent of Cambodians have access to clean water and sanitation, while about 28 per cent still do not have access to clean water.

Aden, Yemen – The people of Aden have been experiencing chronic water shortages, in part due to their reliance on aged and damaged water pumps in local wells. Submersible engine-pumps are expected to improve access to clean water for almost 1.1 million Yemenis living in the port-city of Aden, in the country’s south.

The United Nations Development Programmed (UNDP), in partnership with the Public Works Project (PWP), and with generous funding from the Government of Japan, delivered 12 submersible engine-pumps to the Local Water and Sanitary Corporation (LWSC) in August, which have since helped to re-operationalise 12 existing wells.

“The provision of engine-pumps, including their cables and control panels, to re-operationalise wells in the Bir Nasser and Bir Ahmed water fields, will increase the water supply by 20,000 cubic metres of drinking water daily, and alleviate pressure on the existing infrastructure,” said Mr. Fathi Assaqaf, Head of LWSC in Aden.

The new engine-pumps replaced older units between two to five years old and will work constantly to supply clean water to the local residents and businesses relying on these wells for their daily subsistence.

“Access to clean water is a basic human right. People cannot enjoy a stable, healthy, and decent life without water. With the Government of Japan support, Aden’s water supply will greatly improve. This is especially critical at this time with the added pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic to improve hygiene and stop the spread of the virus,” remarked UNDP Head of Sub-Office in Aden, Salma El Hag Yousif.

The World Health Organisation has estimated that access to clean and safe water and sanitation could reduce the global disease burden by almost 10 per cent, but many remote Australian communities still lack access to it.

Project Gilghi, the brainchild of global engineering firm Aurecon and New South Wales Hunter-based electrical engineering company Ampcontrol, aims to change that. In the process, the project has been awarded an Australian Engineering Excellence Award, and is a finalist in next month’s national Sir William Hudson Awards.

“Gilghi represents a breakthrough, innovative, solar-powered water purifying system solution,” said Julian Briggs, Design Director, Water and Waste Water Treatment at Aurecon.

“The project provides a roadmap for how Australia and other countries can meet the ambitious target of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 6 — to provide safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030.”

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, more than 48,000 Indigenous Australians in 694 locations nationwide rely on groundwater for their water supply. But the groundwater in arid areas can contain high concentrations of elements such as uranium. Lack of access to clean water also contributes to high prevalence of diseases such as trachoma.

The project also looks to solve other issues, Briggs said, such as the energy intensity of water treatment — which accounts for 13 per cent of the nation’s electricity use — and the expense of transporting clean water to remote communities.

“It was realised that the change in rate of technology has not been matched by a change in the way developments have been implemented in the water sector,” he explained.

“This presented an opportunity to capitalise on renewable power opportunities by comparing the levelised cost of electricity versus unvalued capital in the power grid system.”

How it works

The Gilghi system is designed to take feed water from a range of sources including bores, streams and brackish and saltwater.

The water is stored in an inlet tank before it is passed through three stages of treatment, including sand and carbon media filtration, a reverse osmosis (RO) unit comprised of cartridge filters, pressure booster pump and RO membranes, and finally an outlet tank and UV disinfection system.

Once treated, the water is transferred to a storage tank and made available for consumption. In terms of waste stream processing, an evaporation pond is built to treat the brine from the RO process.

“Traditionally, water treatment systems operate continuously, whereas Gilghi’s innovative design makes smart use of available solar power to run the plant and charge the batteries during the day,” Briggs said.","Remote communities across Australia have a new option for affordable and continuous potable water, thanks to Project Gilghi, a self-sufficient, sustainable water treatment plant in a container.

By | Published: 1:19 pm 10:34 pm

Hyderabad: With the rains taking a break on Thursday, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao directed officials to take up extensive sanitation works, ensure provision of safe drinking water, food and initiate all measures for prevention of communicable diseases.

Continuing his inspections in rain-affected areas in the city for the second consecutive day, the Minister interacted with residents and assured them of all help and support.

With water levels slowly receding in several colonies, the GHMC was directed to take up sanitation works and ensure there was no spread of vector-borne and communicable diseases. On the sidelines of his inspection in the rain-affected areas of Nallakunta, Musheerabad, Amberpet and Tolichowki, the Minister instructed HMWSSB to increase testing of water samples and to also distribute chlorine tablets.

He appealed to the residents to be alert and cautious and consume only boiled water as a precautionary measure. He directed the officials and elected public representatives to shift residents in low-lying areas to shelter homes and arrange blankets, food and milk packets. Rao also instructed GHMC Commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar to submit proposals on setting up of drainage pipelines and sewer systems in a few areas as a means to ensure a permanent solution to avoid flooding in the future.

Earlier in the day, the Minister along with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar reviewed the rescue and relief measures being taken up in the city in view of the rains. In colonies where the situation is under control and rainwater level receded, he directed health officials to extend medical treatment at community halls using ‘104’ ambulances. To this effect, instructions were issued to the health department to deploy health and paramedical staff as required.

Officials said 50,000 food packets were distributed in different colonies. On Thursday, arrangements were made for the distribution of Rs 5 meals from Annapurna canteens and free food packs in the required areas. To estimate the losses suffered due to rains, all the departments were directed to work in coordination with GHMC and submit a report at the earliest. For taking up preliminary repair works at the lakes, the GHMC was directed to work in coordination with the Irrigation department.

Apart from Hyderabad, the Minister wanted a detailed report on the calamity in the districts and on the losses suffered. MA&UD Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar was asked to submit a report on this.

The day, organized by the Global Handwashing Partnership, is celebrated each year on Oct. 15 and is dedicated to increasing awareness of the importance of hand-washing with soap.

The 2020 Global Handwashing Day theme is “Hand Hygiene for All” and focuses on the recent global initiative calling on all to scale up hand hygiene, especially through hand-washing with soap. This has been especially important in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the World Health Organization, millions of young lives could be saved with access to bar soap and hygiene education. Pneumonia and diarrheal disease are two of the leading causes of death among children under 5 years old. Most are from populations in developing countries who live in extreme poverty. Having access to clean water and soap is one of the best preventive measures.

Working and living in the communities they serve, Salesian missionaries are perfectly positioned to ensure that soap and other hygiene items reach those who need it most. Accompanying education ensures that recipients learn the importance of proper hygiene for good health. Operating primary schools, technical training centers, agricultural schools, youth centers, orphanages and programs for street children, Salesian missionaries are on the front lines assessing what youth and their families need most.

“Clean, safe water, access to soap, and programs teaching about good hygiene, like proper hand-washing, are important now more than ever,” said Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions. “Improving water and sanitation, as well as providing donated soap, brings a sense of dignity to children and ensures that teachers and students are working and learning in an environment that promotes proper hygiene and has safe drinking water. This reduces the number of waterborne illnesses that can affect those in our schools, keeping them away from important study time.”

To mark Global Handwashing Day, Salesian Missions is proud to highlight programs that ensure youth have access to clean water and soap, as well as hygiene education.

BURUNDI

The Salesian Parish in Rukago, Burundi, has access to hand-washing stations thanks to funding from Salesian Missions. This project, which benefited 65,000 people in the parish and local community, provided hand-washing stations in eight churches, 15 schools and the Don Bosco Oratory.

“Installing hand-washing stations in front of churches, offices, schools and playgrounds is an effective means of fighting the coronavirus pandemic while giving the local population the hope of living,” said Father Raphaël Katanga, economer of the Salesian Community in Rukago. “With the funding, we have also supported some vulnerable families from a local indigenous group, who were at risk of facing food shortage due to the limited circulation of goods and people.”

ETHIOPIA

The Don Bosco Center in Mekanissa, an area on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is supplying water to thousands of poor people living in the slums of Koshe and Kore. The Salesian community, with the help of the Planning and Development Office, repaired an old truck and a reservoir tank that has a capacity of 5,000 liters. Water is transported to the area every day so people can wash their hands.

The Don Bosco Center had been serving the local area before the virus by providing education, nutrition and health services to 400 poor youth. Most of the youth, aged 2-15, are street children who have no place else to live or anyone to take care of them. Brother Donato Galetta, a Salesian missionary, has been welcoming these youth for 30 years.

INDIA

Don Bosco School Mebo, in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, has clean water access thanks to funding received by the Salesian Missions “Clean Water Initiative,” which enabled it to build underground water tanks to harvest rainwater. Two of the three tanks have been constructed with the third delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The water tanks have been completed at the school and near the boys’ hostel. A final tank will be built near the girls’ hostel.

Don Bosco School Mebo provides education for 120 boys and 100 girls ages 5-15. There are 125 students who board at the school, along with 12 teachers. Most of the children attending the school come from poor families in the region.

The school needed its own water supply since there are no water sources supplied by the local government. Students and teachers had to use the river for bathing and washing clothes. The water was not safe, and there was a drowning risk for students. Drinking water was collected in small tanks that were not enough to supply the school. The new water tanks will provide clean water access for drinking, bathing and washing clothing, decreasing risk of waterborne illness for staff and students.

MALI

Hand-washing stations have been installed in Salesian educational centers in Bamako, Sikasso and Touba, Mali, where educational activities have resumed. Salesian missionaries are well aware of the risks Mali faces during the pandemic, and they are working to protect and support youth and the most vulnerable families in their programs and communities.

Creating a culture of personal hygiene and careful hand-washing is one of the most important prevention measures. Father Romeo Salami, from the Salesian Planning and Development Office of the West Africa Province, is working to ensure local programs have what they need to provide a safe environment for youth. He also wishes to thank all of the people who collaborated in the “Faced with the pandemic, Global Solidarity” project, which raised funds to help these efforts.

“The installation of hand-washing devices in our vocational training centers in Bamako, Sikasso and Touba guarantees the continued education of the most vulnerable,” explained Fr. Salami.

PHOTO: EXPRESS

The Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) government on Thursday signed an agreement of partnership with Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH) Pakistan to conduct a study for provision of drinking water to central Hunza where people have been hit hard by recently following floods in Hassanabad and Ultar Nullahs.

“The study will be conducted for sustainable solution of drinking water supply for central Hunza sourced from Attabad lake,” an official privy to the development said.

”The feasibility will include Hazard Vulnerability and Risk Assessments of the supply line and eight settlements of Hunza,” he said referring to areas including Faizabad, Altit, Karimabad, Ganish, Garelth, Haiderabad, Dorkhand and Aliabad.

Central Hunza faces acute water shortage as most settlements depend on two glacial melt streams (Hassanabad Nallah and Ultar Nallah) as their primary source of water. The recent glacial lake outburst floods from both glaciers have severely impacted water supply and other community infrastructure.

Growth in tourism to the area, critical for economic development, adds further pressure on the region’s water resources. Using its rich experience around the design and implementation of water supply systems in mountain areas combined with its hazard risk assessment and overall habitat planning expertise the AKAH will provide technical support to the government on this highly important study.

Addressing on the occasion, Deputy Commissioner Hunza Fayaz Ahmed hoped that the partnership with the AKAH will enable district administration to provide sustainable access to clean drinking water to 5,500 households, commercial entities, health and education facilities from eight settlements of central Hunza.

This feasibility study will not only identify solutions for the current needs of the community but also help boost tourism potential of the area in the years to come.

In his remarks, Nawab Ali Khan, chief executive officer, Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, Pakistan said, “The AKAH has the mandate of creating resilient human habitats and we will support any initiative that is aligned with our mandate.” The AKAH is thankful to the government for all its support that has enabled us to serve communities in need, he added.

Over the last two decades, the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, Pakistan has provided 500,000 people with water and sanitation facilities across the country mainly in mountain communities. This has resulted not only in reducing waterborne diseases, but also improved health and economic conditions as well as reduced the burden on women and girls of fetching water from long distances.","Over the last two decades, the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, Pakistan has provided 500,000 people with water and sanitation facilities across Pakistan mainly in mountain communities.

For the first time, a large part of the aid convoy is made up of medical supplies to help overcome the COVID crisis. On 15 October 2020, the twelfth convoy organised by Swiss Humanitarian Aid, comprising 19 trucks, reached the Donetsk region.

The pandemic is continuing to restrict people’s movements in the war-torn region of eastern Ukraine and make life difficult on both sides of the contact line. There are still shortages of key goods, such as chemicals and equipment to provide clean drinking water as well as personal protective equipment and medical supplies. On 15 October, the twelfth aid convoy organised by Swiss Humanitarian Aid (SHA) crossed the contact line and arrived in the city of Donetsk. The supplies are destined for both sides of the contact line in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

The convoy started in Mariupol on the Black Sea and is made up of 19 trucks which contain 300 tonnes of aluminium sulphate and 15 electrolysis machines. These are able to produce enough hyperchloride, which is a substitute for the chlorine previously used, to disinfect water for approximately 500,000 people. Around four million people on both sides of the contact line rely on the drinking water produced by the Voda Donbasu water utility and its auxiliary plants. Switzerland has provided considerable assistance to the utility since 2015.

Three of the trucks contain medical supplies and equipment destined for nine hospitals located on both sides of the contact line. This is the first aid convoy to provide supplies to be used in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, such as protective wear, 46,000 test kits, masks and contactless thermometers. There is a real need for these supplies, particularly in hospitals; around twenty per cent of those infected with COVID-19 in eastern Ukraine are medical workers.

The overall cost of the aid convoy is 3.5 million francs and it is being monitored by four staff from Swiss Humanitarian Aid and its pool of specialists (SHA). The twelfth convoy was particularly difficult to organise because only one crossing point is open due to the quarantine measures in place in the region and the widespread steppe fires.

It is a project to improve the well-being of women and children through the construction of dry toilet blocks in the city’s busiest markets. Also known as compost toilets, dry toilets are sanitary facilities that do not use water to flush faeces. It is therefore possible to recover excreta to produce biogas or organic fertilizers.

The Stay Clean dry toilet project in Kinshasa is a response to the glaring lack of sanitation facilities in the city of 14.5 million inhabitants. According to UNICEF, only 29% of the population has access to improved sanitation facilities. Yet access to adequate sanitation and hygiene conditions helps to prevent multiple water-borne diseases, such as cholera, the epidemic that will cause nearly 900 deaths in this Central African country in 2018.

Dry toilets have many environmental benefits

The dry toilet announcement in Kinshasa was made on October 1, 2020, by the managers of Stay Clean, who had just received training in Switzerland from the Fédération vaudoise de coopération (Fedevaco) on project management and monitoring. This was the motivation behind the launch of a project whose feasibility study has been underway since 2017. “In the planning of our actions, we will have to sensitise thousands of vendors in the three major markets of Kinshasa. This project will strengthen the dignity of women in the markets, while providing them with training on how to respect the gestures of barriers, management and maintenance of our toilet blocks,” says Limangi Barocheli, project manager at Stay Clean. In its perspectives, the association plans to develop a vast network of autonomous, affordable solar-powered toilets covering the 24 communes of the city of Kinshasa.

Already popularised in some European countries, notably Sweden, long before the Second World War, dry toilets, in addition to being a source of biogas and organic fertilisers, have other ecological advantages. They save water, unlike ordinary toilets, which consume three to twelve litres of water each time they are used. The use of dry toilets also simplifies water treatment in sewage treatment plants, as the bacteria and chemicals in excreta require longer treatment to be as harmless as grey water (washing water).

CONTEXT

The current humanitarian situation in Al-Baidha governorate combined with pre-existing culturally-inspired negative attitudes and practices are major constraints facing communities in adopting positive hygiene practices, especially for children and women. Lack of accurate information and appropriate knowledge among conflict-affected communities has also impacted these negative behaviors and practices.

Efforts of the Community Volunteers and Youth continued effortlessly to conduct awareness raising sessions and encourage community members to adopt preventative practices against Cholera and Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD)

Rada’a District Hospital

Rada’a Hospital is the main hospital in the district providing health care services to residents in the city and its neighboring areas.

RRD’s Community Volunteers were in shock to witness the amount of waste accumulated around the Hospital. This according to them only indicates that the hospital may just be another repository for airborne disease instead of being the safe haven it was expected to be.

Community Volunteers decided to take action into their own hands once they saw the unbearable situation of the Central Hospital in Rada’a regardless that their efforts were aimed at raising awareness in the district.

“I was honestly surprised to see that a forklift and a truck were readily available at the hospital on the day we decided to conduct the cleanup campaign”, said Community Volunteer, Yahya Nassiri.

RRD received great gratitude from the Hospital’s staff in appreciation of the efforts made. The most important outcome of this activity was the change Community Volunteers were able to make.

People are now well aware that removal of waste is not impossible, in fact, it only needs their efforts and coordination with local authorities to regularly carry out such activities.

They contacted offices of local authorities in the district to help and received positive response and encouragement particularly from representatives of the Local Council, Office of the National Authority for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Recovery (NAMCHA), Cleaning Fund, and the Local Corporation Water Supply and Sanitation in the district.

While support and encouragement were evident in their response, CVs did not expect that members of the local authority would take them seriously and step out of their way to support their efforts.

Local authority representatives decided to support the Community Volunteers in their efforts and an unexpectedly large clean-up campaign targeted the main hospital in the district.

This activity was the first in a series of such wonderful clean-up campaign activities conducted in Rada district and the efforts will continue until all neighborhoods, private and public establishments are reached.","Rada’a Hospital Clean-up CampaignProject: Communication for Cholera Prevention and ControlDonor: UNICEFSector: Communications for Development C4DCrossing Sectors: WASH, HealthTarget Area: Rada’a District, Al-Baidha GovernorateCONTEXTThe current humanitarian situation in Al-Baidha governorate combined with pre-existing culturally-inspired negative attitudes and practices are major constraints facing communities in adopting positive hygiene practices, especially for children and women.

This makes it crucial to revisit the goals of India’s ambitious Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission, or SBM) that came to a close almost exactly a year ago. While there were substantial improvements made in toilet coverage, a lack of data clarity muddies an understanding of exactly how large these improvements were across the country. According to government estimates, national sanitation coverage was 51% in 2014 when SBM began and reached 78% in 2018, less than a year prior to the end of the program. While this certainly shows progress — the national average was just under 26% in 1999 — no one would think to take these numbers and simply round up to 100%.

But at the close of the SBM last fall, this is exactly what Prime Minister Narendra Modi did. Speaking to a crowd, Modi proclaimed that India was now completely open defecation free (ODF), with sanitation coverage reported by the SBM portal as 100% in rural areas and, inexplicably, 105% in urban areas. From the start of the 2014 campaign, the central government maintained that in just five short years, India would be ODF. Despite the gains made, a singular focus on meeting steep targets in a very short amount of time seems to have put Modi in a tight spot by the time October 2019 rolled around.

Caste Politics Overshadow Sanitation Issues in India

READ MORE

The gaps have been, at times, glaring. News reports from established outlets all over the country reported open defecation in areas that were already recorded as ODF. A 2018 study by the Rice Institute estimated an open defecation rate of 44%, meaning nearly half of the sampled population was still engaging in the practice hardly a year before SBM ended. In urban areas the picture looks a bit better: 95% of urban households access an improved toilet. But this includes community toilets, which may be used by hundreds of other families and are often plagued with maintenance, hygiene and safety issues. Furthermore, one survey from 18 states identified over 48,000 manual scavengers still cleaning “dry” toilets which do not discharge into sewer lines.

Social Pressure-Cooker

What explains these inconsistencies? The use of shame-based tactics to stop open defecation, alongside a rush to meet ODF goals, have built up a pressure-cooker environment. The SBM has continued prior national efforts that deemphasized technical solutions and focused heavily on strategies to encourage behavior change at the local level. One such strategy is Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), which hinges on “triggering” disgust and extreme emotions among community members to spur the abandonment of open defecation. Despite some concerns about shame-based approaches, the SBM continued with the CLTS Foundation and others as implementation partners.

But open defecation is an issue that needs more than short-term emotional reactions. The longstanding practice is mired in cultural tradition, casteist taboos and environmental factors, among others. Some reasons people give for it is that they do not wish to empty a pit themselves, that it is considered more hygienic to defecate further away from the home — certainly reasonable considering how few poor Indian homes have running water — or that community toilets are dirty and unsafe, so squatting in a quiet area nearby is actually preferable.

In the SBM environment, people who have not built a toilet, for whatever reason, are highly likely to experience retaliation for continuing to defecate in the open. Because Indian culture is quite collective — the actions of one person are seen to have radiating effects on the family and community — sometimes social pressure can play a role in nudging behavior change. However, this is a slippery slope. In India’s highly unequal society, characterized by stark gender and caste-based hierarchies amidst a wide array of languages and ethnicities, such strategies have the potential to be misused, with large social costs.

There is ample evidence to show this. In June 2017, Zafar Hussein, a local community leader agitating against the eviction of his settlement in Rajasthan, was allegedly beaten to death by local officials for trying to stop officials from taking photographs of women defecating in the open. His death was reported by multiple outlets. In other areas of Maharashtra, people have been followed by a loud band, jailed or fined for defecating in the open.

Walls of shame have been instituted by local village councils onto which the names and photographs of people defecating openly are be pasted. These individuals were often removed from eligibility for local government programs. The previously mentioned Rice Institute study also recorded coercion and threats of the loss of government rations as a way to bring down open defecation rates. Notably, the study found that Dalits and Adivasis were the most likely to face such behaviors. India’s Health Ministry has publicly denounced the results of the Rice survey. But in September last year, weeks before Modi’s ODF declaration, two young Dalit children were beaten to death in their village in Madhya Pradesh for defecating in the open.

Numbers, Strategies and Health Equity

These debates over sanitation data are not merely academic exercises. They have real, material impacts on people. In some ways, the above tragedies are not surprising. If a hasty approach is taken toward declaring areas ODF, it follows that any activity hinting that this claim is not matched by reality will be quashed. Despite this, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation bestowed the Global Goalkeeper Award upon Modi last year. It is surprising that one of the largest, most influential health organizations in the world, committed to facts and data, accepted without question the Indian prime minister’s claims, failing to consider all the evidence to the contrary.

So what is the solution? Certainly, the answer is not to give up on sanitation programming as the need remains great. There are several organizations on the ground that have successfully integrated mobilization with communities, technical expertise and a sustained presence through which people are not merely pressured to stop a practice but meaningfully guided toward an alternative and given the facts and tools to integrate that alternative into their lives.

However, this takes a more long-term presence, a less single-minded focus on quick targets, a commitment toward waste management infrastructure besides just toilets, and a willingness to meet people where they are. Further, the same people who have fallen through the gaps in the SBM are those with a lot to lose during the current pandemic: the rural poor, slum-dwellers, sanitation workers, manual laborers and migrants. Brutal crackdowns against those who kept working amidst India’s COVID-19 lockdown illustrate that retaliation cannot continue to be a solution when reality does not match the official word. Amidst the pandemic, sanitation infrastructure and the transparency of data surrounding it are necessities that cannot afford to wait.

HappyTap Brings Clean Hands Technology to Combat Covid in North Tyneside School

A businesswoman, executive advisor and coach who spent 30 years living and working in Japan has returned to the UK and brought with her a cost effective yet simple idea to keep children safe against Covid in North East schools.

Vikki Bolam who runs Tynemouth based Red Zebra Consulting spent three decades working abroad as a senior executive and management consultant advising Japanese firms with multibillion-dollar turnovers.

One of her roles focused on creating the corporate brand for a newly created multibillion-dollar Japanese company which was a market leader in sanitary ware. The company was interested in developing a social impact legacy and in a world where only one in three people have a hygienic toilet, supporting the WaSH sector (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) in underserved communities globally made instant sense.

This experience was the impetus for Vikki dedicating her future career to supporting social enterprises increase their impact, particularly in the hygiene sector. After leaving Japan in 2018, she joined the boards of two exciting social enterprises, a portable toilet company in Ghana (Clean Team Ghana) and a waste processing technology in the U.K. (Wase Ltd.), and became an executive advisor and coach to others including HappyTap based in Cambodia.

HappyTap produces the world’s first affordable, portable sink and water storage tank designed to encourage handwashing behaviours amongst children in challenging environments; it features a brightly coloured base with fun decals, and a tap designed for small hands. It is sold commercially for use in homes and thousands have been bought by aid agencies for distribution across the world for schools and health facilities.

As COVID took hold in the U.K. and the government emphasised handwashing was key to preventing the spread of the disease, Vikki realized HappyTap could support schools in the UK struggling to provide enough handwashing facilities to adhere to government guidelines.

“Covid has been an enormous leveller; it is wreaking havoc across the world regardless of location or wealth. HappyTap was borne from the need to improve hygiene in challenging environments where deadly infectious diseases are rife. Hence the development of a robust, affordable, portable sink designed specifically to develop good handwashing habits in children. It’s also a great example of reverse innovation; how a product adapted for use in another part of the world can be usefully introduced and, in this case, be used to protect our own school children, “said Vikki.

The HappyTap has been successfully trialled in Durham schools where the equipment has drastically cut down waiting times during lunch and breaks for children to wash their hands and given older schools with limited washing facilities more options. Schools across the county will have them by the new half-term.

Now, a North Tyneside school has also recognized its potential. The HappyTap is now being used in Sir James Knott Nursery in Tynemouth and head teacher Mr. John Croft is already seeing benefits:

“The unit is specially designed for children to use easily and each holds enough water for about 60 washes. It’s making washing hands so much more fun and less time consuming for our young people. Use of hand sanitizers can be more difficult to supervise effectively, and can cause some skin complaints – soap and water are always the best. It’s such a simple idea yet it’s very effective,” he said.

“HappyTap’s mission is to provide robust, accessible handwashing facilities to 10 million people by 2024. In addition to making a real difference to the safety of young people in our region, for every ten units sold in the U.K., one will be donated to a school in a low-income country extending its impact to children who face significant hygiene risks on a daily basis. We have committed to donating 80 units to schools in Vietnam in just the last month, benefitting more than 2,000 children,” said Vikki.

413,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/health/married-to-a-clean-freak-wellness/index.html,"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,The pandemic makes me glad I married a clean freak,"(CNN) When my girlfriend and I met more than a decade ago, I was living in a dump.

The apartment was my first after college, a decrepit walk-up in a rundown little building next to the elevated train in Queens, New York. The walls rumbled when the N train whipped by every few minutes, and the floors and ceiling swayed amid the hum of the prehistoric looking water bugs that crawled — and yes, flew — around.

I'll spare you the details on the bathroom.

Despite its obvious shortcomings, I loved my freedom in that little apartment with its shabby, lopsided furniture and cheap rent. I spent most of my time out, attending plays and dinners, and working, an endless barrage of a stacked schedule of work and play that brought me home mostly to crash.

Until I met her 12 years ago. She slowed me down, helping me to recognize the importance of home as a destination.

""What was this?"" my girlfriend asked, pulling a black liquid in a plastic bag out of my fridge at arm's length.

""Lettuce?"" I guessed, acknowledging that most of the food in my kitchen was expired, many so old they formed a new chemical makeup.

With the pandemic's intense focus on sanitation and handwashing , I can acknowledge how gross I was back then.

At the time, I didn't see the problem in using Febreze spray to mask the stench on my clothes and sheets rather than just washing them or worrying about the science lab in my fridge. (I didn't eat any of it. I ate out.)

Opposites attract

My girlfriend was the exact opposite. She owned a big house on the edge of a beautiful park in upstate New York. You could lick the floors in her home — not that I did — they were so clean. Not a single magazine or glass was out of place. Everything was coiffed, ironed, organized, spotless.

""It feels so nice to get into a fresh, clean bed,"" she'd say, tucking her hospital-corner sheets under her chin and inhaling deeply. I prayed she didn't inhale at my place, which she braved every other weekend.

She must have really loved me — so much that she agreed to sell her house and move in with me. We found a charming apartment together in New York City. She wiped every inch of it down with bleach before we moved in.

She was diplomatic, even gentle, when she suggested I part with the wardrobe that was one shove away from total collapse, the bed that I'd shared with hazy former lovers and not enough changed sheets, and all else from my dilapidated former life. I was fine, even eager, to shed those decrepit parts of my past.

It was easy to get along when we first moved in together. We were so excited to entwine our lives after dating quasi-long distance for two years. It felt like vacation every day. If she disapproved of my messiness, she didn't say — not at first.

But, like any honeymoon, the rose-colored glasses faded after a few months, replaced with a more sober, crystal-clear clarity.

I started to notice strange things. I would make the bed, only to see that the bed had been remade. I would wash dishes and catch her rewashing them. I'd say I was going to do laundry.

""Oh, don't worry about it,"" she'd reply. ""I need to wash those sheets anyway. I'll do it.""

I thought that her offer to take charge on the domestic chores was her way of showing love. While that may have been true, I learned that it was also her passive aggressive way of telling me I wasn't doing it right. Her offer to handle tasks was a way to avoid living in dirt and sidestep calling me out.

Cleaning clashes

We got married in 2013, and had a baby together in 2017. Sleepless newborn nights and co-parenting duties stripped away any respectful veneer we had maintained for the sake of keeping the peace.

""Did you wash these?"" my wife would say, holding a glass to scrutinize it with weary, new-mom bloodshot eyes.

""Yes, I just did,"" I said, because it was the truth.

She would proceed to show me the streaks and stains that still clung to the glass, and then she'd rewash everything I had just washed.

It was the same thing with the bed.

""Did you make the bed?"" she'd say, squinting her eyes in an accusatory way.

""Yes!"" I'd say, because I had, in fact, made the bed.

""You really should take more time and care doing it,"" she'd say.

I felt deflated, because I really had taken extra care to make the bed.

""We aren't living in a hospital,"" I said one time as I watched her remake the bed with hospital corners.

""We aren't living in a pigsty either,"" she said. (I wanted to tell her that pigs were not naturally dirty animals, that they only rolled around in mud to stay cool because no one provided them a cleaner option. But I was married. I knew when to keep my mouth shut — most of the time).

Plus, I knew my wife was right. I don't notice filth. It might be genetic or a condition that doesn't yet have a name. I am really bad at cleaning.

When I walk away from a table after eating, I believe in earnest that I have picked up after myself. I grab a napkin or sponge and wipe up my crumbs. I throw out the garbage. I wash the dishes. I think I'm finished, that I wiped any trace of my presence. But I miss the huge puddle of olive oil on the counter, the sponge saturated with milk, the smeared blueberry on our kid's face (I did wipe his face).

It's not any better when I try to do laundry, cook or do handiwork around the house. I have turned adult sweaters into doll-size attire; dyed perfectly good white shirts purple; and managed to mess up the preparation of straightforward dishes like pancakes and cheese dip.

After nearly a dozen years, my wife's obsession with domestic duties was starting to make my head explode.

Epiphany

Then Covid-19 hit.

A switch turned on in my head. Suddenly, sanitizing became an imperative, a matter of life and death. My clothes could have the coronavirus on them. I wasn't going to wear them twice. Items shouldn't be strewn on countertops. Everything must be wiped down. Hands must be washed thoroughly.

My wife became my pandemic hero.

When she cleans, she is keeping our family safe. When she asks me to do better, she's asking me to do the same. I strain to memorize her meticulous moves in an attempt to emulate and self-protect. My wife is my cleanliness advisor, and she is going to keep our family alive.

The shift from begrudging bystander to active listener probably doesn't resonate with my wife, who I imagine would have appreciated my epiphany about a decade sooner. But then again, she probably isn't thinking too hard about it. She's too practical. She just wants a safe house.","You could lick the floors in her home — not that I did — they were so clean.

Abu Dhabi: Thousands of people across three Cambodian villages can now live safer, healthier lives following the deployment of new water purifying technology as part of ‘20by2020’, a Zayed Sustainability Prize’s UAE-driven humanitarian initiative.

After the most recent installation of solar powered light systems in vulnerable communities in Egypt and Jordan, the initiative has progressed with five water fountains, benefiting the 4,400 residents of the Chhnok Trou, Kampong Phrah and Ses Salab villages in Cambodia. In Cambodia, the provision of clean drinking water remains a major challenge; more than 3 million people lack access to safe water and 6 million lack access to improved sanitation.

Avoid diseases

Due to the instalment of the water ultra-filtration solution, organised by the 20by2020 initiative, the village communities, along with the Chhnok Trou school and clinic, have access to clean and safe water for the first time. Not only does this gives residents an option for avoiding many of the waterborne diseases and other health issues stemming from dirty water, it will offer new opportunities for better hygiene, an essential requirement given the importance of handwashing in preventing the spread of coronavirus.

20by2020’s support has seen yet another community benefit from “life-saving” technology. In Cambodia, the solution deployed has been developed by Safe Water Cube, a French company that was a Zayed Sustainability Prize finalist in 2019 under the Water Category. The technology deployment in Cambodia makes surface water drinkable (from rivers and ponds) by removing viruses and bacteria that cause diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera and hepatitis, from up to 1,000 litres of water per hour with no energy or maintenance required, and no chemicals used.

Humanitarian work

Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, and director-general of the Zayed Sustainability Prize, said: “By streamlining efforts with the 20by2020 partners to achieve a more sustainable world, we can extend the impact of the inspiring humanitarian and international development vision of the UAE’s founding father, the late Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, while reinforcing the country’s role in humanitarian aid and progress towards sustainability.”

Delivering this impactful work across the world is the main objective of 20by2020, a UAE initiative led by the Zayed Sustainability Prize in partnership with Abu Dhabi Global Market, Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, Mubadala Petroleum, Ministry of Tolerance and Coexistence and Masdar.

Lim Kean Hor, Minister of Water Resources and Meteorology of Cambodia and chairman of the Tonle Sap Authority of the Royal Government of Cambodia, said: “We welcome the 20by2020 initiative whose contribution meets one of the strategic objectives of the Tonle Sap Authority to improve access to safe drinking water in the remote areas around the Tonle Sap Great Lake.”

About Zayed Sustainability Prize

Established by the UAE leadership in 2008 to honour the legacy of the founding father, the late Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Zayed Sustainability Prize is the UAE’s global award for recognising sustainability and humanitarian solutions around the world.","Thousands of people across three Cambodian villages can now live safer, healthier lives following the deployment of new water purifying technology as part of ‘20by2020’ Image Credit: SuppliedAbu Dhabi: Thousands of people across three Cambodian villages can now live safer, healthier lives following the deployment of new water purifying technology as part of ‘20by2020’, a Zayed Sustainability Prize’s UAE-driven humanitarian initiative.

Former defence and military veterans minister Lindiwe Sisulu is tasked with overseeing water and sanitation as well as human settlements in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet. There was probably some sense of pride when people from her old portfolio – the SA Army Engineer Formation – was selected by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni to right the wrongs caused by years of pollution from municipal sewage works adjacent to one of the major inland waterways in South Africa. The Sappers did what they could and were withdrawn to be replaced by a team from ERWAT (East Rand Water Supply Company).

The east Gauteng company’s tenure is also apparently at an end with government’s news agency SAnews reporting R911 million has been committed for the rest of the 2020/21 financial year “to assist in solving longstanding sewer pollution of the Vaal River”.

Sisulu’s department has finalised the scope of work needed at the Vaal and will advertise 26 separate work packages in the “coming weeks for competent contractors to be part of solving the protracted sewer challenge”.

“This means appointed contractors will be on the ground during the festive season. Provided there are no community protests leading to work stoppages, more frequent in recent times, the department plans to launch module 6 in Sebokeng Water Care Works before the end of current financial year,” the DWS said.

The department added is taking all necessary precautions to ensure it complies with the provisions of Section 217 of the Constitution, as far as procurement is concerned.







“The process of advertising for competent contractors is in its final stages and adverts will be in the Government Gazette soon. Start and completion dates of the project will be communicated to all stakeholders once contractorsare appointed,” SAnews said.","Former defence and military veterans minister Lindiwe Sisulu is tasked with overseeing water and sanitation as well as human settlements in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet.

Thiruvananthapuram: For the first time, a scenic hill station in Kerala has got the protection of “green check posts” and round-the-clock vigil by “green army” in a bid to guard its serene eco-system and keep it plastic-free. Vagamon, a British era plantation town in high range Idukki district in central Kerala, has now got five check posts a tall its entry points under an innovative initiative of the state-run Haritha Keralam (Green Kerala) Mission.

Known for its lush greenery, misty valleys and splendid meadows, the sought-after tourist destination had been chocked by plastic and other non-degradable waste dumped by the visitors for long and the present effort was to reclaim its beauty and protect its serene ecosystem, officials said.

Haritha Keralam, launched nearly four years ago by the state government, envisages a clean and green state through waste management, organic farming and conservation of water resources with the support of the people.

The check posts at Vagamon were the first of its kind in the southern state and the initiative was an experimental model of ‘green tourism’, conceptualised and implemented by the mission, its Executive Vice-Chairperson T N Seema said.

Elappara village panchayat, where the major part of the tourist hub is located, and the district administration have also joined hands with the Haritha Keralam in this endeavour. As part of the initiative, members of “Haritha karmasena”, the green army, stop vehicles entering into Vagamon at the check posts and screen whether the visitors are carrying any plastic carry bags or other harmful materials.

The ‘green counters’, attached to the check posts, offer tourists eco-friendly articles like cloth bags. They can deposit plastic bottles and other materials at the ‘bottle booths’, set up at various points, officials said. Two material collection facilities are open to keep and segregate waste collected at these booths and the state-run ‘Clean Kerala’ company has been entrusted with removal of the waste at particular intervals.

An amenity centre has also been set up near one of the check posts, the officials added.

It is part of our efforts to make tourism destinations in the state clean and plastic-free. Visitors used to dump plastic and other harmful materials on the way sides and in the beautiful valleys of the place. We hope that the present effort will surely make a difference, Seema told PTI.

The mission, with the support of the village panchayat and district administration, had also recently carried out amass cleaning drive at the tourist hub, she said.

NDTV – Dettol Banega Swasth India campaign is an extension of the five-year-old Banega Swachh India initiative helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. It aims to spread awareness about critical health issues facing the country. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign highlights the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children to prevent maternal and child mortality, fight malnutrition, stunting, wasting, anaemia and disease prevention through vaccines. Importance of programmes like Public Distribution System (PDS), Mid-day Meal Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyan and the role of Aganwadis and ASHA workers are also covered. Only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and become a Swasth or healthy India. The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene.

Course Completed

Under India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), about 122 nonattainment cities have prepared clean air action plans for reaching their target of 20 to 30 per cent reduction in particulate pollution by 2024 from the 2017 levels. As these cities move to begin their implementation processes and systems, it will be crucial for them to build capacity and knowledge for sector-wise and department-wise strategies and regulatory actions.

For instance, what kind of actions and strategies would be needed in different sectors, ranging from vehicles and waste burning to industries and clean household energy? How can cities enhance and strengthen air quality monitoring strategies and source assessment to guide policy-making?

Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), known for its decades of ground-breaking research and advocacy in air pollution abatement and management, and for its leading edge in capacity building of public institutions and regulatory agencies, offers a new training programme in this subject. This two-week online course is especially designed to meet the needs of clean air action planners and implementing agencies and individuals from different sectors.

WHO CAN APPLY?

Government officials from different departments involved with clean air action planning and NCAP programme and working on sectoral strategies for air pollution control; officials involved with implementation in targeted sectors

Professionals, consultants, planners, practitioners providing technical support to city action plans and programmes

The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government has assembled experts with the requisite skills to deal with the recent crude oil spill in the Bellair area, in Durban.

This, according to Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, who inspected the rehabilitation and clean-up operations at the Bayhead Natural Heritage Site, near the Durban Habour Canal on Saturday.

News24 previously reported that the theft of a Transnet pipeline caused the oil spill which affected the Umbilo River which flowed into the Durban Harbour.

Dube-Ncube said a team of environmentalists had conducted daily inspections of the spill since Thursday.

On Saturday, she announced that the oil spill had been declared a Section 30 incident which referred to an ""unexpected, sudden and uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance, including from a major emission, fire or explosion, that causes, has caused or may cause significant harm to the environment, human life or property"", according to the National Environmental Management Act.

The initiative comes at a time the Government of Ghana has set for itself an ambitious agenda to rid Accra of the choking menace of filth, improper waste management and littering engulfing the national capital.

Youth numbering over 200 joined the exercise as they cleared the beach of plastics, rubbish, faecal matter and litter.

The exercise aimed to foster greater youth involvement in the vision of government, to make Accra, the cleanest city in West Africa.

The youth were also trained on proper waste management practices geared towards attaining the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation

To protect aquatic life of the sea, GARYN took advantage of the day to champion SDG 13 on climate action and SDG 14 on protecting life below water.

The campaign mobilized youth from keep fit clubs and recognized youth groups including Glife Youth Association and Ablekuma boys.

Vice convenor for the Greater Accra Youth Network Florence Agyemang told the media the cleanup exercise will be held on the last Saturday of every month.

She explained: “Accra generates over 3000 tons of filth every day. Our inability to properly manage this leads to all kinds of diseases, floods and a dirty landscape that poses harm to our very selves.”

If the youth are properly educated to take on the task of cleaning the city, we create a culture of ownership of the environment for the good future of the country,” she added.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on climate change, Malik Amin Aslam, on Tuesday said all-out efforts were being made under the Prime Minister Imran Khan's vision for clean and green Pakistan to overcome growing challenges of environmental degradation, particularly pollution, and unmanaged solid waste littering in cities and towns across the country.

In a statement issued here on Tuesday, he highlighted that the incumbent government was focusing on transforming the overall outlook of the cities, which would play key economic roles in the coming days.

However, the prime minister launched an ambitious Clean Green Pakistan Index (CGPI) last year in November for tackling these urban environmental challenges, so as to provide the people with healthy liveable condition, he said.

CGPI encourage competition among cities on various indicators, including public access to drinking water, safe sanitation, effective solid waste management and tree plantation. The initiative primarily weighs up clean and green characters of the cities on 35 indicators under these five pillars. This index will be used as a benchmark for making annual budgetary allocations to the provinces from the national kitty.

Amin said that in the initial phase of the CGPI, 20 cities of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces, including Attock, Lahore, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Okara and Bahawalpur, were selected to compete on certain issues of public interest.

The selected cities were being judged on addressing issues such as safe drinking water, solid waste management, liquid waste management, city beautification, cleanliness of streets, the usability of parks, tree plantation, total sanitation/hygiene and community participation, he added.

He said that while initially the performance of the 20 cities from the two provinces competing has been now measured on the CGPI, most of them have performed well on all 35 indicators of CGPI under the six different themes.

Giving break-up of the performance score achieved by the cities, he told that as per data collected in the climate change ministry regarding performance of the cities on CGPI, Attock city attained the highest score of 76.53 points among all 13 cities of Punjab province followed by Bahawalpur (74.80), Lahore (74.30), Gujrat (70.46), Rawalpindi 69.94), Sahiwal (65.88), Gujranwala (64.39), Faisalabad (62.97), Multan (60.63), Sialkot 56.27), Sargodha (56.10), DG Khan (53.45) and Murree (37.29).

While in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Bannu bagged the highest score of (57.50) on CGPI, followed by Kohat (52.97), Abbottabad (52.72), Peshawar (45.39), Mardan (34.17), Swat (30.97) and D.I. Khan (21.19), Amin added.

He said that however, in recognition of the performance of 20 cities on 35 indicators of CGPI, the deputy commissioners of the districts, where the cities were located, were awarded by the Prime Minister Imran Khan, who showed prominent progress towards making their cities clean and green.

While highlighting factors and indicators behind of the performance, Malik Amin Aslam said that 120,000 champions registered with the PM's Clean Green Pakistan Programme played a vital role in monitoring the role of the city administrations, particularly municipalities. They also played their role in helping these cities to improve their performance of managing cities in the best environmental-friendly way, he added.

The PM's special assistant also highlighted that since the launching of the CGPI in November last year, 1,200,235 trees have been planted in these two cities, where 156,724 public hygiene and 10, 787 public awareness on ways and means to keep the cities clean were conducted.

Counting on reasons behind the successful implementation of CGPI under the Prime Minister Khan's Clean Green Pakistan Programme, Amin said that demonstration of political will, public behavioural change, local government institutions and enhanced public engagement were instrumental for the improvement in overall environmental and waste management in the 20 competing cities.

He vowed to expand the CGPI experiences to other cities in Balochistan, Sindh Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir soon, where environmental degradation, particularly air pollution and absence of solid waste management facilities are posing grave risks to the public health and overall environment.

The special assistant said every segment of the society, including the administration, the elected representatives and the youth should become part of the prime minister's clean and green initiative to joint hands with the government to tackle burgeoning environmental degradation.","Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on climate change says Imran Khan is eager to overcome environmental degradation.

Project: Communication for Cholera Prevention and Control

Donor: UNICEF

Sector: Communications for Development C4D

Crossing Sectors: WASH, Health

Target Area: Rada’a District, Al-Baidha Governorate

The project in partnership with UNICEF, focuses on improving knowledge and awareness as well as creating an enabling environment for behavior change and adoption of the positive practices among beneficiaries in the targeted area. A total of 60 Community Volunteers and Youth were trained on key disease-preventing practices, interpersonal communication and community engagement techniques to conduct awareness raising sessions and encourage community members to adopt preventative practices against Cholera and Acute Watery Diarrhea.

Shocking amounts of accumulated waste

Reports and photos taken by the Community Volunteers were alarming and indicated that residential and public areas within the city of Rada’a were overridden by waste. “I was shocked to see the amount of trash and waste randomly laying everywhere in the city”, a statement by Aisha Al-Redha, a Community Volunteer disseminating messages in different neighborhoods around the city.

She knew that actions were needed in order to save her city and decided to take it upon her shoulder to convince her team members that a clean-up campaign was the only way to go about solving this problem. Accordingly, she started targeting her own neighborhood and bought broom, gloves and trash cans. Along with her team members, they started lifting the waste spread around houses. To her surprise, members of the community joined and the momentum was unstoppable. Men, women, boys and girls were all working together to clean their community and in no time, the streets were clean. “I’ve never seen our street so clean before” said a 10-year-old girl from the community.

Residents showered Community Volunteers with praise and vowed never to randomly dispose waste on the streets.","A total of 60 Community Volunteers and Youth were trained on key disease-preventing practices, interpersonal communication and community engagement techniques to conduct awareness raising sessions and encourage community members to adopt preventative practices against Cholera and Acute Watery Diarrhea.

Two new partners Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the Italian National Promotional Institution and Financial Institution for Development Cooperation, and ICO, the Spanish Promotional Bank, join as new members of the initiative.

After its second year of operation, the Clean Oceans Initiative has provided EUR 1.3 billion long-term financing for projects that reduce discharge of plastics and other litter to the oceans through improved management of wastewater, storm water and solid waste. The goal of the initiative set by the three founding members is to finance EUR 2 billion in public and private sector projects by 2023.

The vast majority of the 21 projects signed so far under the initiative are located in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Examples include improved sanitation in Ratmalana and Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, solid waste management in Lomé, Togo, stormwater management and flooding in Cotonou, Benin, wastewater treatment in Alexandria, Egypt and in Cape Town, South Africa, as well as green urban investments in the Yangtze River Delta Region in China.

The founding members of the Clean Oceans Initiative are very pleased to welcome CDP and ICO as new partners to contribute to the protection of our oceans and seas under this joint initiative.

AFD Chief Executive officer Rémy Rioux said: “While the global impact of plastic on oceans and communities is devastating ocean wildlife and affecting human health, collective actions are required for effectively preventing marine plastic pollution. This is why EIB, KfW and AFD have joined forces in 2018 by launching the EUR 2bn Clean Oceans Initiative. We are very proud to welcome this year two other European partners, CDP of Italy and ICO of Spain to help us overcome this challenge, and further demonstrate the capacity of public development banks (PDBs) to pursue the long-term objectives of protecting the planet and promoting sustainable development – which will be key areas of discussion at the Finance in Common Summit on 12 November when the 450 PDBs around the world will gather for the first time ever. ”

EIB President Dr Werner Hoyer said: “In the midst of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 we do not lose sight of global environmental and climate challenges. The Clean Oceans Initiative is now more relevant than ever, with dramatic pollution further aggravated by the widespread use of disposable protective equipment. I’m delighted therefore that we can now welcome ICO and CDP to join the amazing collaboration started two years ago with AFD and KfW. Protecting our oceans is a mission that unites us and that we take very seriously.”

KfW CEO Dr Günther Bräunig said: “The Clean Ocean Initiative is a European response to a global problem. The last two years have provided impressive proof of how well it works: We have clearly achieved our interim goal so far and will continue to join forces against the flood of plastic waste. It is therefore all the more gratifying that the Spanish and Italian development banks have now joined our initiative.”

CDP CEO Fabrizio Palermo said: “We are very pleased to join our European partners in the Clean Oceans Initiative and contribute to its success. This Partnership reaffirms the crucial role that European Institutions and Public Development Banks can play in jointly promoting sustainable development models that safeguard oceans and biodiversity of our planet. Together, we can further contribute to reorient financial flows and crowd in private sector resources to finance innovative solutions that will keep our oceans clean”.

ICO Chairman José Carlos García de Quevedo said: “Let me congratulate the founding members of the Clean Oceans Initiative, AFD, EIB and KFW, for their excellent work and brilliant results achieved on this second anniversary. As this is a global challenge, we have to gather all forces and combine efforts. This is why ICO, as national promotional bank, is taking part in this initiative. We will provide debt, equity and guarantee to projects and companies that contribute to the Clean Oceans Initiative objectives”

The Clean Oceans Initiative identifies projects that reduce discharge of plastic waste in rivers, seas and on land, with a particular focus on riverine and coastal areas in developing countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. This reflects that a significant amount of plastic waste enters the oceans from ten major river systems located in Africa and Asia, which lack access to regular waste collection and controlled waste disposal systems, as well as adequate wastewater and stormwater management systems.","The FINANCIAL -- Today at the IMF/World Bank Group meetings, the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW acting on behalf of the German Federal Government reported significant progress on the Clean Oceans Initiative.

427,https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/How-do-you-find-a-clean-restroom-in-Bay-Area-15618361.php,"Sun, 04 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",San Francisco Chronicle,How do you find a clean restroom in Bay Area during the pandemic? It's not easy,"During a recent stroll through Hayes Valley, things almost felt normal, with people sunning at Patricia’s Green, dawdling in retail stores and zipping in to get takeout from restaurants.

But no one seemed to know where to go to the bathroom.

On the short Hayes Street block between Octavia and Laguna streets, four stores, peppered with requests, finally opted for signs saying that restrooms are not available.

La Boulangerie de San Francisco has posted a sign that reads: “Sorry, no bathrooms allowed.” A similar sign hangs across the street, at Patxi’s Pizza. Server Julius Allen estimated that 20 people still ask about the restroom during each of his shifts. “People always asked before COVID times, but now, it’s constant,” Allen said.

It’s a similar story at Peak Design, a travel bags and camera gear store: The restroom is currently unavailable, even to customers. When asked where customers could find relief nearby, store manager P.J. Harris said: “No idea. Not in this area.”

The Hayes Valley experience is a microcosm of what’s going on across the Bay Area, where a decades-old problem of finding clean public restrooms has been amplified during the coronavirus pandemic. With concerns about sanitation intensified and many go-to options shuttered or more heavily secured, places for people to relieve themselves are few and far between.

Liz Hafalia / The Chronicle

Lenore Estrada understands the demand, as pregnancy created an extra challenge for her during the pandemic. The owner of Three Babes Bakeshop said she often planned her day around bathroom access, calling ahead to make sure something is available when feeling like she “has to pee every 20 minutes.”

“We’re failing at human dignity,” Fran Heller said. “The system is broken; however, there’s technology that can fix it.”

Heller is the chief executive of Good2Go, a San Francisco startup. She started working on the problem after her Menlo Park running group had trouble finding a restroom in 2015. With a background in biotech and pharma, Heller developed a solution that combines virtual queuing with keyless access and touchless hardware.

The company’s app solves two problems: where to find a restroom and how to access it. Good2Go uses geolocation to find a nearby restroom and allow a customer to join a virtual queue. When it’s the customer’s turn, a phone alert arrives with a digital key to unlock the restroom. Businesses can also print a QR code to provide a hands-free experience.

Good2Go, which says it has had 750,000 uses of its system, has had successful pilot programs with the Pacific Heights Chevron and the Haight Whole Foods Market.

One of Good2Go’s partners is Peet’s. With the coffee roaster generally relegated to drive-through and takeout orders — meaning restrooms aren’t available — Good2Go has taken a hit. But it also reported an “overwhelming” increase in requests for information about its service from local and federal government recently.

Jamie Cotten / Special to The Chronicle

Maybe no one is feeling the squeeze more than drivers. In a recent Good2Go poll, 53% of gig, parcel delivery, food delivery, and light truck delivery drivers said they have found relief in an alley or bottle during the pandemic.

“Female drivers have it especially tough, because they aren’t as likely to pee in an alleyway or Gatorade bottle. Even though, not every male driver would admit it, we have all peed in an alley or even a Gatorade bottle at some point or another,” said Harry Campbell, who started driving part-time for Uber and Lyft in 2014 before quitting his job as an engineer a year later to cover the gig economy full time at the Rideshare Guy, a website and podcast.

Campbell said drivers all have their tricks for finding clean public restrooms, like making quick stops at a cafe of fast-food restaurant, but few are open for sit-down service in the Bay Area these days. Because restrooms at gas stations and grocery stores can be busier than ever, Campbell said some drivers sneak into hotel or hospital lobbies.

Grocery stores might consistently have the longest lines, although some have figured out the trick that posting an “out of order” sign is easier than meeting the demand. Finding a gas station restroom often means waiting in your car and clogging a pump space since parking is limited, and hotels often have heightened security during the pandemic.

Fletcher Wilson was getting a late-night Uber ride home when he asked the driver how he found restrooms.

Braking at the next stop sign, the driver popped open the glove compartment to reveal a neatly rolled necktie. The driver said, “Whenever I drop a passenger at a hotel, I throw on the tie, walk into the lobby, and boom, a really nice bathroom is all mine.”

“What struck me most was the subtle hint of shame that drives this sort of strategy: That he felt the need to dress himself up to earn access to a nice bathroom experience,” said Wilson, who this year founded Throne Labs, a San Francisco company that hopes to establish a set of new, clean restrooms in cities. “It is clear that this problem has been made a lot worse for everyone. We keep hearing people say that many of their go-to spots aren’t open anymore, and also that cleanliness is much more important than it used to be.”

San Francisco announced in April the distribution of a series of new portable toilets and handwashing stations at 15 high-need locations in response to the pandemic. The toilets are available 24 hours a day, staffed to deter untoward activities, and are cleaned daily.

Interactive Vaccine Tracker: Latest developments Detailed information about the coronavirus vaccines as it becomes available.

Though the numbers could be skewed by the fact that fewer people are working downtown to call in reports on human waste, statistics have improved. There were 1,840 reports of human and animal waste to the city’s 311 hotline last month. August reports have averaged more than 2,400 in the past three years.

Concerns about spreading the coronavirus on surfaces have eased. But as with any common space, health experts say that people should touch as little as possible in restrooms and wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. They say to use a paper towel to activate the faucet and to open the door, and to carry hand sanitizer — in case the restroom is out of handwashing supplies.

In an American Institute of Physics report in July, a study showed that tiny water droplets are ejected several feet from a toilet during a flush. Forced air dryers can also blow whatever is on your hands back into your face.

Jamie Cotten / Special to The Chronicle

Among the riskiest parts of using a public restroom is waiting in long lines, especially if proper distancing isn’t possible or face-covering guidance isn’t enforced.

“There is a prevalent problem of long lines for ladies’ rooms and the need for greater potty parity, equal speed of access for toilets for males and females,” said Kathryn H. Anthony, the vice president of the American Restroom Association. “For millions of people around the world, boys and girls, men and women of all ages, especially pregnant and menstruating women, and whether you are Democrat, Republican or Green, using public restrooms is no laughing matter.”

People probably still won’t be belly laughing, but there may be an easing of bladders on the horizon.

San Francisco’s progress in coronavirus rates and testing pushed the county Tuesday from the second-worst to the second-best tier on the state’s four-color blueprint for a safer economy. After its bump to the orange tier, indicating what’s considered “moderate” spread of the virus, San Francisco on Wednesday allowed indoor dining and bars that serve food to open at 25% capacity or to 100 people, whichever is fewer. Indoor restaurants are expected to allow diners use of restrooms, while outdoor restaurants are on a case-by-case basis. City rules permit restaurants to allow patrons seated outdoors to go inside to use restrooms, but it’s unclear whether the restaurants must do so.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed also hopes that city playgrounds will be able to open by Oct. 14. If so, the Hayes Valley Playground, with its restrooms and changing tables, would be available for the first time since the mid-March shelter-in-place order.

“That will be nice to have at least one option to send customers,” said Emily Soe, a sales associate at the Orange Bird gift shop on Hayes Street. “It’s difficult to turn away families with small children and not have an answer for them.”

“This is the time for government and nation to get mobilized to safeguard our children and future generations….There is a need of forestation,” he said while speaking as chief guest at the Encouragement Award Ceremony of Clean Green Index organized by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.

The prime minister had launched the Clean Green Pakistan Movement (CGPI) on November 25, 2019.

The major focus of the initiative was to inculcate a spirit of competition on cleanliness initiatives in the cities and facilitate the behavioural change, building positive attitudes, institutional strengthening for better water, sanitation and hygiene services, and facilities.

The prime minister said Pakistan, which was bestowed by Allah Almighty with abundant natural resource and beauty, was not take care of in the past and was destroyed through a lot of deforestation.

“Peshawar was known as a city of gardens and Lahore used to be a clean and green city…But now we have reached to this point. Lahore has witnessed 70% deforestation during the last 20 years,” he remarked.

Imran Khan referred to the high levels of pollution in major cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Karachi, Peshawar and Gujranwala particularly during the winter season and expressed his fear that it could cause the spike of COVID-19 during the second wave of pandemic.

He, however, pointed out that the international institutions, including the World Health Organization (WHO) appreciated Pakistan for its effective handling of the COVID-19 and put it among the world’s four countries, which, besides protecting the people from the virus, also saved themselves from economic impacts.

The prime minister said besides focusing on forestation through 10 billion tree programme, the government was also working on cleanliness of the cities through effective solid waste management.

He said since the solid waste was used for power generation in various countries, the present government was also working with various foreign companies for the purpose.

Imran Kahn said there was a need to change the mindset of people to bring in changes at the ground level, and create awareness among them about the importance of clean and green environment.

Appreciating the efforts of deputy commissioners of the cities that won the encouragement awards under clean and green index, he said there should be more incentives for the officers working to ensure cleanliness in the cities.

The prime minister, however, added that since there was a culture of equal treatment of people in bureaucracy in terms of salaries and perks, there was a need to introduce a system of reward and punishment to encourage the hard-working officers.

If the deputy commissioners ensuring cleanliness in their respective districts were awarded with incentives, including the financial awards, then those not performing well should be punished, he added.

The prime minister lauded the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change for the clean green initiative, saying besides 120,000 champions registered in the clean and green initiative, over one million youth from the Tiger Force would also help ensure cleanliness in the country.

Advisor to the PM on Environment and Climate Change Malik Ameen Aslam and Minister of State Zartaj Gul also spoke on the occasion and highlighted various programmes and initiatives of the ministry to ensure a clean and green Pakistan.

429,https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/23918-keep-it-clean,"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Meat & Poultry,Keep it clean,"Clean ingredients are the new baseline for today’s shoppers, according to the “2020 US Grocery Shopper Trends,” a report produced by FMI – The Food Industry Association, Washington, DC, in collaboration with The Hartman Group, Bellevue, Wash. Shoppers are reevaluating their purchasing criteria and product assortment needs. They have a sharper focus on health, a heightened awareness of the environmental consequences of consumption and a desire for a deeper connection to food, according to the study. Ingredient legends matter.

Today’s shoppers bring a broader, more sophisticated range of criteria with them when shopping for groceries, including meat and poultry. They want foods to be as close to natural as possible, and that means no artificial ingredients. For meat and poultry, that means no synthetic colors, flavors or preservatives.

“We have meat and poultry customers that traditionally sold into school and hospitality sectors,” said Jane Quartel, executive director, food protection, Kalsec, Kalamazoo, Mich. “Those sectors are more tolerant of lengthier labels and synthetic inclusions. These customers are now switching gears and wanting to capture additional growth seen in the consumer markets, but the consumer is choosier and wants shorter, cleaner labels.”

Travis Krause, sales director, Kemin Food Technologies-Americas, Des Moines, Iowa, said, “Consumers are reaching for simpler, free-from and clean-label meat and poultry products, but taste is still at the top of their shopping list. Clean label meats resonate with consumers and their perceptions of quality, health and value.”

Clean is the future

Clean label is not a passing trend, it’s a movement that is here to stay. This is something that is proving to be even more valued during these uncertain times, as consumers are taking control of their health by being selective with what they put into their bodies.

Solutions based on vinegar and certain plant extracts – namely rosemary, green tea, acerola and celery – possess the unique ability to assist with extending the shelf life of meat and poultry by naturally preserving color, flavor and quality

“They have come a long way in recent years in rivaling the efficacy of traditional synthetic ingredients,” said Garrett McCoy, research and development manager, Corbion, Lenexa, Kan. “They make effective curing agents and provide antioxidant activity that delays rancidity and protects product color and flavor.”

The pandemic changed the way consumers shop, cook and eat. In addition to increased retail purchases, consumers were looking for products with longer shelf lives to decrease the number of trips to the store.

“At the same time, there is also increased demand for convenience and heat-and-eat items, as working from home while maintaining school schedules and juggling children and spouses at home increases the volume and number of meals being made per day,” Krause said. “Meat manufacturers have had to quickly pivot and determine the best business decisions to utilize inventory that wasn’t running through foodservice and in many cases look for ingredients to formulate for the longer shelf life demands required by retail.”

They discovered that vinegars and certain plant extracts are label-friendly options for extending the shelf life and safety of protein products. That’s what consumers want.

Research shows that natural product shoppers are not abandoning their focus during COVID-19, according to new research from Chicago-based IRI and SPINS. The study shows that consumers are doubling down on their food choices. They are widening their preferences through strategies such as seeking and avoiding various ingredients and carefully studying label claims and certifications. This has resulted in consumers purchasing more natural products in 2020, both pre-COVID-19 and during the current pandemic.

“Dollar sales for natural products continue to grow over one year ago, as much as an astounding 78% in the middle of March during consumers’ initial stock-up period and continuing in the high teens at present,” said Steve Ramsey, executive vice president and general manager of strategic accounts for IRI. “Given that natural products represent more than 8% of total store sales year-to-date and are outpacing sales of conventional products, there are significant opportunities for manufacturers and retailers alike to show support for consumers.”

Allison Turner, preservation product manager, Naturex, part of Givaudan, South Hackensack, NJ, said, “Consumers are mindful of the ingredients in their food and what is on their labels. While using plant extracts in meat and poultry is not a new concept, it is a key ingredient in meeting consumer trends in natural, transparency and simplicity.”

Power of plants

Rosemary leads the way in this area of functional plant extracts. Rosemary is primarily used to limit oxidation of fats and pigments, thereby helping retain product quality. Rosemary can be blended with other plant extracts to offer different levels of protection.

“One of the active components, carnosic acid, naturally protects the rosemary plant from heat and light when growing in the wild. That same compound provides a natural way to combat pro-oxidants, such as oxygen, light and temperature in meat and poultry,” Turner said. “Other plants have active compounds that protect fats during the different stages of the oxidation reaction.”

Proprietary consumer research by Naturex showed that the majority of consumers who are avoiding artificial preservatives are also concerned about nitrites and nitrates in meat. These compounds are commonly found in cured products, such as bacon, ham and sausages.

“Plant extracts can also be used as an alternative to traditional curing for meats,” said Tim Knight, preservation technical service specialist at Givaudan/Naturex. “Celery and Swiss chard have naturally occurring nitrates. When converted to nitrites, they can help preserve taste and color. They can be used along with acerola cherry, which is an alternative to sodium erythorbate.”

These vegetable sources of naturally occurring nitrite are familiar and recognizable to consumers and also offer convenience and predictability for processed meat manufacturers. Vegetable-sourced nitrite produces the same characteristic color, flavor and microbial control in meat products as traditional curing using sodium nitrite, according to Knight.

“Swiss chard is a growing option for applications where celery is not desirable because of allergen or sensitivity concerns,” Knight said.

Multi-functional vinegar

Vinegar is commonly used by meat and poultry processors as a food safety tool. It is one of the few products around today that has been in grandma’s kitchen for centuries, making it a clean-label ingredient. Often described as sour to the taste buds, vinegar ingredients have long been appreciated by meat and poultry processors for their contribution to tenderizing, preserving, enhancing flavor and even influencing color. Suppliers offer vinegar ingredients in dry and liquid extract format, with or without other functional or flavorful ingredients.

Acetic acid is the primary constituent of vinegar and the active compound. In terms of food safety, the undissociated acid penetrates microbial cell walls and once inside the microorganism, where the pH is near or above neutral, the acid dissociates, lowering the pH. With pH-sensitive microorganisms, including the pathogens and spoilage bacteria encountered in the meat and poultry processing and distribution environment, this change in pH impairs or stops growth. Further, the anionic parts of the organic acid, which are the negatively charged ions, that remain in the microorganism will accumulate, disrupting metabolic functions. This leads to an increase in osmotic pressure that destroys the microorganism.

Corbion conducted an online survey of 528 Canadians in March 2020 to better understand consumer perceptions regarding the labeling of vinegar ingredients in processed meat products. Those who qualified for participation in the survey said they had purchased or consumed ready-to-eat meat (RTE) products such as hot dogs, bacon or sausage, within the prior three-month period. Sixty-two percent of consumers surveyed feel “natural” is very important in RTE meat products. More than half (55%) stated they would buy RTE meats with buffered vinegar while 60% said they would purchase RTE meats with neutralized vinegar and 69% would purchase RTE meats with low acid vinegar.

“Low acid vinegar is perceived by consumers as being the most natural followed by neutralized vinegar,” McCoy said. “One thing that stands out among those consumers that are not extremely likely to purchase a product under any naming convention is they truly do not understand the ingredients’ functionality.”

This presents an opportunity to educate consumers as to why an ingredient is added to a product. Processors should note that there are varied vinegar ingredients in the marketplace.

“Buffered vinegars come in a wide range of pH levels and customers can choose from both liquid and powder formats, as well as organic and non-GMO options,” McCoy said. “Different pH levels work well in different applications, but in meat and poultry applications, it’s important that pH not be too low in order to avoid flavor impact and to preserve water-holding capacity and texture.”

At the same time, maintaining antimicrobial activity is essential to ensuring food safety and prolonging product freshness. There’s a fear factor driving consumer concerns about food safety, which has never been more important. Shelf life is important too, as shoppers stock up on foods to make sure they have what they need in the event of another lockdown.

“This can be especially tough for the makers of sliced and RTE products like sandwich meats,” McCoy said. “They must keep in mind that many consumers are out of work and have to look for lower price points, so cost efficiency is very much in focus for processors. And with so many consumers choosing curbside pickup and doorstep delivery options in their food shopping, manufacturers are hard pressed to deal with the need for greater temperature tolerance, so their products stay safe, fresh and stable longer under challenging conditions.”

Knight concluded, “Consumers may be keeping meat and poultry products longer in their freezer as they stock up on these items. Prevention of oxidation is particularly important for fully cooked products that are stored in the freezer. Plant extracts can be added to formulas to help prevent the development of objectionable oxidative flavors and odors in frozen meat and poultry products that develop over time.”","Clean ingredients are the new baseline for today’s shoppers, according to the “2020 US Grocery Shopper Trends,” a report produced by FMI – The Food Industry Association, Washington, DC, in collaboration with The Hartman Group, Bellevue, Wash.

Railway-News: What are some rail projects Camira has worked on?

Camira: As a global brand, we work with operators across the world including Queensland Rail, RATP in France, Belgian Rail, LA Metro and Belarusian Rail. Closer to home, we’ve most recently completed a project with Avanti West Coast and we are proud to have produced fabrics for LNER Azuma, Northern Rail, TransPennine Rail, TfW – Wales & Borders, West Midlands, Govia – Thameslink and Southern, GWR and Mersey Rail, to name a few! Here in the UK though, we’re best known for supplying wire-woven wool moquette fabrics to TfL for the London Underground and Overground. Most recently, we were commissioned to produce a wire woven moquette for the Elizabeth Line, which we developed alongside British design studio, Wallace Sewell. In keeping with the royal name of the line, regal purple is the dominant colour on the Elizabeth Line branding, which is carried right through to the fabric design itself. For us, we pride ourselves on our transport capabilities. Our inhouse design studio works in close partnership with professional design houses and operators to create the most appropriate fabric solutions, not only in terms of colour and appearance, but also in meeting specific technical requirements, most notably flammability performance. For operators looking for something special, a bespoke design or branded fabric can add personality and flair to a vehicle interior.

RN: Can you give us an overview of how production has been affected for Camira as a result of coronavirus?

C: Clearly, while it hasn’t been “business as usual” during this period, we have been able to maintain ongoing service throughout, continuing to distribute fabrics into all regions, and – apart from two brief interruptions in the UK and in Lithuania – continuing to produce fabrics to demand. Different segments have been affected to different degrees – in Commercial Interiors we have seen more demand for vertical fabrics for privacy screens, while we’ve also benefited from the move to home office working; in Transport, we’ve seen a dip in coach-related sales due to the effects on tourism and travel, while rail projects due to their longer-term nature have remained on track (no pun intended).

RN: Hygiene is a major talking point now on public transport, as one of the tools we have to keep each other safe. Have you seen a shift in enquiries towards more hygiene-oriented fabrics? You have published a cleaning and disinfecting guide and all of your fabrics can be cleaned and disinfected with soap and water, for example, but your wool products won’t take bleach.

C: Understandably, cleaning and disinfection have become hot topics in the wake of Covid-19, with a new emphasis on hygiene as an important way in which to help prevent the spread of the virus, especially on public transport. As the industry works to reassure passengers that it is safe to travel by bus, coach and rail, we’ve made it our duty to educate our customers on how they can clean and disinfect our fabrics effectively. Most recently, we have released a dedicated guide to cleaning and disinfecting our transport fabrics, which can be found on our website. Perhaps contrary to popular belief, viruses do not survive as well on fabrics, as they do on frequently touched hard surfaces such as plastics, laminates, metal and glass. On textiles, viruses can get trapped and therefore have reduced likelihood of spreading. Subsequently, operators will need to ensure more attention is given to the regular cleaning and disinfection of grab handles, seat trays and door release buttons, for example. Of course, there are further ways to reduce the risk of textiles with similar protocols. As you rightly flag, bleach is not suitable for use on woollen products but what wool does love is steam. What we have to remember is that wool is nature’s ultra-intelligent fibre type. It has in-built health properties making it allergy and asthma safe as well as this, it improves interior air quality. With this in mind, it makes sense that this fibre type would prefer an all-natural, chemical free disinfection method. With steam cleaning, its high-pressure and high-temperature water vapour not only disinfects, but also revives the inherent spring and elasticity of wool, so it looks far superior to other types of fabric when steamed. Wool also has enhanced flame-retardant properties – especially in relation to spread of flame and smoke density/ toxicity, so it wins out in this area compared to vinyl.

RN: What, generally, has the knockon effect of coronavirus been for you? Rail projects often have long implementation periods – have you seen a big change in order volumes?

C: As you say, rail projects do have long implementation periods and as such, the rail sector has probably seen the least impact from COVID-19 so far. With major projects set for completion in 2–3 years’ time, they need to keep moving. Yes, there have been a few delays but the majority of projects that were in the pipeline for 2019 are still very much in motion. This is optimistic as we look ahead to the future.

RN: Has this public health crisis changed the way you do things that you will maintain longterm?

C: The pandemic has certainly prompted us to home in on our top priorities as a business. Having to respond to rapidly changing circumstances within over 80 countries, we have had to move at a faster pace – pulling together educational tools such as our transport cleaning guide, collating our anti-microbial fabrics and conducting webinars, for example. Projects have very much been based around what our customers need here and now. To understand this, more regular communication between multiple departments has been essential and therefore this will be pivotal moving forward, as we start to flex our new work lives between both the home and the office.

RN: What have been the major take-aways with regards to how you do business?

C: Looking at the bigger picture is an obvious takeaway. We cannot simply focus on developing new products; we need to constantly strive towards innovative solutions to everyday life. Now that the virus is set to be a part of our life for the foreseeable future, hygiene and sanitation will continue to be a focus whilst sustainability and flame retardancy will be fundamental design principles. Ultimately, we need to retain a dynamic approach that allows us to be flexible to our customers’ changing needs.

RN: Many companies time product launches to coincide with InnoTrans, which has obviously been moved to April 2021. Are there new products Camira is bringing to market?

C: We’ll be presenting our full portfolio of fabric capabilities for railway interiors and clearly have more time to create further product responses to the new world order we now find ourselves in. We’re also looking forward to continuing to work with Deutsche Bahn who are showcasing the evolution of their concept train for the future (Ideenzug).

RN: What are the trends in the fabrics sector?

C: As mentioned above, our heightened sense of hygiene and sanitation will undoubtedly be a trend for months, if not years to come. As well as adopting more stringent cleaning and disinfection protocols, we expect rail operators will look to adapt carriage interiors to enable greater personal space for passengers. Ensuring a higher level of privacy and protection whilst being careful not to remove the inviting, homely atmosphere of the traditional carriage will be key. Naturally, hard surfaces will still combine with soft surfaces to create this look and feel, for example, plastic case seating with individual fabric screens. After all, part of the pleasure of train travel is comfort and design which textiles are a key part of. In terms of the fabrics themselves, operators will not only be keen to understand the anti-microbial properties of materials, we expect a greater emphasis to be placed on the wellbeing of passengers. Subsequently, wool moquette will continue to be a popular choice with its natural in-built health properties. For those looking for the aesthetics of a flat woven fabric with the durability of a plush moquette, we anticipate fabrics such as our Hybrid product being a hit. Hybrid is wire woven using wool making it robust and lightweight, with sustainable credentials. Expertly woven, its double-density all-loop face is designed to withstand the demands of today’s transport world with its high-performance capabilities and enhanced strength, whilst its woolrich composition enhances the air quality of rail interiors.

RN: Are customers changing what they’re asking for, a greater focus on sustainability (congratulations on winning the Green Materials category in the 2020 HiP Awards, by the way!)?

C: With an ever-increasing need to embrace sustainability in each element of our lives, operators are keen to adopt this within their designs from the offset. We strongly believe that Hybrid marks the future of transport textiles with its sustainable credentials but there are many more products within our portfolio that meet this requirement. In regards to our HiP Award win, this was actually for one of our contract fabrics. Oceanic is our very first fabric to contain recycled plastic marine waste. A revolutionary product, this takes our mission to reduce single-use plastic one step further as we have actually been producing recycled PET fabrics for over twenty years. Looking to the future, we continue to explore the possibilities of upcycling raw waste materials within our product portfolio.

Photo by Samantha Butler-Hassan

The City of Kingston has released new details on the process of the environmental remediation process underway at 661 Montreal Street. The City’s Integrated Care Hub (ICH) is scheduled to move there from Artillery Park and on Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020, and work is reportedly on track.

As the former site of Burton’s Sanitation, the property is contaminated by industrial chemical pollutants. For over a year, prior to the City’s interest in the property, owner Ben Pilon said he has been implementing environmental remediation in line with requirements laid out by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MOE). These include removing contaminated areas of soil, capping other areas of the property with clean material and installing specialized ventilation equipment.

“The project remains on track for the ICH opening on November 1st at 661 Montreal Street,” said Robert Hosier, Communications Officer for the City of Kingston.

City updates — ‘Project on track’

When a property changes from industrial to a more sensitive use, the MOE requires a Record of Site Condition (RSC) conducted by a qualified third party, to lay out its condition. A Certificate of Property Use (CPU) accompanies the RSC, and specifies the remediation required to make the site safe.

“The Certificate of Property Use is the legal instrument used to obligate the property owner to implement the risk management measures to ensure health and environmental risks are mitigated,” said Gary Wheeler of the MOE.

“During site redevelopment the various steps required within the CPU are implemented by the owner and are verified by the Qualified Person, environmental engineer at XCG Consultants,” said the City.

According to the City, the RSC at 661 Montreal St. involved the assessment and delineation of soil and groundwater contamination on the property, the removal of some hotspots of contaminated soil, and the completion of a risk assessment that is guiding remediation during redevelopment.

“These steps include, among other things, isolating the remaining soil contamination beneath a layer of clean material (either a certain thickness of fill or gravel or pavement), upgrades to the building’s ventilation system if additional stories are to be constructed, preparation of management plans and long term monitoring of environmental conditions,” said the City. “The owner’s Qualified Person inspects that these measures are completed.”

As a future leaseholder, the The City said it will also inspect to ensure that measures outlined in the CPU are satisfied. The City noted that the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks also has the ability to inspect the work being performed to complete the remediation as per the CPU.

Assessment highlights — contamination & restricted uses

According to Wheeler the CPU indicates that the the following risk management measures are required at 661 Montreal St:

Covering all areas of the site (not covered by the building) with either a paved hard surface or 1 metre of clean fill material;

Not having residential use on the main floor or below grade;

A health and safety plan for any subsurface work at the site; and

A soil and groundwater management plan for any soils or groundwater removed from the site during construction activities.

The RSC, completed by local environmental engineering firm XCG Consultants in July 2019, lists concentrations for up to 96 different contaminants in the soil and water. Many, including Mercury, Chloroform, DDT and other Petroleum Hydrocarbons were noted in high concentrations.

Wheeler said that although certain contaminants remain in the soil, the MOE concluded health risks can be fully mitigated if the measures outlined in the CPU are implemented.

“The owner’s environmental consultant conducted a risk assessment to determine the potential for risks to human health and the environment from conditions at the site. The risk assessment concluded that the risk management measures set out above would ensure that there are no risks to human health or the environment for this type of property use,” he said.

No residential use on first storey

The RSC and CPU both include clauses stating that the first storey of any building on the site should not be residential, and that the ventilation and air duct system serving the first storey should be separate from the rest of the building.

The CPU further elaborates that the first storey should not be “residential use, parkland use or institutional use, or a combination thereof.”

The City of Kingston said that the intended uses of the first storey align with this requirement.

“It is safe to occupy the first floor as a drop-in center because the type and length of stay are different than overnight accommodations,” said the City. “Additionally, short-term overnight stays are planned to occur on the second floor at this facility. The distinction is from the Provincial regulation that assesses risk based on type and length of stay inside a facility. “

The City said that a drop-in center is considered “equivalent to many other commercial uses in which a user would visit for a short period of time, but not stay overnight or for any longer-term occupancy.”

“Residential use assumes a longer stay and therefore the RSC and CPU identifies this use as applicable on the upper floors only,” said the City.

The CPU goes into further detail about the steps required for recovering the property, including the need for “continuous pathway elimination” for the contaminants, soil maintenance and inspection.

The CPU for 661 Montreal Street, CPU RA1560-16-01, is dated Friday, Feb. 8, 2019 and is signed by Travor Dagilis from the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks. XCG Consultants completed the RSC in July 2019, and the MOE filed it on Tuesday, Sep. 10, 2019. XCG Consultants indicated in the RSC that they had performed three other Environmental Assessments on the property between 2014 and 2019.

Updates coming Tuesday

The City is holding a press conference at the new ICH site on Tuesday, Oct. 20, in conjunction with HIV/Aids Regional Services (HARS), who partner with the City to operate the facility.

The ICH opened at Artillery Park in July, 2020, a temporary location that was unoccupied at the time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","The site of the new Integrated Care Hub at 661 Montreal St. on Friday, Oct. 16, 2020.

Houngbo, UN-Water Chair

We are in uncharted waters. In 2020, we have been hit by the most severe pandemic in over a century, which has triggered the deepest global recession in recent history. All of our certainties have been shaken. Around the world, people are focused on surviving a crisis that has no end in sight.

As the United Nations marks its 75th anniversary, international cooperation is clearly vital to us all.

The UN was set up in 1945 precisely to deal with global challenges like this – problems which can only be solved when we come together, see the bigger picture, put aside any differences and take action for the benefit of humanity as a whole.

The threat of coronavirus has made all of us appreciate the value of health. And that one’s own health depends on the wellbeing of those around us and the systems that protect it.

It should be no surprise that in the ‘UN75’ global public consultation, conducted throughout 2020 with over one million people, the number one finding was that most respondents’ immediate priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is improved access to basic services: healthcare, safe water and sanitation, and education.

Water and soap for handwashing, which is essential to combating the spread of this and other infectious diseases, is a first line of defence. Safe water and sanitation are fundamental both to preventing disease and to the functioning of healthcare and education, not to mention every other aspect of society, from business and industry to agriculture and the integrity of our environment.

However, 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water and 4.2 billion people worldwide live without safely managed sanitation. Global demand for water is skyrocketing, while many water sources are becoming more polluted. Manufacturing is getting thirstier, as are, energy generation, and other industries. And, climate change is making water more scarce and unpredictable, wreaking havoc and displacing millions of people.

The deadly coronavirus and its wider impacts will only exacerbate the looming global water and sanitation crisis.

As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, the consequences of chronic underinvestment in water and sanitation services are already abundantly clear. We need strong water and sanitation systems and the integrated management of water resources to sustain progress on health, education, food, energy, climate change and peace.

The extraordinary global disruption caused by the pandemic offers an opportunity to “build back better”, to focus on getting the basics in place, leaving no one behind. If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it is that we have a shared vulnerability and a common destiny.

With a shift in priorities, we can get the world on track to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, including SDG 6 – ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

This is why the UN system is setting up a global framework to accelerate progress on SDG 6. This initiative will mobilise action across governments, civil society, the private sector and the UN; better aligning efforts, optimising financing and enhancing capacity and governance.

The SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework has three novel features. First, it will increase focus on practical support that will augment impact at the country level.

Second, it embodies a clear commitment from principals of UN agencies, funds and programmes that will enable UN entities to work better together, improving the way the UN system and its partners deliver collectively.

And third, it mandates a multi-stakeholder, high-level, annual progress review to help stakeholders maintain momentum on SDG 6, and share lessons and best practices.

We have examples from many countries around the world which prove that dramatic gains in water and sanitation are possible in just a few years and that some of the solutions are inexpensive, effective and can be quickly deployed.

There is a high likelihood that COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic we see bringing the world to a halt. Next time could be much worse.

We need to do more to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce the stresses caused by population growth and economic development. Providing well-managed water and sanitation services and the facilities to practise good hygiene to the billions of people who lack them today is everyone’s problem.

The UN’s 75th anniversary comes during the biggest wake-up call humanity has ever faced. We will only escape this global crisis with a united effort.

We are in uncharted waters but the course we must set is unarguable: towards a world in which our health is protected by universal basic services. Our immediate, shared task is to accelerate progress on SDG 6 to establish water and sanitation for all people, for all purposes, to help future-proof global society against threats that loom.

Global Citizen campaigns on the United Nations’ Global Goals, including Goal 3 for the good health and well-being of all, and Goal 6 for clean water, sanitation, and hygiene. With more than 1.7 billion people impacted by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) worldwide and less than 10 years left to achieve the Global Goals, international cooperation will be essential in making significant progress. You can join us in calling on world leaders to end the neglect by taking action here.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us time and again how essential effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) management can be in preventing the spread of disease. When communities have access to safe and clean water, they’re better equipped to follow recommended public health tips and contain or prevent an outbreak of a virus.

Still, an estimated 2 billion people around the world are currently at risk of contracting COVID-19 due to limited access to effective handwashing.

And in low- and middle-income countries, where adequate facilities are often unavailable, these unsanitary conditions also create a breeding ground for other diseases to spread — diseases that have been around for much longer than COVID-19.

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are diseases of poverty that affect more than 1.7 billion people across 149 countries.

Despite this — and the fact that a whopping 2.7 billion people lack access to sanitation around the world — NTDs have historically failed to receive much attention from the global community, which is precisely why they’re considered “neglected.”

Some of them, like soil-transmitted helminths and Guinea worm disease, spread through soil, food, or water that’s been contaminated by parasites. Others, like trachoma, are transmitted through flying insects and could be prevented with regular face washing and proper disposal of human waste.

Each year, NTD cases contribute to decreased school attendance, hunger, and poverty among thousands of children — especially girls who depend on unsafe shared public resources.

The good news is that these issues could be fixed by providing access to safe facilities and drinking water sources.

Improved sanitation could reduce cases of WASH-related NTDs by as much as 78% around the world, according to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC).

Aside from leading to positive health outcomes, global WASH interventions could also help alleviate poverty and keep thousands of children in school each year.

But the connection between WASH and NTDs, although evident, has gone largely unaddressed by world leaders and decision-makers.

“The focus in the last decade has been to scale up treatments, in large part made possible through donations from pharmaceutical companies,” Dr. Claire Chaumont, measurement and evaluation program evidence director at the END Fund, told Global Citizen. “Despite progress made thus far, it does not allow communities to break the cycle of transmission of these parasites. Accelerating progress towards elimination goals will require better integration of treatment campaigns with WASH interventions.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently published a new framework to help world leaders achieve this level of integration on a global scale — but WASH still fails to make it to the top of policymakers’ list of priorities when it comes to fighting NTDs.

Some countries, like Nigeria, have recently committed to improving WASH conditions by putting an end to open defecation, marking a welcome step forward in the fight against water-borne diseases like diarrhea. Many organizations, like Water.org, a nonprofit co-founded by actor Matt Damon, are also working with families to finance solutions and improve WASH within the world’s most vulnerable communities.

But much more remains to be done, starting with substantial financial commitments from world leaders, at a time when the London Declaration on NTDs is coming to an end.

“Funding is standing in the way to an improved global WASH strategy,” April Davies, planning and performance manager for global impact at Water.org, told Global Citizen. “It will require $114 billion per year for universal access to safe water and sanitation by 2030. This is more than three times the amount that is currently invested.”

Chaumont echoed these concerns, adding that renewed financial commitments should go hand in hand with a WASH-sensitive global NTD eradication strategy.

“Ensuring that [NTDs] are high on the political agenda is a key first step to making sure that they are prioritized and addressed,” she said. “Appropriate financing is a second piece. And finally, adequate alignment with other sectors, such as WASH, will go a long way to leverage these investments towards ending these diseases.”

With just 0.6% of global health funding currently going to preventing NTDs, new commitments are desperately needed to safeguard the progress made towards their elimination. You can join us in calling on world leaders to renew the London Declaration and to mobilize new financial pledges of $1.5 billion to help accelerate progress towards by taking action here.","You can join us in calling on world leaders to end the neglect by taking action here.

Cohen, Minister of International Cooperation Dr. Rania Al Mashat, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission Director Leslie Reed visited Egypt’s Holding Company for Water and Wastewater (HCWW) and Cairo’s main water treatment plant at Rod El Farag on November 17, 2020. The U.S. Government through USAID helped establish the HCWW and Egyptian Water Regulatory Authority to improve Egypt’s ability to provide water and sanitation services.

Ambassador Cohen, Minister Al Mashat, and Mission Director Reed discussed current and planned USAID activities in the water sector with Engineer Mamdouh Raslan, the Chairman of HCWW and Mostafa Ahmed al-Shemy, the Chairman of the Cairo Potable Water Company, and met engineers and workers at the facility.

According to Ambassador Cohen, “The U.S. financed this facility and many more like it across Egypt to bring clean water and sanitation services to the Egyptian people, as part of an investment of more than $3.5 billion to help bring clean water and sanitation services to over 25 million Egyptians. This includes $243 million to expand the Central Cairo Water System, which continues to serve 5 million people every day.”

Minister Mashat said, ““Our cooperation focuses primarily on enhancing the livelihoods of Egyptian people; and engages mostly with civil society organizations and private sector. Thus, it is focused on putting people and inclusive partnerships at the core for a sustainable future,” H.E. Minister of International Cooperation, Dr. Rania Al-Mashat, stated.

Ambassador Cohen and Mission Director Reed also visited Al Azhar park and met with the Aga Khan Development Network to see how U.S. investments, through USAID, helped transform the park into a communal green space and incorporated U.S.-funded water reservoirs into the design of the park. The water reservoirs improve pressure in Cairo’s water distribution system, serve as a backup water source during high use, and also serve as a water source for the U.S.-funded pump station that supplies Manshiet Naser and Mohkattam in addition to the U.S.-funded Abbasseya Reservoir with clean drinking water.","Ambassador to Egypt Jonathan R.

Friday marked the UN’s Africa Industrialisation Day, which focuses on economic transformation and sustainable development – two areas of critical importance to South Africa, especially post-Covid-19.



Africa is home to more than 1.2 billion people – 16% of the world’s population – yet accounts for less than 2% of international trade and manufacturing.

With population growth and rapid urbanisation already putting pressure on supply levels, it’s time we all played our part to equip Africa, specifically South Africa, with the power and automation technologies to boost our economy through sustainable industrialisation.

South Africa plays a vital role in Africa’s industrial growth, but, without water, there can be no development. Water availability and economic progress are closely linked.

While there’s been some improvement in the quality of drinking water, it’s still a matter of grave concern that certain towns aren’t getting enough of it.

Hundreds of jobs are linked to water management, while access to safe drinking water and sanitation protects people from disease and enables them to attend school or go to work without disruption.

This, in turn, leads to higher levels of education and employment, which is the foundation for growth.

PROBLEMS FACING SA

South Africa is facing a growing water crisis, with dam reserves reaching unprecedented lows and municipalities increasingly faced with imposing restrictions on water usage. With global water demand expected to increase by nearly a third by 2050, the demand for clean drinking water will only escalate.

This shortage should force us as consumers to think anew about water and how we are using – or overusing – it.

According to the department of water and sanitation, the global average water consumption is 180 litres per person per day, compared with South Africa’s average of 235 litres per person per day.

Almost 3% of people in South Africa continue to live without proper sanitation, with that number increasing to 19% in rural populations, while 30% of people still lack sufficient access to running water.

While there’s been some improvement in the quality of drinking water, it’s still a matter of grave concern that certain towns aren’t getting enough of it.

There’s growing pressure on municipalities to improve water quality and implement more effective management of the entire supply chain.

Even more concerning is the management of South Africa’s treated sewage. Several rural communities are still reliant on water gathered from open sources, with many of the country’s largest rivers – such as the Vaal and Umgeni – having high contamination levels.

The most significant causes of water pollution are inadequate treatment of human waste, and inadequately managed and treated industrial and agricultural waste.

Poor water quality has a direct impact on water quantity. Polluted water that can’t be used for drinking, bathing, industry or agriculture effectively reduces the amount of useable water within a given area.

This scarcity of clean water is a clear hindrance to economic development, with the UN estimating that sub-Saharan Africa alone loses 40 billion hours per year collecting water.

MEETING THE UN’S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

So, as we mark the UN’s Africa Industrialisation Day, we reflect on its sustainable development goals, specifically goal 6, which pledges to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

To do this, we need to deliver new technologies, invest in research and development, and develop new business models and innovative collaborative schemes to make water supply, treatment and management more efficient.

There are four fundamental challenges to achieving these goals – awareness of the value of water, water scarcity, access to safe water and the amount of available freshwater globally.

Water is a global issue, but requires local solutions and, in South Africa, the need for infrastructural upgrades has never been greater.

No single technology can resolve all these issues. Instead, we must support optimisation of the entire water lifecycle for domestic, industrial and agricultural use, and strive to ensure that all water-intensive industries are collaborating to reuse water and reduce energy consumption.

A cross-sector approach is crucial, from water intake and treatment to transmission, distribution and reintroduction.

Water losses from leakages can be plugged, municipal wastewater can be treated and reused for agricultural purposes, and industrial wastewater can be treated and reused to grow food.

EXAMPLES OF PROGRESS

Progress is steadily being made across Africa through a range of water supply, treatment and transfer schemes.

Take ABB’s most recent initiative, the North-South Carrier project in Botswana, where the climate is arid, rainfall unpredictable and droughts can last for several years.

There are reservoirs in the north-east of the country. However, in the south, the population of the capital is expanding rapidly, increasing the demand for water.

Government estimates that 51% of current wastewater treatment infrastructure is in poor or critical condition, with 11% completely dysfunctional and 44% of water treatment infrastructure also in poor or critical condition.

ABB’s solutions automated and powered the 360km pipeline that carries water from the north to Gaborone, as well as pumping stations and treatment plants. As a result, the percentage of people with access to safe drinking water increased from 77% to 96%, enabling rural communities in the south to survive.

In Algeria, the challenge was meeting the daily drinking requirements of a population of 5 million people. Rainfall had been 30% below normal in recent years, forcing the country to make a potable water network one of its highest priorities.

An ambitious plan to deliver 20 desalination plants along the coast, with seven new regional hydraulic projects that link the Kerrada reservoir dam to key cities – supplying 155 million cubic metres of potable water per year – is under way.

ABB delivered the complete electrical and mechanical works of the pump station required to link Oran, Algeria’s second-largest city, to the water treatment plant.

WORKING TOGETHER TO SUCCEED

Water is a global issue, but requires local solutions and, in South Africa, the need for infrastructural upgrades has never been greater. Government estimates that 51% of current wastewater treatment infrastructure is in poor or critical condition, with 11% completely dysfunctional and 44% of water treatment infrastructure also in poor or critical condition.

This is where companies like ABB come in, working with water companies and municipalities to preserve humanity’s most precious resource through pioneering sophisticated technology and digital solutions that power the supply, treatment and transfer of water to remote communities, agricultural areas and industries.

ABB provides integrated automation and electrical solutions, instrumentation and digital services for the entire water and wastewater cycle to help plug the gap between supply and demand, and deliver a safe, reliable and efficient water supply.

Having worked in Africa for a century, ABB is committed to driving innovation and industrialisation in South Africa to provide cleaner, safer and more accessible water for all.

CANBERRA, Nov 18 2020 (IPS) - Rural communities on one of the nine islands that make up the Polynesian nation of Tuvalu are anticipating how life will change when they are connected to piped clean water for the first time. Despite being surrounded by millions of square kilometres of ocean, just over half of the 12 million people who live in the Pacific Islands region have access to clean water, the lowest of any region in the world. In remote island communities in Tuvalu, and across the region, the deficit of clean water is a major obstacle to disease prevention, lifelong health and development progress.

Pisi Seleganiu, whose family live in villages on Vaitupu Island, which is located about 120 kilometres northwest of Tuvalu’s main Funafuti Atoll, told IPS: “It very much affects their daily lives. The only source is rainwater; the issue is when it becomes dry there is no supplementary water supply. People use a lot of fuel to drive to the far end of the island to get water and bring it back to the villages.” This month work will begin on building the network of tanks and pipes which will eventually convey groundwater from wells in the north of Vaitupu Island to the 1,500 people who live in the villages of Tumaseu and Asau in the south. It’s the culmination of years of consultation between the island’s customary leaders and the regional development organisation, Pacific Community, which is headquartered in New Caledonia, about traditional knowledge of water resources.

Located in the Central Pacific Ocean between Kiribati to the northeast and Fiji to the south, Tuvalu’s estimated population of 10,580 people reside on low lying islands; the highest elevation is 4.6 metres. Surface sources of freshwater are very scarce. There are no rivers, for instance, and islanders are overwhelmingly reliant on capturing rainwater for drinking, cooking and hygiene.

“Tuvalu is blessed to have plenty of rain annually…rainwater harvesting with adequate storage is the only sustainable means to maintain supply for the population,” Uatea Salesa, project manager at the Pacific Community for the Vaitupu Water Security Project, told IPS. But he added that, during times of drought, even the rainwater wasn’t enough.

The atoll nation is highly vulnerable to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon, an alternating pattern of changes in the water temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean, known as El Niño and La Niña, that, in turn, drive warm and cool atmospheric changes and fluctuating periods of rainfall. In 2011 Tuvalu experienced a severe drought, attributed to La Niña, following months without rain, which led to the government announcing a state of emergency and supplies of freshwater being airlifted into the country by international donors.

Population growth has also increased pressures on the country’s water resources. Tuvalu has a total land area of only 26 square kilometres and a population density of 408 people per square kilometre, resulting in a huge demand for consumption of a fragile natural resource.

Boosting the country’s water security is a major priority for the Tuvalu government and, to this end, desalination has been explored.

“Desalination was installed to supplement the water supply by the government on Funafuti Island [where the capital is located] and on some of the northern islands as a backup during periods of low rainfall and during drought,” Salesa said. “But desalination is an expensive technology and will not be sustainable if it becomes an alternative source of water supply.”

Soseala Tinilau, the Tuvalu government’s director of the Department of Environment, told IPS that the challenges of managing and supplying water also included the low capacity of households to store clean water and continually maintain guttering and water tanks.

The importance of clean water for life and human, as well as national development, was stressed by Dr Stuart Minchin, director general of the Pacific Community, on World Water Day, Mar. 22, this year.

“Lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation poses a serious health risk, particularly to children, and a fundamental development constraint for Pacific nations….While access to potable water and sanitation is a basic human right that many of us take for granted, it is a right currently denied to over two thirds of Pacific Islanders, especially those in rural areas, informal communities on the fringes of the region’s growing urban areas and on the hundreds of small islands scattered across the Pacific,” Minchin stated.

Clean freshwater is an essential agent, at the moment, in the battle against COVID-19, but also in reducing the prevalence of waterborne diseases in the Pacific Islands, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are fatal illnesses for young children. And, in an island state, such as Tuvalu, which is increasingly linked to the fortunes of climate change, it’s an imperative for continued human habitation.

“Water is an issue of survival for people in Tuvalu, water is life,” Tinilau told IPS.

And in the Pacific, it’s an issue of greater magnitude in rural communities, where only 44 percent of people have access to water, compared to 92 percent in towns and cities. In Tumaseu and Asau on Vaitupu Island, villagers whose livelihoods are mostly associated with fishing, have access to health clinics and sanitation, but life is challenging without a consistently reliable source of water in the communities.

This is now set to change after technical experts from the Pacific Community drew on the traditional knowledge held by village elders of where sources of well water were located and carried out scientific investigations in 2014. It resulted in the groundwater potential on Vaitupu Island being mapped and quantified for the first time.

“We checked out where they said the location would be, the possible sites. We used technology where we passed electrical signals down to the ground and then we knew exactly where the water was, the level of the water….it was great to see the science behind the assessment actually proving the local knowledge,” Salesa told IPS.

As the elders had said, the most expansive groundwater lens was in the far north of the island, near the coast. The island council then led successful applications to secure funding from the New Zealand Government’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the construction of overhead tanks at the well site and pipes to convey water direct to the villages. Clean water is expected to be on tap in Tumaseu and Asau by June 2022.

“It will be so beneficial to implement this project. It will help to improve the status of living of people in both communities. It will make a big difference to health issues,” Seleganiu said, adding that villagers will also have more time to devote to income earning and community development activities, without the time-consuming labour of transporting supplies of water by road.","Bringing Clean Water On Tap To Rural Villages In Polynesian Island Nation Of TuvaluCANBERRA, Nov 18 2020 (IPS) - Rural communities on one of the nine islands that make up the Polynesian nation of Tuvalu are anticipating how life will change when they are connected to piped clean water for the first time.

Many of the Smiths have contributed their time, energy and money to provide and advocate for countries to have more accessible clean water.

About the Global Water Crisis

As of 2019, 844 million people do not have an accessible source of clean water. Additionally, 2.3 billion people do not have a working sanitation system. Without access to clean water or improved sanitation systems, children, women and refugees continue to be at high risk of contracting a waterborne illness and dying. More than 800 children die daily because of waterborne diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera, with diarrhea being a primary symptom. Additionally, diarrhea itself causes more than 1.5 million child deaths every year.

Currently, 43 countries face water insecurity. One of those countries is Kenya, which is located in east Africa. Kenya is also another country with a significant number of people without accessible clean water. More than 18 million people struggle for clean water in Kenya. Deaths caused by contaminated disease-filled water could be decreased by 21% if the water was clean. In addition, Ethiopia — also located in East Africa — continues to suffer water scarcity. However, it has improved because of people like Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith.

Will and Jada’s Trip to Ethiopia

The famous Hollywood couple Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith raised more than $700,000 to clean water efforts in Ethiopia in 2012. Before that, in 2010, the couple raised more than $100,000 for the non-profit organization Charity: Water. The Charity: Water organization has served more than 11 million people in 29 countries.

Jaden Smith’s Just Water

Besides making music and providing healthy vegan meals to people in need in Los Angeles, Jaden Smith has put his best foot forward to advocate for clean, more accessible water. As a founder of the sustainable Just Water brand, Jaden Smith has provided clean water to people in areas that suffer from water contamination.

Just water is 100% recyclable. The carton consists of 54% paper, 28% plant-based plastic, 3.5% aluminum and another 8.1% protective plastic film. About 1.5 million bottles can fit into just one truck, allowing for less pollution. The brand contributes less to pollution because it reduces its use of emissions, uses organic packaging, uses hydroelectric power and uses renewable energy.

Just Water’s water is 100% spring water. The spring water used comes from the Glen Falls watershed in New York State. The Just Water organization has helped places like Flint, Michigan, where roughly 9,000 people have been exposed to unsafe lead-contaminated water. Flint, Michigan has been adapting to Just Water‘s mobile filtration system and has received donations from the company. In addition, they have also been working to replace water lines to avoid lead contamination.

The Smiths’ contributions with Charity: Water and Just Water have helped millions of people. Water is an essential resource for living a healthy lifestyle. Even with the donations, there are people around the world still suffering from contaminated water and waterborne illnesses. However, the Smiths have been recognized by organizations like Charity: Water and by the millions of people for the work they have done.

The recommendation by the Committee would help the States/ UTs so that they can use these technologies depending on their requirement and suitability. These technologies were appraised at different levels before consideration and recommendation by the technical committee.

The Ministry of Jal Shakti gives primacy to the infusion and deployment of innovative technological solutions to realise the ambitious objective of the Jal Jeevan Mission to provide functional household tap connection to every rural home by 2024 with speed and scale while tackling the diverse challenges encountered during implementation.

Under the Mission, innovative proposals are sought online for assisting the States/UTs to adopt innovative technologies to deliver drinking water services to rural communities of adequate quantity and prescribed quality. Various challenges being faced during implementation of the Mission include variations in regional endowment of water resources & levels of service provision, water quality challenges, convergence with the sanitation sector and dealing with grey water/ sludge issues etc.

To address these challenges and to consider and recommend innovative 'field level solution' technologies, a multi-disciplinary Technical Committee, chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India with members from NITI Aayog, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Bio-Technology, CSIR, DRDO, NEERI, IIT, National Institute of Ocean Technology, States, etc, was constituted. The Committee focused on application of Science and Technology (S&T) for providing field level solutions, which would be helpful to the implementing agencies in the States/ UTs.

India is set to be one of the three countries to witness maximum urban growth by 2050, along with China and Nigeria. In India's case, this fast pace of urbanisation at an annual rate of 2.1 per cent coupled with a high growth in economic activities — if not supported with commensurate sustainable solutions — is bound to compound the water and sanitation challenges in the country's urban areas. Indian cities are currently plagued by multiple challenges to water, sanitation and hygiene.

At present, 163 million people do not have access to safe drinking water, while 210 million people lack access to improved basic sanitation in India. India is currently at the bottom of 122 countries in the Water Quality Index (WQI) — at 120 — with nearly 70 per cent of water sources are contaminated.

WQI is an important tool to determine the drinking water quality in urban, rural and industrial areas. Water and sanitation are getting a lot of traction in the world, owing to the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. India has to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including Goals 6, 11 and 12 that talk about sanitation, sustainable cities and sustainable consumption and keep pace with the rest of the countries as well.

The same is reflected through the union government's programmes and schemes that have captured the world's attention in their efforts to provide safe drinking water and sanitation services. The stage is being set for modernising and expanding services which make quality addition to life.","Various challenges being faced during implementation of the Mission include variations in regional endowment of water resources & levels of service provision, water quality challenges, convergence with the sanitation sector and dealing with grey water/ sludge issues etc.

Women are most likely to face these injuries because fetching water is considered a woman’s (and sometimes children’s) job.

“We wanted to better understand the true burden of water insecurity,” Dr. Jo-Anne Geere, from the University of East Anglia, said in a statement. “Millions of people don’t have the luxury of clean drinking water at their home, and they face many dangers before the water even touches their lips. Global research on water has largely focused on scarcity and health issues related to what is in the water, but the burden and risks of how water is retrieved and carried have been overlooked until now.”

Researchers surveyed more than 6,000 households globally to understand where and how respondents experienced injuries while fetching water. Thirteen percent of respondents reported water-fetching injuries. Most injuries occurred due to falls on dangerous terrain that led to fractures and dislocations, mostly of lower limbs. Other injuries included spinal injuries and lacerations. Other causes of injuries included traffic accidents, animal attacks, and fights while waiting in queue for water.

Water Theft Is a Critical Global Problem, and It’s Only Going to Get Worse

Almost 40% of women who live in rural India step out to fetch water for their homes daily, according to a survey from Gaon Connection, a rural news publication. From this group, 16% walk distances ranging from 1 to 5 kilometers to fetch water. Women balance multiple pots of water on their heads and have to walk back and forth to fetch water up to three times a day, which increases health problems and lowers life expectancy.

“[The report] highlights the importance of safe interventions that prioritize personal physical safety alongside traditional global indicators of water, sanitation, and hygiene,” Professor Paul Hunter, study author from the University of East Anglia, said in the statement.

“It’s really important that data on water-fetching injuries are systematically collected so that we can know the true burden of water insecurity. Currently, all of the broken bones, spinal injuries, lacerations, and other physical injuries are not accounted for in calculations about the burden of water insecurity,” Vidya Venkataramanan, Ph.D., a study author from Northwestern University, added.","Women are most likely to face these injuries because fetching water is considered a woman’s (and sometimes children’s) job.

Stephanie Chang to make sure that Michigan residents have access to clean, safe water. SB 241 would maintain Gov. Whitmer’s water restoration order and make sure Michiganders’ water is not shut off while we battle Covid-19. The Legislature should extend the bill as written and pass it immediately to protect the health of Michigan residents.

Having access to clean water is essential for basic sanitation. The Centers for Disease Control’s guidance on protection from COVID-19 calls for frequent and thorough hand washing to protect yourself and others from spreading the virus. As the CDC notes, COVID-19 spreads easily from person to person, and washing your hands reduces the likelihood that you or others become infected.

For those who cannot afford their water bills, shutoffs not only endanger their lives, but the lives of others they come in contact with. Clean and available water is essential to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

This is not a novel idea. Early in the pandemic, 29 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, DC recognized the importance of accessible, clean water in fighting COVID-19. They protected their residents from water shutoffs.

In the 23 days since the Michigan Supreme Court decision, some of Gov. Whitmer’s executive orders have been restored by the Legislature. Water protection has not been one of them.

Families are again at risk of losing access to water solely because they cannot afford their water bills – a particular challenge in light of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.

While the Michigan Legislature authorized the use of $25 million in CARES Act funds for easing some of the financial burden of the cost of water, these resources expire at the end of the year and only provide a patchwork of relief across the state. The funds only applied to water utilities that volunteered to participate -- which at this point is a mere 130 of 1,400 water systems.

Sen. Chang’s bill provides a statewide solution for ensuring all Michiganders have access to clean water during this pandemic. This is especially crucial because the pandemic is expected to last well into next year, even in the most favorable scenarios.

Losing access to clean water is coming at a time when confirmed COVID-19 cases are at their highest level ever in Michigan, higher than they were at the time Gov. Whitmer issued her water restoration order on March 28.

Fortunately, the Legislature can do something. They can pass State Sen. Chang’s Senate Bill 241, extend it beyond year end and ensure it’s implemented at least until we have a safe and widely accessible vaccine.

When the Michigan Supreme Court struck down Gov. Whitmer’s emergency orders, many elected officials committed to work in partnership with the Governor.

Now is their chance. Legislators should not deny their constituents a crucial protection to help slow COVID-19. This is an issue that impacts every Michigan community.

As someone who has spent her life working to improve health and health care in Michigan and beyond, I urge lawmakers to vote “Yes” on Sen. Chang’s water shut-off moratorium bill, so we can keep the water running and protect Michiganders from this potentially deadly virus.","Senate Bill 241 has been introduced by Sen.

Although global progress towards the UN's SDGs remains insufficient to meet the 2030 deadline, the UK is among the nations leading the way on alignment and, as such, is a prime market for impact investment.

The analysis, from Refinitiv, saw the UK receiving top marks for SDGs 2: Zero Hunger; 3: Good Health & Wellbeing; 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and 7: Affordable and clean energy.

Additionally, three-quarters of British firms believe they have a role to play in furthering national and international progress against the SDGs.

This new report features a current state of play on the SDG 7 and the global shift to clean energy and features a foreword from the REA's chief executive Dr Nina Skorupska on how clean energy can be at the heart of a green industrial revolution.

“Never before has our world needed a sustainable, affordable energy strategy for the future as now, with Covid-19 continuing to show just how vulnerable our precious, connected planet can be,” Skorupska said in the report.

“We must waste no time in forging a green economic recovery that will be sufficiently durable to meet the fast-evolving needs of today, whilst lasting enough to avoid compromising those of future generations.”

Bryt Energy's sales and marketing director David Taylor is also on hand in the report, outlining how new innovations are transforming the energy sector to the benefit of society.

The new water treatment systems can help provide up to 4,000 liters of clean water per hour and has a total production capacity of 96,000 liters per day. This will enable more than 4,000 locals per day to receive safe water for drinking and hand washing.

The Grundfos systems were launched on October 29 in Baseco Compound. Representatives from the community, Grundfos Philippines, and ASSIST attended the event.

Grundfos Foundation Executive Director Kim Nøhr Skibsted said seeing the water and sanitation requirements of Baseco Compound has been an “eye-opener” for the group, inspiring them to help more communities get access to clean water.

“Critical life sources such as clean water and sanitation facilities have always been imperative. It is needed now more than ever as lack of access to these basic needs may bring greater health risks to communities and make them highly susceptible to the spread of diseases such as COVID-19,” she said.

Meanwhile, Grundfos Philippines General Manager Jonathan Breton underscored how the water treatment systems can help residents of the compound gain skills through livelihood training.

“These water systems are not only sustainable with respect to the environment but will also ensure financial stability of its operations through the social enterprises being built around it. This will in the long-run support its operations and provide livelihood opportunities for the residents of Baseco,” he said in a statement.

The Kabalikat sa Pag-unlad ng Baseco People’s Organization will be leading a community cooperative of water business and health-related livelihood such as soap-making. Net proceeds from these activities will go to information campaigns and trainings in the community.

Grundfos Philippines and ASSIST said they are working on scaling up this project by installing more water purification systems in Baseco along with other partners.","Baseco Compound, one of the largest and densest slums in Manila, gained access to clean water supply with two new water treatment systems given by a Danish foundation.

PHOENIX, Nov. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Electrolux, a global leader in household appliances and appliances for professional use, and Planet Water Foundation, a non-profit organization addressing global water poverty, have moved together in response to the unprecedented flooding in Banteay Meanchey Province, Cambodia.

Extreme rainfall typhoons since early October in Cambodia have caused unprecedented deadly floods and landslides. In the worst-hit province of Banteay Meanchey, over 4,200 families have been forced to evacuate and are currently living in makeshift tents positioned on the main highways which are elevated above their flooded villages. Access to food, water, and basic sanitation has been a major struggle for these families.

Electrolux immediately responded to the critical need for potable water by sponsoring two Planet Water AquaBlock systems that produce 1,500 liters of clean water per hour. Under the direction of the Banteay Meanchey Provincial authorities, Planet Water's Cambodia team, over the past several days, have mobilized the water supply systems to support 3,632 families (16,344 people) in the Bot Trang and Se Soen emergency encampments in Banteay Meanchey.

This builds on the partnership established earlier this year to bring access to clean, safe water to schools in six communities across Indonesia and the Philippines, with funding provided by Electrolux in 2020.

""Our hearts and thoughts go out to the families and communities affected by the terrible flooding in Banteay Meanchey. We are thankful for the opportunity to support the emergency efforts. In times like this every single bit of support helps and we hope that our contribution will improve the daily lives of this community as they go through these challenging times,"" says Adam Cich, CEO, Electrolux APAC & MEA.

""Fast response is critical in emergencies like this, and thanks to Electrolux's support, Planet Water was able to mobilize our systems and deliver access to clean water to impacted communities within 48 hours,"" said Mark Steele, Founder and CEO of Planet Water Foundation.""

This year, as the UK faces continued restrictions, churches meeting virtually can join together to use WaterAid’s online resources, which include fundraising ideas and youth group activities.

WaterAid aims to raise £3 million to help transform thousands of lives in Ethiopia and across the world. If church groups give before 4 February 2021, their donation will be matched by the UK government, up to £2 million, doubling the impact in communities across Ethiopia.

Globally, 785 million people don’t have clean water. In Ethiopia, nearly two-thirds of people live without this basic human right, including those in Frat, where families spend hours each day collecting dirty water from a river at the bottom of a hill.

The community, which is diverse but not divided with Christians and Muslims living side by side and supporting each other to stay strong in the face of adversity. However, our changing climate is making life harder, with unpredictable weather threatening crops – their only source of income.

WaterAid’s Christmas appeal will help people like 12-year-olds Yenus and Ansha from Frat who spend hours every day fetching dirty water when they could be studying, helping fulfil their potential.

For Yenus, even though each sip could lead to serious illness, it’s all his family has to drink, cook and wash with. Without a reliable source of water, his whole family is at the mercy of the changing climate. Yenus’ father recently lost his entire crop of chillies because the rains failed. Before that, there was too much rain that washed away all the crops in the village.

At the school where Ansha and Yenus attend, they are often thirsty as there’s no water to drink and nowhere to wash their hands, leaving them vulnerable to disease.

Ansha said:

“We go to collect water in the morning and so sometimes I’m late to school. If I miss lessons, I have to catch up from friends, which is difficult. It’s hard work collecting water; we usually help each other to pick up the jerry cans as they’re very heavy. If I didn’t have to spend time collecting water, I’d have more time to play with my friends and do my homework.”

In partnership with the local community, WaterAid will dig a borehole to reach clean spring water, which will then be pumped uphill using renewable solar energy to a new 75,000-litre reservoir. By raising £140, churches could pay to install a solar panel, while £620 could build a handwashing point at a school.

Match funding from the UK government will be used to bring sustainable water, toilet and hygiene facilities to communities in Berbere, which like Frat, is one of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable areas in Ethiopia. The project will include constructing flood-resistant community water points and accessible water and sanitation facilities in schools and health centres, as well as training communities to manage the facilities.

By supporting Future on Tap, church congregations can make sure communities like Frat and Berbere can rely on clean water, today and every day.

Marcus Missen, Director of Communications and Fundraising at WaterAid, said:

“Christmas will be very different this year but we can all still come together, even if just virtually, to help make a difference to people’s lives across the world. “A reliable source of clean water improves lives and livelihoods, and is the first line of defence against the impact of our changing climate. Clean water means future generations can stay safe and healthy, whatever tomorrow brings. Now more than ever, we need to make clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene a normal part of everyday life for everyone, everywhere. We invite church congregations to play their part and join our Future on Tap campaign to help thousands get access to clean water they can rely on today and every day.”

To support the appeal, WaterAid has produced a range of free educational and fundraising resources which can be used virtually if churches are closed: a case study, poster, youth group activities, fundraising ideas and a 2021 wall calendar for groups to display.

She says villagers sometimes have to travel long distances on foot to carry buckets of water to their homes but this will be a problem of the past.","Villagers in Nairaviravi, Naivutu and Navuniyaugunu in Ra will no longer have to cart water from a spring a kilometer away.
This after the Fiji Water Foundation in partnership with Rotary Pacific Water for Life Foundation commissioned three new water projects that will bring clean drinking water to nearly 400 villagers in Ra.

Cleaning your makeup brushes regularly is always necessary, experts told us, and right now, it might be more critical than ever before because of Covid. ""Dirty brushes can become breeding grounds for bacteria, and when used again on your face can lead to breakouts or skin irritations,"" said Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist. She noted dirty brushes and sponges could spread bacteria, yeast and viral infections like herpes or pink eye. The combination of dirt and oils from your skin and caked makeup can clog your pores and lead to acne, too. And while there are a slew of skin care products made for acne-prone skin — sunscreen, Differin gel and salicylic acid — washing your brushes can help prevent the spread of acne-causing bacteria in the first place. So, it's best to take preventative measures when possible, experts urge. Additionally, King noted, dirty makeup sponges and brushes could cause your makeup to apply unevenly or with streaks.

So what about Covid and makeup brushes? Since applying makeup involves close contact with our eyes, King explained that it might mean contact with the mucosal surface of our eyes, nose or mouth — especially if not applied carefully. “If we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our mucosa [mucus membrane], then, theoretically, the virus could be passed from the surface to the hands to the mucosa — but we don't know exactly how likely that is, particularly with something like a makeup brush,” she said.

Given the above and if you’re inclined to elevate your makeup brush cleaning routine or convinced to begin one, what's the best way to clean your makeup brushes and Beautyblenders? To find out, I also consulted in-demand makeup artists to learn how and what products they use to sanitize their kit essentials during the age of Covid. I also share a few of my favorite products I've come to rely on over the last eight months to clean my collection of 70-plus makeup brushes.

Best products to clean your makeup brushes

Scott Barnes, a celebrity makeup artist and founder of his namesake cosmetics line, and Andie Markoe-Bryne, a makeup artist in New York, recommended Cinema Secrets Makeup Brush Cleaner. ""To clean my brushes (or any brush), I use Cinema Secrets Makeup Brush Cleaner, to disinfect and get rid of excess product in the brush immediately after use,"" said Barnes. Afterward, he deep cleans with Dawn Dish Soap and lukewarm water. The LA-based artist said it helps with tough-to-remove makeup like creams from brushes. A general rule of his for disinfecting tools is using something with 70 percent alcohol, which is aligned with the CDC's guidance on hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. ""If you use something that is 90 percent [alcohol], it dries too fast and doesn't accurately disinfect the brush,"" said Barnes. Cinema Secrets claims its highly-rated product — it holds a 4.3-star rating from more than 1,000 Sephora reviews — is an antimicrobial disinfectant that cleans your brushes quickly, no-rinse required, which is why the makeup artists we consulted keep it handy when working. You pour a little bit of the blue liquid into a bowl or dish, dip your entire brush or just the tips into the product and it melts the makeup off your tools.

Markoe-Bryne uses a three-step system. After utilizing Cinema Secrets Cleaner, she uses antibacterial soap and recommended using a soap bar for synthetic bristle brushes and liquid soap for fluffy brushes to help remove concealer and lipstick. ""You can really rub all the product out to the center of the brush,"" she said. After letting her brushes dry overnight, she disinfects them in her UV sanitizer of choice, the 59S sterilizer box, as a preventative step. She added that after removing the products, she'll wipe the inside and outside of the box down with rubbing alcohol and uses the gadget to sanitize her phone, too. King recommended placing a few drops of antibacterial soap on your finger or toothbrush to scrub brush bristles and crevices. You can rinse your beauty tools with warm water and then allow the brush head to air dry overnight. Look for a gentle option such as this clean-smelling antibacterial soap from Dial. I've been buying it for as long as I can remember, and it's gentle enough not to strip moisture from my hands after washing. The soap is also highly-rated on Amazon with a 4.7-star average rating from more than 1,340 reviews.

""UV light devices are worth purchasing because they are known to be effective and have already been in use pre-Covid for sanitation purposes,"" Ehsan Ali, MD, of Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor Inc, previously told NBC News Shopping. During our chat, he noted that UV sanitizers could disinfect various items, ranging from makeup brushes and retainers to face masks and sunglasses. After speaking with Ali, I discovered this top-rated UV sanitizer on Amazon that was designed to fit up to six baby bottles. Although I can't fit my iPad Pro in there, it can store my reusable water bottles, facemasks, keys, smartphone and Beats by Dre headphones, just not at the same time. The gadget enables me to clean my belongings in as little as 10 minutes or sanitize and dry my items in 40 minutes. There's also a button to sanitize for a full 24 hour period, too — it sanitizes and dries for 50 minutes, then every two hours (up to 24 hours), it sanitizes in your belongings for two minutes.

My go-to liquid makeup brush cleanser is from Sigma Beauty because the brand claims it is an antimicrobial formula and I find that it removes residual makeup from my synthetic and natural bristle brushes and Beautyblenders with ease. It's also a fragrance- and sulfate-free formula made with natural ingredients like virgin coconut oil and certified sustainable palm oil, which is always a win in my book. While cleansing, I like to rub the brush bristles into the Sigma brush cleaning mat to get into all of the nooks and crannies of my tools and hang them bristle side-down in the Sigma Dry'n Shape, which looks like a tiered wedding cake.

RESIDENTS of five villages in the Omundaungilo Constituency now have clean potable water after the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform erected water tanks that are filled from boreholes in the area.

The water is sourced from the Ohangwena Aquifer 2 through boreholes than piped to the villages of Eexwa, Okalundwena, Ohehonge, Onaupanya, and Eneepinga.

Agriculture minister Calle Schlettwein, during a familiarisation visit to the Ohangwena Region, said that there are a number of boreholes drilled in Aquifer 2 and there is no need to treat or purify it as it is good water.

Schlettwein stated that Aquifer 2 is being developed and it’s being done in stages considering the recharge and inflow of water from Angola.

Regional Head of Water Supply and Sanitation Coordinator in Ohangwena region Lazarus Shikololo said the borehole water supply scheme cost government N$3 million of which N$600 000 was spent on drilling and N$ 2.4 million was spent on the installation process.

Shikololo stated that the drilling of the boreholes kicked off during August, while the installation of the water infrastructure was done in September.

Vilho Teofelus headman of Ohehonge said the installation of the infrastructure and boreholes has seen water reaching their areas and that all people now have access to clean water.

“We used to make use of ponds, wells, and earth dams, but now that has become a thing of the past,” said Teofelus.

Eufemia Shitaleni, a resident of Eneepinga, said they are thankful to the government for providing them with clean water.

“We no longer have to consume water from dirty sources where we had to purify ourselves, take our animals for drinking and washing, and bathing,” said Shitaleni.

She added that they mostly used to depend on water sourced from oshanas, self-made earth dams, and ponds found in the areas.","Maria DavidRESIDENTS of five villages in the Omundaungilo Constituency now have clean potable water after the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform erected water tanks that are filled from boreholes in the area.

Heck, we love the stuff so much that we sometimes come around for another cup hours later just to stave off the afternoon slump. Yes, coffee is both our salvation and a beacon of hope, so we really do owe a great debt of gratitude to the appliance that makes caffeine magic happen with minimal effort, aka the coffee machine. But sadly, we haven’t been caring for this handy kitchen appliance as well as it cares for us, so it’s time to right the wrong. What’s the first step? Read our guide on how to clean a coffee maker and start doing it on the regular.

How often should I clean my coffee maker...and do I really have to?

Let’s start with that last bit: Yes, you definitely, absolutely have to clean your coffee maker. Why? Because according to a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) study, your trusty brewing buddy just might be the germiest thing in your kitchen.

Your coffee maker is a prime breeding ground for mold and bacteria due to the fact that it comes in regular contact with water, followed by heat and trapped humidity. In other words, things can get pretty gross, which is why the NSF says you should wash the removable parts of your coffee maker daily as well as give the chamber a deep clean once per month. The first part is self-explanatory, but you’ll want to read on for detailed instructions about how to deal with the harder-to-access areas of the machine.

The Auditor-General also recommended stronger oversight at some entities to ensure audit that outcomes improve.

Vacancies at senior levels have also been highlighted as a challenge.

Over the last five years, not a single entity in the national Department of Human Settlement has managed to obtain a clean audit.



On Friday, the Auditor-General (AG) briefed Parliament on the 2019/20 audit outcomes of the department and its entities.

The entities include the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC), the Estate Agency Affairs Board (EAAB), National Housing Finance Corporation (NHFC), and the Community Schemes Ombud Service.

Londoloza Songwevu, audit manager at the AG, said in his presentation that the department needed stronger leadership.

He said:

Leadership is required to set the right tone and provide the necessary oversight support in ensuring that the audit outcomes of the portfolio as a whole improve. The NHBRC and NHFC's material misstatements in the financial statements were corrected by management, resulting in an unqualified, with findings, audit opinion. This can be attributed to inadequate and lack [of] timely review processes, as well as the ineffective use of the internal audit function.

The CSOS and EAAB both received a qualified opinion because of inadequate controls and processes around revenue management.

""Both entities have no permanent chief financial officer appointed. The NDHS submitted financial statements with no errors, and did not material (sic) contravene laws and regulations that govern financial matters. However, the systems and processes to ensure performance information reported is useful and reliable require improvement,"" he said.

At the EAAB, Songwevu said, revenue was materially understated.

""[As] penalties for late renewals of fidelity fund certificates by estate agents were not always raised. The qualification in 2018/19 on commitments has been resolved. [At the] CSOS, similar to prior years, revenue is materially understated as not all levies from community schemes were identified and collected. Though still qualified, some improvement were noted towards addressing the finding,"" he said.

Irregular expenditure has also decreased dramatically.

In the 2018/19 financial year, R48 million was recorded as irregular expenditure. That amount has, however, decreased to R14 million in the 2019/20 year.

""The majority was caused by contravention of supply chain management legislation through deviations and irregularities in the procurement process at the NHBRC, CSOS and the EAAB, as well as NHFC's continued use of contracts after expiry dates,"" he said.

Fruitless and wasteful expenditure, albeit low for both financial years, also decreased from R2 million in 2018/19 to R1 million in 2019/20.

""The majority of the disclosed fruitless and wasteful expenditure for the current year was caused by interest and penalties charged on late payment to creditors at NHFC,"" Songwevu said.

The train had traveled just 50 kilometers from its starting station. I found out that the washbasin is dirty. Many people spit into it after chewing gutkha and paan. Sighting it, a passenger said, ""Railway is not aware of sanitation"". ""Should not it be cleaned because we have paid the fare for traveling?"" I wondered after listening to this comment.

In the same way, I have to move to my office by passing a railway foot-over bridge every day. The bridge looks dirty because many people are spitting at that place. The cleaning staff cleans it up using acid and water. The bridge is just a hundred meters long, but individuals are not taking care of it.

At present, when I have to go to the bus stand I feel afraid. I imagine anyone sitting in the bus could spit out from the window. That's why I go there carefully. I have witnessed a quarrel about this on the bus stand many times when a passenger accidentally spits on a passer-by.

In our community, every family makes an effort to maintain their residence clean and beautiful, but the same person when in public places has a different attitude. Using plastic carry bags and not disposing of properly, is common.

Sometimes, people would throw garbage, leftover food, pointed items, broken glass, and poisonous substances openly in plastic bags.

This behaviour is harmful to our environment and creates a threat to animals, birds because they may unknowingly eat it and die. The garbage collection authorities are requesting people to collect dry and wet waste in different dustbins, but many of us do not follow it seriously.

The conditions of public conveniences are also inadequate. It is found dirty and people do not use it decently. Even, I saw in government offices that the toilets were untidy. No one could lead the initiative to clean the toilet.

In 2017, the Hindi language comedy-drama film 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' was released and became a success.

The movie delivered a solid message to improve sanitation conditions, with an emphasis on the eradication of open defecation, especially in rural areas. It expresses the actual situation of rural areas, where women are facing numerous troubles due to the unavailability of toilets.

This year, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic vindicates the significance of sanitation and personal hygiene. Many people follow the guidelines and preventive measures issued by the government. At the same time, many others violate the protocols involving the wearing of masks and social distancing, which is the best way to avoid this pandemic. The state governments have banned spitting in public places, but citizens are still not taking it thoughtfully.

Swachh Bharat Mission is a revolutionary movement introduced by the Government of India. The mission displays positive results continuously. For the year 2020, Indore was adjudged India's cleanest city for the fourth straight year, while Surat and Navi Mumbai grabbed the second and third positions respectively, as the Centre announced the results of its latest annual cleanliness survey.

The father of the nation - Mahatma Gandhi said once, ""Sanitation is more important than independence"". Today, after seven decades of independence, his dream of a clean India is still unfulfilled. Sanitation is not a personal issue, it is indirectly reflected in our socio-economic development and to reach the identity and dignity of the forthcoming generations. Cleanliness is not a responsibility of the government only, it is also our duty to live healthily.

Positive and collective steps can change society's attitude towards sanitation. Our responsibility is necessary to sustain the country's beauty.

Twice a month, American comedian, musician, writer, actor, activist, juggler, and publisher Ngaio Bealum—host of the Netflix show Cooking on High and trivia app Daily Bonfire—answers Leafly reader questions on cannabis, regarding personal use, family, community, state, and country. After a stressful election, it’s time to clean up, and that includes the old bong.

Question:

Dear, Ngaio,

What is your glass pipe and bong cleaning regimen? Some people’s glass is NASTY.

—Roz N. Tarr

Answer:

Roz,

You got that right. And no one wants to place their mouth on someone’s nasty glass. Gross.

I’m a simple man, Roz. All I need is some isopropyl alcohol (at least 70%; 90% is even better), a little table salt, and some elbow grease. Isopropyl alcohol should be easy enough to find, now that the hoarding has passed, or you can find some bong-specific cleaners online or at the local head shop.

Here’s how to clean a bong:

Pour some salt and alcohol into your piece. Plug the holes. Shake it like a Polaroid picture. The iso and salt should dissolve and scrub away most of your guck and grime. Use a pipe cleaner if you have to get into some nooks and crannies. Rinse your piece with warm water, air dry, and you should be good to go.

We double-checked our method with a sanitation expert, too. “I think that is a relatively safe suggestion,” said Josh Wurzer, SC Labs president and co-founder. “In a pinch, ethanol would work as well. I use acetone, as it works far better than anything else, but it is a little gnarly for the amateur. If you don’t rinse properly it’s going to hurt your lungs.”

Clean your Mobius NUC matrix diffuser after every session. (David Downs/Leafly)

Lastly, if you aren’t in a hurry, you can just soak your piece in some alcohol overnight or for a few days, and then give it a rinse. Have fun! And remember to change your bong water every day, or even every few hours if you smoke all day.

Peace, Ngaio

Question:

Dear, Ngaio,

Weed salads: Are they good? My homie is devoutly anti-salad. He says that the terp combos can be overwhelming, but I love an expertly paired blend. This Sunday it was Papaya Punch + Squirt for bluntch. Thoughts?

—Mina JaVerde

Answer

Dear, Mina,

I personally love a good mix: whether it’s an old school thing, like, everyone throwing a nug into the pile to roll a fat “stoned soup” doobie; or meticulously picking the perfect strains and flavors to make a restaurant-quality, “medley of fall terps, wrapped with natural hemp” fancy-pants joint, er, pre-roll.

“The goal is to create a flavor greater than the sum of its parts.” —Ngaio Bealum, on weed salads

Blending different cannabis strains is just like blending wines: The goal is to create a flavor greater than the sum of its parts. Blends are actually showing up in the commercial market these days, with companies like Perfect Blends creating pre-rolls geared to create specific effects like sleepiness or the giggles.

I would say that your homie is missing out on some good flavors and effects and should maybe be hella mindful when um, tossing a salad.

Try mixing a high-CBD strain with something containing a bunch of pinene for an “active, but not anxious” sort of feel.

I also like to roll one with the strains lined up instead of mixed, so I can try to tell when the flavors change. But hey, if your friend doesn’t want to mix his weeds together, there’s no shame. Just more for us.

Best, Ngaio

458,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/cleantech/electric-vehicles-renewable-fuels-can-coexist-in-a-clean-energy-future,"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,"Electric Vehicles, Renewable Fuels Can Coexist in a Clean Energy Future","The future of alternative energy will not be based on a single solution. Options are much more likely to include “all of the above” answers, using both electricity and proven alternatives such as biodiesel.

Across the United States, more than 70 percent of all goods used in our daily lives — from food to manufactured products — are transported to our stores and homes by trucks. As the nation’s demand for goods continues to reach record levels, cities are facing an increase in congestion, noise and air pollution.

Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are the second-largest contributor to US transportation emissions. Interest is high in zero-emission electric vehicles to transform the movement of goods. While Tesla and other manufacturers have made inroads in the US passenger vehicle market, electric trucks are still in their infancy. Wood Mackenzie, a global research and consulting firm, estimates there were about 2,000 electric trucks on US roads at the end of last year.

As organizations look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in their transportation operations, biodiesel offers environmental benefits today.

“Biodiesel continues to have a significant niche in the fuels market because it increases energy security, improves air quality and the environment, and provides safety benefits,” says Linda Bluestein, co-director of Clean Cities in the US Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office. The office seeks to form partnerships between government, private and nonprofit organizations to advance alternative fuels and petroleum-displacement methods.

“Fuel diversity is extremely important for energy security, resiliency, innovation and affordability,” she added. And achieving a diverse fuel supply depends on exploring new options — such as electricity, compressed natural gas and hydrogen — without abandoning proven alternative fuel solutions available today, such as biodiesel.

The transition to a zero-emission future will be a paradigm shift — requiring greater collaboration among fleets, truck manufacturers, utilities and policymakers. The development of charging infrastructure also is a significant hurdle.

“Because of the buzz around electric vehicle technologies today, people often think they are going to come in and wipe the slate clean,” says Bailey Arnold, senior manager of clean air initiatives at the American Lung Association. “But we likely will have diesel-powered vehicles on the road well into the future, so we will need liquid fuels to power these vehicles. That’s why we need to embrace cleaner-burning liquid fuel solutions — like biodiesel — that are right here, right now.”

Biodiesel has already been down the path of investment and acceptance that electric vehicles have just begun.

In June 2000, biodiesel became the first and only alternative fuel to have successfully completed the Tier I and Tier II Health Effects testing requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The biodiesel industry invested more than $2 million and four years into the health-effects testing program, with the goal of setting biodiesel apart from other alternative fuels and increasing consumer confidence in biodiesel.

The quality has gotten better and better. Biodiesel blends must meet 23 minimum standards created by ASTM International designed to enhance the safety and quality of the fuel — petroleum diesel has to meet 14 standards. Biodiesel is higher in cetane for reduced smoke and is naturally sulfur-free, meeting limits of 15 parts per million or less.

A biodiesel federal income tax credit was first adopted in 2005 to encourage distribution. The tax credit has been extended several times, most recently in December through 2022.

Biodiesel has proven its value as an affordable alternative fuel option for fleets. It is a domestically produced, clean-burning and renewable substitute for petroleum diesel and can be used in diesel vehicles without engine modification or changes in fuel infrastructure.

Comparing vehicle fuel options

The future of alternative energy will not be based on a single solution. Options are much more likely to include “all of the above” answers, using both electricity and proven alternatives such as biodiesel.

“Biodiesel can continue to have a significant niche in the fuels market,” Bluestein said. “This will allow it to increase resiliency, lower certain emissions, and provide a fuel with great performance and emissions profiles for on- and off-road purposes.”","The future of alternative energy will not be based on a single solution.
Interest is high in zero-emission electric vehicles to transform the movement of goods.
The office seeks to form partnerships between government, private and nonprofit organizations to advance alternative fuels and petroleum-displacement methods.

Under this partnership, at least five million Ghanaian households will benefit from environmentally friendly cookers and solar-generated electricity. However, it will take a few more weeks for the agreement to come into force, as it will not come into force until the beginning of 2021.

The partnership will catalyse private sector investment in Ghana’s National Energy Access Programme (NCEP), complementing Ghana’s contributions to the Paris agreement through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Ghana is also exploring the possibility of integrating other initiatives into the agreement signed with Switzerland.

“We hope that this bilateral agreement will enable Ghana’s national clean energy access programme to meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2 million tonnes, giving millions of people access to energy and moving towards a green recovery,” says Achim Steiner, UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) Administrator and environmental policy expert.

On the Ghanaian side, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, called on the private sector of both countries to “consider this bilateral cooperation as a step to strengthen collaboration between Swiss and Ghanaian companies to identify commercially viable and sustainable development projects for the next decade”.

The agreement between Switzerland and Ghana will enable the development of solar energy projects for commercial and industrial clients, thus enabling Ghanaian companies to take action on climate change. In accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the cooperation between the two partners will set a precedent for other African countries to explore innovative climate financing solutions.

As a reminder, Article 6 of the Paris agreement states that “developing countries and small island states may establish and communicate low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, plans and measures appropriate to their particular circumstances”.

460,https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/private-public-partnership-to-use-nuclear-energy-for-clean-hydrogen-production/,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",KTLA,Private-public partnership to use nuclear energy for clean hydrogen production,"The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded just under $14 million for an attempt to build a hydrogen-energy production facility at a nuclear power plant in Minnesota with the help of a nuclear research lab in Idaho.

Idaho National Laboratory and Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy will work on devising and building the facility, most likely at Xcel Energy’s Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Station in Red Wing, Minnesota.

The project announced this week is part of the Energy Department’s strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions using nuclear power to generate carbon-free energy. Vehicles using hydrogen fuel cells, for example, produce only water vapor and warm air as exhaust. Hydrogen could also be used in industry, such as in the production of steel.

Xcel Energy officials said they have a large amount of wind-generated energy they supply to customers. Officials said the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Station could make hydrogen when wind energy meets customer demand for electricity. Officials said the hydrogen would initially be used at the power plant but could ultimately be sold to other industries.

According to its website, Xcel Energy provides energy to millions of homes and businesses across eight Western and Midwestern states, and has a goal of being 100% carbon-free by 2050.

“Now we’ll be the first company to produce carbon-free hydrogen at a nuclear plant using this technology,” Tim O’Connor, Xcel Energy chief generation officer, said in a statement.

The effort planned at the Minnesota plant will use a process called high-temperature steam electrolysis. Water is made out of three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogen. The proposed project would use Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Station’s steam and electricity to split water and separate the hydrogen. Idaho National Laboratory will help with technical aspects of the project.

The Energy Department said it hopes the result will be a functioning hydrogen plant capable of operating as a hybrid system that can also test electrolysis technologies.

“This is a game-changer for both nuclear energy and carbon-free hydrogen production for numerous industries,” said the Energy Department’s Richard Boardman in a statement. “It offers a view of the energy structures of the future, which will integrate systems to maximize energy use, generator profitability and grid reliability all while minimizing carbon emissions.”

Hydrogen is abundant in the environment and is stored in water, methane and organic matter. The primary challenge is economically extracting it and being competitive in the marketplace. Most of the hydrogen currently produced in the nation comes from combining high-temperature steam with natural gas.

Officials say nuclear-produced hydrogen has the advantage of being carbon-free. That’s opposed to fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal and oil that produce greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

The Energy Department says that nearly all hydrogen produced in the U.S. is used for refining petroleum, processing food, producing fertilizer or treating metals.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States at the end of 2019 had 96 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 58 nuclear power plants in 29 states. They produce about 20% of the nation’s electricity. Most of the reactors are decades old, and some are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.","The project announced this week is part of the Energy Department’s strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions using nuclear power to generate carbon-free energy.

VICTORIA – One of the tasks of the United Association Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 324 is to monitor a “clean up” the industry that employs over 1,000 unionized pipe trade workers on the island.

The installation of handwashing stations on job sites during the COVID 19 pandemic – especially those that include hot water – has been warmly welcomed, notes Business Manager Jim Noon. He applauds WorkSafe BC’s insistence on the stations to help keep these essential workers safe on the job.

“Our members are quite pleased to see this change,” says Noon. “They feel more comfortable being able to wash their hands, and with hand sanitizer, it’s a much more thorough way of washing their hands. That’s definitely a big plus.”

Mick Smith, owner of Victoria-based Oceanview Mechanical, adds “We have put handwashing stations wherever required, and we put hot water with them. We knew if we provided warm water, the workers will wash their hands, especially if it’s colder. I think the key is having hot water, as nobody wants to wash their hands in ice-cold water.”

Another desired adjustment could ensure that hand wash stations are located beside port-a-potties, as opposed to being on the opposite end of the job site.

“If the wash stations are right there, people can immediately wash their hands,” Noon notes.

While Noon hands out accolades for companies providing hand wash stations and ensuring they are stocked up, he also sees an urgent need for flush toilets on medium/large-sized job sites. Port-a-potties are adequate for small residential construction jobs with only a handful of workers.

“But when we are building schools, hospitals, commercial buildings and condominiums, port-a-potties are still being used, and we’d like to see that changed,” Noon states. “One concern that has arisen during the pandemic – and in the past – is the unsanitary conditions of some port-a-potties.

“Issues include that they are not being cleaned frequently enough, there is no interior lighting, and no heat, and in the winter, the weather affects the temperatures inside,” he observes. “A lot of our members are opposed to using them because they’re not being cleaned enough, so it can be a health concern. Some workers would rather hold out all day and not use the facility rather than using them, and that’s very unhealthy.”

Noon would like to see regulations change to mandate flush toilets on larger projects.

Some companies provide washroom trailers, complete with flush toilets, sinks and handwashing stations inside, heated and protected from the elements.

“We believe facility that has porcelain flush toilets with light and heat can be cleaned a lot easier, and it’s more sanitary than plastic port-a-potties,” he notes. “A push for flush toilets is something we need to consider on our projects. That would help keeping the workers safe.”

Menstruation is a natural, regular and normal physiological process. It occurs when a girl enters into her adolescence. It is a good sign that her reproductive organs are developing and functioning properly for reproduction later. It is a very normal and essential function of the reproductive organ of the body.

But many social norms, taboos and customs associated with it make it more complex as a result of which accepting and managing the most important physical function becomes a difficult task for the school going girls.

When we think about a student-friendly school environment, different pictures come to our mind. Availability of good building, teaching-learning material, digital classroom, study material, library and well-equipped science lab is considered very important. Very few people talk about the availability of proper WASH (clean toilet, safe drinking water, hand washing facility, dustbin, etc.) facility in the school.

About 50% of students are girls and are mostly in the menstruating age. Still, no one talks about the availability of menstruation hygiene management facilities like dustbin inside the toilet, sanitary pad dispensary unit and clean toilet with sufficient running water as well as pad disposal facility. Due to lack of proper infrastructure and behaviour, menstruating girls could not manage their period well in schools.

Lack of proper facilities for MHM (Menstrual Health Management) in schools decreases their interest in studies. It again impacts their retention, participation, learning outcome and overall educational development.

Menstruation is associated with stigma and fear of embarrassment and harassment, which makes them stay at home. Lack of a proper place (to change, and dispose of sanitary pads during periods) at school shortens their confidence and interest to attend school regularly. As a result, the rate of absenteeism increases. They prefer to stay at home for 3–5 days once every month. If anyhow they attended school, they could not concentrate on study.

There is a fear that there may be a stain on the dress or any unhygienic irritation occurs. They cannot participate in any classroom activity like to stand and speak, write anything on the blackboard and any other physical task assigned by the teacher.

Low attendance and lack of active class participation impact their overall learning achievement, which reflected in their exam results. About 40–60 days absent in school means a lot. The fear of failure, low-grade achievement makes them drop from their study in the middle.

Dropping out of school breaks their chain of educational, personal and career development. They are compelled to compromise with their ambition and aspiration. Breaks in studying make them susceptible to social issues like child marriage, teenage pregnancy, trafficking, child labour, domestic violence, etc.

In addition to the above, health-related issues like Urinary Tract Infection, Reproductive Tract Infection, etc. become a part of their life. It also negatively influences their physical and mental health.

A 2014 report by the NGO Dasra titled Spot On! found that nearly 23 million girls drop out from school annually due to lack of proper menstrual hygiene management facilities which include the availability of sanitary napkins and logical awareness of menstruation. This study also revealed that 63 million adolescent girls live in a home without toilet facilities.

A 2015 survey by the ministry of education found that in 63% of schools in villages, teachers never discussed menstruation and how to deal with it hygienically. They have to struggle both at home and in school to get both information and infrastructure.

Public sector units claimed to have constructed 1.4 lakh toilets in government schools as a part of Right to Education Project, but almost 40% are found to be non-existent or partially constructed or unused. In an audit report presented in the parliament, the CAG said over 70% of toilets did not have running water facilities while 75% of toilets were not being maintained hygienically.

A school is an important place in a student’s life after home. It is called the second home of children. So this home needs to fulfil all the essential needs of all students to make the environment student-friendly. The government/policymakers should make necessary laws and guidelines. The administration should ensure the right implementation of those laws and the community (parents and civil society organisations) should be vigilant whether their child’s basic needs are taken care of or not.

Intensive awareness, education results in social acceptance. Community participation is the key to achieve a safe and sustained environment at school. Disseminating information about MHM among adolescent groups will help break the stigma. This can help girls complete their education and fulfil their dream.","Availability of good building, teaching-learning material, digital classroom, study material, library and well-equipped science lab is considered very important.

The Regional Minister, Mr. Salifu Adam Braimah, who performed the ceremony on Saturday, on behalf of the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, stressed that the government remained committed to the effective and efficient management of waste in the country.



According to the President, the project formed part of his vision to make Ghana clean, indicating that when completed, the plant would help in managing waste in a more environmentally-friendly manner in the region.



“Our collective responsibility is to sustain the gains made in the sanitation and water sector,” he urged the citizenry.



President Akufo-Addo commended the management of Zoomlion Ghana Limited (ZGL) for ensuring that the project was completed, adding that, “I owe it as a responsibility as the President of the Republic of Ghana to fight sanitation and provide potable water to the people of Ghana.”



Speaking in his capacity as the Regional Minister, Mr. Adam Braimah said, “It is for this reason that I call on you to give Nana Akufo-Addo ‘four more to do more’. And to the contractors, this project is dear to the heart of the President and the people of Savannah, so we want it to be completed on schedule.”



The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Jospong Group of Companies (JGC), Madam Florence Larbi, speaking on behalf of the Executive Chairman of the group, Dr. Joseph Siaw Agyapong, revealed that the project was estimated to cost 15 million Euros.



“It will be completed within four months, and will serve Bole, West Gonja, East Gonja, Sawla, North-East Gonja, Central Gonja, North Gonja, and other surrounding districts,” she revealed.



She, therefore, expressed her gratitude to President Nana Akufo-Addo, for his visionary leadership and personal support to the environmental sanitation sector and the private sector for development during his tenure of office.



“His commitment and dedication to ensuring a clean Ghana are very much appreciated. We, as the leading waste management company in Ghana and other parts of Africa, will continue to contribute our quota to make his vision for this sector a reality,” she assured.



The facility, she disclosed, was a 200-ton integrated, recycling, and compost facility equipped with 21st-century technologies in sanitation management.



“It aims to provide a sustainable solution to recover and recycle over 60 per cent of the organic fraction of the waste into compost to boost the agricultural sector and support the ‘Planting for Food and Jobs’ agenda. Other recyclable materials like plastics, paper, and metals will also be separated and processed for re-use,” she said.



When completed, Madam Larbi said, the facility will create 75 direct jobs and 1,500 indirect jobs for the teeming youth in Savannah.



The Regional Environmental Officer, West Gonja Municipality, Mr. Adam Wahab, who spoke on behalf of the Sanitation and Water Resources Minister, Mrs. Cecilia Abena Dapaah, said the project was a priority of the government to ensure a clean Ghana.



“This project will help and sustain the gains made in the sanitation and water sector,” the Sanitation and Water Resources Minister said.

Former union minister of state for civil aviation and Hazaribagh MP Jayant Sinha on Wednesday led a team of Border Security Force(BSF) 400 jawans and officials to clean Hazaribagh lake, which was left filthy due to the Chhath festival that started on this day.

Praising the efforts of the BSF and calling its jawans and officials sanitation warriors, Sinha urged everyone to take part in such drives in order to keep their areas clean. He also hoped that the force would come forward to participate in such missions at other important areas of the town.

The MP reached the lake this morning and joined the BSF jawans to clean it. The Hazaribagh lake, a popular tourist destination, is used by devotees during the Chhath festival to perform several rituals that subsequently pollutes it. With the situation being the same at three other reservoirs as well, efforts are on to clean them all. In recent years, all the four lakes have been covered with jalkumbhi or common water hyacinths as a result of negligence, which has prompted the deputy commissioner to ask the department of fisheries to take up the cleaning work.

According to Inspector General Rajiv Gandhi, paramilitary forces including the BSF have been taking part in these drives from time to time as a result of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a cleaner and greener India, which asks everyone to take part in sanitation works. Along with securing the borders the BSF has also been taking care of the residents living around the camp areas, he said.

Gandhi added that on Wednesday 350 jawans and 50 officials took part in the s sanitation drive, while terming the Hazaribagh lake an ornament for any city.

[+] child in a community where drinking water is scarce or contaminated. LifeStraw

This year, while the focus has been on the pandemic, other crises have continued to play out — and sometimes fly under the radar. LifeStraw, a part of Swiss-based company Vestergaard Frandsen, has been responding to these humanitarian crises, weather-related disasters, and forgotten communities around the world this year.

“2020 was a challenging year for emergency relief efforts,” says Tara MacDowell, Social Impact Manager at LifeStraw. “The biggest challenge has just been the fact that many natural disasters that happened in 2020 took a back seat to the news and media attention of the pandemic. This has meant less mobilization of resources and logistics to support these communities, and more challenging awareness-building to leverage additional supplies and resources.”

The Swiss company is famous for their water filter, which continued to see strong sales in the pandemic as more people went camping, enjoyed the outdoors, and needed a reliable source of clean, drinking water, but it’s also a global health company at heart, she says.

In fact, Vestergaard has been working for 15 years with the Carter Center on eradicating another disease: the guinea worm, a parasite that thrives in bodies of water and continues to be a source of illness, particularly in Africa where Vestergaard works. Therefore, through a partnership with the Carter Center, the company has donated over 390,000 Guinea worm filters, in hopes of one day eradicating the parasite and the disease it inflicts.

In addition to the guinea worm project, Vestergaard helps in humanitarian crises, ensuring that vulnerable communities get access to drinking water when resources are limited, damaged, or completely wiped out. Doing that in a pandemic, this year, MacDowell says became even more critical:

“While LifeStraw did continue to respond to natural disasters, every emergency situation was complicated by the COVID pandemic and our teams had to adapt. Each response strategy had to manage the additional risk COVID posed to our teams as well as the communities impacted by disaster.”

For instance, last year’s earthquake in Puerto Rico had left many without a steady supply of safe drinking water. So in February and in September, MacDowell traveled to the region with a team from the University of Rochester and non-profit organization People 2 People 4 Puerto Rico to distribute LifeStraw filters, and their larger, LifeStraw Family and Community purifiers, which the company uses solely for their humanitarian work, allowing more people to use one device for drinking water. Over 1500 individuals, she says, will have benefited from these new devices, installed in hospitals and neighboring communities in Puerto Rico.

But as the pandemic was making its way around the world in April 2020, Kenya, where LifeStraw has a year-round program to provide these filtration units to schools, saw a series of floods wiping out farms, homes, and schools. During these floods, clean water was in scarce supply. LifeStraw re-oriented their local staff, headquartered in Nairobi, to address this calamity.

“2020 has shined a light on the intersectionality of so many global issues from social justice, racial equality, climate change, water scarcity, to viral pandemics – everything is interrelated and the most low-resource communities inevitably carry the most significant impact,” MacDowell points out.

The next month, in May, India faced a cyclone. In June, El Salvador was hit by a tropical storm. And by August, it was back in the US when Hurricane Laura made landfall. The natural disasters didn’t stop. In November 2020, when the world was fixated on politics, central America was hit by two powerful hurricanes.

Thus, throughout the year, as communities battled weather events and subsequent shortages of clean, drinking water, LifeStraw still had the challenge to deliver on their mission as a public health company.

“The pandemic exacerbated safe water accessibility issues around the globe, from unsheltered communities and indigenous populations in the US to our school-based programs in Kenya. It also added significant challenges to our disaster response efforts and community engagement,” she says.

As the pandemic made its way through East Africa, LifeStraw’s Give Back Program, its primary initiative to provide safe water through schools in the region, came to a halt because most schools have been shut down since March. The Kenya team, of about 40 individuals, instead pivoted to work with county public health offices to provide COVID messaging to their respective communities, install hand-washing stations, distribute soaps and other supplies, and disinfect public places.They also developed protocols to make water filtration accessible through other public communal places while also observing sanitation and distancing protocols.

A lot of this is possible, she says, because of the “nimble” nature of the company, composed of staff who have a history of working at grassroots organizations around the world and in the humanitarian sector.

The company has donated over 10,000 units through its Give Back program and in natural disasters around the world. Though Lifestraw has a give back model embedded into the sale of each of its products, they have also always maintained discretionary funds and product to respond to disasters, MacDowell explains. “This was critical in 2020 to allow us to continue to do our humanitarian work. We believe that in times of crisis, it is critical to adapt, change and lean in, not shy away from our mission and our DNA as a public health company.”","For each LifeStraw product sold, the company puts funds towards a year's worth of clean water for a ...

Founded in 2010 by Lou Haveman — who, with his wife, Jan Haveman, was a missionary to South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda and Nigeria for 22 years and now lives in Grandville — Business Connect is a social enterprise that provides inhabitants of the Southern Hemisphere with affordable and easy access to clean and safe water in order to strengthen education, health and economic growth opportunities in the developing world.

According to the World Health Organization, 800 million people globally do not have basic water services, and 2 billion people drink water contaminated with feces. UNICEF reports 6,000 children die every day due to water-related diseases.

Business Connect so far has forged partnerships and made sales of water treatment products in 67 countries across Africa, Asia, and Central and South America — areas of the developing world that are currently working on their water, sanitation and hygiene strategies.

The company works with about six or seven manufacturers in the U.S. and the U.K. that make water filters, then Business Connect ships the filters to on-the-ground partners in the global south, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and social entrepreneurs, according to Darin Fey, global director at Business Connect. He said Business Connect is set up as a low-profit limited liability company (L3C) so it can redirect as much of its profit as possible to its in-country partners, who create jobs and support their local economies.

Fey, who is based in South Africa, recently spoke to the Business Journal about the company’s growth and its latest milestone — receiving global certification from the World Health Organization for the VF100 Home Filter.

Business Connect is partnering with the Bujumbura, Burundi-based NGO Amazi Water to work with the government of Burundi on its clean water goals. As a small country in eastern Africa at the northern tip of the Nile River, Burundi is working to develop a national water strategy with the goal of providing sustainable access to clean water for every Burundian community by the end of 2028.

The VF100 Home Filter is part of that strategy, Fey said. Representatives from Amazi connected with Fey at a water conference in Kenya about two years ago, and after Amazi purchased about 3,000 to 4,000 of the home filters for Burundi, the government there said it would like to see more proof the product works as indicated before implementing additional rollouts.

“The VF100 is not a new filter, but in order to accomplish Burundi’s goal and to ensure we were providing a high-quality filter on such a large scale, we wanted to do additional testing through WHO,” Fey said. “We are committed to creating hope through business and are proud to be part of the solution for Burundi.”

The VF100 Home Filter is a hollow-fiber membrane filter and the first of its kind to be certified by WHO, according to Business Connection. The filter had already helped bring clean water to over 3 million people globally prior to receiving the WHO qualification. WHO testing confirmed the filter exceeds standards for targeted protection to provide clean and safe water. Through further testing from WHO, the filter was given an additional certification that it is effective with turbid (dirty and cloudy) water.

“You can take the dirtiest river or open well water, put it through the filter, and not only will it remove all that dirt, it will also then remove all those bacteria, protozoa, etc.,” Fey said.

The VF100 has many applications, including use on buckets, bags, refrigerators, faucets and water bottles. The filter removes contaminants from water and can last for many years for an entire family, Business Connect said.

“This solution has the power to dramatically impact the lives of our citizens,” said Armel Cimanishatse, a Burundian citizen and strategic consultant for Amazi Water. “We believe our mission to provide safe access to water will do wonderful things for our country. We are grateful for partnerships like Business Connect and Amazi Water that will help us achieve this vision.”

In addition to home filtration, Business Connect offers a range of products, including 10-cent water treatment tablets that can treat a 5-gallon bucket of water; larger systems that can treat more than 10,000 gallons a day — without using electricity or chemicals — for offices, rural schools and clinics; and even has been known to link banks of filters together across rivers to clean the water source for entire cities.

A YouTube video created by a missionary family to thank Business Connect partner Water for Life, at bit.ly/WaterforLifeYouTube, shows how the VF100 Home Filters work and the impact of clean water for village families in rural India.

Fey said Business Connect recently began providing water treatment products after hurricanes polluted drinking water in Honduras, and the organization hopes to continue more of that natural disaster-related work, as well as to further expand rural development activities in Asia and South America during the next couple of years.

472,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/23/flint-water-crisis-2020-post-coronavirus-america-445459,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",POLITICO,Flint Has Clean Water Now. Why Won’t People Drink It?,"On that day in April, the plan came to fruition. Mayor Dayne Walling, then a 40-year-old Flint native who had won a Rhodes Scholarship before coming back to serve his hometown, raised a glass of that river’s water, toasted a jolly “Here’s to Flint!,” and downed it in one swig, surrounded by his fellow bureaucrats who dutifully followed suit. Just moments before, captured on video now for eternity, Walling had pushed a button on a panel at the city’s water treatment plant that turned an ominous, glowing red. Though nobody knew it at the time, that red glow signified the end of the clean water that flowed from Detroit, and the beginning of a saga that would change the course of Flint’s history.

Not long after, residents started to complain about strange odors and brackish, brown water coming out of their pipes. In August 2014, the city issued a boil water advisory after fecal bacteria were identified in the water. By the time the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notified Michigan in early 2015 that there were dangerous levels of lead in Flint’s water, its residents had complained for months of mysterious illnesses.

When scientists analyzed that water, they discovered to their horror that the city’s treatment of it was woefully inadequate to reduce its levels of harmful bacteria and acid—and that the latter had begun to corrode Flint’s antiquated pipes from the inside, delivering tiny bits of lead through people’s faucets. For months, it turned out, Flint had had been exposing its residents to that lead at levels that could cause lifelong damage to the health of its children. The levels of bacteria likely caused an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease that also followed the switch, killing at least a dozen people.

Although Walling literally pressed the button, the decision to use Flint River water had much deeper roots. After a panel appointed by Michigan’s Republican then-governor, Rick Snyder, declared the city in a state of financial emergency—taking its finances, and therefore most major decisions, out of the hands of City Hall and putting them under the control of a hand-picked emergency manager, Walling and Flint’s other elected officials became effectively ornamental.

The city’s financial emergency was the result of years of mismanagement by former Mayor Don Williamson, a brash, proto-Trumpian businessman who oversaw year after year of multimillion-dollar deficits during the 2000s—a large portion of which were due in part to his fending off various lawsuits from city employees.

Walling was elected in 2009 to succeed Williamson, after the latter resigned rather than face a recall election. The new mayor’s voters viewed him as exactly the kind of good-government technocrat capable of reversing the city’s slide. As well as being a Rhodes Scholar, he was an aide to the former U.S. Representative and titan of Flint-area politics Dale Kildee, and Flint residents viewed him as a welcome technocratic contrast with Williamson’s unique governing style. Urbane where his predecessor was crass, credentialed where Williamson had only a rap sheet, brainy instead of flexing his political brawn, Walling was exactly the kind of homegrown talent a troubled, once-proud city needed.

But his efforts to repair the damage his predecessor wrought weren’t fast enough for the state’s liking. Snyder installed Michael Brown as the first in a line of emergency managers—stingingly, on the same day as Walling’s 2011 reelection.

I met Walling at Café Rhema, a small coffee shop in downtown Flint that seeks to do its part in revitalizing the city by invoking the better days of the Jazz Age. Walling is now a consultant and occasional college adjunct, imparting hard-earned wisdom from his time in office to the would-be technocrats of tomorrow. Since he first took office, there have been no fewer than two subsequent mayors and four emergency managers (one serving two nonconsecutive terms), giving Flint residents a leadership that goes far beyond the “revolving door” to approach a whirlwind.

“Hopefully the scope of those challenges will at some point begin to narrow, but I don’t think we’re at that point.” Former Flint Mayor Dayne Walling

“I get elected in 2009,” he said. “I get reelected in 2011, and then we get the sequence of [four] emergency managers, who under state law effectively become the mayor and the city council, even though they don’t take that title,” Walling told me. “Then the emergency manager leaves, and I’m back [in charge] at the end of April 2015. I lose reelection [that November,] and Mayor [Karen] Weaver gets sworn in. ... It’s been an incredible cast of characters who have been in charge at City Hall.”

Walling attempted a political comeback in 2018, running to represent a Flint-area district in the Michigan House of Representatives, and losing in the Democratic primary to John Cherry III, the son of the state’s former lieutenant governor. When he looks back at his time in office, Walling remembers it the same way that many of his constituents probably do: as a time of being caught flat-footed, without recourse or relief.

“There’s the Great Recession, then the Tea Party takeover, and then the rewrite of the emergency manager law, where the state now says, ‘We will take over absolutely everything’ … and then I didn't see the water crisis coming out of out of that,” Walling told me. “That sequence was extraordinarily difficult. … Hopefully, the scope of those challenges will at some point begin to narrow, but I don’t think we’re at that point.”

Dr. Benjamin J. Pauli, assistant professor at Flint’s Kettering University. | M. Scott Mahaskey / POLITICO

Benjamin Pauli, a professor of social sciences at Flint’s Kettering University and author of Flint Fights Back: Environmental Justice and Democracy in the Flint Water Crisis, draws a direct connection between the state takeover and the groundswell of anger and mistrust around the water crisis, describing how even before the water switch Flint’s activist community was “interested in democracy, and it just so happened that water and democracy were starting to come together.”

That intersection resulted in one of the water crisis’ most unique political consequences: Walling’s succession by Karen Weaver, a local booster, business owner and child psychologist, to replace Walling in 2015. In contrast with Walling, whom her campaign painted as an out-of-touch bureaucrat gladly carrying out the state’s bidding, Weaver was sharply attuned to the demands of Flint activists—and, significantly, became the majority-Black city’s first Black mayor in more than a decade, defeating Walling by 10 points in his second reelection bid as the crisis raged.

One of Weaver’s campaign promises was that she would declare a state of emergency in the city, out of a belief that the city needed to fan the media flames more aggressively in order to draw the national attention and resources necessary to remedy the crisis. She did so in December 2015, a month after her election, and President Barack Obama then declared a federal emergency in January 2016, freeing up $5 million in aid.

Despite what some see as the shortcomings of Weaver’s administration, her emergency declaration is viewed as a key moment in transforming a story of local mismanagement into one with nationwide repercussions. In a city with a long legacy of dysfunction, it’s the rare action that can be matched to a clear and obvious positive outcome.

“There would not have been a water crisis if we had democracy in the city.” Nayyirah Shariff

“The emergency declaration we will be forever thankful for,” said Nayyirah Shariff, a longtime activist and the director of the nonprofit Flint Rising. “She had a press conference, it was on the ticker at CNN by 4:00, and she was on ‘Rachel Maddow’ by 9:00. Regardless of how people may feel about her administration, if she had not done that emergency declaration, Flint would not have been international news.”

Weaver was elected as an outsider, someone who would give voice to Flint’s common man and upend the sclerotic status quo through sheer force of personality. But her tenure in office revealed the difficulties faced by all outsiders once they get inside.

“One of the things about Karen is that she’s a regular person, and not a politician, and so there were some issues with that, mostly from some of the people she listened to,” said Mays, the activist. “I can’t say I agree with everything she said and did, but she stood with us, and she pushed for us, and she understood the urgency we felt.”

Activists heralded her election, but during her four years in office, Weaver frequently stumbled. She became mired not only in controversies over the water crisis’ complicated infrastructural fix, but accusations she used her office to reward friends and family and boost her own profile.","In August 2014, the city issued a boil water advisory after fecal bacteria were identified in the water.

Access to clean drinking water, sanitation is a human right: NGO The NGO also aims to raise awareness about the perils of open defecation

New Delhi: Two years ago, Rani Devi, a 56-year-old resident of Batoli village in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand was at an open defecation site about a kilometre from her house with a sickle in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. As she squatted, at what she thought was a safe spot for her morning ritual, she saw a wild bear approaching her. She was terrified for a second but in spontaneous reaction, she climbed up a tree. However, Rani still sustained grave wounds and had to be admitted to a hospital. Rani was among the lucky ones. In another incident, last year, a construction worker died while he was defecating in a field and a leopard pounced on him.

Women and girls from the rural communities who were responsible for fetching water for the household chores were required to walk long distances and many times they had to face harassment from sexual predators.

Dinisha Negi, 22-year-old resident of a village in Tehri district who could not study after Class 5 and from a very young age was given the duty to fetch water along with her mother for a family of four recalls,

During those days, I had never imagined that we’ll get water so easily. My state has a number of rivers and the origin of two mighty rivers Ganga and Yamuna is also here but ironically, access to clean water was always a challenge for people in my village.

It was after the installation of water tanks, water filters and toilets at home, in Anganwadi centres and government schools that people like Rani and Dinisha were able to finally feel safe and not be bothered about arranging water or finding a safe place to defecate. The two women are among nearly three lakh people in over 1,000 villages in 11 districts of Uttarakhand who are able to live an easier life because of the water supply and sanitation project of Himmotthan Society, a Dehradun based NGO, which is an initiative of Tata Trusts started in 2001, with support from The Hans Foundations- a Public Charitable Trust established in 2009 with an aim to work in the areas of health, education and livelihoods and to provide financial aid to other NGOs working in the same area.

While talking to NDTV about the initiative, Vinod Kothari, Coordinator- WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), Himmotthan Society, Tata Trust said,

Our central objective has been creating equitable access to clean drinking water and basic hygiene and sanitation facilities for the poor and vulnerable people living in the rural areas. We are currently working in 11 out of 13 districts of Uttarakhand – Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Champawat, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Pauri, Tehri, Uttarkashi, and hill areas of Dehradun. We have also partnered with the state government of Uttarakhand for implementing Swachh Bharat Mission in some parts of the state.

He further explained that due to the topography of the state with rivers flowing from top to down, the challenge is to tap water and bring it to the upper reaches of remote villages. Mr. Kothari said that where feasible, water is being sourced from natural springs and through rainwater harvesting that have been installed near individual houses, anganwadi centres and schools.

Integrated in the water supply and sanitation project are a host of other initiatives like gender empowerment, strengthening School Action Plans by focusing on building habits of children and parents around sanitation, raising awareness among the people on water, hygiene and sanitation. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Himmotthan Society has been focusing on promoting handwashing and raising awareness about preventive measures. Shweta Rawat, Chairperson and Founder, The Hans Foundation said,

In the COVID world and the post COVID world, nothing will be more important than water, sanitation and hygiene for preventing infections. We have embarked this initiative with our partner Himmotthan across Uttarakhand where we have educated people to stop open defecation as well as stop their farm animals from defecating near the sources of drinking water. People have now realised that those activities were causing immense harm and perpetual sickness among the people, especially children and also among the animals. Now, in this time of the pandemic, people have realised the importance of hygiene and sanitation as key tools in stopping the virus from spreading. So hopefully, these habits will continue after the pandemic as well.

She further said that through WASH programmes that were running in schools before the lockdown was imposed due to COVID-19, children were targeted as change-makers in the village. The initiative aimed at educating them early enough so that they can take the same habit back to their homes and also pass it on to their next generation when they grow up.

While acknowledging the gains made by the initiative, Ashwani Rawat, Deputy Education Officer, Nainital said to NDTV,

In Nainital, the WASH programme is being implemented in 26 government primary schools. Not only were toilets installed in these schools, the WASH programme also helped installing water pipeline, water filters, and dustbins. Through workshops, children were made aware about the using toilets properly and maintaining hygiene. I believe the girls in these schools have benefitted the most from this initiative.

According to Premlata Bahuguna, Principal, Government Primary School, in a village in Jakhan town of Dehradun, the school had a toilet since a very long time but it was mainly used by the male students. Himmotthan installed a toilet complex that greatly helped the female students, she said. Ms. Bahuguna added,

With separate toilets for girls in the school, we saw an increase in their attendance. There are 40 students enrolled in the school. Before the school got temporarily shut due to the pandemic, we also observed an improvement in the overall health of the children as they were regularly taught about washing hands frequently and maintaining proper hygiene. Even now, we try during online classes and interactions that we keep reminding children and their families to follow preventive measures in order to avoid contracting coronavirus.

As the country is opening up and states planning to reopen schools, Himmotthan is working on installing toilets and drinking water facilities in 78 more schools across nine districts of Uttarakhand. The organisation plans to gradually cover more schools and village communities in all 13 districts of the state by providing them access to basic hygiene and clean drinking water in the coming years.

NDTV – Dettol Banega Swasth India campaign is an extension of the five-year-old Banega Swachh India initiative helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. It aims to spread awareness about critical health issues facing the country. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign highlights the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children to prevent maternal and child mortality, fight malnutrition, stunting, wasting, anaemia and disease prevention through vaccines. Importance of programmes like Public Distribution System (PDS), Mid-day Meal Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyan and the role of Aganwadis and ASHA workers are also covered. Only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and become a Swasth or healthy India. The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include additional information about relief efforts and donations for Honduras.

Choloma, Honduras — Although their primary mission is to provide children's services for a fraction of the barrio's approximately 3,000 laborers who work in garment factories, they felt they had no choice but to respond to housing needs as they saw their community suffer in the days following the hurricanes. Area parishes are involved in relief efforts as well, coordinating with the sisters to assess and provide for the needs of those they have taken in. Mattresses were donated by one congregation. Another group of volunteers from the San Pedro Sula Diocese, under the leadership of Fr. Noel Ortiz, is coordinating food basket and clothing distribution throughout Choloma, supporting the sisters' work, and also managing a shelter for dogs displaced by the flooding to help owners and pets reconnect. Honduras faces a long recovery after being battered by the back-to-back hurricanes. In this region, stretches of makeshift tents still line the main road more than a week after the storms ended, housing people displaced by the storms. Some of the garment factories, and at least one that employs 30,000 people, have shut down temporarily due to flooding or water damage.

When Hurricane Eta struck this textile manufacturing town in northeast Honduras at the beginning of November, thousands of people living in rough housing in low lying areas were forced out of the homes where most can only afford to rent rooms. Living in temporary shelters constructed along the nearby highway as Hurricane Iota unleashed its torrential rains on the area two weeks later, this already suffering population was left especially devastated. In Barrio La Primavera, the sisters of the María Inmaculada Nursery School established in 2015 by the Missionaries of Mary Immaculate (a congregation based in Spain, Misioneras de María Inmaculada Siervas de las Obreras), quickly converted classrooms in their modest day care center into a shelter for displaced families. On donated mattresses and blankets, with clothing salvaged as they escaped the rising waters in their dwellings, more than a dozen people now occupy the grounds of the nursery awaiting a hopeful return to their residences. Srs. María Luisa Canencia Garcia, Jessica Karina Lemus Sánchez, Ana Felipa Olvera Pérez, and Bessy Guadalupe Enamorado Monge live and serve among the people of the community, families who work long hours to earn a meager weekly check in nearby garment factories. They say the barrio is a dangerous place — plagued by gun and gang violence — but the sisters feel safe, having established their presence of care.

The storms that battered Honduras also left trails of destruction in Nicaragua, Guatemala and Panama, say sisters whose congregations minister in the region. ""A lot of people have lost everything,"" said Sr. Larraine Lauter, an Ursuline Sister of Mount St. Joseph and executive lead with Water With Blessings, which empowers women to filter water for their local communities. ""People were huddled up under underpasses, in refugee centers or taking refuge in schools — it's a really difficult situation,"" she said, citing reports from the organization's eight staff people based in Tegucigalpa. The organization undertook a special campaign to get 5,000 water filters to Honduras in the wake of the storms and is now shipping and setting up distribution, while raising money to cover other hardware and training expenses. ""For us, the biggest concern is that after any disaster, the next disaster is contaminated drinking water — there are far more illnesses and casualties because of contaminated water. That's what we know how to do — providing clean water.""

The biggest needs are food, potable water and medical supplies, said Sr. Diane Clyne, a Sister of Mercy and director of development for the CCASA community, which serves Mercy Sisters and their ministries in eight countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America, including Honduras and Panama. Casa Corazon in San Pedro Sula, in which two sisters care for HIV-positive children, had to move all 25 residents, ranging in ages from infants to teens, to other locations before the storms hit. The residents have since been moved back into the house, which is intact, but the surrounding area is still flooded and choked with mud, said Clyne, who lived for six years in Central America, including at Casa Corazon. People in the neighborhood depended on the sisters for some of their food supply even before the storms, she said, and now are in even greater need.

In smaller cities such Tegucigalpita, she has heard from two sisters who live there, that ""whole pieces of land with houses just slipped down the mountainside — they have lost a significant number of homes,"" she said. There is no food supply in that town and with bridges collapsed, it's impossible to get food from neighboring towns, she said. She's been in contact with sisters via WhatsApp and phone. One sister wrote to her said what little recovery is happening is because of "" 'people helping people — we don't see the government.' "" In Panama, Clyne has been in contact with two sisters in Panama City who run a women and child care center, but has not been able to reach three sisters ministering to nine villages and other areas in the interior of the country. The area ""was badly hit,"" Clyne said. ""We have concern for the sisters and their outreach for the people."" With roads and bridges damaged and crops destroyed, the recovery challenge is massive — and there is still the concern of the coronavirus. The need for food and medicine are both for the immediate and extended term, she said. ""It's not going to end with one relief mission.""

River-Honduras-Farrell c.jpg Rivers in southwestern Honduras, where Sr. Pat Farrell, a Sister of St. Francis of Dubuque, Iowa, and others minister, are swollen and muddy because of the torrential rain and mudslides caused by the two hurricanes, Eta and Iota. Pictured is a river near Farrell's house, and a neighbor. The bridge nearby is fortunately still intact but many have washed away. (Sr. Pat Farrell)

Flooding and mudslides affected communities in the southwestern part of Honduras, where Sr. Pat Farrell and three other Sisters of St. Francis of Dubuque, Iowa, usually do pastoral work in prisons, run formation programs and a radio program, and coordinate water purification projects in the departments (states) of Lempira and Copan. (One of the sisters, a novice, is in Dubuque for formation.) After the storms, Farrell and the other two sisters have been coordinating help and connecting people to resources. ""In spite of the great poverty in Honduras, the peoples' spontaneous mobilization of solidarity is a typical response and very inspiring,"" Farrell wrote in an email. ""Every parish has organized to collect food and clothing in response to local emergencies as well as to assist efforts in San Pedro Sula. Money, however, is in very short supply,"" she said. ""Our sisters and associates in the U.S. have responded immediately and very generously in generating economic support which we are in the process of channeling through parishes to areas of the dioceses most seriously affected.""

She and other sisters are also working to bring safe drinking water to villages. ""It is a serious and immediate need."" They are focusing on helping those in the countryside, where a number of areas are inaccessible by road, making it challenging to get food and supplies to them. Some people are traveling by foot and horseback to distribution sites. Crops are damaged, which means there will be continued issues with food supply. Building materials such as corrugated tin for roofing will be needed, though repairs rather than rebuilding entire houses will be the priority. About 20 sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame in Montreal minister in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and with associates are helping locals recover from the storms ""by doing what they can at this time and the way they can, in the words of St. Marguerite [Bourgeoys], 'going where there is good to be done,' "" wrote Sr. Martha Lucía Pérez Gutierrez, region leader, in a newsletter to the congregation. The sisters' community home in El Progreso, Honduras, was flooded and filled with debris, and they worked with neighbors to clean it up. The sisters and associates, who normally are involved with pastoral ministries, a health and wellness center or educational outreach programs, have been distributing food and water filters. Sr. Rosa Maria Trochez, a School Sister of Notre Dame, sent a newsletter co-written with Fr. Ismael “Melo” Coto of Radio Progresso summarizing the widespread destruction in Honduras wrought by the storms. Efforts are being made to evacuate those at highest risk and supply water, food, hygiene supplies and masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Replanting lost crops and restoring housing are the next priorities. SHARE El Salvador, which assists in El Salvador, Honduras and elsewhere in the region, encouraged those commemorating the 40th anniversary of the murder of the four church women to donate to a hurricane emergency relief fund.

The Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, has four sisters ministering in Rosita, Nicaragua, and 14 sisters total in the country, the legacy of the congregation's ministry in the country that began 75 years ago. The storms tore off part of the roof of the parish house that the sisters live in (only two of the four were in Rosita during the hurricanes) and the area was badly flooded, said Sr. Kathryn Schilling, who had ministered in Nicaragua for 25 years and still keeps in contact with sisters there. Besides food, clothing and medicine, building materials such as metal sheets for roofs are needed, she said. Many residents are still in staying at schools and haven't yet started rebuilding. It's not clear how long families will be housed at the María Inmaculada Nursery School in Choloma, Honduras — probably at least a month. But the sisters are committed to helping however they can. The storms' destruction is one more set of challenges in an area where life is already very hard. ""People come to the area because the maquilas (clothing factories) give a weekly payment,"" said Pérez. ""But it's not enough to sustain the families. [The workers] can't even pay for potable water or children's supplies for school. That is why we have the day care — to meet their basic needs, to change their minds away from gangs, to teach them, and also try to motivate them not to quit school."" The sisters' experience of the challenges faced by the working poor in their neighborhood is supported by a 2019 World Bank Jobs Diagnostic report on the Honduran economy. Job creation in the textile and garment sector outpaced all other industries in the past three years by 400%, yet the extreme poverty rate among the general population was the highest in Latin American countries at 16%.

Thirty-five children from ages 2 to 5 are usually on site for regular care at the center. They receive two healthy meals, preschool education, and many loving reminders from the sisters of their value as children. Very few homes have running water, so the children bathe at the center. The lack of access to hygiene contributes to the spread of digestive diseases, Sanchez said. Garcia, who has served in the order for 53 years and moved to the community from Spain in 2017, explains her hope to remodel a room in the sisters' home to be used exclusively for providing basic health care for the children. With no nearby clinic attending to measure benchmarks of early child development, activities such as monitoring temperatures, weight and height; caring for wounds, nutritional assessments, and administering scheduled medicines are especially important.

Introduction

Sex work exists in various forms in South Asia. India is said to have some of the world’s largest red-light districts. Although selling sex in exchange for money is not a crime per se, the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act, 1956, criminalises maintaining and managing brothels, pimping, aiding, abetting or compelling prostitution, etc. According to a 2007 report by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, there are more than three million sex workers in India.

The number must be on the rise in the past decade and yet, there is rarely any mention of the sex workers when talking about marginalised groups, despite their wretched conditions. One of the reasons for such disregard is attributed to the attitude that demeans sex work itself, which in turn leads to sheer neglect in ensuring the cleanliness of streets in red-light districts and callousness of public hospitals in providing access to healthcare.

Water, Sanitation And Hygiene Challenges

In a meeting convened by the Global Interfaith Wash Alliance in 2019, 140 people belonging to various disadvantaged communities across India discussed the sanitation and hygiene challenges faced by sex workers. Sultana, a sex worker, explained the issues faced by her community. “I am a sex worker by profession,” said Sultana, “and therefore, society treats us as outcasts. When we talk about menstruation or hygiene, people think “it is a sex worker, your opinions don’t matter.”

“The government needs to rehabilitate us so that our lives are better. We also have many incidents of violence with us, and when we go to the police, they do not even file a complaint. They say that you are a sex worker, what should you complain about?” She also highlighted how scavengers discriminate against them. Even garbage pickers are not interested in cleaning up the lanes in the red light areas.

Talking about the living conditions— running water does not even reach them as pipelines need to be replaced, which would take years if there is an initiative of some sort. The houses they live in are ill-equipped conditions, but since they are owned by private entities, the municipal corporations do not intervene either. With the advent of Covid-19, sex workers are claimed to be one of the most vulnerable groups at risk, especially due to their already dilapidated conditions.

Most sex workers live together in 10×12 ft windowless rooms, as many as 50 people share one public bathroom. More than 40% of sex workers from Kamathipura, Mumbai (largest red-light area in Asia) are homeless and hence, live on the streets and footpaths. This tells us that they are dependent on public bathrooms for water and privacy. They rent a brothel room when they get a client. Salima, one such sex worker in Kamathipura, recalls ‘We manage food in hotels, for bath I go thrice in a week to the public toilet. Life in brothel was good but I had to give a lot of rent’,

The Link Between Water, Sanitation, Hygiene And Sexual And Reproductive Health Rights

It is well understood that poor WASH facilities affect the SRHR system and services as well.

Lack of gender-sensitive wash facilities limits the ability to manage periods privately and hygienically. Sex workers are missing on safe and accessible toilets equipped with clean water and soap, where they can also dispose of the menstrual hygiene products and clean themselves.

According to a working paper by William Rachna on reproductive health practices by sex workers in Tamil Nadu, very few sex workers are aware of menstrual hygiene practices; at times, they cannot afford or have time to clean themselves. The figures presented by them tell us that 85% of sex workers use and reuse cloth during periods, 7% of them use cotton rolled in cloth while 7.8% of them use sanitary pads. During periods, 41.8% of sex workers don’t wash themselves suggesting to us unsafe menstruation practices that are prevalent, although the data presented might or might not be generalised.

Article 21 Of The Indian Constitution: Right Of Sex Workers To WASH

The Court has regularly reiterated that right to life under Article 21 is more than mere animal existence. Lack of access to water and sanitation facilities in red light areas is the most pervasive human rights violation. It has been underlooked by both the judiciary and the government.

The Court in the case of Virendra Gaur v State of Haryana had observed that a hygienic environment that includes sanitation facility is an integral facet of right to healthy life under Article 21. This, in application, also poses a duty on the government to make policies and schemes by which sex workers who live in red light areas could get WASH facilities. The disregard shown in making WASH facilities in red light areas up till now could also be attributed to the problem that red light areas are largely seen as places where illegal and unauthorised activities take place.","According to a 2007 report by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, there are more than three million sex workers in India.

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, presiding over a meeting of the State Water and Sanitation Mission over the weekend, said: “All persons living in 1634 water quality affected villages in the State will be provided clean drinking water within the next one year.”

The State Government is committed to ensure supply of potable water to all such villages in Punjab which are affected by fluoride, arsenic, and other heavy metals through both short-term and long-term mitigation measures, said the Chief Minister, adding that the clean drinking water is a basic right of all individuals, be it rich or poor, and it is the duty of the State Government to ensure its supply.

Giving further details, a State Government’s spokesperson said that Punjab was spending Rs 1,191 crore on undertaking such measures. All short-term measures, at both individual household level and community level, would be completed in 2021, preferably by June. The long-term measures, which included new schemes based on either surface water or Arsenic and Iron Removal Plants, would be accomplished over the next two-three years, added the spokesperson.

In addition, the State would cover all 35 lakh rural households with potable piped water connections by March 2022 under the Jal Jeevan Mission.

Already 22.63 lakh rural households stand covered under the scheme. Three districts, namely SAS Nagar (Mohali), Rupnagar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, have achieved the distinction of 100 percent coverage of all their villages, said the spokesperson.

The Department of Water Supply and Sanitation would also be undertaking development of multi-level state-of-the-art laboratories for testing of water quality across the State. A proper Management Information System was being created to ensure tracking of each sample being tested by laboratories at any level, he added.

Water Supply Minister Razia Sultana said that the first 24x7 multi-village water supply scheme based on surface water would be commissioned in January 2021 in Moga. “This scheme being undertaken on DBOT basis under the World Bank aided project costs Rs 232 crore and would cover 85 villages, some of which have reported traces of uranium, and would provide round-the-clock running tap water to around three lakh persons of the area,” she said.

“In addition, many other surface-water based multi-village schemes are under progress in the districts of Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, and Tarn Taran, and would be completed by December 2022,” she added.

Further, the Minister said that new water supply schemes were also being proposed in the water scarcity areas of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur, and Rupnagar districts.

The Mission also gave its in-principle approval for setting up of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) under the Department for managing multi-village water supply schemes in partnership with the community through representatives of the Gram Panchayat Water and Sanitation Committees.

The Mission also gave its consent for creating a ring-fenced account called Water Quality Kosh for ensuring proper maintenance of water quality mitigation measures and their monitoring and testing in the rural areas of the State.

The Mission also endorsed the state Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu’s suggestion that smaller water supply schemes, where water table was relatively high, should be taken up for solarization of pump sets on priority. This would help in saving of electricity and also help in reducing the expenditure of the Department on power supply.

The Department also informed that the State Government had agreed to its proposal for One-Time Settlement of dues of DWSS run schemes with PSPCL and Rs 200 crore was written off with the approval of PSERC.

The Department had also obtained order from PSERC to treat rural water supply as a special category under PSPCL with reduced tariff, thereby making the operations of water supply schemes more sustainable. Further, Rs 250 crore has already been paid to PSPCL for settlement of outstanding dues, said the spokesperson.","Punjab Government has decided to cover all 1,634 water quality affected villages by mitigation measures to provide their residents clean drinking water by 2021.

478,https://missionnewswire.org/mongolia-families-access-clean-drinking-water/,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",MissionNewswire,"MONGOLIA: Families have clean water for drinking, cleaning","Salesian missionaries provide clean water access to more than 300 families in Shuwuu

(MissionNewswire) Salesian missionaries have been operating the Catholic mission station of Shuwuu, Mongolia, for the past four years, but families who live in this district have been accessing water from the Catholic mission since 1998. Throughout the year, people from the countryside come to the well to stock up on drinking water to take to their homes.

At least 300 families come to the well because they have no other clean water access. In many places in Mongolia, water is a rare commodity and is often brought to villages by tanker trucks. Services like this are especially popular with families and young people in Shuwuu, especially during challenges times, such as this year. Mongolia has been in isolation since January, which has caused difficulties and challenges for its citizens.

Brother Andrew Le Phuong, director of the Salesian planning and development office in Ulaanbaatar, said, “Our hope is that clean water services and the other initiatives of the Salesians in Mongolia will become better known and attract more and more generous people around the world to contribute to our mission.”

Mongolia is not the only country that lacks access to clean water. UN-Water estimates that worldwide 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and by 2050, the world’s population will have grown by an estimated 2 billion people, pushing global water demand up to 30 percent higher than today. One in four primary schools has no drinking water service, with students using unprotected water sources or going thirsty. In addition, UN-Water notes that more than 700 children under 5 years of age die every day from diarrheal disease linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation.

Close to 28 percent of the population in Mongolia is living at or below the poverty line with a significant jump to 35 percent for those living in rural areas. Herders in the countryside struggle to survive as their traditional livelihood dissolves, and there are few job opportunities for young generations. Prior to 1990, the country received nearly 30 percent of its gross domestic product from the former Soviet Union and had a centrally planned economy with the government providing basic goods and a full range of public services. As a result, poverty in the country was very low even in rural areas.

According to the World Bank, the poverty rate jumped to nearly 60 percent after 1990, which was directly linked to the country’s transition to a market economy after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the collapse of Mongolia’s centrally planned economy. Today, in part due to Mongolia’s vast mineral resources and mining, the country’s economy is rebounding and the poverty rate is in decline, having decreased from 38.7 percent in 2010 to where it stands today.

David Wallace/The Republic

MISHONGNOVI — At the end of a dusty road, beside two water tanks in the desert shrubs, a windmill spins in the breeze.

From a spigot, water flows through a blue hose and gushes into a bucket.

When the water reaches the brim, Kayla Johnson heaves the bucket into the back of her family’s car. Her younger brother, Terron, holds the hose and keeps the stream running into a 5-gallon jug.

“We come here often,” said Kayla, a 17-year-old high school senior. “This water will last us about two days tops, depending on what we're needing it for.”

At home, Kayla and her three siblings, their parents, grandparents and an uncle all depend on these buckets and jugs. They use the water for bathing, cooking, doing dishes, cleaning house and washing their dogs. Some of it they drink.

Like many other Hopi families, they have no running water, so they make do with 16-mile trips to the windmill and back.

“This is how we've been living, without the water. And we just kind of got used to it,” Kayla said, wearing a mask and gloves as she loaded the last of the jugs into the car. “It would be nice for us to have running water, or at least water closer to your home, instead of having to drive all this way.”

Her family has been waiting many years for a water system to be built in their community atop a mesa on the Hopi Reservation. Now, they and other families are finally in line to be hooked up to a new water system.

The Hopi have long lacked adequate drinking water. In parts of the reservation, the water that flows from taps is contaminated with toxic arsenic at levels that exceed the federal standard. And in homes without running water, many families get by using what little they haul from communal faucets, which can amount to less than 2 gallons a day per person.

This acute state of water poverty has persisted for generations due to insufficient infrastructure, an injustice that leaders of the Hopi Tribe call a humanitarian issue that must finally be addressed. And while the tribe’s leaders have gone to court over water rights, they are also moving ahead with plans for new infrastructure, including a pipeline project that will remedy the contamination problems and extend water lines to more homes.

""Water is life."" Infrastructure needs on Hopi Reservation From accessibility to arsenic contaminated water, the Hopi Reservation is facing water infrastructure needs for its people. David Wallace, The Republic | azcentral.com

Many of the hundreds of families who will benefit from the project have tap water tainted with unsafe levels of arsenic. Others will be getting piped water for the first time.

The 2000 Census found that 27% of Hopi people lacked complete plumbing. Many families use outhouses or portable toilets.

A survey of more than 700 households in the mid-2000s found that 35% of homes had no sewer connection, 11% had no electricity and 18% had no running water. In some villages, most or all homes have no tap water.

These problems are the results of a longstanding lack of funds to address basic needs on the reservation. The tribe’s leaders have been pressing the federal government for assistance. And with $20.5 million in federal funds now secured, the tribe’s water utility is set to begin building the 41-mile pipeline, together with storage tanks and other infrastructure that will bring clean water to homes.

“When we look at the overall picture of some of our shortfalls, it's infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure,” Hopi Tribe Chairman Timothy Nuvangyaoma said in an interview. “It's long overdue out here on Hopi, and it's just been underfunded for too long, and it's been our plea to the national level to bring some attention out here at Hopi.”

In many parts of Arizona and the Southwest, the ground naturally contains arsenic. The element can be dissolved in groundwater at levels that pose health dangers. Over time, drinking arsenic-tainted water increases risks of cancer, kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses.

Water with high levels of arsenic flows not only to many homes but also to some of the community spigots where people fill jugs and tanks. Many of these water systems were built by the federal government between the 1950s and 70s, and the Hopi have been using the water ever since.

While the health effects haven’t been studied, Nuvangyaoma said, there has been an increase in cancer cases among Hopi people.

“We know it has a health impact,” he said. “Continuously having to drink arsenic water is just plain out not healthy.”

The severity of the contamination problem came into focus when the federal Environmental Protection Agency lowered its threshold for arsenic in drinking water from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion. That standard took effect in 2006, and since then several water systems on the reservation have consistently had arsenic levels over the limit.

The problem affects eight of the reservation’s 12 villages. In some communities, tests have shown arsenic levels as much as three to four times over the legal limit. The EPA has cited the operators of several water systems for violations and has told the tribal government to address the problem or face fines.

Two wells were drilled in 2013 to tap into a part of the aquifer with pure water. But the tribe was short of funds to complete the project.

Nuvangyaoma was elected in 2017 and over the past few years has repeatedly testified before the House Appropriations Committee to ask for more funding. Those requests ultimately succeeded, and the tribal government has been working with federal officials on plans for the water pipeline, which will supply communities in the eastern part of the reservation.

“It's been a hard-fought battle,” Nuvangyaoma said. “We’re on the right track now.”

The tribe’s newly created Hopi Utilities Corporation will oversee construction, which is scheduled to begin in the spring with funding from the EPA and the Indian Health Service.

This major expansion of infrastructure has been dubbed the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project. Under the plan, the system will supply water to 869 homes in the areas of First Mesa and Second Mesa, including 778 households that have tap water contaminated with arsenic.

Hopi leaders see the project as a step toward building other needed water projects throughout the reservation. Nuvangyaoma said the tribal government recently assessed immediate water infrastructure needs and estimated the total cost at more than $100 million.

In addition to this funding shortfall, the Hopi face other challenges that complicate their efforts to secure water supplies. The reservation, created 138 year ago by the U.S. government, is surrounded by the Navajo Nation, and its communities rely on wells for drinking water, drawing from an aquifer that has been declining in many areas.

This year, Nuvangyaoma and other Hopi representatives have appeared in virtual court hearings in a long-running case focusing on the Little Colorado River, seeking to clarify the tribe’s water rights. When the case is eventually decided or settled, it could bring not only water but also funding to help build infrastructure.

“We have a lot of needs,” Nuvangyaoma said. “I think we've been ignored for far too long. And we want to bring attention to some of the challenges that we face.”

He understands from personal experience how the lack of infrastructure affects daily life. During his childhood, his family had no running water at home, so they drove to windmills and other sources. They would fill a washbasin in the morning and use it to wash their hands throughout the day.

When they sometimes left the reservation and stopped in neighboring communities, Nuvangyaoma noticed how differently people used water elsewhere.

“You'd see the grass being watered and you'd see kids playing with water balloons, having water fights,” he said. “Boy, if you tried that out here, you would have your uncles or your grandmother screaming at you.”

Living with so little water, he said, Hopi people learn to value water at a young age and are very careful with how much they use.

“We all know water is life,” he said. “If you're threatened with your water running out, it's definitely a concern for us out here on Hopi.”

Kayla Johnson is the oldest of four siblings and she often helps with chores at home. She regularly makes trips for water, driving from their house on Second Mesa down to the windmill in the valley below.

Sometimes, if the family uses more water for cleaning and bathing, they have to make two or three trips.

Her mother, Dottie Johnson, said she’s always lived without running water and it usually doesn’t bother her. The only frustrating thing, she said, was when the family vehicle broke down and they had to find someone to help pick up water.

On a typical day, it’s part of Johnson’s routine to lug buckets around, just like she did as a girl when she walked to get water from the village faucet for her grandmother.

“It’s just the norm for us,” Johnson said. “We can do without.”

Between trips, they store the water in buckets and plastic barrels. Because the house has no plumbing, they use an outhouse. To wash clothes, they regularly drive 65 miles to Winslow with their laundry.

When it’s warm out, they bathe with a camping shower bag inside a makeshift enclosure. Johnson’s boyfriend built the outdoor shower against the side of the house, making a floor with a wood pallet and walls of corrugated metal, with a blanket and bedsheet draped over the top.

“We shower during the summers, so that's kind of our luxury,” Johnson said with a smile. During the winters, they find other places to bathe, including her boyfriend’s family’s home, where they have working faucets.

“We always wish we had running water,” she said. “It would be so much easier, where we could have a washer and dryer and wash our clothes at home.”

Johnson said she has heard talk for years about plans to extend a water line to the area, but nothing has happened. So she’s skeptical.

Recently, she said, a woman and a man from a government agency stopped by and asked to look around the house to see where they could install a septic tank.

“It's been going on for years,” Johnson said. “We just tell them the same thing: We'll see. We'll see if it happens. I mean, it's just broken promises.”

Her family’s house has a bathroom that’s unfinished, with boards on the floor instead of concrete. They left the floor open so they could install plumbing once the water pipe comes.

Her father, Harold Johnson, is 70 and said he has been waiting to get water for about 30 years.

“They're slow. But I think this time we're going to get something,” he said. “We need water. You've got to have water.”

A document issued by the federal Indian Health Service details plans for the Hopi Arsenic Mitigation Project, including how the water will be delivered to several villages. In addition to the pipeline, the system includes three storage tanks, two booster stations, pump houses and other equipment.

According to the EPA, the system is scheduled to be delivering drinking water by the end of 2023.

Other federally funded projects are underway to build water infrastructure elsewhere on the reservation.

The coronavirus has brought greater attention to the fact that many Hopi people can’t simply turn on a faucet to wash their hands. And some of the Hopi Tribe’s federal coronavirus relief funds are being used to expand water access.

In the centuries-old village of Oraibi on Third Mesa, a newly purchased portable “water buffalo” tank sits parked beside stone houses, enabling residents to fill buckets without having to drive several miles to the nearest communal spigot.

Oraibi (also spelled Orayvi) dates to about 1100 and is thought to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. No one in Oraibi has running water, and some of the village’s elders have long preferred it to remain that way for a variety of reasons, including holding on to traditional ways and not disturbing sacred ground to lay pipes.

But Oraibi’s leaders recently decided to use coronavirus relief funds to drill a new well nearby and run a water line to a portion of the homes outside the historic heart of the village.

“I think it’s going to be a good move,” said Beatrice Norton, chairperson of the village board. “For the next generation, it's really going to be a benefit to them.”

A drilling rig recently began humming near Oraibi, boring about 2,000 feet underground. Once a pump is installed, a water line will be laid to connect more than 20 homes and a communal faucet will be installed, Norton said.

In the meantime, residents can get water from the portable tank.

The virus has taken a toll in Oraibi, claiming the life of Norton’s 91-year-old mother, Treva Burton, in April.

Norton is mindful that some of her older neighbors may not have relatives helping haul water, and she wants to make sure the tank has plenty for those who need it most.

To fetch water for her house, she continues to drive more than 5 miles to fill up at a well next to the Hopi Veterans Memorial Center. On a recent afternoon, she put a bucket under the faucet and opened the valve. The water sloshed in.

“This has good tasting water,” Norton said, lifting a bucket into the back of her truck. “It’s a hard life, but you get used to it after a while.”

At another well in the flatlands near Second Mesa, Lucion Koinva hooked a hose to a faucet and water began to pour into a tank on his truck. He said the water would last about a week.

The tribe’s water specialists periodically test some wells and windmills for arsenic contamination. But it’s unclear when this well was last tested.

A sign next to the tank read: “UNREGULATED WATER SOURCE, CONSUME AT YOUR OWN RISK.”

“We’ve always been drinking it. I haven’t really noticed anything from it,” Koinva said.

“We really didn’t know anything about arsenic being in the water until, like, I don’t know how many years back we started finding out,” he said. “And they were saying there was arsenic in the water, but we never knew. So we're still here.”

Koinva said he thinks faucets should be installed on the mesas so people wouldn’t have to come so far. He drove 18 miles round trip to fill the tank and haul the water home.

Craig Andrews, a member of the Hopi Tribal Council who represents the village of Mishongnovi, said the goal is to make clean water available for everyone, enabling future generations to flourish.

“I’m not fighting for today, for myself. This is into the future where my kids’ grandkids are going to benefit, or at least be somewhat better off than where we are today. And that’s the whole fight,” Andrews said, watching another man fill a tank at the well.

“Infrastructure is really the key to the future, to benefit our tribe,” he said. “It starts with the water.”

The Hopi Tribe’s access to water is shaped not only by the infrastructure that’s available but also by the tribe’s history.

In September, Nuvangyaoma spoke to a meeting of Gov. Doug Ducey’s water council about the tribe’s history and culture and its long struggle to clarify its water rights. In his prepared remarks, the Hopi chairman said the tribe has about 14,000 enrolled citizens, over half of whom live on the reservation.

“It has been said that to be a Hopi is to be a steward of the earth, a caretaker of the land and the water,” Nuvangyaoma said. “It has also been said that in Hopi culture, everything is about water. Water is life. Water is the beginning and end of the cycle of life. Our connection to water is very sacred and intimate.”

He explained how the Hopi ancestral lands, which they call Hopi Tutskwa, extend north to the Colorado River, west to the San Francisco Mountains and south to the Mogollon Rim, and how the reservation today is much smaller than those ancestral lands and completely surrounded by the Navajo Reservation.

The reservation’s only reliable water source, he pointed out, is groundwater pumped from the Navajo Aquifer, also called the N Aquifer.

“Unfortunately, wells from this aquifer near the Hopi villages are minimally productive, and often contain arsenic in amounts that make the water unsafe for human consumption, making it necessary to develop expensive well fields and related infrastructure north of the Hopi villages,” Nuvangyaoma said.

He spoke of how the U.S. government established the reservation in 1882, how the Navajo encroached on Hopi ancestral lands and how the federal government later enlarged the Navajo Reservation over the years until it completely surrounded the Hopi Reservation.

He explained the twists and turns in land disputes over the past century. He said Hopi and Navajo negotiators have made progress recently in talks on issues that have been “major stumbling blocks” in moving toward a water settlement.

In 2012, then-Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain had sought to build support for a Navajo-Hopi water settlement on the Little Colorado, but the proposal encountered opposition and was scrapped.

Addressing the water council, Nuvangyaoma explained the tribe’s effort to clarify water rights through the courts.

“Hopi is entitled to all water necessary for the Hopi Reservation to be a permanent economically viable and self-sufficient homeland for the Hopi people,” Nuvangyaoma said, including surface water from the Colorado River and off-reservation groundwater from Hopi ranches to the south.

In September, the Hopi Tribe’s leaders and attorneys returned to court to make their case for water rights in the Little Colorado River basin, appearing in virtual hearings due to the pandemic.

The trial before the Arizona Superior Court is part of a larger case called the Little Colorado River adjudication, which has been in litigation since the 1970s. The Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation, along with the federal government, filed claims in the case in 1985. The trial will determine the Hopi Tribe’s future access to water in the river basin.

As the hearings began, Nuvangyaoma said it was important “we make it clear that we have an inherent right to good clean healthy water for our people.”

The trial is scheduled to continue through January, with more than 80 witnesses giving testimony. Some hearings have focused on the tribe’s water needs and plans for economic development.

Those giving testimony included two experts who last year submitted an economic assessment of future water needs on the reservation — Michael Hanemann, a professor of economics and director of Arizona State University’s Center for Environmental Economics and Sustainability Policy, and Dale Whittington, a professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

They wrote in their report that the aim is to provide enough water for the Hopi Reservation to be a “livable and abiding place” for the tribe as a permanent homeland, and that at present the reservation does not “meet the standard of a livable homeland.”

They said the very low levels of water use on the reservation reflect severe deficiencies of water systems that “constrain economic development.”

“These water supply systems are quite similar to the simple piped water systems that were built in many poor rural communities in developing countries such as Pakistan and India in the second half of the 20th century, intended to supply basic human needs but not to serve as a platform for economic development,” Hanemann and Whittington wrote.

In households without running water, they estimated that Hopi families typically use less than 2 gallons per person per day, which they said is probably the lowest of anywhere in the United States, an amount that “would be considered low for a poor, rural household in most parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.”

These extremely low water use levels result from the inadequate infrastructure, “not because Hopi households do not want more water,” they said.

Addressing the severe infrastructure deficit is critical because infrastructure serves as a platform that enables economic development, Hanemann and Whittington wrote. The rapid growth of metropolitan areas in Phoenix and Los Angeles would have been impossible, they noted, without “the large-scale importation of freshwater supplies financed in part by higher level governments,” including large government water projects such as Hoover Dam and the $4 billion Central Arizona Project Canal.

Without adequate water supplies and infrastructure, they said, the quality of life on the reservation will fall further behind and the reservation “will dwindle into little more than an old people’s home” — and will not be a “livable homeland.”

The worsening effects of climate change, which research shows are increasing temperatures and intensifying drought in the Southwest, pose an additional threat to water security, they wrote. Increasing the water supply allotted to the Hopi Tribe, they said, would be an “insurance strategy” for reducing risks.

At the situation stands, Nuvangyaoma has said residents suffer high unemployment partly because the reservation’s remote and landlocked location hinders economic development. He and other Hopi leaders say securing additional water would change that, opening up economic opportunities.

The chairman said addressing the lack of water and infrastructure is a matter of finally righting a longstanding injustice.

“We're fighting for our livelihood right now and we need the government to pay attention to us,” Nuvangyaoma said.

In the water rights case, he added, the Hopi Tribe has faced opposition from a list of entities ranging from Salt River Project to Flagstaff and other cities.

“I just look at it as if they don't want Hopi to survive. I mean, this is a humanitarian situation,” Nuvangyaoma said. “It bothers me that this is how another set of humans can be treated.”

Nuvangyaoma said the Hopi Reservation’s serious water problems remind him of the crisis surrounding lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan. He said he also thinks about the injustice of his tribe's long struggle for water in the context of the nationwide demands for change in protests over police killings of Black Americans.

“Black lives matter, they say, and they do. Native American lives matter. Hopi lives matter. We want that opportunity,” Nuvangyaoma said. “We've been here since time immemorial. And it seems that we're invisible, to some of the inequalities, the injustices that are happening right here in Arizona's backyard.”

He said his focus in speaking about these unresolved water issues, including with congressional leaders in Washington, has been “making as much noise as we can.”

The goal is to make sure the Hopi Tribe has a homeland with water into the future, he said. “And when we talk about for the future, we don't talk about 100 years from now. We talk 500, a thousand years from now.”

He said his hopes for the future are simple.

“I want better for the Hopi people,” he said. “We need water to survive.”

My email boxes are overflowing with questions as to why our eateries have been singled out - and required to be policemen - regarding questionable measures (not laws, “measures”) that fly in the face of what’s actually happening at malls, box stores, etc. Political issues aside, the simple fact is that well-run restaurants are, have been and always will be leaders when it comes to sanitation and disinfection.

In spite of that, apparently uninformed people continue to cite these increasingly draconian restrictions to question the safety of restaurants. For some consumers, the concept of hand washing, surface sanitation and being aware of what you touch is a novel concept. Nothing could be further from the truth; all that and more are everyday concerns for well-run eateries. But the hardships heaped upon our friends and neighbors who own and operate restaurants continue to dismiss the very things that make a good restaurant one of the most sanitary places you can be. It almost seems like there could be some agenda other than health.

They say that experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted, and that certainly applies to the volumes of rules and regulations that grew out of real-life encounters with bacteria, viruses and foodborne pathogens. One of the primary compilations of these sanitation procedures is known as HACCP. From the moment a seed is planted or an animal is born (or hatched), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points are identified and monitored to ensure that the risk of contamination remains as low as possible. On the restaurant level, strict procedures for storing, handling, cooking and serving become a key element in the training of managers, cooks and even servers. And these procedures merge seamlessly with the need to protect guests from any sort of microbial transmission.

There’s a lot of hysteria and misinformation nowadays regarding gloves, masks and the like. I often hear people complain that the person preparing their food wasn’t wearing gloves, and it seems like that would be a major offense. Interestingly, many state health inspectors disagree. They maintain that gloves can give workers a false sense of security when handling non-food items such as money, doorknobs, cans, boxes, etc. The next time you order from a carryout, a truck or a stand at an outdoor event, watch the preparer’s hands. Does he or she handle your money and make change wearing the same gloves that touched your taco? In the words of the state health inspector for my most recent restaurant, “the only things those gloves keep clean are your hands.” I’ve been impressed by the increasing number of food service workers who change gloves as they handle takeout bags, money and the like.

On a similar note, one of my pet peeves is when a server graciously - and innocently - carries your plate of half-eaten food back into the kitchen to be boxed for you to take home. The danger is that that plate could possibly contact the same surface where fresh food is waiting to be served. What if I had coughed onto my plate while eating? More and more restaurants are wising up to this potential for cross-contamination by bringing the carryout container to the table so the guest can box the leftovers. I suspect that this procedure might soon be added to the wealth of scientifically based and common-sense safeguards that restaurants are required to follow.

Owners, managers and guests trust servers, prep cooks, line cooks, runners, etc. to care enough about their jobs to scrub their hands often - especially after visiting the restroom. Competent owners operate in their best interests by making it clear to employees that the business - and their livelihoods - depend on vigilant food-handling, frequent hand washing and attention to the guests’ well-being.

This concept regarding employees and trust also applies to my “policeman” comment back in paragraph one. There are increasing numbers of angry incidents regarding customers and employees. These include drinks thrown in a bartender’s face when the patron was told he could not sit at the bar, and a conflict I myself witnessed last week when a bartender was forced to tell patrons that they could not dance to the live music. The poor bartender had to kiss that tip goodbye. (That issue of customer rudeness and anger also extends to our beleaguered retail workers, by the way.)

In spite of all the largely unfounded fears out there, chances are overwhelmingly good that restaurant experiences - takeout and otherwise - will be safe and non-toxic. In fact, epidemiological studies have shown that food served even by fast-food chains is safer than that prepared in your own home. Furthermore, technological advances have given rise to improved protocols designed to detect and respond to sanitation issues.

It’s no secret that customers’ sense of well-being is vital to success in this business of eating - whether it’s a food truck, a fast-food drive-thru or a fine-dining steakhouse. By standing back and applying a bit of critical thinking to some of the purported “science” used to justify this ongoing targeting of restaurants, the fact becomes clear that quality eateries have survived because sanitation and cleanliness have always been their No. 1 priority.","Political issues aside, the simple fact is that well-run restaurants are, have been and always will be leaders when it comes to sanitation and disinfection.

NEW DELHI: Less than 45 per cent of households use clean fuel for cooking in five states, including Bihar and West Bengal, the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) has revealed.

The survey covered 17 states and five union territories.

The five states where less than 45 per cent households use clean fuel for cooking are Assam (42.1 per cent), Bihar (37.8 per cent), Meghalaya (33.7 per cent), Nagaland (43 per cent) and West Bengal (40.2 per cent), according to the data.

The NFHS-5 (2019-20) was conducted in 6.1 lakh sample households to collect information on population, health, family planning and nutrition-related indicators from the 22 states and union territories.

According to the data, over 80 per cent of households use clean fuels in Andhra Pradesh (83.6 per cent), Goa (96.5 per cent), Mizoram (83.8 per cent) and Telangana (91.8 per cent). Electricity, LPG or natural gas and biogas are considered as clean fuel in the survey.

The survey also showed that the use of clean fuel increased in all the 22 surveyed states and UTs in comparison to NFHS-4 (2015-16).

It found that over 70 per cent of the population in 16 states are living in households that use an improved sanitation facility.

Lakshadweep (99.8 per cent) and Kerala (98.7 per cent) have the highest percentage of population living in households with an improved sanitation facility, while Bihar (49.4 per cent) and Ladakh (42.3 per cent) have the lowest, the survey said.

It found that almost all the surveyed households are using iodised salt.

Over 90 per cent of the population was living in households with electricity, and more than 70 per cent with improved drinking water sources in the surveyed states and UTs, according to the data.

The NFHS results of 17 states and five UTs (Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Mizoram, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu) have been released now as Phase-I.

Phase-II, which will cover other states, will be released next year, the health ministry has said.

Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources permanent secretary Raijeli Taga (right) commissioned borehole water project at Ratu Emeri Primary School in Bua on December 3, 2020.

After 45 years, Ratu Emeri Primary School in Bua is in a better position to access clean water without any trouble.

This is after the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources permanent secretary Raijeli Taga commissioned their bore­hole water project on Wednes­day.

Ms Taga said the project start­ed with groundwater survey in 2016 to 2017.

The borehole drilling was conducted in 2017 to 2018 and reticulation programme from 2018 to 2019.

“The project is in line with the five and 20 years National Development Plan of Fiji un­der water and sanitation which aims to fulfill the sustainable development goal – clean and safe water in adequate quan­tity,” Ms Taga said.

“I am glad that my ministry is supporting and working to­wards achieving the national target of 100 per cent access to clean and safe drinking water to all Fijians in the rural com­munity by 2030.”

The total cost of the project is $70,000.

“The borehole is proven to be of good yield and good qual­ity which can supplement the water supply to the school and can be maintained over a number of years if sustainably managed,” she said.

“This borehole is estimated to directly benefit 125 people.”

She stressed to the school management the importance of looking after the project well.

Meanwhile, Ratu Emeri Pri­mary School head teacher Kiniviliame Naiki said since the school was built in 1974, it has been using different types of water source.

“Lately we were using water from the nearby spring,” Mr Naiki said.

“During rainy days the pipes get damaged and we would be without water.”

With the opening of this borehole project, he said their struggles and pain have been removed.

He thanked the ministry for its timely support.

Yet, he’s at work every day for over 12 hours, supervising the 37 men who keep the toilets, provided by Bhutani International, “clean-ish” at the protest site where thousands of farmers have been camping since November 26.

“We have been given the tender by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) and have been here since December 2. There are Indian toilets and western commodes too. There are 37 vehicles with 10 toilets each,” said Singh. There is a row of toilet vehicles just before the barricades at Singhu border. Manoj (34), with his neon green jacket and a broom in hand, is one of those tasked with keeping the toilets clean. “I have been doing this for two years, and I am being paid Rs 400 a day. Some days, I do a single 10-hour shift, other days, I opt for overtime and do two shifts… The problems remain the same — some leave the tap open, others don’t flush properly. We try to do our best,” he said.

At a village nearby, the company has rented two large rooms where the 35-plus contractual employees stay. “The first shift begins at 5 am and goes on till 1 pm, the other one begins at 1 pm and goes on till 11 pm. There are very few people who use the toilet late at night, and it’s too cold to ask anyone to clean,” said Singh.

Apart from this, there are 11 toilets at the Guru Teg Bahadur Memorial nearby, frequented by protesters who are staying inside the premises as well as those who take shelter in their trolleys and tractors. Amit (40), the sanitation supervisor there, said he has a team of eight men who clean the 11 toilets at the Memorial, which is spread across an 11-acre area. He said, “Each year, at least one big gathering takes place here, which we are now used to managing, but this is the first time that the numbers are this high and for so many days.”

Among those tasked with cleaning the toilets at the Memorial are 24-year-old Pramod, who hails from UP’s Muzaffarnagar, and Pradeep (28). “Our salary is Rs 13,500 a month for working six days a week, from 8 am to 5 pm. Thankfully, there are so many portable toilets in the area now so the pressure is distributed. The protesters are unlike any other we have seen — many ask if they can help,” said Pradeep.

Plus DUSIB has placed two vehicles with 10 toilets each as well. While the cubicles were relatively clean, the lack of water was a grouse many held. “The sheer number of people here is staggering so we understand some problems… They do get addressed quickly too. We are grateful to the Delhi government for this,” said Manjot Singh (26), who has come to Delhi from Punjab’s Bathinda.

A few kilometers away from the stage is Hemkunt Foundation’s ‘Tent City’ — 150 water-proof tents that accommodate over 500 people at a petrol pump, with two toilets. Harteerath Singh (19), community development director on site, said the tents are occupied by elderly farmers, protesters with young children, and women students of Panjab University. “Our own volunteers — students, MNC employees — clean the toilets, in two shifts. We also provide sanitary napkins to women. By Saturday, we will set up more tents, and will be able to accommodate 1,000 people,” said Singh.

Ashwani Aggarwal and Sahaj Umang Singh of Basicshit.org — an organisation that builds portable, waterless toilets using single-use plastic — have meanwhile set up a ‘Bibiyan da toilet’ after a day-long recce. “We realised women are having a lot of trouble accessing clean toilets, so we have set up one. We had set up three at the Shaheen Bagh protest but two were destroyed when the protest site was cleaned up in March. Hopefully, we will get funds and can set up more,” said Singh.

At Tikri border, more than 300 portable toilet cabins have been put by the Haryana and Delhi government for farmers, and there are over 50 sanitation workers deployed. Mumtaz (24) and her sister, who live nearby, reach the site at 8 am daily and begin cleaning the toilets as well as the road. “We’ve been working here for more than two weeks now, from 8 am to 6 pm. It’s exhausting work… There are thousands of people here. We carry bags to collect the waste from the toilets and roads, and by the end of the day, it weighs more than 30 kg,” said Mumtaz.

A senior district official from Bahadurgarh said, “We have deployed several workers on the ground. A lot of waste is generated during the day due to food, toilets and the transport of materials. We have sent more than 200 vehicles with toilets and also placed other cabins to be used as toilets. Workers are deployed till evening to clean the roads and toilets.”

On Thursday afternoon, 45-year-old Rakesh, a contractual worker with the Haryana government, was told to clean five toilet cabins. With a toilet plunger and a broom in hand, he began his work. “I don’t keep a count now. I clean all the toilets with a plunger. I also have to check the water and the flush. There’s a lot of work here but I get food. The farmers also give me packed food for my children.”","There is a row of toilet vehicles just before the barricades at Singhu border.

Peng Jianhua may have streaked to victory in the race’s sixth annual outing, in the process knocking 3 minutes off the course record, but in his wake, and those of 9,999 other participants, was a trail of devastation.

And a bunch of Nanjing car owners impatient to get back on the road.

As a result, while the athletes raced against time to return their personal bests, so an orange army of sanitation workers stood by ready to do their utmost to return a spotless city, ready for the public to use again as soon as possible.

More than a thousand sanitation personnel had been deployed Sunday, charged with cleaning each section of the marathon’s track within 15 minutes, reported the Yangtze Evening News.

After the pistol was fired for a 07:30 start from the east gate of Nanjing Olympic Sports Centre, marathon participants first turned on to Mengdu Da Jie. With the runners gone, so the cleaners moved in at 07:45; they were done by 08:05. Fengtai Nan Lu was next, where cleaners began their lightning shift at 08:00, to knock off on schedule at 08:15. And so it continued.

Assisting the orange army in their monumental task were 53 machine sweepers, 16 small-cleaning vehicles, 15 water tankers, 27 other rubbish-collection vehicles, 31 pickup trucks and 83 quick-cleaning vehicles.

All in all, a total of 1,049 sanitation workers disposed of 17.35 tons of rubbish, among which were 13 bags of discarded face masks.

Like Peng, their work had been completed in record time, but unlike the race’s victor, it had began much, much earlier than the official race start. The orange army first took to the streets between 03:30 and 04:00, being required to complete all preparatory cleaning before 06:00. Participating athletes even remarked that the track was still emitting a fresh smell.

With such a large number of sports enthusiasts running along the route, so there was also opportunity, some of it criminal. Sanitation workers were joined by law enforcing urban management, out to remove illegal advertisements, bike sharing, street stalls and other hindrances to the smooth operation of the race.

And the final part of those sanitation workers’ job description? The most important advertising of all; to carry out their tasks “showing an elegant demeanour” to the runners who came from afar.","Assisting the orange army in their monumental task were 53 machine sweepers, 16 small-cleaning vehicles, 15 water tankers, 27 other rubbish-collection vehicles, 31 pickup trucks and 83 quick-cleaning vehicles.

489,https://www.dairyfoods.com/articles/94759-go-clean-with-emulsifiers-stabilizers-and-gums,"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",dairyfoods.com,"Go ‘clean’ with emulsifiers, stabilizers and gums","Emulsifiers, stabilizers and gums are the unsung heroes of many dairy products. Not only do they create desired textures, but they also help offerings avoid nasty issues such as syneresis and keep their attributes throughout shelf life.

“Stabilizers and emulsifiers can help with freeze/thaw stability, resistance to shrinkage, resistance to syneresis, resistance to serum separation, resistance to creaming, resistance to sedimentation [and] resistance to meltdown, as well as contribute to the overall texture of a finished product,” summarizes Philip Rakes, senior food technologist for Agropur U.S., Eden Prairie, Minn. “In some rare instances, they can even contribute to the nutritional aspects of a finished product.”

According to Iliana Nava, senior technical service specialist, hydrocolloids for Minneapolis-based Cargill, hydrocolloids (which include starches and gums) also are important for keeping products consistent batch to batch when they contain ingredients with variable amounts of solids and minerals.

In frozen desserts, gums and starches serve another functionality, says Matthew Berliner, vice president, ISC Gums, Edison, N.J. These ingredients control melt time, ice crystal size and shelf stability.

And in sour cream and cottage cheese, stabilizers can prevent whey separation, notes Scott Rangus, president and CEO of Ingredients Solutions Inc. (ISI), Waldo, Maine.

Despite their multifaceted roles, emulsifiers, gums and starches are asked to serve another purpose by many of today’s discerning consumers: They should also be clean-label friendly.

What’s in a name?

One of the biggest influences in the emulsifiers/stabilizers/gums space in the past year has been consumers’ interest in products they perceive as “natural” or “less processed,” shares Nava.

“That can create challenges for formulators, as they strive to maintain functionality and achieve their textural goals for finished products,” she adds. “Fortunately, ingredient suppliers like Cargill have been working to address these gaps, introducing a steady stream of highly functional, label-friendly products.”

Eco Guar Group LLC’s 2018 quantitative research study found that 86% of consumers think it is important to understand ingredients on food labels, says Kat Peeler, CEO of the New York-based company.

“Products with additives like carrageenan and xanthan gum are increasingly being rejected by customers due to their perceived artificiality and being linked to potential health problems,” she adds.

According to Corie Beyers, strategic marketing manager, food systems for Westchester, Ill.-based Ingredion Incorporated, one of the challenges here is that there is no universally accepted definition for clean label. Thus, processors need to be “agile and flexible” within a constantly changing market.

“When a developer is looking to clean up their label, it is often contingent on GMO status, organic status, retailer approval and other variables,” she explains.

The clean-label movement also has changed how processors label the ingredients they use. They now often list “the common names of additives on ingredient labels instead of technical names” — for example using “guar gum” instead of “E412,” explains Peeler.

Eco Guar Group’s research also revealed that 69% of consumers thought guar gum didn’t belong on a clean label. However, after learning that it was plant-derived, 77% of consumers believed it to be clean-label friendly.

“A major finding was that consumers strongly preferred the name guar bean gum over guar gum,” says Peeler. “Nearly 90% (88%) believed adding ‘bean’ to the name best communicated the natural origin of guar gum and was the best fit for a clean label.”

After reviewing these findings, Eco Guar Group petitioned the FDA for a name change and won approval to use guar bean gum in labeling.

An Ho, research and development director, and Emily O’Chiu, product development scientist for Fenton, Mo.-based International Food Products Corp., say if the name of an ingredient has an artificial connotation, it can influence consumer perception.

“Xanthan gum is commonly accepted as clean label, but the word xanthan can have a chemical perception,” they note. “Due to the word’s appearance, some consumers will not buy anything with xanthan as an ingredient.”

According to Berliner, consumer perception can make a huge difference, even if it is inaccurate. He points to carrageenan, a stabilizer derived from seaweed that has suffered from “misinformation spread virally” and is still recovering its reputation in the eyes of consumers.

“Right or wrong, it’s difficult to fight consumer perception, and consumer education is a long, expensive and difficult undertaking, especially these days when one tweet from an ‘influencer’ can wrongly inform consumers and create a backlash against an ingredient,” Berliner argues.

Kevin Johndro, director of research and development for ISI, agrees that carrageenan has specifically suffered a backlash.

“[It] has been used safely in commercially marketed products for decades,” he notes. “It has also been under an orchestrated attack by a small group of researchers for several years.”

‘Cleaner’ ingredient offerings

Fortunately for dairy processors looking to clean up their labels, lots of stabilizers, emulsifiers and gums fit the bill. For example, in the emulsifier category, Cargill offers a “more label-friendly” sunflower or canola lecithin, which can be used instead of mono- and diglycerides, says Nava.

“Lecithin will hold the fat and water portions of a frozen-dessert system in place, and it can help control overrun,” she explains.

For its part, The Ingredient House, Southern Pines, N.C., created an emulsifier made from red maple wood that also meets clean-label needs.

“We offer an upcycled plant-based, clean-label emulsifier, humectant and texturizer called Nouravant maple fiber,” says Katherine Cleland, technical manager. “It has shown efficacy as an emulsifier and mono-/diglyceride replacement in some dairy applications.”

Yogurt makers looking for a clean-label stabilizer could turn to pectin, a fiber naturally derived from citrus peels, explains Kyle Bailey, sales technical service manager, Americas for Atlanta-based CP Kelco. The company offers a couple of pectin products meant for different applications. For example, its new GENU Pectin YM-FP-2100 is designed for fruity yogurt drinks.

“[It] is added at the fruit preparation stage and then carries over the stability into the yogurt drink,” Bailey says. “No other starch or stabilizer is needed.”

CP Kelco also created GENU Explorer Pectin ND-200 as a vegetarian substitute for gelatin.

“It has the same creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture and molding quality to make dairy desserts such as panna cotta and is compatible with traditional processing methods,” Bailey points out.

Another citrus fiber with stabilizing (and emulsifying) properties is Fiberstar’s Citri-Fi — a byproduct created by the citrus juicing process, explains Brock Lundberg, Ph.D., president of R&D and applications for the River Falls, Wis.-based company.

“Due to the high fat- and water-binding capability of Citri-Fi, very small amounts — for example, less than 0.5% — of Citri-Fi will deliver emulsification and stabilization functionality,” he notes, “Citri-Fi also comes in several different particle sizes, which can be useful for formulating different properties such as emulsification, viscosity, creaminess, storage and/or process stability.”

According to Lundberg, the ingredient can be labeled as consumer-friendly “dried citrus pulp” or “citrus flour.”

On the gums front, ISC Gums offers the clean-label option of acacia gum, notes Berliner. It is often used in dairy beverages for its ability to emulsify without adding texture.

“ISC Gums is currently developing an exciting new process, which will produce an acacia that will provide a stronger emulsion at much heavier oil loads,” he says. “This process will not use any chemical modifiers and will be 100% clean label.”

Beyond clean label

Consumer interest in clean labels goes beyond looking for naturally derived ingredients. It can also mean a desire for label designations such as non-GMO and organic, explains Donna Klockeman, director of R&D innovation for Colony Gums Inc., Monroe, N.C.

“In response to increased consumer demand for non-GMO ingredients, we have expanded our TrueGum line of Non-GMO Project Verified gums and stabilizer blends,” she says. “We have also observed increased requests for organic-compliant and our certified Colony Organics product line that includes individual hydrocolloids and stabilizer blends.”

Ingredion also sells a variety of Non-GMO Project Verified gums, says Beyers.

“We currently offer over 60 gum-containing products that carry the Non-GMO Project Verified seal, including acacia, guar, pectin, xanthan and more,” she notes. “We are committed to producing ingredients that allow manufacturers to communicate clearly and honestly with their customers.”

Another reality of the clean-label movement is that consumers are looking for shorter ingredient lists, notes Jennifer Stephens, vice president of marketing for Fiberstar. This has led to processors searching for multifunctional ingredients that can serve more than one purpose in a formulation.

“Very few natural ingredients provide multiple functionality and stability in food processing,” she says. “Citri-Fi is unique in that this citrus fiber provides both high water-holding and emulsification properties.”

According to Bailey, CP Kelco’s dual-function KELCOGEL DF gellan gum, which is meant for dairy beverages, can help shorten ingredients lists.

“It provides suspension power for insolubles like cocoa or minerals, as it enhances mouthfeel,” he explains. “It’s one ingredient that does the work of two.”

And sustainability plays a role in the clean-label picture, too. Consumers not only want to understand what the ingredients are, but also how they are sourced.

“For the dairy processors, a transparent supply chain and traceability from farmer to processor help to ensure product quality and safety,” says Peeler. “Eco Guar Group has a focus on ethical fair trade, traceability and sustainability with industry-leading renewable energy and green-technology manufacturing innovations that contribute to the [corporate social responsibility] goals of our customers.”

CP Kelco also emphasizes the sustainable nature of its ingredients, notes Bailey.

“The clean-label movement is evolving and encompassing more avenues due to consumer demand for transparency,” he points out. “As a nature-based company, we have made a strong commitment to that space. We have great stories to tell about how our ingredients are sourced and the efforts at our plants to reduce our impact on the planet as we strive for zero waste.”

And plant-based fiber ingredients supplier J. Rettenmaier USA LP (JRS), Schoolcraft, Mich., is looking for ways to reduce its impact as “natural and renewable” claims become more important to today’s consumers, says Greg Gilleland, functional systems product sales manager.

“Caring for the ecological cycle is always a top priority to JRS,” he adds. “Therefore, sustainable plant-based raw materials will always be the foundation of our product philosophy in the future.”

Challenges of clean label

While clean-label emulsifiers, stabilizers and gums are the preference of many consumers, using natural ingredients also can have certain downsides. Clean-label ingredients might require higher usage rates, explains Lundberg, and they might not be as easy to incorporate or as able to function over time and in different process conditions.

“For example, oftentimes a pectin and/or starch would need to be either rehydrated in water and/or heated to activate its functional properties,” he points out.

And when experimenting with clean-label formulations, it can be difficult for processers to predict the effect that processing and “other elements of formulating will have on an end product,” says Beyers.

“Once you delve deeper, it is important to consider things that may not be as obvious, such as pH, salt concentration, heat processing or total water availability, as these can all impact stability,” she explains. “Some hydrocolloids like xanthan gum, for example, are stable across a wide pH range, while the functionality of others such as guar gum will degrade over time in acidic environments.”

Another potential challenge to switching to clean-label emulsifiers, stabilizers and gums is price, say Ho and O’Chiu.

“Clean-label ingredients are almost always more expensive than the artificial, chemical or overly processed ingredients,” they note. “Often the dairy processor is not able to pay significant amounts more for a clean label. It gets tricky trying to formulate something with more costly ingredients and try[ing]to keep the overall cost the same.”

Fortunately, processors have options.

“The beauty in utilizing hydrocolloids is that there is rarely just one solution,” says Klockeman, noting that for its part, Colony Gums offers a variety of products, including agar, carrageenan, cellulose gum, gellan gum, guar gum, gum acacia, sunflower lecithin, tara gum, locust bean gum and stabilizer blends, which processors can choose from based on their needs.","Emulsifiers, stabilizers and gums are the unsung heroes of many dairy products.

On Wednesday, the group announced its annual financial results for the year ending July. The company has brought its gross debt down significantly. It paid R291-million in capital for the current year and a further R409-million post-year end.

This will leave the company with a debt balance of R2-billion, down from the R4-billion the company’s new management team inherited at the start of 2018 financial year.

“EOH is a story of continued improvement in that 2020 is much better than 2019 and H2 [second half] is better than H1 [first half] for 2020,” said the group chief executive, Stephen van Coller.

He said the group was now targeting a “70% equity to 30% debt ratio,”.

“Since embarking on its turnaround strategy EOH, in my view, has made great progress towards building a sustainable organisation while navigating these negative effects of issues inherited from previous management as well as the negative impacts of Covid-19.”

Since taking over as group leader in September 2018, Van Coller and his team have focused on cleaning up the business from a governance and financial perspective.

Accounting firm PwC gave the company an unqualified audit, indicating a fair and transparent financial statement in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.

This is a milestone for a company that has been rocked up by allegations of corruption and bribery for several years.

In 2019, Microsoft terminated its licensing agreement with EOH after a tip-off to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission about alleged wrongdoing regarding a software procurement deal between EOH and the South African National Defence Force and the department of water and sanitation.

Last month, the company testified at the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture and provided evidence of irregular money flows at EOH, which was unearthed by law firm ENSafrica.

The forensic investigation, which was commissioned by the board of the company in 2019, identified R1.2-billion in suspicious contracts. It also found severe governance failings, tender irregularities, unsubstantiated payments among other unethical business dealings at the company.

The company gave information relating to the questionable and unethical business practices dating back to 2014, which were brought to light by the ENSafrica’s report.

At the commission, Van Coller said the investigation found that payments were made to subcontractors in circumstances where there was no evidence that the subcontractors did the work.

“At the time, these payments totalled R1.2-billion, including VAT, and on further investigation, it is currently suspected the potential irregular payments stand at approximately R865-million,” he said.

Also in November, ENSafrica’s director, Stephen Powell, testified at the commission that Geoff Makhubo received money from EOH to his Molelwane Consulting company when he was City of Johannesburg’s member of the mayoral committee for finance . He is now the mayor.

Molelwane has denied any wrongdoing.

Powell further revealed that other payments were made by Jehan Mackay when he was EOH’s executive director to ANC officials, including Zizi Kodwa, Siyabulela Sintwa and Reggie Nkabinde.

According to the company’s financial statements, five of the eight problematic public sector contracts had been settled, with one currently in arbitration, one in final negotiations and third deal concluding at the end of April 2021.

A total loss of R323-million in the current financial year was recorded as a result of these legacy contracts. In the first half of the year, the loss was R188-million and R279-million in 2019.

The company said these contracts do not qualify as discontinued for reporting purposes because they relate to specific contracts and not a division or definable area of business.

A settlement has also been reached with the Special Investigating Unit post-year end in respect of disclosures reported in May 2019 for two of the three identified contracts where overbilling of licence occurred.

“EOH will repay R42-million over 36 months as reimbursement for overcharging the department of defence and is in the process of finalising a similar arrangement with regard to the third and final contract.

“These costs have been fully provided for in the FY2019 and FY2020 accounts”, according to the company’s annual financial results.

While the amended Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, focused on undoing damage caused by the wrong decision of dumping mixed waste and creating garbage hills, the pace of implementing these rules is lagging even after three years.

CSE's latest publication Clean it Right: Dumpsite Management in India is an attempt to understand and document the problem, and the gaps that need to be filled. We invite you to a webinar with experts from some of the Indian cities who have taken initiatives and efforts in the right direction towards dumpsite management.

*NOTE: This is a free webinar, and the registration is only limited to representatives from Urban Local Bodies (ULB) who are willing to participate or are already a part of CSE's initiative ªForum of Cities that Segregateº. All the cities who register will receive an automatic confirmation. However, we request you to register yourself at the earliest and reach out to us in case of any queries.

For CSE’s latest assessment of winter pollution in Rajasthan, please see:

Under the National Clean Air Programme, implementation of comprehensive clean air action plans is underway in five non-attainment cities of Rajasthan including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur, and Alwar. The objective is to meet the target of reducing particulate pollution by at least 20-30 per cent from the 2017 level by 2024. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) has prepared the plan and now taken the lead to enhance the implementation strategies for an effective impact.

In this regard, the RSPCB, in collaboration with CSE, has initiated an assessment of the current challenges, status of baseline action in each sector of pollution, identify the gaps and next steps to inform and enhance more granular strategies. This multi-sector strategy encompasses industry, power plants, vehicles and transportation, waste management and solid fuels in households. The state government has already initiated several measures in all these sectors. But assessment of the progress and emerging challenges in each sector across the region will further help to raise the level of ambition and effectiveness of the strategy.

As part of this initiative, the RSPCB is among the very few in the country to have taken the lead to adopt a unique approach of mitigating pollution at a regional scale to maximise air quality gains. RSPCB has recognised the importance of aligning action across sectors in a given airshed to minimise the regional influence on local pollution while enhancing the local action. Even though under the NCAP the RSPCB is implementing city-specific clean air action plans in five non-attainment cities, it is additionally creating a framework for regional approach. To pilot this approach, the administrative boundary of the Jaipur division has been prioritised for develop regional scale action plan. Division comprises of different districts, cities, towns and rural hinterland and is a useful framework to test out the multi-jurisdiction regional sale of approach to mitigation.

As part of this collaborative effort, field investigation has been carried out in targeted hotspots and in cities to understand the ground realities and implementation challenges. This has been contextualised within emerging and changing air quality trends in the region, and changing pattern of public health risk. For each sector baseline action has been identified to chart the next steps.

Based on this assessment, more sector specific investigation, stakeholder consultation, best practice sharing and capacity building exercise will be carried out to continually improve implementation and compliance.

On the occasion of the release of the findings of this new study – “Enhanced Strategies for Clean Air Action Plan in Jaipur Division, Rajasthan” -- a stakeholder workshop was organised as part of the RSPCB-CSE collaboration. This gathering had the presence of Ms Veena Gupta (IAS), Chairperson, Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board, Sunita Narain, Director General, Centre for Science and Environment, Ravi Jain, Transport Commissioner, Dr Mukesh Sharma, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Dr Vijai Singhal, Chief Environment Engineer, RSPCB, and Anumita Roychowdhury, Executive Director, CSE. This gathering had also brought together diverse set of officials from urban local bodies, bus transport corporation, Metro Rail, Industry association, academia from Jodhpur IIT, media representatives among others. This new report also included additional assessment of industrial and power plant pollution in Jaipur division. CSE experts Parth Kumar, Vinay Trivedi, and Shantanu Gupta shared the findings.

This summary note captures the key highlights of the sector-specific assessment.

Air quality assessment

Informing clean air target for action planning: Even though the NCAP has set a target of 20-30 per cent reduction in particulate pollution from 2017 level by 2024, the actual target reduction needed in cities to meet the clean air standards varies. At this stage, without an appropriate protocol, it is not possible to set a uniform region-wide reduction target. Air quality monitoring is also limited to only a few cities of the region. As per the global good practice, if the current baseline is taken as the three-year average and compared with the national ambient air quality standards for PM2.5, accordingly, Jaipur needs to cut its annual PM2.5 level by 23 per cent, Jodhpur by 54 per cent, Udaipur 16 per cent, Kota 23 per cent, and Alwar by 16 per cent. In addition, Bhiwadi, an industrial cluster requires 64 per cent cut followed by Pali at 34 per cent, and Ajmer by 8 per cent.

This indicates the scale and speed of action needed to meet the clean air benchmark. In fact, the reduction target for PM10, coarser particles, is expected to be higher. However, PM2.5 monitoring is still limited in the state.

Long-term trends in pollution in cities of Jaipur division: Available data for PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 for cities of Jaipur division show high but a stabilised trend. The annual average concentration of PM10 has started declining in the key cities of Jaipur, Alwar and Bhiwadi. But it is still exceeding the standard. The highest exceedance is in Bhiwadi followed by Jaipur and Alwar. While in Bhiwadi the levels are exceeding the standards by three times, in Jaipur 1.6 times and Alwar 1.2 times.

Similarly, the annual level of PM2.5, the tinier particulates, is showing a declining trend in all the three cities but it is exceeding the standard in Bhiwadi by 2.35 times, and in other two it is exceeding the standard.

The nitrogen dioxide levels on the other hand are stable in all the cities and are within the standard in Jaipur and Alwar but exceeds in Bhiwadi.

Lockdown and clear blue sky: This has been an extraordinary year due to the COVID19 pandemic. The shutting down of the economy during the lockdown phases had led to dramatic clean up in pollution across all regions. RSPCB has carried out an extensive analysis of the pollution levels during the extraordinary phase of pandemic linked lockdown. This shows significant increase in number of days in the satisfactory and moderate categories - increased by up to 40 to 60 per cent. Highest reduction in the average AQI levels was in Bhiwadi. Except in Alwar, all other stations witnessed a rise in the AQI level during the modified lockdown period—20 April to 03 May 2020— when restrictions were lowered. This assessment has shown how clean the air can get once local pollution in controlled and regional influence is minimised. While this temporary relief came from the shutting down of the economy, this has kindled interest in deeper systemic reforms for lasting change.

Rising trend during winter: Predictably, the pollution levels increase every winter due to inversion, colder temperature and slow wind, even though the seasonal difference is not as big as in the larger Indo-Gangetic plain. Despite the dramatic decline in pollution due to the lockdown this summer the levels have increased substantially this winter when the Indo Gangetic Plain was trapped in choking haze of pollution. The 2020 winter pollution in Japipur has seen more number of days in “Poor” AQI category for PM2.5 – in fact the number of days has more than doubled, compared to 2019. In the recent years, the episodes of bad air quality are of longer duration and comparatively more severe. Winter pollution has increased across nearly all cities and towns of Rajasthan.

Air quality gets more toxic with the onset of winter with ratio of tinier PM2.5 increasing: The share of tinier and finer particles in the overall coarser PM10 concentration determines the toxicity of air. When the overall share of tinier PM2.5 in the overall coarser PM10 is higher, the air is more toxic as the tiny particles penetrate deep inside the lungs and cut through the blood barrier increasing health risk. Interestingly, during lockdown, when the overall suspended coarser particles had settled down reducing the PM10 levels, the PM2.5 had also come down. But its share increased with the onset of winter. Monthly average PM 2.5 percentage in Jaipur rose beyond 50 per cent in November and hit a daily high of 70 per cent this year. The ratio is higher in 2020 winter months than in 2019.

Ozone – an emerging challenge: While the current policy focus is on particulate pollution, the available data shows that ozone is beginning to rise. In several cities of Rajasthan the number of days in a year not meeting the 8 hour ozone standard has begun to increase. Only in Udaipur all days have met the standards since 2018. In Jaipur the number of days not meeting the standards is the highest. However, the interesting trend is that high NO2 areas in the region are low ozone areas and high ozone areas are low NO2 areas. This is consistent with the known science that ozone dissipates in high NO2 areas through secondary reaction. Ozone is not directly emitted by any source but gets created under the influence of sun and temperature when volatile organic compounds react and NOx is a catalyst. But to control ozone primary gases from combustion sources will have to be controlled. This is a highly reactive gas and has high health risk. This demands strong action on combustion sources to control gaseous emissions. This is also needed to control secondary particulates in the air, which according to the IIT Kanpur study can be 21 per cent of the PM2.5 concentration during winter.

Growing health risk

High health cost: According to the newly released Lancet report 2020, economic loss attributable to air pollution as a percentage of state GDP for Rajasthan is 1·70 per cent. Economic loss due to lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to household air pollution as a percentage of state GDP in Rajasthan is 0·79 per cent. Total and per-capita economic loss due to premature deaths attributable to air pollution in Rajasthan is USD 2294 millions. Economic loss due to premature deaths and morbidity as a percentage of state GDP in 2019 for Rajasthan was highest for ambient particulate pollution followed by household air pollution and then ambient ozone pollution.

Air pollution ranks as the second-largest risk factor for premature deaths in Rajasthan as per the 2016, state-level disease burden estimates (IHME, ICMR and PHFI) Death rate per 100,000 population attributable to air pollution in Rajasthan at 112.5, was the highest in India. It was estimated that if air pollution concentration could be lowered, the life expectancy in Rajasthan could increase by 2.5 years. Children are particularly vulnerable to air pollution.

Baseline action in different sectors

The time-bound, integrated and multi-sectoral action requires adoption of several new generation compliance methods and systems to control real world emissions, and comprehensive design details of mitigation strategies. This also requires capability to assess air quality and pollution sources. RSPCB has taken several steps in this direction. There is a growing learning curve.

Expanding air quality monitoring network enables better understanding of air quality:

Air quality monitoring network has expanded in cities of Rajasthan since 2016. While total manual monitoring stations have increased from 30 stations in 2016 to 39 in 2019, the real time monitors have jumped from none in 2016 to 10 in 2020. Expansion of real time monitors has helped to track daily change more efficiently and enabled public dissemination of air quality information based on national air quality index (NAQI). 41per cent of total monitors (manual + realtime) are in Jaipur Division. While the scope of real time monitoring need to be further expanded, RSPCB is also exploring adoption of alternative monitoring methods including satellite data and sensor based monitoring to generate data for the regions without adequate regulatory monitors. Currently, RSPCB is adding 30-40 more stations in the state. Real time data will also enable forecasting of pollution and advance action.

Understanding pollution sources

RSPCB has taken the lead to collaborate with the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, to carry out emissions source inventory and source apportionment studies to assess the relative contribution of pollution sources to pollution load and pollution concentration respectively. The inventory study shows that road dust dominates the pollution inventory with 47 per cent of the particulate load followed by vehicles at 20 per cent, and industry at 19 per cent. But it may be noted that road dust contains maximum traces of highly toxic and cancer causing substances and accumulates toxins from combustion sources. It is also evident that vehicles are the highest contributor to nitrogen oxides at 85 per cent.

The source apportionment study that assesses the relative contribution of sources to pollution concentration in the air shows that during winter there is huge impact of combustion sources on PM2.5 concentration. Biomass burning dominates at 31 per cent, followed by secondary aerosols at 21 per cent and vehicles at 16 per cent. This indicates that the regional plans now need special strategies to reduce primary gas emissions like Sox and Nox and others to control secondary particulates. This evidence on pollutioj source profile helps to further prioritisie action.

iii. Controlling action in power plants

The collaborative study of CSE and RSPCB has assessed the current compliance status of coal-based thermal power plant in Rajasthan with the 2015 standards for PM, SO2, NOx, Hg, and Water. It also highlights fly ash utilization status and issues related to continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS).

This shows that more than two third of the capacity is owned by state sector. Fleet is young with two third of the capacity is less than 10-year-old. Only one-third of Rajasthan’s coal-based capacity is compliant with the PM standards, which is much below the national compliance rate of 56 per cent. Majority of capacity is non-compliant with SO2 standard, and, further, progress is poor in taking SO2 control measures as no plant awarded work till November, 2020. Plant will not meet deadlines if measures further delayed. NOx compliance is better considering recently relaxed norms of 450 mg/Nm3. Compliance with Water and Mercury is average, however, CSE observed better transparency in disclosing water and mercury data in Rajasthan TPPs. Fly ash utilization is good, in fact, Rajasthan should be used as a case study to improve fly ash utilization in other states.

It is therefore recommended that that the plant wise detailed action plan is crucial for meeting PM, SO2 and NOx standards to ensure compliance before 2022 deadlines. Separate deadlines should be given to meet water norms. CEMS data connectivity need to be addressed and CEMS data should be made publicly available for bringing transparency. Water audits and CEMS audits are also recommended. A clear phase out plan for older units and a few of them can also trialed for biomass co-firing.

Controlling emissions from industry

CSE has carried out assessment of industrial air pollution in the key industry clusters in Jaipur along with Alwar and Bhiwadi (as these were one of the most industrialized regions in this airshed). This has assessed the local industry profile, and nature of their pollution to chart a roadmap for more locally appropriate action. Some of the key industrial pollution hotspots identified includes Vishwa Karma Industrial Area (VKIA) in Jaipur, Matsya Industrial Area in Alwar, and Bhiwadi Industrial Area (Phase I to IV) in Bhiwadi.

Total air polluting industries in Jaipur district are 1261 and the major industries are metal based, stone works, mineral grinding, brick kilns etc. There are overall 48 designated industrial areas and 8 of them are major ones. VKIA is the largest coal and liquid fuel consumer and uses almost 30 percent of the coal used by industries in the district. On the other hand Kotputli is the largest agro residue consumer. VKIA is one of the biggest contributors to the industrial pollution loading in the area and is responsible for 33 per cent of the total industrial loading. Metal and food processing sectors are the largest contributors.

Alwar has quite a number of furnaces and boilers. Most boilers are below the capacity of 2 TPH. MIA, largest coal consumer, – using up 63 .5 percent of the coal used in the district. MIA and Neemrana together contribute more than 60 per cent to the industrial pollution load of the district. But this area also shows highest use of agro residue as a fuel and Neemrana is largest agro residue consumer. On the other hand, Bhiwadi Industrial Area contributes around 65 per cent to the industrial pollution load of the region. Bhiwadi with a total of 328 air polluting industries with predominance of metal based & chemical/pharmaceutical, has overall 3 major designated industrial areas – Bhiwadi, Chopanki & Khuskhera. Majority boilers are below the capacity of 3 TPH. Bhiwadi Industrial Area is the largest coal, agro and wood consumer. Chopanki Industrial Area is the largest liquid fuel consumer.

There is a need for pollution hotspot-wise action plan to promote and mandate cleaner fuels. But this will require a clean fuel pricing policy. At the same time, it is important to assess the feasibility of introducing common boilers in place of numerous small boiler clusters that are difficult to monitor. Induction furnaces can be made mandatory, especially in Jaipur and Bhiwadi.

Combating fugitive emissions has become necessary. Strict adherence to RSPCB mineral grinding and Stone Crusher guidelines especially in Rajgarh and MIA in Alwar is important. Waste Management agencies need to be involved for non-hazardous industrial waste management along with secured dumpsites. Cement concrete roads in industrial areas need to be facilitated to prevent dust generation from heavy vehicle movement. It is important to insist on public display of the consent details to identify legal and illegal industries.

Controlling on-road emissions from vehicles

Jaipur region has about 30 per cent of the total registered vehicles in the state of Rajasthan. Per-capita vehicle ownership in Jaipur district is also very high i.e. 446 per thousand people compared to the regional average of 243 per thousand. Two-wheelers more than 70 per cent of the total registered vehicles. The second highest share of goods vehicles in Alwar, Sikar, Dausa and Jhunjhunu districts indicates the presence of industrial and freight activity in these areas.

This assessment has highlighted the pathways to advancement in strategies that are needed for improving on-road emissions monitoring and compliance system as the region has made the transition from Bharat Stage IV emissions standards to BSVI standards this year.

Currently, the state government is reforming the PUC scheme. It has been linked with the network server since 2017. Under the scheme, a total of 68.12 lakh vehicles till March 2019 have been checked. Challans are being issued for non-compliance. However, the current failure rates are very low – 406 per cent for petrol vehicles and less than 1 per cent for diesel vehicles. The programme will require stronger quality control and quality assurance.

Phasing out old vehicles: As per the NGT order dated 01 January 2014 regarding phase out of 10-yearold diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles in Delhi-NCR region, directions have been issued to all the RTOs. Policy states that vehicles older than 15 years are to be deregistered and permitted only after inspection. It is evident that 21.2 lakh vehicles have been deregistered, which is 12 per cent of the total registered vehicles. However, this will require a targeted state level vehicle scrappage policy and scrappage infrastructure for safe disposal and material recovery to make this programme effective.

Clean fuel initiative: As per the order of the transport department dated 10 July 2019, LPG and CNG vehicles get 50 per cent discount during registration. For improvement in air quality the registration of diesel autos/tempos has been restricted whereas LPG and CNG vehicle registration is being promoted. Rajasthan State Gas Limited (RSGL) supplying CNG to vehicles at two stations on Delhi–Jaipur National Highway (NH-8) at Neemrana and Kukas. Two more stations are being set up on NH-8 between Neemrana and Kukas. However, the CNG fuelling network has remained limited.

Electric vehicle programme: State government of Rajasthan is framing a draft electric vehicle policy to fast track the implementation of electric mobility. The state government is proposing 100 per cent exemption to electric vehicles from taxes. Rajasthan State Industrial Policy, 2019 proposes electric vehicle research and manufacturing zone, financial assistance to encourage electric vehicles and their component manufacturing units, and allotment of land for short-term and long-term leases to reduce land cost for entrepreneurs. This will require a robust and time-bound implementation roadmap. Given the fact that Rajasthan has a high level of tourism with large tourist centres, linking electric mobility with eco-tourism will be an important opportunity. But this will require careful planning of the electric vehicle ecosystem including charging infrastructure, electrification of targeted route clusters, fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, and disposal systems, etc. There is a great potential for promoting electric vehicles in Jaipur. The travel pattern in the city is most conducive. Short trip length dominate as more than half of the trips are below 5 km distance. Low powered two-wheelers are 73 per cent of the fleet and average vehicle speed is around 15-18 km/hour. This range can be comfortably achieved in a single charge by almost all existing EV models in the market today.

Mobility and transportaton strategy

Public transport strategy: It may be noted that Jaipur City Mobility Plan has set the goal of 50 per cent public transport modal share, 35 per cent of non motorized transport share and 100 per cent coverage of footpaths on all roads by 2030.

However, the decadal comparison of modal share in Jaipur city shows that share of public transport and Intermediate Para Transit has gone down by 18 per cent whereas private motor vehicle share has increased by 18 per cent. To achieve an optimal modal share, the city needs to increase the public transport and IPT share by almost three times.

Jaipur has already taken various initiatives such as introduction of city bus service, Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), metro system, and Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) to improve the overall mobility scenario. To fast forward transition to electric mobility, the state electric vehicle policy is in the pipeline. The Jaipur city is going to procure 100 more electric buses.

However, a lot more needs to be done. For example, the city has 24 buses per lakh population whereas it needs to achieve a target of 60 buses per lakh population. The aging of buses is further aggravating the situation as in 2018 around 215 buses had to be phased out. Also, the buses get overcrowded during peak hours, face competition with private minibuses and IPT due to poor rationalized routes, and poor operational performance. The IPT system caters to 7 per cent of the travel demand but is completely unorganized. Despite walking being a major mode of movement, only 19 per cent of the city roads have footpaths which are majorly encroached.

For improving public transport usage, bus fleet needs to be increased, routes have to be rationalized, equipped with Intelligent Transport System (ITS), and carry out multi-modal integration. Public transport will only work efficiently if the last mile connectivity will be provided. For this, the IPT service will have to organized along with providing infrastructure required. The phase out of older vehicles has to be linked with incentives to purchase clean vehicles such as Bharat Stage VI and electric IPT. The roads need to be redesigned based on the principle of complete street design.

Improve walking and cycling: The modal share Jaipur division shows that more than 50 per cent of the trips are being made by walk and bicycle and end within 5 km. As these trips are within potential walkable/bicyclable distance, therefore improvements of Non-Motorized-Transport (NMT) infrastructure can help in retaining the existing captive NMT users along with attracting the other potential users.

vii) Need vehicle restraint measures

Insatiable demand for parking has created enormous demand for land that is unsustainable. Unorgansied parking is also aggravating congestion. As much as 62 per cent of the road network in Japipur is vulnerable to legal and illegal parking. The demand for total land for parking in the city is estiamted to be 4 times higher than the walled city area.

As part of the comprehensive action plan of the Delhi NCR that also applies to Rajasthan part of the NCR, has included parking policy as a demand management and vehicle restraint measure. There needs to be a shift from increasing the parking supply to optimizing the available service and using parking as a vehicle restraint measure. Therefore, a comprehensive parking policy and parking area management plan is required to reduce demand for parking and free up land and roads from parking encroachment by following well defined demand management principles.

Currently, the region lacks a comprehensive parking management strategy. Almost all the parking supply is provided free of cost despite a high revenue generation opportunity from the land.

But there is a big opportunity. Rajasthan is the only state where proof of parking is required before getting the vehicle registered- as per the Rajasthan High Court order 2012 but the compliance with the order is poor. It is impotant to implement parking magament area plan across all land uses to identify and earmark on ground the legal larking area, stop illegal parking, introduce variable parking pricing in all legal parking areas, ban parking in green areas and footaths etc. While providing for organised and well regulate dparking ot also has to restrain unlimited supply of free parking.

Overall, Jaipur has the unique opportunity to build upon its advantage of having a diverse set of public transport systems. It is important to identify the pathways for efficient and more upgraded integration. As Jaipur embarks on expanding and modernizing its public transport systems, additional strategies will be needed to keep services affordable and the systems financially viable. Connecting new urban development with a well integrated public transport system will be crucial to ensure the sprawling metropolitan areas do not fall into the trap of motorization and lose their inherent advantages.

This dialogue will be taken forward to enable knowledge sharing to build capacity, design advanced strategies and strengthen implementation for cleaner air.

viii) Ensure circular economy for proper waste management and material recovery to prevent waste burning

Rajasthan has already taken steps to implement the waste management rules and is also setting up infrastructure to address different streams of waste to prevent waste burning. This will have to be taken forward fo rmore robust managemet staretgies to implement decentralised waste management system including segregation and recycling. Adopt effective landfill management and create roadmap for zero landfill policy.

Similalry promote decentralized C&D waste segregation and collection and make it obligatory for developers to- carry out on-site recycling and/or disposal at designated sites. Set-up facilities for recycling of C&D waste to promote recycling of construction and demolition waste. At the same time control fugitive emissions from material handling, conveying and screening. Implement provision of Central regulations for construction and demolition waste management rules 2016. Ensure dust pollution control in all construction sites.

ix) Traget 100% LPG access in households to eliminate solid fuels for coooking

The 2020 Lancel study has shown how premature deaths from household air pollution is responsible for health cost that is equivalent to close to 1 per cent of the state’s GDP in Rajasthan. This will have to be addressed urgently by maximising clean energy access and enableing 100 per cent coverage of household with reliable LPG conenction. At the same time eliminate use of solid fuels from open eateries and resturaunts and link this with their commercial license.

This collaborative initiative of RSPCB-CSE will be taken forward for more deep dive support to multi-sector action for clean air in all regions of Rajasthan. This will provide the model template for regional airshed level interventions that can provide a learning curve to other states of India.

MCG’s Ward 28 includes sectors 38, 39, and Jharsa.

As per MCG officials, the drive will commence at 8.30am from Sector 38 on Saturday and will continue till 5pm. MCG officials privy to the matter said that areas falling under sectors 38 and 39 have a high quantity of C&D waste, due to which Ward 28 was selected for the initiative.

Workers will clear mixed waste, C&D waste, and also implement measures to curb pollution, such as cleaning high dust accumulation stretches and subsequently, sprinkling water on them. Further, trees and grass in the ward would also be pruned by horticulture wing officials while all illegal hoardings and posters will be removed and seized by civic body officials.

MCG joint commissioner Pradeep Ahlawat said that the garbage and debris will be transported to designated spots. Further, all roads and stretches would be made dust-free. “Due to the heavy collection and clearance of waste, sizeable numbers of earthmovers and tractor-trolleys have been provided to the workers along with tree pruning machines. Unlike the usual practice of allocating resources for a citywide coverage, the rationale behind this drive is to thoroughly clean a specific ward in a single day’s operation before proceeding to a different area,” said Ahlawat.

Officials said that depending on the drive’s success, it would be replicated in MCG’s 34 other wards.

With more than 800 staff members from MCG’s sanitation branch, C&D waste branch and horticulture branch taking part in the drive, the civic body has directed all workers to maintain strict coronavirus protocols, such as the continuous wearing of masks and social distancing.

It is the largest gathering the MCG has arranged since the national lockdown in March.

MCG had initiated a similar initiative from February 25 to March 4 last year when the civic body ran a 168-hour continuous drive to clean 28 stretches, covering more than 120 kilometres of road length in the city. More than 2,500 MCG workers participated in the week-long drive on a rotational basis. In the drive, workers lifted garbage, sprinkled water on roads after removing dust, cleared posters, hoardings, encroachments, repaired footpaths, maintained green belts, and desilt drains.","More than 800 workers of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will carry out a sanitation drive in Ward 28 on Saturday, as per a release issued by the civic body on Friday.

S. NATIONAL WATER MISSION:

National Water Mission has launched a campaign – “Catch the Rain” with a tagline “Catch the Rain – when it falls, where it falls” to nudge all stake-holders to create Rain Water Harvesting Structures (RWHS) suitable to the climatic conditions and sub-soil strata to catch the rains with the people’s active participation. Under this campaign drives to make water harvesting pits, rooftop RWHS, check dams, etc; removal of encroachments and de-silting of tanks to increase their storage capacity; removal of obstructions in the channels which bring water to them from the catchment areas, etc; repairs to step-wells and using defunct bore-wells to put the water back to aquifers, etc are some of the activities suggested to be taken up.

To facilitate this, NWM has been propagating that Rain Centres should be setup in every district or GP headquarters, to give technical guidance to people on Rain Water Harvesting Structures. NWM has requested to States and District Magistrates (DM) to establish Rain centres in every district headquarters. These RCs can be developed in future as “Jal Shakti Kendras” acting as knowledge centres on water-linked topics like RWHS, restoration, desilting of water bodies, ground water recharging, water saving practices in agriculture, industry, drinking water etc. State Governments have started setting up rain centres in the districts. A number of districts in the country which include Dantewada, Chhattisgarh; Changlang, Arunachal Pradesh; Balia, Uttar Pradesh and South Andaman, A&N Islands have responded to our request and already started ‘Rain Centres’ in their districts.

NWM had requested the State Governments, Central Ministries/ Departments, AAI, Railway Board, Army, Airforce, Navy, Universities, IITs, IIMs, Central Armed Police Forces, Ordnance Factory Board, Sports Authority of India, Military Engineering Services, CPSEs, NYKS etc. to create rain water harvesting & artificial recharge structures and to support NWM in its catch the rain campaign.

Airport Authority of India (AAI) has affirmed that they have already implemented various measures to store/recharge the rainwater’ to the aquifers at most of the Airports, thus contributing to “Catch the Rain” campaign of “National Water Mission”. In addition, RWH system is also being implemented at all the major airport projects of AAI. Many organizations have also responded to our request for supporting catch the rain campaign and informed us about the details of activities undertaken under the campaign.The campaign is also endorsed by dignitaries like the Vice President of India; Vice Chairman, NITI Ayog; CEO, NITI Ayog; Senior Government Officials; water experts – Shri Sonam Wangchuck; Dr Anil Joshi etc and influencers like Shri Ravishankar ji, Shri Gopi Chand etc.

The campaign was initiated in February this year i.e well before the onset of ensuing monsoon and it has evoked a very good response. Corporate bodies like FICCI has also organized a series of 4 Webinars on “Catch the Rain” to promote the campaign within the industrial sector. A weekly dialogue series on “Catch the Rain” has also been started where Collectors/District Magistrates/Commissioners and water activist have been invited to share their commendable work in their districts to address the water issues. NWM has involved Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangthan (NYKS) for undertaking the ‘Catch the Rain’ awareness campaign to cover 623 districts in 31,150 villages.

SahiFasal Campaign

In India, 85-89% of water usage is for agricultural purposes and about 5%usage is for drinking and domestic purposes. Hence, even a small percentage saving of water in agricultural usage will have a significant impact in water availability for drinking and domestic purposes. ‘SahiFasal’ campaign was launched by National Water Mission on14.11.2019 to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive, but use water very efficiently; and are economically remunerative; are healthy and nutritious; suited to the agro-climatic-hydro characteristics of the area; and are environmentally friendly. Creating awareness among farmers on appropriate crops, micro-irrigation, soil moisture conservation etc; weaning them away from water intensive crops like paddy, sugarcane etc. to crops like corn, maize etc which require less water; assisting policy makers to frame policies that make effective pricing of inputs (water and electricity); improve procurement and market for these alternate crops; create appropriate storage them etc ultimately leading to increase in the income of farmers are the key elements of “SahiFasal”. Under SahiFasal, series of workshops are being organized in the water stressed areas of the country. Currently four workshops have been organized in Amritsar (Punjab) on14.11.2019, New Delhi on 26-27.11.2019, Aurangabad (Maharashtra) on 13.01.2020 and Kurukshetra (Haryana) on 14.02.2020.Punjab/Haryana has taken steps for crop diversification.","Polavaram Irrigation Project: Polavaram Irrigation Project was declared as National Project under Section 90 of AP Reorganization Act, 2014, which came into force on 1st March 2014.
has been released for execution of Polavaram Irrigation Project so far, out of which Rs.1850 Cr has been released since January’2020.
Atal Bhujal Yojana is expected to improve ground water conditions in the target areas and to contribute significantly to ensure ground water sustainability for interventions planned under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM).

TSUMEB residents are up in arms after the municipality failed to keep the town clean since September.

The matter was made worse when the Mayor of Tsumeb, Mathews Hangula responded that the municipality will return to its full duty when he returns from leave early in the next year.

“I will be back in town on the 10th of January 2021. Let us engage collectively and see what best solution we can come up with in order to reclaim and restore the paradise town to its origin,” Hangula commented on the town’s social media page when he was asked about the situation by some of the residents.

Three months ago, the residents of the informal area of Tsumeb known as Soweto, demanded the removal of the dumpsite at the area as it was allegedly causing a health hazard.

In a petition, the residents from an informal settlement claim that both children and adults are using the dumpsite as a toilet and human waste is all over the site.

“Buckets which are used as a toilet are emptied at the site which releases unpleasant smell in the surroundings,” read the petition.

Further, the petition indicated that plastics and papers are blown in every direction and end up in yards of people leaving the surrounding dirty.

Informanté has been trying to reach out to the officials at the Tsumeb municipality since September but to date has not gotten any feedback.

However, a few days ago, several residents took to social media expressing their disappointment regarding the matter and having a clean town.

Some of the comments were: “Look at how Tsumeb’s black suburbs looks like.”

“Tsumeb is a disgrace, this exactly how it looks next to Kuvukiland PS, so dirty, rubbish is all over the place, honestly it’s a disgrace. Tsumeb municipality does something about this kind of a mess, it’s such a dirty place, how awful.”

“Municipality never empty most of those bins so even if the people throw the rubbish in the bin but the bin is full eventually the rubbish will fall on the ground… municipality should come up with a schedule to empty those bins on a regular basis… some are smelling very bad especially in the location.”","Maria DavidTSUMEB residents are up in arms after the municipality failed to keep the town clean since September.
