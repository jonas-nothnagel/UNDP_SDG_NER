1,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-releases-guidance-on-mechanisms-for-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Releases Guidance on Mechanisms for SDG Implementation,"18 December 2017: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) released a guidance note on integration and coordination mechanisms for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The note provides information on how countries have adapted or established institutional and coordination frameworks to implement the Goals, and highlights efforts to promote horizontal and vertical coherence.

The document titled, ‘Institutional and Coordination Mechanisms: Guidance Note on Facilitating Integration and Coherence for SDG Implementation,’ finds that many countries are adapting and expanding institutional frameworks established during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, such as national councils for sustainable development (NCSDs), for SDG implementation. The note recommends that such institutions should be positioned within the office of the president or prime minister to ensure effective coordination, and should include some form of decentralization, whether by ensuring representation of local focal points in the NCSD or through establishing sub-national bodies. An annex to the note shares country experiences from Germany, Indonesia, and Nigeria.

On new mechanisms and structures, the guidance argues that the scope and ambition of the SDGs requires systems that facilitate cross-sectoral action and shared accountability that traverses ministries, agencies, levels of government and stakeholders. The note shares how countries have created inter-ministerial commissions to oversee SDG implementation, established high-level inter-ministerial committees to bring together sectoral working groups, and established inter-sectoral thematic working groups, or requested ministries to identify their SDG-related responsibilities. Country experiences from Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone illustrate how countries have created new institutional frameworks to implement the SDGs.

The note identifies the functions of an inter-ministerial commission for sustainable development. They include: operating as an advisory body on the SDGs; developing or coordinating implementation strategies on the SDGs; engaging with key stakeholders; developing a national monitoring framework and national indicators; reviewing the SDGs and targets; recommending financing measures for SDG implementation; and preparing for regional and global dialogues on SDG implementation.

The guidance also discusses allocation of responsibility among various levels of government, emphasizing that sub-national and local governments are often responsible for implementation. The note recommends governments promote vertical coherence and integration across government levels by creating explicit institutional links between sustainable development strategies and federal and sub-national processes. The note further recommends, inter alia: maintaining two-way communication; including partners from outside government with local expertise; and matching devolved responsibilities with funds and revenue-raising powers.

Additional sections of the guidance note address, inter alia: promoting an integrated cross-sectoral approach, drawing from national institutions to implement climate interventions; addressing challenges related to SDG monitoring and reporting; and engaging stakeholders. The note underscores the role of parliaments in SDG implementation through their legislative, oversight, and budgetary functions. The document elaborates on opportunities for parliaments to ensure no one is left behind, promote gender equality, support the rights of persons with disabilities, and engage youth populations.

The publication concludes with recommendations on questions countries should consider when adapting or establishing institutional frameworks for SDG implementation. These questions focus on: designation of a key institution to oversee SDG implementation; high-level support for the institution; the institution’s mandate to oversee and coordinate SDG implementation; a sustainable development road map or strategy with clear roles and targets; mechanisms to foster horizontal and vertical coordination; stakeholder engagement; access to decision-making and inclusion of marginalized groups; and mechanisms for arbitration of conflicting views. Finally, the note proposes key structural factors that countries should consider when setting up an institutional mechanism for SDG implementation.

UNDP intends for the note to be a living document that will be updated based on feedback and lessons learned from ongoing SDG implementation.

The overarching goal of the call for proposals under the fourth project cycle of the Benefit-sharing Fund is the conservation and use of adapted plant varieties that would lead to increased productivity, on-farm incomes, and nutrient-rich food, as well as enhanced resilience to production shocks and reduced adverse impacts to the environment. Eligible applicants include governmental and non-governmental organizations, including farmers and farmers’ organizations, genebanks and research institutions, as well as regional and international organizations based in developing countries that are Contracting Parties to the International Treaty. At least US$5 million will be invested in projects over the next four years.

The projects are expected to also contribute towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Projects selected for Benefit-sharing Fund support under this call for proposals will focus on responding to the needs of the poorest, most vulnerable segments of society, and those furthest behind in terms of development,” said Kent Nnadozie, Secretary of the International Treaty, who also noted that, “By responding to the needs of these segments of society, the projects are expected to also contribute towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”

The deadline for submitting pre-proposals is 1 March 2018. A helpdesk will be offering practical and technical information to support applicants throughout the call for proposals. Applications will be assessed by an independent panel of experts against pre-established criteria, including experience and capacity of applicant organizations to contribute towards the programme goals, outcomes, and targets.

To date, the International Treaty’s Benefit-sharing Fund has invested more than US$20 million in 61 projects across 55 developing countries over three project cycles. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) estimates that it has positively impacted the lives of approximately 1 million people. Projects have supported the development, testing and use of climate ready crops, resulting in over 3,000 food crop varieties now available to the international scientific and breeding community under the International Treaty’s Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing.

3,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-issues-vnr-handbook-revised-voluntary-guidelines/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"DESA Issues VNR Handbook, Revised Voluntary Guidelines","January 2018: The UN Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has issued a draft unedited version of a handbook on preparing Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). The handbook provides “basic, practical information” on the steps that countries may take when preparing a VNR, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the UN Secretary-General’s proposal of voluntary common reporting guidelines for VNRs, which were updated in December 2017, and are included in the handbook.

VNRs are part of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and are presented annually by UN Member States during the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). They are intended to track progress in implementing the SDGs and their targets in all countries in an open, inclusive, participatory and transparent manner.

The ‘Handbook for Preparation of Voluntary National Reviews’ includes sections on: how to initiate a review; organization and preparation of the review; multi-stakeholder participation; key building blocks for preparing the review; preparatory workshops and submission of VNRs; presentation of the VNR at the HLPF; and “after the presentation.” It also features country examples, and a VNR preparation checklist outlining actions related to: initial preparation and organization; stakeholder engagement; VNR preparation; and HLPF presentation.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals.

The handbook states that the process of carrying out the VNRs should not be seen as separate from the implementation of the SDGs, but should allow a country to plan more appropriate policies, structures and processes, in order to effectively achieve the goals. On organization and preparation of the review, the handbook notes that for most VNR countries, preparation time is very short, and therefore it is advisable to begin the process as early as possible. The handbook recommends drawing up a work plan or roadmap that covers the main deliverables and deadlines for the national preparatory process. Components of the roadmap could include: the coordination structure for the review; costs of the review and possible sources of funding; scope of the VNR; a list of bodies and agencies that will be providing data and information; key stakeholders to engage and methods of engagement; ways to access to high quality, up-to-date, and disaggregated data; and allocating time for technical editing as well as a high-level review of the VNR and its main messages.

On timeline, the handbook notes that VNR countries should submit their main messages (conclusive summary of the VNR) by 18 May 2018. The final reviews should be submitted to DESA by 18 June 2018.

The handbook states that the preparatory process for the VNRs includes global workshops based on countries’ previous experiences in participating in the VNR process. The workshops are organized by DESA, and are designed to facilitate peer learning and interaction. The handbook indicates that a first global workshop seeks to cover key components of the preparatory process, and involves current and former VNR countries. A second global workshop facilitates the sharing of experiences among VNR countries, including lessons learned and challenges encountered. A third global workshop covers final preparatory matters, and engages countries in a discussion of anticipated follow-up to their VNRs. In preparation for the 2018 VNRs, the first workshop took place in Geneva, Switzerland, in December 2017. The second workshop is planned for early March 2018, in Dakar, Senegal, and the third and final one is scheduled for 15 July 2018, in New York, US, according to the handbook.

The handbook “goes beyond” the UN Secretary-General’s proposed guidelines, the authors note. Those voluntary common reporting guidelines, which are included in an annex to the handbook, provide a framework for the VNR reports, while allowing for flexibility. They were first issued in January 2016, as part of the UN Secretary-General’s report on ‘Critical milestones towards coherent, efficient and inclusive follow-up and review at the global level’ (A/70/684), and were updated in December 2017 based on lessons learned from the VNR experiences in 2016 and 2017. The guidelines comprise sections on: follow-up and review guiding principles; structure and content of the VNR report; and making presentations at the HLPF.

The authors of the handbook also highlight other sources may further assist countries in their preparations, such as the synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs prepared by DESA, and the Guidelines to Support Country Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (2017) prepared by the UN Development Group (UNDG).

In 2018, 48 countries will present their VNRs during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF (16-18 July).

Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

5,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-initiatives-to-unleash-big-data-for-sustainable-development/,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches Initiatives to Unleash Big Data for Sustainable Development,"1 December 2017: The UN has launched several initiatives to strengthen countries’ use of big data for sustainable development, including a 12-point plan on privacy and governance issues. The UN System Staff College (UNSSC) with the Data-Pop Alliance launched a platform offering online courses on big data in November 2017, and will conduct face-to-face trainings in 2018. The UN Statistics Division with the GIS software company Esri have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to monitor progress on the SDGs.

The Data-Pop Alliance is a coalition of research and development actors created by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, MIT Media Lab, and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to promote the use of big data for sustainable development through research, capacity building, and community engagement. UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are seeking to promote data literacy within the UN and other development practitioners. Their learning platform, the ‘Big Data & Sustainable Development Open Learning Hub,’ offers a series of eight consecutive modules over 11 months. The online modules became available in November 2017 and will run until mid-September 2018. The first module covered issues of governance, transparency and politics related to the use of big data, and subsequent modules will address: climate change; citizen-generated and mobile phone data; gender equity; public health; emergency response; data collection, gaps and opportunities; and data storytelling and visualization. The program can be accessed by anyone who creates a profile on the learning hub.

UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are also offering in-person training on ‘Leveraging Big Data for Sustainable Development.’ The training is conducted over three to four days, and is offered in French and English at various locations around the world. A French-language programme will take place in Dakar, Senegal, from 6-8 March 2018, and an English-language programme in Bangkok, Thailand, from 27-29 March 2018. The training programme is meant to strengthen the skills of UN staff and development practitioners in selecting, creating, using and interpreting data in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Hewlett Foundation is supporting fellowships to cover the costs of the course to professionals from public sector institutions, civil society and academia.

On 30 November 2017, the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management endorsed the concept of a “federated system” of open SDG Data Hubs. The federated system facilitates the role of national statistical offices (NSOs) in managing statistical and geospatial data through an open data platform with software for GIS and data analytics, as well as through the use of web-based tools for communication and user engagement. It seeks to strengthen national and global statistical systems in managing and sharing data and good practices in implementing the SDGs, improving data interoperability, and enhancing relationships between national and global data. The concept has been implemented through initial research conducted by the UN Statistics Division (UNStats) and Esri, which have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to collect, analyze and share data for monitoring progress on the SDGs.

Also on big data, Emmanuel Letouzé and David Sangokoya of the Data-Pop Alliance have proposed a 12-point plan addressing privacy issues in big data. In a paper titled, ‘How to Use Big Data,’ developed in cooperation with the Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications, the authors recommend that collected data be encrypted and stored in distributed data repositories, where it can only be accessed for legitimate purposes. They call for directing big data projects and resources toward solving shared problems, and for communicating results of projects through data visualizations.

Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman. So we have maintained gender balance… in these processes.” [Press Conference Transcript] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Second Report of Secretary-General on UNDS Reforms] [UNGA President’s Comments at Closing Plenary of Main Part of 72nd UNGA] [All SDG Knowledge Hub Coverage of Migration Process] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on UNGA Adoption of Parts of Management Reform] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Second Report of UN Secretary-General on UN Development System Reforms]","20 December 2017: The UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) main priorities for the next several months relate to migration, sustaining peace, SDG implementation, and reform processes, according to a statement by President Miroslav Lajcak during a press conference at the end of 2017.
Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.
When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018.
He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council.
Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts."

To address this issue, the UN SDG Action Campaign is encouraging people to engage in SDG implementation and monitoring, while the IAP, a global network of science agencies, has published a guide to the SDGs for its members.

Market research conducted jointly by PepsiCo, Paragon Partnerships, and the UN SDG Action Campaign found that just 5.9% of 10,000 people interviewed in the Philippines were aware of the SDGs, with this percentage falling among lower-income respondents. The survey also found that poverty, hunger and ill health were the issues of most concern to respondents, corresponding to SDGs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The majority of respondents (68.2%) believed that the situation with regard to these concerns had not changed in the past year, while about a quarter (28%) felt the situation had improved.

Commenting on the results of the Philippines survey, Dilek Ozler of Paragon Partnerships expressed hope that more country governments will choose to measure progress and promote SDG implementation. Paragon Partnerships is a network of government, research agencies, NGOs, companies and client organizations that seeks to use data to generate insights for policy making and programme development towards SDG implementation.

The UN SDG Action Campaign is an initiative of the UN Secretary-General administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The campaign supports countries and the UN system to promote public engagement in SDG implementation. Among its activities are the MYWorld 2030 platform for data sharing and citizen engagement and the ‘World We Want’ partnership with civil society for hosting SDG-focused consultations.

Separately, the IAP, a global network of science, engineering and medicine academies, conducted a survey of its members, which likewise found limited awareness of the SDGs. The IAP has published a 20-page guide to “demystify” the structures and processes by which the SDGs are to be implemented, and to encourage scientists to apply their knowledge to the challenge of implementation. The guide titled, ‘Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guide for Merit-Based Academies,’ includes a database of peer-reviewed publications on the SDGs that academies have produced since 2014. The activities are part of a three-year IAP project that began in 2016, and seeks to promote the global science community’s contribution to SDG achievement.

The meeting will take place on 1 February 2018, in New York, US.

Following the adoption of UNGA resolution 68/1 titled, ‘Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolution 61/16 on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council,’ in 2013, ECOSOC underwent a series of reforms to strengthen the Council. By that resolution, UN Member States must review the arrangements during the 72nd UNGA session.

In their letter to UN Member States on 20 December 2017, co-facilitators Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, and Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, invite delegations to share their views on the timeline and outcome of the review process. They also pose four key questions for the informal meeting on 1 February, addressing: the approach to carry out the review in order to cover the substantive and structural aspects of resolution 68/1; ensuring that the review accounts for related processes without overburdening its focus; ways by which ECOSOC could generate effective “leadership, strategic direction and specific guidance” including through its annual main theme; and suggestions for augmenting the added value of the various interlinked functions of the ECOSOC cycle.

Resolution 68/1 outlines arrangements on ECOSOC’s functions and architecture. Among other provisions, it calls on the Council to: adopt a July-to-July cycle for its programme of work; have a strengthened issues-based approach to enhance its lead role in achieving a balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development; and base its annual programme of work on a main theme that takes into account the role of the Council in promoting sustainable development and enables the Council to promote UN system-wide coherence and coordination. The resolution also outlines arrangements for ECOSOC segments and meetings, including for its operational activities for development segment, its humanitarian affairs segment, its high-level segment, its integration segment, and its coordination and management meetings. The resolution calls on ECOSOC to: continue to strengthen and further promote implementation of the financing for development (FfD) agenda; promote the active participation of Major Groups, NGOs, other relevant stakeholders and regional organizations in the activities of the Council; further promote the integration of youth into its deliberations; and devote time to the specific needs of countries in special situations.

9,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-sanitation-economy-the-new-economy-set-to-tackle-sdg-6-2/,"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Sanitation Economy: The New Economy Set to Tackle SDG 6.2,"The news often reports the desperate lack of access to safe sanitation faced by a staggering 2.3 billion people globally. Around the world, one in three people still lacks access to a toilet, and hundreds of thousands of children die annually from diarrheal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. There is an abundance of heart wrenching stories to share.

To address this challenge, in 2015, the global community adopted a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). Target 6.2 under this Goal calls for, “by 2030, achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation.” This article discusses the untapped opportunity for the private sector to help achieve SDG target 6.2. Not only can business be a part of the solution that provides clean water and sanitation for all, but it can make a profit at the same time.

So, where do we begin? From the outset, overcoming this global issue is daunting. Where do we look for the solution, when the issue includes complex cultural nuances, societal taboos, and the general ‘yuck’ factor?

To start, the global business community and savvy entrepreneurs can take a closer look at the bottom of our toilets. Yes, it may sound unpalatable, but there is method in the madness.

The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

In its latest report, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) introduces the ‘Sanitation Economy‘ – a market that presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses. This new economy monetizes toilet provision, products and services, biological resources, health data and information, to provide benefits across business and society.

This research shows that the market could be worth US$62 billion in India alone, by conservative estimates; it could turn trillions of liters of human waste into valuable biological resources each year; and it could hold a vast reservoir of information about human health.

It is rare today to find white spaces in the economy open for business and innovation, and that address such an urgent global challenge as outlined in SDG 6.

The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies. They include: the Toilet Economy, which encompasses toilet product and service innovation that provides toilets fit for purpose for all environments and incomes; the Circular Sanitation Economy, which means toilet resources (commonly known as human waste) feed into a circular economic system that replaces traditional waste management; and finally, the Smart Sanitation Economy, which involves digitized sanitation systems that optimize data for operating efficiencies, maintenance, plus consumer use and health information insights.

The Toilet Economy

Providing basic access to a toilet and the sanitation systems that safely manage human waste is a serious issue. Access to “sanitation for all” made the least progress during the era of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that spanned from 2000 to 2015. As a result, the world is now watching, and acting, to ensure progress over the next 15 years under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.

The Government of India is leading the way with its ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Clean India Campaign’, which aims to provide universal access to all Indians in just five years (2014-2019), become open defecation-free, and build more than 100 million toilets. The campaign is making swift progress in providing access to toilets and awareness is high among citizens. China is now following in its footsteps.

It is not just national governments rising up. Citizen movements are also encouraging behavior change. In November 2016, the Global Citizen Festival was held in Mumbai, India, to put a spotlight on the need for sanitation for all. About 100,000 citizens gathered to listen to an impressive mix of celebrities, musical artists, and sanitation experts – including Coldplay, JAY-Z, and famous Bollywood stars about the importance of sanitation. In 2017, Bollywood launched ‘Toilet: A Love Story,’ a film about a woman who turns down a marriage proposal until her husband-to-be agrees to buy her a toilet. Such cultural activities help educate people about the importance of sanitation and drive behavior change alongside the creation of toilets.

The Circular Sanitation Economy

The past decade has seen business embrace sustainable development, where private sector practices address growing constraints on resources and new responsibilities for the customers and communities they serve. Leading corporations have found new market opportunities by looking at where their unique value propositions can also address unmet needs, and market failures that underpin the SDGs, where no one is left behind. The circular economy – the mining of waste and available resources to save costs and generate new revenue – is trendy among global businesses.

Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources. If what goes into our toilets has value, those interested in extracting that value will invest in ensuring that the resource is properly managed.

And there is no shortage of this resource. Approximately 7.6 billion people globally create excreta every day, to the tune of 3.8 trillion liters of resources – an amount that is growing with our population growth. These resources, when captured and mined, present very interesting biological resource use cases.

For instance, entrepreneurs and businesses are starting to monetize these resources and are creating valuable products such as nutrient-rich organic fertilizers, electricity, bio-fuel, water, and proteins. All of these products were previously, and in many cases, are still, flushed down the toilet. From manufacturing operations to municipalities, there is growing demand for these new, renewable resources and organic or biological products. They help fill food, fiber, agriculture, animal feed, consumer goods and healthcare needs.

The Smart Sanitation Economy

The future of industry is being shaped by what the World Economic Forum is calling the fourth industrial revolution – a digital economy. This is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Sanitation and toilets have a place here, too. There is a key opportunity now to apply new technologies and digitization to sanitation to create new business opportunities as future sanitation systems are developed. While the Smart Sanitation Economy is the least developed area of the Sanitation Economy to date, we believe that it could be a game changer for how we view our sanitation and toilets into the future. It can provide valuable data and insights on health, and for sanitation system operating efficiencies.

A Call to Action – Making ‘Your Business’ Business

The Sanitation Economy is the business response to a global crisis and resulting market and societal failures. With collaboration and investment on all fronts, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s toilet-related resources and data into valuable, life-saving resources and critical information.

This is our call to action to the global business community – because sanitation is every business’s business. It’s time to step up and be counted.","The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

The report ranks 16 of the world’s largest publicly listed auto companies on readiness for a low carbon transition.

The companies included in the report titled, ‘Driving Disruption: Which automotive companies will seize the opportunities in a low-carbon economy?’, have a total market capitalization of US$790 billion and represent over 75% of the global passenger vehicle market. According to CDP’s ranking, BMW, Daimler and Toyota are the best performing car companies on climate-related metrics.

The authors explain that the car industry is “facing a double hit of disruption from EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous and shared driving,” with over a fifth of profits likely to shift to technology companies like Uber and Google by 2030. Over 30% of new car sales are projected to be zero emissions and plug-in hybrid by 2030, representing a potential US$1 trillion market. By 2022, EVs could become as affordable as petrol and diesel cars, making it easier for car makers to profit from a low-carbon economy. Accelerating the deployment of such vehicles is critical for reducing carbon emissions meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

CDP CEO Paul Simpson said technology and software disrupters have forced the car industry to innovate quickly to ensure their survival in the low-carbon transition. Traditional car companies are increasingly investing (over US$11 billion since 2015) in autonomous and shared vehicle companies, and setting aggressive electric and autonomous vehicle targets. For example, General Motors is working towards an ‘All Electric-future.’ However, nearly 50% of car makers risk penalties by missing their emissions targets, and in the EU, some companies will need to increase their share of EV sales by 20% in order to meet the EU’s 2021 targets.

For traditional car engines, complying with emissions regulations will increase to over US$2,200 per vehicle by 2025.

The report details a number of risks and opportunities for the car industry. For example, governance and remuneration structures must be aligned with the low carbon transition, and the cost to comply with emissions regulations for traditional car engines is expected to increase threefold by 2025 to over US$2,200 per vehicle. In addition, China is critical, says CDP, as it accounts for 29% of global passenger vehicle sales, and has set aggressive targets for new energy vehicles such as EVs beginning in 2019.

CDP leverages investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage environmental impacts, and drive companies and governments to reduce their emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. CDP has reported on the oil and gas, steel, cement, automotive, electric utilities, chemicals and mining industries in recent years.

Released in cooperation with Bertelsmann Stiftung, this year’s edition of the study included additional metrics for the SDGs analysis along with several refinements to the methodology, leaving the results ""not strictly comparable"" with those of prior editions, according to the report.

The Kingdom obtained the best results in its performance on the SDG No. 1: No poverty, which the report considered as achieved based on statistics indicating that no citizen earns less than $1.9 per day.

“The SDG Index is a tool to engage stakeholders around overall progress made on SDGs. There is a strong correlation between poor and crisis affected countries and lower SDG Index rankings. Jordan ranking 5 in the Arab states means there are potential areas for improvement including availability of data for some of the SDGs and strengthening national data systems to monitor and report on progress,”

Sara Ferrer Olivella, country director, Jordan UNDP, told The Jordan Times.

Human rights researcher Sulaiman Sweiss told The Jordan Times that he ""doubts"" the reality of such advance, noting that ""even the official figures show an increase in poverty in the past years, not to mention the last raise on the price of general goods such as bread, which will continue to burden the less privileged.""

Hunger, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, industry innovation and infrastructure, life below water and life on land were the SDGs in which Jordan performed the worst, according to the study.

""Jordan went backwards on the official rankings released by the UN in the past years and I am not optimistic about the performance next year,"" Sweis said, noting that ""we can not advance in the SDGs within the huge gender gap that we are still experiencing, with women accounting only for the 13 per cent of the workforce in Jordan.""

""The SDG Index and Dashboards is aimed at assisting countries to identify priorities for action in order to achieve the 17 SDGs,"" the report said, pointing out that ""the indicators and dashboards should help countries to pinpoint key implementation challenges.""

In this regard, Gender Consultant at the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Reem Aslan told The Jordan Times that ""the participation of women in the economy is very low,"" noting ""the need to provide women with a better working environment and a better work-life balance.""

Low wages, sexual harassment at work and the lack of transportation from home to the workplace are some of the issues preventing women from engaging in the labour market, according to the expert.

""When you look at the statistics you don't find women over 50 in the workplace,"" Aslan highlighted, noting that ""the Social Security Law allows women to retire at an early age without warning them about the financial loss that comes with it, and many of them do not even have the chance to work because they start taking care of their parents once their children emancipate.""

""In addition, we don't believe that the government or the employers are aware of the importance and the benefits of having more women in the workforce,"" she continued, noting the presence of studies aimed at raising awareness on the matter.

""However, we are starting to witness a mental shift derived from the work of non-governmental organisations,"" Aslan added, expressing that ""we are lucky to have a few ministers committed with this issue, such as the minister of Social Development or the minister of Education.""

Regarding the regional picture, Algeria topped the Arab world ranking achieving the 64th position worldwide, followed by Tunisia (65th), Morocco (73th) and the UAE (77th).

Lebanon stood close to Jordan achieving the 86th position worldwide, closely followed by Egypt (87th). Bahrain (92nd) and Oman (94th).

When asked about the regional scenario, Sweis highlighted the similarities between the official UN ranking and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network's ranking, noting that ""many countries in the region have improved their situations despite the challenges they are facing, while Jordan remains in a very similar situation when compared to the previous years.""

""The SDGs are not only about the economy and the statistical figures, they are about human rights,"" the researcher added, calling on the government to ""reconsider the policies in this field if they want to see real advances"".","AMMAN — Jordan has ranked 80th worldwide and 5th in the Arab world in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Dashboards Report recently issued by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which analyses the SDGs performance of a total of 157 countries out of the 193 UN member states.

12,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-blended-finance-and-private-sector-contributions-to-the-sdgs/,"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Blended Finance and Private Sector Contributions to the SDGs,"How will we finance sustainable development? In last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, we saw the possibilities that blockchain technology holds for development finance. This week’s brief considers where and how private sector actors can contribute to SDG achievement, including through blended finance.

Blended finance is the use of public or philanthropic investment to attract commercial finance from the private sector, particularly to fund activities in developing countries. The private sector contains many types of entities: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), multinational corporations (MNCs), institutional investors, individuals, and everything in between. A working paper by Convergence and the Business & Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Task Force tackles a subset of the question posed in its title, ‘Who is the private sector?’ The paper focuses on six types of institutional investors: pension funds; insurance companies; sovereign wealth funds; commercial and investment banks; private equity firms; and asset/wealth managers. The authors then consider how to mobilize capital from such institutional investors, through blended finance. Recommendations address: 1) engagement, 2) designing appropriate products and scaling successful solutions, 3) building off development finance institutions (DFIs) capabilities and experience, and 4) disseminating return and impact data.

Also from the Blended Finance Task Force, in partnership with the Business & Sustainable Development Commission and SYSTEMIQ, comes ‘Better Finance, Better World.’ This consultation paper says that institutional investors can leverage the current low-interest rate environment to use blended finance in a manner that de-risks investment in emerging markets infrastructure. The paper also notes the central role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and DFIs, but calls on both to increase their mobilization ratios. The paper highlights that MDBs currently mobilize less than US$1 of private capital per dollar invested. A write-up of the two papers on ImpactAlpha by Convergence’s Justice Durland looks at “ways to get the private sector to start paying attention” to the SDGs. Coverage of the second paper is also available on Public Finance International.

Eurodad’s Polly Meeks authored a piece, also on Public Finance International, asking whether blended finance is “a silver bullet or a double-edged sword” and noting the opportunity costs of blended finance. The article responds to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) ‘Private Finance for Sustainable Development’ conference, hosted on 29 January 2018, in Paris, France. The event, covered by Devex’s Molly Anders, launched an OECD report titled, ‘Making Blended Finance Work for the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The report notes blended finance’s potential for delivering the US$2.5 trillion annual investment needed to achieve the SDGs. It highlights that donor governments and other development actors are increasingly using blended finance, but acknowledges that “a critical first step” is simply agreeing on a common definition.

Lastly on blended finance, the Brookings Institution’s Emily Gustafsson-Wright asks, ‘Is paying for results with blended finance ready to take off?’ The post, featured on Brookings’ Education Plus Development blog, quotes Davos attendees’ remarks on the potential for innovative financing models, and evaluates the extent to which blended finance has been used to achieve sustainable development outcomes. Gustafsson-Wright looks at a range of case studies, including payment by results, social and development impact bonds, and other efforts by bilateral and multilateral donors. She concludes that there is indeed something to be said for blended finance, whose elements can enable more effective investment in prevention, incentivize collaboration, build a culture of monitoring and evaluation, and empower countries to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.

The SDGs can serve as an investment tool for “putting value on values.”

Blended finance is not the only way for the private sector to support the SDGs. Thomson Reuters delves into other roles for private companies in article titled, ‘Can you use the SDGs as an investment tool?’ The post discusses opportunities to use environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics as a basis to develop investment strategies in manner that is consistent with, or centered around, the SDGs. The piece references a prior webinar and summary report on how the SDGs can serve as “a new tool for putting value on values.”

GreenBiz Group’s Anya Khalamayzer also looks at ESG opportunities aligned with the SDGs, through the lens of retirement and pension funds. The post highlights an aspirational goal by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to move US$10 billion in retirement assets under management of its member companies into ESG-themed retirement benefit accounts by 2020. Last week, together with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), WBCSD also launched draft guidance on applying Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ESG-related risks.

Private sector engagement with the SDGs featured broadly at GreenBiz 18, GreenBiz Group’s annual conference, which convened from 6-8 February 2018, in Phoenix, Arizona. Sessions on Materiality and Metrics discussed three types of contributions to the 2030 Agenda: “the potential of business to realize the SDGs;” navigating the reporting landscape; and SDG achievement through improved soil health. A WBCSD-moderated GreenBiz tutorial highlights what businesses can do with respect to the SDGs, covering employment opportunities, technological innovation, and, as discussed above, finance.

Also on measuring business contributions, the SDG Compass has been updated with new indicators, according to the Global Reporting Initiative. SDG Compass is a joint product of GRI, WBCSD and UN Global Compact that provides guidance to companies on aligning strategies and measuring contributions to the SDGs.

A UBS white paper titled, ‘Partnerships for the Goals,’ explores opportunities for wealth managers to collaborate with MDBs, financial services firms, UBS’s clientele, and social enterprises, in order to mobilize the estimated US$5-7 trillion of annual investment needed to meet the SDGs. The paper calls on wealth managers to take action in five areas: 1) working more closely with MDBs, 2) standardizing sustainable and impact investing conventions, 3) working together to “fashion new solutions that fill gaps in the SDG-funding instrument landscape,” 4) focusing on outcomes and impacts, in partnership with philanthropic clients, and 5) working with social entrepreneurs and introducing them to their stakeholders.

An upcoming SDG Knowledge Weekly brief will explore the role of public finance in making the SDGs a reality, as the international community gears up for meetings on tax collaboration, infrastructure, and follow-up to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FFD.

Leaders highlighted the role of political will, community engagement and targeted investment in changing practices and lives, stressing that FGM can and must be stopped.

The Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality (SDG 5) target 5.3 aims to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM by 2030. According to the UN, global prevalence of FGM has declined nearly one-quarter since 2000 but the rate of progress is insufficient to keep up with population growth, meaning that the number of total cases is expected to continue to increase without additional action. In addition, by 2030, one-third of births globally will be in the 30 FGM countries, a trend that will require accelerated progress to protect women and girls from this practice.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.”

In his message for the day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres described FGM as “a gross violation of the human rights of women and girls.” He called for accelerating progress on SDG target 5.3, saying that, without immediate action, “a further 68 million girls could be subjected to this practice by 2030.” Guterres stressed, “sustainable development cannot be achieved without full respect for the human rights of women and girls.”

In a joint statement for the Day, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director Henrietta Fore and UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Natalaia Kanem described FGM as a “violation of human rights that both reflects and perpetuates the low status of girls and women” and can cause infection, childbirth complications and death. The leaders highlighted building momentum to eliminate FGM, observing that over 25 million people in more than 18,000 communities across 15 countries have disavowed the practice of FGM since 2008. Fore and Kanem stressed that ending the practice helps girls to grow up healthier, better educated and employed, and more empowered to make decisions about their lives.

In countries where UNICEF and UNFPA work jointly to end FGM, the UN finds that girls are one-third less likely to undergo FGM than in 1997. The UNICEF and UNFPA Executive Directors highlighted conditions that help to end FGM, including when governments, communities and families address the issue; when women and girls are empowered to make their voices heard; when villages confront social norms; when access to education, health and legal services support sustainable change; when medical professionals refuse to perform FGM; or when laws make FGM a crime and authorities enforce the law.

According to the UN Regional Information Centre for Western Europe (UNRIC), many women and girls in European countries are also subjected to FGM, particularly migrants from countries where FGM is practiced. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 20,000 women and girls coming from countries that practice FGM apply for asylum in European member states annually, including for reasons related to FGM. UNRIC explains that FGM continues to exist among migrant groups after migration to Europe, with girls particularly at risk when they temporarily return to their country of origin during holidays.

The Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, said the FGM “is not acceptable in the 21st century” in her remarks at an international forum in the Gambia on strategies to combat FGM. Gambia banned FGM in November 2015. Wickramanayake called on countries to address gaps in their legal frameworks to end the practice of FGM.

The report assesses LDCs’ economic trends and progress towards selected SDG targets and indicators.

Only five LDCs reached the SDG 8.1 ambition of sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in 2017.

The 2018 report titled, ‘Selected Sustainable Development Trends in the Least Developed Countries,’ was presented to UNCTAD Member States at a meeting of its governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, on 5 February 2018. The assessment finds that LDCs economic growth averaged 5% in 2017, and should reach 5.4% in 2018, which is below SDG target 8.1 on sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the LDCs. According to the report, in 2017, only five LDCs achieved this target: Bangladesh (7.1% GDP growth), Djibouti (7.0% GDP growth), Ethiopia (8.5% GDP growth), Myanmar (7.2% GDP growth) and Nepal (7.5% GDP growth).

The report shows that aid to LDCs remains far below the target of 0.15-0.20% of donor countries’ official development assistance (ODA)/gross national income (GNI), a level that was agreed in 1981 and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development in 2015. It notes that in 2016, only a handful of donor countries appear to have met these commitments: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK provided over 0.20% of their own GNI to LDCs, while the Netherlands met the 0.15% threshold.

The report also shows that aid tends to be skewed towards a relatively small pool of LDCs, with the top ten recipients accounting for roughly half of total disbursements to the group. The top recipients are often the countries most affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict, the authors find.

The assessment indicates that levels of external indebtedness have been surging across LDCs, and in 2016, remittances accounted for as much as 31% of GDP in Nepal, 29% in Haiti, 26% in Liberia, 22% in the Gambia, 21% in the Comoros, 15% in Lesotho, and they exceeded 10% of GDP in Senegal, Yemen and Tuvalu. It also finds that many LDCs fall short of the inclusive and sustainable industrialization envisaged in SDG target 9.2 (Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in LDCs).

Hawai’i will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge.

The Hawai’i State Senate aims to focus on a local platform to implement the SDGs during the 2018 Legislative Session. The 2018 Senate Legislative Program outlines Hawai’i’s goals for each of the 17 SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the Program states that Hawai’i will ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have “equal rights to economic resources by implementing and enacting appropriate measures and social protection systems.” On SDG 14 (life below water), Hawai’i will continue its commitment to strengthen its “resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters” in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change. On SDG 15 (life on land), Hawai’i aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of its “’āina and natural resources by integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into local and state planning.”

The Senate will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge, a local sustainability framework that aims to improve the quality of life for future generations. The Aloha+ Challenge focuses on achieving sustainability goals in clean energy, local food production, natural resource management, solid waste reduction, smart and sustainable communities, and green workforce and education. The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard tracks Hawai’i’s progress in these areas. On natural resource management, the Dashboard focuses on increased freshwater capacity, watershed area, marine managed areas, invasive species control and native species management and notes whether each area is being measured or is near its target. For example, on watershed area, Hawai’i is near the 2030 target of 253,000 areas of native watershed under high-level protection. The state has increased is protection of priority watersheds from 10% (90,000 acres) to 15% (132,000 acres) since 2011, and has plans for tripling the areas protected. For each of these areas, the Dashboard provides information on how users can learn more about the issue and contribute to making a difference.

On local food production and consumption, the Dashboard describes current challenges Hawai’i faces in developing a sustainable local food system and outlines the state’s goal of doubling local food production by 2030 by building on Hawai’i’s history of agricultural innovation and abundance. Users can track progress by dairy, protein, vegetables, fruit and starches.

J. Kalani English, Hawaiian Senate Majority Leader, said the 17 SDGs will “continue to build a more resilient state and improve the quality of life for future generations.” In the introduction to the legislative program, he stresses that Hawai’i is recognized as a “global leader in addressing sustainability and climate change challenges, building on a history of systems-thinking and traditional knowledge.” [Hawai’i Senate Press Release] [Hawai’i 2018 Senate Legislative Program] [Aloha+ Challenge]","17 January 2018: The Hawai’i State Senate announced its intention to enact the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into state law to achieve the sustainability of Hawai’i’s people, communities, natural resources and economic prosperity.

It also supported a focus on helping vulnerable groups to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Commission agreed on four draft resolutions, which will be forwarded to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

CSocD 56 convened from 29 January-7 February 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Commission focused on the theme, ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all’ and addressed both the drivers of poverty and recommendations to tackle poverty.

In opening remarks, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed welcomed achievements in reducing extreme poverty, providing access to health care and education and promoting the empowerment of women, youth, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and older persons. She cautioned, however, that progress on extreme poverty remains uneven “across regions, within countries and between various social groups.” She underscored the need to address such inequality and unemployment and underemployment among the world’s youth.

On poverty, the Commission discussed the role of strategies for poverty eradication in achieving sustainable development for all. Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions “remains the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.” Equatorial Guinea for the African Group said 390 million Africans remain “mired in extreme poverty,” despite commitments to eradicate poverty. Participants recognized the role of natural disasters, conflicts, civil unrest and economic slow-downs in driving poverty.

On social protection, many supported both universal health care (UHC) and social services for all. Mohammed said 45% of the people around the world who need social protection have access to only one benefit. She called for social policies and protection that ensure everyone shares the benefits of economic growth and globalization.

Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, observed that many people remain at risk of falling back into poverty if impacted by a disaster, illness, job loss or lack of social protection. He recommended developing a comprehensive and integrated socioeconomic policy framework. A representative from Malawi shared his country’s cash transfer programme and holistic approach to implementing the SDGs.

On vulnerable populations, participants advocated for prioritizing the rights of older persons, youth, rural people and others in special situations. The International Federation of Associations of the Elderly said elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of disasters and impacts from conflicts and wars, and recommended managing older populations’ post-traumatic stress from such crises. The International Relations Students’ Association of McGill University, Canada, the only student‑run group that has consultative status with ECOSOC, called for taking youth voices into account in decisions on environmental change, energy, food security and migration.

Many participants echoed this call for the participation of youth in decision-making, stressing that youth can help to advance the 2030 Agenda and play a role in improving the use of science, technology and innovation (STI) and increasing transparency. Others highlighted: the importance of investments in early childhood education; the role of risk management and insurance in building resilience, especially in the context of climate change and natural disasters; and the potential of access to information and communications technology (ICT) in increasing the independence of persons with disabilities or older persons with mobility challenges.

On UN reform, Mohammed observed that the Commission can support the UN Secretary-General’s current efforts to reposition the UN development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. She said the Commission’s resolution on its methods of work can support these efforts, and emphasized the Commission’s continued role as a space for policy debate and exchange of experiences.

CSocD 56 agreed on a draft resolution on the Commission’s future organization and methods of work. By the text, governments decide that the Commission will focus on a single priority theme at each future session, leading to an action-oriented resolution with recommendations to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). The resolution proposes the 2019 priority theme of ‘Addressing inequalities and challenges to social inclusion through fiscal, wage and social protection policies.’

The resolution titled, ‘Third review and appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002′ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.3), recognizes the contribution of older persons to implementing the SDGs, and encourages States to consider the health, care and well-being of older persons in their national SDG implementation. The Commission further agreed on resolutions on: ‘Social dimensions of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development’ (document E/CN.5/2018/L.4); and ‘Strategies for eradicating poverty to achieve sustainable development for all.’

Four high-level panel discussions convened throughout CSocD 56, including a high-level panel that discussed evidence-based mainstreaming of disability in the 2030 Agenda. Another high-level panel focused on the UN Secretary-General’s report on the Madrid review on aging. The report identifies trends and obstacles to implementation of the Plan around the world. Other panel discussions addressed sustainable and resilient societies, including the role of technology for social need and social good, and of innovative ICT in the 2030 Agenda. The Commission also discussed a report on poverty eradication, reviewing progress on and discussing country strategies to implement SDG 1 (no poverty).

ECOSOC President Marie Chatardová noted that the Commission’s discussions on eradicating poverty will contribute to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

17,https://www.edie.net/library/Five-steps-to-take-the-lead-on-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals/6807,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",edie.net,SDG roundtable: Five ways to move from ambition to action,"Sustainability and corporate responsibility managers from a range of businesses across the country recently gathered in London for an exclusive roundtable hosted by edie and UL EHS Sustainability, which explored the steps required to take the lead on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

Forum Chair Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, released the summary of the 2017 Forum.

The annual high-level event took place on 14 October 2017, in Washington, DC, US, during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings. The Forum gathered heads of government, ministers and central bank governors from small States, as well as representatives of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth Secretariat, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the IMF. The 2017 edition of the Forum marked the first time that private sector institutions participated at a large scale, including Swiss Re, World Economic Forum, Bitt.com and the World Ocean Council.

The four main issues raised during the 2017 Small States Forum, according to the summary, are: vulnerability; International Development Association (IDA18) implementation; de-risking; and partnerships. The summary also highlights the importance of mobilizing public and private sector financing for renewable energy, for green and blue economies, and for technology. Also, according to the summary, Forum Members welcomed the ‘Roadmap for World Bank Group Engagement with Small States,’ which was prepared by the World Bank in May 2017.

On vulnerability, participants underlined that small States’ susceptibility to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, frames the challenge of quickly mobilizing and disbursing considerable financial resources to countries that may not have easy access to concessional development finance. The World Bank can mobilize finance quickly in the aftermath of an emergency and provide additional resources for countries that otherwise would not be eligible for it, including by using the IDA Crisis Response Window and creative price buy-downs using trust fund resources. However, the Members noted, some vulnerable small States, such as Nauru and Palau, are unable to access either IDA or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, as they neither qualify for the IDA small States exception nor meet the credit standard for IBRD. They called on the World Bank to explore financing solutions for such vulnerable small States that “fall through the cracks.”

On the IDA18 implementation, participants welcomed the “massive increase” in IDA resources available for eligible small States (US$1.9 billion, which is more than double the previous allocation), noting that for some countries, the IDA allocation has quadrupled. The Forum observed that the challenge is to now find transformative projects that can absorb and make the most of these extra resources. The summary explains the need to focus efforts on preparation, front-loading and fast-tracking (available) development financing, and using innovative financial instruments and creating new partnerships to mobilize additional public and private sector resources.

On de-risking, the Forum noted that as financial institutions seek to “de-risk,” they are causing the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships in small States. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda proposed the establishment of a working group to address the development challenges of de-risking for small States.

Participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and nontraditional partnerships.

On partnerships, participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and non-traditional partnerships. Development partners agreed to continue working together to improve opportunities for small States to access development finance that reduces their vulnerability to shocks.

Several private sector innovative mechanisms were also discussed, including: a new form of blockchain technology that builds direct financial connections to manage remittances and address the challenge of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relations; private insurance that acts as a financial shock absorber, providing fiscal space during natural disasters; and technology to ensure the traceability of tuna so that small States can significantly increase their revenue.

Now, imagine that area stripped entirely of its trees. This is the amount of forest area lost to the world each year. The total cost of this deforestation is immeasurable, with impacts extending far beyond the forest itself.

Once forests and trees have disappeared, so too will the integrity of the soil and water systems they supported — often permanently. Approximately 75% of all freshwater for farms, industry and homes comes from forests and wetlands. Forests also sequester more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem, and when they are destroyed, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, impacting adversely on the global climate.

Deforestation’s negative impacts for people and the environment are thus far-reaching and serious. Increased forest loss also means that, without major corrections in land use, the world will fail to meet crucial global targets, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Deforestation threatens achievement of forestry targets under the Goals, as well as SDGs on eradicating hunger and poverty, preserving health and fighting climate change — which rely heavily on the goods and services that forests provide.

To put this degree of interdependence into perspective, we need to look at SDG 15 on ‘Life on Land.’ In July, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards this Goal, which calls for, by 2020, promoting the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and substantially increasing afforestation and reforestation globally. These are highly ambitious targets. SDG 15 requires the world to ensure that through the sustainable management of forests, we also protect biodiversity; restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; and halt and reverse land degradation.

None of these measures can be achieved if forests are not at the heart of policies, development strategies, and actions that go far beyond the forest sector.

This is because many drivers of deforestation lie outside the forest sector and are rooted in wider social and economic issues, including challenges related to reducing poverty, and policies that favor land uses that produce higher and more rapid financial returns, including energy, mining, transportation, and agriculture.

Further, a growing world population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 makes it critically important to find ways to feed people while maintaining and expanding forests to meet other human needs.

This can be done.

Research published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has shown how, over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover. Food production can expand through agricultural intensification and other important policy measures. Ghana, Tunisia, and Viet Nam are just a few examples from very different countries that all show strong results when decision-makers coordinate policies across sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, land-use planning, and rights to land tenure.

Over the past quarter-century, more than 20 countries have improved food security while, at the same time, maintaining or increasing their forest cover.

Sharing expertise and increasing awareness is a critical part of this process. Governments at all levels must work closely with indigenous peoples, community representatives, private-sector associations, and international organizations. Corporate responsibility commitments by large companies operating in the agricultural sector are equally important. An inclusive and broad engagement can lead to a re-evaluation of the role of forests in agriculture production. Innovative technology must be shared and applied to a greater degree, international financial instruments and private-public partnerships considered, and governance issues, including tenure, reviewed.

There is no time to waste. Halting and reversing deforestation globally presents an enormous challenge and will require both political will and concerted action across all sectors at all levels. This effort may influence pivotal decisions expected this year when the HLPF takes stock of progress toward the SDGs in July. This will, in turn, influence follow-up actions by States, business, and civil-society partners at all levels. With collective action now, we can address the global challenge of deforestation, achieve our targets, and ensure that the world today, and in the future, continues to enjoy all of the goods and services that forests provide.

Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra made the call in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, California, US.

Mahindra, who will co-chair the GCAS, said approximately 500 companies are expected to “step up and commit to set science-based targets” by the September summit. He commended the more than 330 companies that have already committed to align their strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through the Science Based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that helps companies determine how much they must cut emissions to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Almost 900 more companies have announced their intent to set science-based targets within the next two years in their CDP disclosures, indicating a “new normal” in the way businesses are developing future strategies, according to the We Mean Business Coalition.

Mahindra said that businesses can “future-proof growth” and boost their competitive advantage in the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting science-based targets, which also shows governments that businesses are serious about aligning their strategies with the Paris Agreement.

This call, made during the 48th World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, which convened from 23-26 January 2018, is the first of multiple ‘Summit Challenges,’ which are expected in advance of the GCAS. Such challenges aim to help deliver GHG reductions to help ensure global emissions start “trending downward” no later than 2020, as well as to help the Summit contribute to an energy transition that generates quality employment and inclusive economic growth. The GCAS aims to showcase such climate action and new commitment in advance of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 24) in November 2018.

In his statement, Mahindra also sought to dispel the idea a trade-off between reducing emissions and increasing profits, among other “persistent myths” about business action on climate change. He explained that initiatives to reduce emissions have generated a return, and in the last five years, his company has saved 58 million KWh of energy, which could power 15,000 homes in India. He added that climate change represents a US$6 trillion financial opportunity over the next two decades.

Also at the WEF, French President Emmanuel Macron committed to shutting down France’s coal-fired power stations by 2021. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted climate change as one of the three most significant challenges to civilization, along with terrorism and the backlash against globalization. The Climate Group released the ‘RE100 Progress and Insights Report: Approaching a Tipping Point: How corporate users are redefining global electricity markets,’ which notes that 25 members of RE100 reached 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2016. Over 30 companies across 16 sectors and with a combined revenue of US$1.3 trillion will accelerate implementation of circular economy solutions through Factor 10, an initiative of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

The hotel industry and Japanese companies are among the business entities taking action recently.

Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) is advancing inclusive, sustainable economic growth through a partnership approach across governments, business and civil society. P4g has invited concept notes to join its Partnership Fund, which will be accepted through 30 March 2018. The P4G initiative aims to catalyze inclusive, sustainable economic growth through partnerships and solutions in support of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. P4G supports partnerships through funding, facilitation and recognition. P4G partners include the governments of Chile, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Viet Nam, the C40 network of 91 major cities, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Also working in alignment with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) established four ‘ITP Goals,’ addressing climate change, water, youth employment and human rights. The goals “embrace science-based targets” on carbon, and encourage the hotel industry to reduce carbon emissions at scale. According to the UN, the global hotel industry accounts for approximately one percent of global emissions, and this amount is predicted to increase as demand grows. ITP encourages the use of its Hotel Footprinting Tool for hotels to identify their carbon emissions and identify areas of improvement, including through energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.

On water, the ITP goals focus on addressing water scarcity and improving water-use efficiency. On youth employment, the ITP goals aim to double the industry’s impact on youth unemployment through employability programmes. On human rights, the ITP goals seek to raise awareness of human rights risks, address risks in the labor supply chain and hotel construction, and include human rights in corporate governance.

The Japanese company Omron considers the SDGs in developing medium-term business plans.

In Japan, companies have set targets in line with the SDGs and are working to advance sustainability across a number of the Global Goals. Companies that have set SDG targets include:

Ajinomoto, which works on infant nutrition in developing countries;

Fujitsu, which advances environmental technologies;

Lixil, which will increase the number of developing countries in which it manufactures portable toilets;

Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, which is using slag byproducts from steel manufacturing to create a product that can increase the ocean’s iron content, supporting the proliferation of seaweed and advancing ocean conservation;

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

23,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-samson,"Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Samson’,"Pure Flix’s first biblical epic has action and spectacle — and a credible Samson — but in some ways the filmmakers would rather their story be ‘pure’ than faithful to the Bible.

If you ever wondered what it might have looked like for Samson to slay 1,000 Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, wonder no more.

I mean, you didn’t necessarily have to wonder before. It’s not like Bruce Macdonald’s Samson, Pure Flix’s first venture into epic moviemaking, is the first screen version of this story.

But Cecil B. DeMille’s stodgy, dated 1949 Samson and Delilah, with Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr, is no classic. The 1996 Bible Stories TV version with Elizabeth Hurley, Dennis Hopper and Diana Rigg is way too long at three hours (and the jawbone scene involves no more than a dozen or so dead Philistines anyway).

Perhaps most importantly to Pure Flix’s constituency, both of these versions and most others include varying degrees of racy content. For DeMille, indeed, the opportunity to show skin and sexiness in an overall context of piety and morality was part of the appeal of biblical and ancient epics. There’s a reason most versions of this story are called Samson and Delilah; a musclebound hero and a treacherous temptress are an obvious sell. Screen Samsons typically get a lot of shirtless scenes, often with Delilah and/or other female characters.

Taylor James, a young English actor who got his start on London’s West End, has by far the most superhero-esque physique of any live-action Samson I’ve seen. In fact, James had a bit part in Justice League as an Atlantean, though he actually reminds me of a particular Marvel hero: With his black hair and bulging facial bones, he would make an excellent Wyatt Wingfoot in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe Fantastic Four movie. (Okay, maybe not, unless it turns out that James has Native-American ancestry, but still.)

Since this is a Pure Flix production, Samson only loses his shirt a couple of times that I recall, and never in romantic moments, which are very chastely filmed. Actually, it’s not just how they’re filmed; the biblical character has been cleaned up quite a bit.

The Book of Judges says that Samson “saw” an unnamed Philistine woman and wanted to marry her; later we read that he “saw” a harlot and went in to her. The repeated verb suggests that the draw in both cases was very much on the surface.

Turning the story of Samson’s ill-fated marriage to a Philistine woman, here named Taren (Frances Sholto-Douglas), into a sweet and chaste story of true love is defensible creative license. So is making Delilah (Caitlin Leahy) conflicted and genuinely in love with Samson.

Likewise defensible, if overly tidy and contrived: linking these women to each other and to Samson’s great enemy, the sadistic Philistine prince Rallah (Jackson Rathbone), son of King Balek (a formidable Billy Zane). It turns out that before Delilah delighted Solomon, she was Rallah’s intended — and Taren was her handmaid.

But the sequence in which Samson innocently finds himself in a brothel only by accident might be the studio’s signature moment. “What manner of inn is this?” Samson asks warily, and the mistress titters, “Nothing indecent, I promise, my lord.” That’s Pure Flix’s promise to you.

Making this sanitizing of the story more jarring is the very different approach to violence. Samson is, I think, Pure Flix’s first PG-13 production, pretty much entirely for violence, including battlefield sequences, cold-blooded murders and brief torture. The jawbone scene, in particular, goes on and on; the filmmakers may not show all 1,000 of those kills, but they want to get as close as possible.

Since the battle has to come to an end at some point, the good news is that James isn’t just the biggest screen Samson I’ve seen, he’s also perhaps the most engaging — a low bar, admittedly, but we spend two and a half hours with the guy, so it matters.

This is a Samson who seems humanly lacking in self-understanding, who often acts more on instinct than on certitude that he’s God’s invincible action figure. Usually sanguine and insouciant, he goes into a cold fury when the spirit of the Lord comes mightily upon him just before a battle.

To peg him in 21st-century movie-hero terms, Samson is part Thor, part Aragorn: a cheerfully irresponsible brawler and a reluctant hero who doesn’t want to embrace his destiny or lead his people.

He’s also an improbable peacemaker, wanting to see Hebrews and Philistines coexist peacefully, though his family and neighbors want him to lead his people to war against their oppressors. (Samson’s parents are played by Rutger Hauer and Lindsay Wagner; as James chortled to my friend Peter Chattaway in an interview, “My dad’s from Blade Runner and my mom is the Bionic Woman!”)

It would be nice to interpret Samson’s peacemaking impulse as a sign of his chosenness — a visionary sense of God’s true will in spite of our hero’s general slacker shortcomings. The film, though, seems to side with his family and neighbors: God has chosen Samson for war, not for peace.

Like the other major heroes of the Book of Judges, Samson was chosen by God to deliver his people from the enemies into whose hands God had given them because of their wickedness. Yet the judges were not just military leaders; they were also civil leaders. After the jawbone massacre, the Bible says that Samson judged Israel for 20 years.

The implication seems to be that, after delivering Israel from the Philistines, Samson proceeded to bring at least some measure of righteous rule to his people, leading them away from the wickedness that had led to Philistine domination. For those 20 years, there was relative peace and justice in Israel (“relative” being the operative word, certainly).

Of course, the Philistines nursed a grudge against Samson — and took their revenge when they got the chance. Yet nothing in the biblical account warrants the scene at the start of the second half (“many years later”) in which we find the Israelites yet again oppressed and starving because Samson refuses to fight for his people.

“For years we have listened to you,” Samson’s younger brother Caleb (Greg Kriek) charges. “We have barely endured. Nothing has changed.”

My misgiving here is not just that the filmmakers have taken dramatic license with the biblical account, but with how this particular choice shapes the film’s themes and point of view.

From start to finish, Samson is about a divinely elected war leader who wrongly wants peace instead of war and who fulfills his destiny only in his climactic self-annihilation — as opposed to the biblical picture of a champion who becomes a civil leader judging his people more or less rightly for 20 years before falling into the hands of his enemies.

The saber-rattling denouement (I wouldn’t exactly think of this as a spoiler, but it’s about the very end, so fair warning), after Samson brings down the house on the Philistines, depicts a sword-wielding Caleb mustering a force of Israelites chanting Samson’s name. In death, then, Samson becomes what he never quite managed to be in life: a figure around which his people unify to fight their enemies.

In spite of these caveats, I can just about recommend Samson to its target audience. It’s competently made and sometimes impressive. The acting is generally good.

There are occasionally decent ideas, such as King Balek schooling his son Rallah in the Realpolitik of religion: The gods, he says, “have no power. For us, they are a means of control. I am Dagon. You can be Dagon.” But Rallah, who has seen God’s power in Samson, struggles with almost Chalcedonian language to describe it: “I have seen a real God in a real man.”

The dialogue is serviceable, and often better than the prior versions (again, a low bar). Occasionally there is a glaring contemporary colloquialism, such as the villain threatening consequences “if Samson doesn’t show.” And Caleb glibly uses the phrase “still small voice” as if it were a well-known cliché and Elijah were not still centuries in the future.

My favorite Bible movies tend to be ones that surprise me and offer me new ways of thinking about the stories I know so well. I feel a little smarter for having seen them. (Films like this include DeMille’s The King of Kings, Pasolini’s The Gospel According to Matthew, DreamWorks’ The Prince of Egypt, the stop-motion The Miracle Maker, Aronofsky’s Noah, and the Anne Rice adaptation The Young Messiah.)

Samson makes me feel … not smarter. But perhaps that is a cheap shot, and I am being too hard on a pretty okay movie that will make a lot of viewers happy.

The consultations address the six themes of the Forum: climate; people; development; urban issues; ecosystems; and financing; as well as the Forum’s three crosscutting topics of sharing through stakeholder involvement; capacity building; and water governance for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Regional reports are being produced, and a Regional Process Commission of the Forum has responsibility for integrating input from the regions into the Forum’s deliberations.

In Europe, a ‘kick-off meeting’ of water professionals and agency representatives took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in May 2017. The meeting launched a process that created a structure and invited case studies for the European regional report.

In Africa, four sub-regional reports were prepared as input to the regional report to the Forum. In January 2018, the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW) organized a regional preparatory meeting of ministers in Entebbe, Uganda, to validate the regional report, which addresses issues of water security, ecosystems and climate change. Osward Chanda, Africa Development Bank (AfDB), stated at the meeting that Africa’s water sector requires US$14 billion a year to adequately address these issues through sound technical studies and investments in infrastructure and water management, of which the AfDB currently is providing US$3 billion.

The Americas used an online survey to invite contributions on the six themes and the three crosscutting topics.

The Mediterranean region organized its Third Mediterranean Water Forum in Cairo, Egypt, from 22-24 January 2018, with outcomes meant to feed into the regional Mediterranean report.

Other preparatory events in the lead-up to WWF-8 have included an interfaith event in January 2018 in Brasilia, and a meeting of local and regional authorities in February 2018 on the sidelines of the ninth session of the World Urban Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Kuala Lumpur meeting discussed arrangements for the Fifth International Conference of Local and Regional Authorities for Water, which will take place as part of WWF-8 on the theme of ‘Water to Sustain A New Urban Future.’ The Brasilia meeting, from 11-12 January, deliberated on the theme of ‘Waters for Peace’ at the Second International Seminar on Water and Transdisciplinarity. Spiritual leader Sri Prem Baba of the ‘Awaken Love’ movement presided at the event. Christian, Buddhist, Muslim and Indigenous representatives, as well as representatives of UN Environment and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), attended the seminar. The event sought to create a peaceful global alliance for the conservation and conscious use of water resources.

The study – entitled How to report on the SDGs: What good looks like and why it matters – reviews corporate reporting on the SDGs from the world’s largest 250 companies (G250) and assesses it against nine SDG reporting quality criteria.

KPMG’s research finds that within two years of the SDGs being launched in 2015, four in ten (40 percent) top companies acknowledged the global goals in their corporate reporting. Of these, 84 percent identified the SDGs they consider most relevant to their business.

However, less than one in ten has reported a business case for action on the SDGs (8 percent) or has set specific and measurable (SMART) business performance targets related to the global goals (only 10 percent).

Adrian King, a lead author of the study and KPMG’s Global Lead for Sustainability Reporting & Assurance, said:

“There are huge business opportunities inherent in tackling the world’s toughest problems, but so far only a handful of big companies have shown they understand that. These few leaders stand to benefit from recognizing the SDGs as a powerful catalyst for the innovation, partnerships and market transformations that build businesses. They will also be at an advantage when communicating with the many investors, governments and other stakeholders who are taking an increasing interest in the contribution of business to the SDGs.”

Key findings from KPMG’s study include:

The SDGs most commonly prioritized by leading companies are Climate Action (SDG13), Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG8) and Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG3)

The SDGs least commonly prioritized are Life on Land (SDG15), Zero Hunger (SDG2) and Life Below Water (SDG14)

Three quarters (75 percent) of companies that report on the SDGs discuss the impact their business has on the goals, but reporting is largely unbalanced with most companies discussing their positive impacts but not the negative

Four in ten (39 percent) companies that report on the SDGs include the global goals in their CEO and or Chair’s message

In emissions trading scheme (ETS) news, the US state of New Jersey is rejoining a regional greenhouse gas (GHG) initiative after six years, and Kazakhstan launched its reformed ETS.

In January 2018, Canada began the implementation of its national carbon pricing strategy, announced in 2016. The carbon pricing scheme is part of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which aims to reduce emissions and build climate resilience while ensuring economic growth. Canada has set a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Under the national scheme, Canada’s provinces and territories can choose their approach to carbon pricing using either an explicit price or a cap-and-trade scheme. In 2019, the Canadian government will implement a federal-level pricing backstop that will apply to provinces and territories that either request this or that do not have an adequate pricing system in place. A draft legislative proposal for this federal backstop will be made available for comment in early 2018. In a comment, environmental advocacy group Carbon Market Watch noted that the Canadian federal government must negotiate with ten provinces, suggesting that this means on the one hand that the new plan is likely to force provinces to do more to reduce emissions. On the other hand, the flexibility and autonomy allowed in implementation “could undermine its performance.” [Government of Canada Webpage on Carbon Pricing] [Carbon Market Watch Commentary]

In ETS news, the US state of New Jersey is on track to rejoin the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) of nine states after incoming state Governor Philip D. Murphy (Democrat), elected in November 2017, signed an executive order that initiates a rule making process for re-entry. New Jersey, a founding member of the RGGI, left the initiative in 2012 under Governor Chris Christie (Republican). The International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) reported that New Jersey’s power sector emissions increased by 15% between 2011 and 2015 while those in the other RGGI states decreased. [ICAP Story]

After two years in suspension, Kazakhstan relaunched its ETS on 1 January 2018. The revamped ETS includes new provisions and targets, including a three-year national allocation plan and an emissions cap of 5% below 1990 levels by 2020. The Kazakh ETS now comprises 225 installations and 130 companies in the energy and industrial sectors. To support the relaunched ETS, Kazakhstan has also developed, jointly with the World Bank, an electronic reporting system for GHG emissions from these sectors. [ICAP Story] [ICAP Kazakhstan ETS Infosheet] [World Bank Press Release]

In an effort to safeguard the environmental integrity of The EU ETS ahead of the Brexit, the UK informed the EU Climate Change Committee that it adopted a law on 27 December 2017 that advances its compliance deadline for 2018 emissions to a date preceding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Consequently, and in line with an EU ETS Registry Regulation endorsed by the Climate Change Committee in November 2017, allowances issued by the UK during 2018 will not be marked or accepted for surrender.

Following a national consultation on the topic, the Ministry of Climate Change will launch a technical study on a possible carbon pricing instrument.

The national consultation took place in Islamabad, Pakistan, organized by Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change and the Collaborative Instruments for Ambitious Climate Action (CI-ACA) project, which the UNFCCC Secretariat runs through its five Regional Collaboration Centres. Approximately 60 public- and private-sector representatives agreed that carbon pricing is worth exploring as a way to reduce emissions and increase green investment. However, they cautioned that any carbon-pricing scenario must be compatible with Pakistan’s economic development objectives, poverty reduction, and increased access to sustainable energy, among other goals.

Participants agreed that Pakistan could draw on the experiences of other countries in developing and implementing carbon pricing instruments, such as a tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or an emissions cap-and-trade system. They emphasized the importance of transparency, clear institutional arrangements, awareness-raising, capacity building, and robust monitoring, and reporting and verification systems.

Approximately 42 national and 25 subnational jurisdictions are pricing carbon. The EU Emissions Trading System, currently the largest carbon market, covers about 1.75 billion tonnes of emissions.

28,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-black-panther,"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Black Panther’,"Is Black Panther the first movie in Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe with something in particular on its mind?

More precisely, is it the first MCU movie with a definite burden — a sense of being set amid a larger discussion that can’t and won’t be ignored?

Until now, the closest thing to an idea running through the MCU franchise has been, I guess, distrust and fear of the military-industrial complex, of the erosion of freedom in the name of security.

The original Iron Man turned on Tony Stark’s discovery that, as a weapons manufacturer, he was the bad guy. Ever since then, global threats in one Marvel movie after another have implicated either Tony himself, one of his rivals or partners, or their top customer, the U.S. government (including SHIELD, which turned out to be radically corrupted by the evil Hydra).

Yet this has been less real concern than a trope; less a political point of view than a way of dodging political controversy. (Reinventing the Chinese supervillain Mandarin in Iron Man 3 as a British actor fronting for an American industrialist was a way to keep selling tickets in China.)

Tony and Nick Fury might get the world into one scrape after another, but they’re always there to get us out. (Are they perhaps a little like Homer Simpson’s incoherent ode to alcohol: “the cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems”?)

Now consider how Black Panther establishes our hero, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), soon to be crowned king of the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda: dropping from the sky onto a convoy of Nigerian insurgents transporting terrified girls and women kidnapped from nearby villages.

Consider how different this introductory sequence is from an analogous scene in the original Iron Man with the armored Avenger-to-be dropping down out of the sky into the midst of a Afghanistan village under attack by the terrorist cell that held him earlier in the film.

The international terror cell in Iron Man had no political or thematic significance beyond implicating Stark Industries in global violence. When Iron Man showed up to clean house, he was merely taking responsibility for his mistakes; the innocent civilians he rescued were just window dressing.

The scene in Black Panther, by contrast, transparently references the hundreds of Nigerian women enslaved by Boko Haram. (The women in their head scarfs scan as Muslims, the main victims of Islamic extremism.)

As it happens, Black Panther is not here to fight these insurgents or to rescue these women. Instead, he’s looking for someone who is: Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), his onetime girlfriend and an officer in a Wakandan all-female special-forces unit called the Dora Milaje.

Despite Wakanda’s strictly isolationist politics, Nakia feels a responsibility on behalf of her nation to those in need on their doorstep — and it turns out that this extends to a nervous young militant who might be almost as much an unwilling captive as the enslaved women he guards.

This scene’s presence, like Nakia’s, expresses a global conscience, not a personal one. How could one make a superhero movie set in Africa, in a technologically advanced African nation with no history of foreign oppression or colonization, and not address Africa’s humanitarian and historical crises, including violence, terror and the legacy of colonialism?

For that matter, how could one make an entry in the biggest Hollywood mega-franchise of all time, with an almost all-black, mostly American, cast and not address the black experience in America?

The answer is that probably many filmmakers could, but Ryan Coogler, the writer-director of Fruitvale Station and Creed, is not one of them. (Some spoilers follow.)

Michael B. Jordan, the star of Coogler’s last two films, is outstanding as a terrific villain, Erik “Killmonger” Stevens, whose grievances and master plan are an indictment of the failings and sins of Wakanda as well as the United States (and, with the U.S., any nation where black skin has been a mark of discrimination).

Some of the beats and motifs here too directly echo last year’s lightweight Thor: Ragnarok, which also turned on a contested royal succession, a villain with a secret past and a grudge rooted in the hidden sins of a royal father, and (thanks to Kiwi director Taika Waititi) an anti-colonial backbeat.

But where Asgard’s history and doom fatally never mattered in Ragnarok, Black Panther cares passionately about Wakanda: its peoples, its architecture, its technology. This Wakanda is a dream or myth of Africa unplundered by colonialism and uncorrupted by slavery, flush with resources, culturally vibrant, rich in pageantry.

What Gene Roddenberry’s Federation was to American culture (and for all its diversity Star Trek was always deeply culturally American), Wakanda might be to Africa, or for Afrocentrists: a futuristic aspirational ideal; an alternate cultural identity of the imagination; a way of taking pride in the best of what we are and thinking about what we could become. (For a quarter century this style of aesthetic has been called “Afrofuturism,” but it’s never broken out on the big screen in this way before.)

Black Panther’s concerns are rooted in real-world injustices in and beyond sub-Saharan Africa. This is a movie in which the white villain, Andy Serkis’s gleefully malicious Ulysses Klaue (introduced in Age of Ultron), sports a Cape Town accent, while the black villain, stealing an important artifact from the African wing of a British museum, points out that the stuff in that wing was stolen in the first place by the English. (Later, as the black villain talks about black communities being over-policed, you realize this is Fruitvale Station’s Oscar Grant talking.)

For all the dignity and bearing that Boseman brings to the role, T’Challa isn’t the most interesting character. On the flip side, he’s a rare big-screen superhero who’s actually decent, conscientious and honorable by character, like Wonder Woman or Captain America.

Helping to humanize him, T’Challa is surrounded by a stronger supporting crew than any other Marvel hero — including a larger crew of strong, capable women than any major comic-book movie to date except Wonder Woman, and then only on Themyscira.

The opening act has some fun with the idea of T’Challa freezing “like an antelope in headlights” at the sight of Nakia. There’s also his kid sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a smart-mouthed tech whiz who plays Q to her big brother’s 007, outfitting him with all the toys. Danai Gurira embodies ferocity as General Okoye, head of the Dora Milaje, and Angela Bassett is appropriately regal as the Queen Mother Ramonda.

A federation of five tribes ruled by a king chosen through single combat, Wakanda is blessed by a primordial meteor strike with a rich store of the extraordinary element vibranium, which seems to have no end of amazing properties.

Among other things, the vibranium-rich soil of Wakanda produces a potent plant from which a drug is distilled that bestows “the power of the panther” on the king of Wakanda. (This power — basically Captain America-style super-soldier enhanced strength, toughness and agility — is said in legend to be a gift from the “panther goddess,” and with the powers comes a trance and a vision in which one seems to meet the spirits of one’s ancestors.)

Following ancient custom, T’Challa’s ascent to the throne is marked by a colorful ritual at a waterfall involving single combat with any challengers from the other clans.

That no one ever questions whether this method of adjudicating claims to the throne — traditionally fatal to the loser — is the best way to select the leader of the world’s most technologically advanced nation is among Black Panther’s odder problems.

Thus we get a scene in which one challenger, roundly defeating his rival, accosts onlookers with rhetorical questions about whether the losing party is really the kind of person who can lead Wakanda into the future. Because, you know, how can someone hope to lead a technological superpower if he can’t even beat up another dude who has trained all his life for a battle like this? This tunnel vision plays out pretty much to the end; it seems that either T’Challa or his rival must kill the other, and no other solution seems in the offing.

There are other flaws. Although the design and look of the film is generally excellent, the action sequences generally suffer from the usual Marvel jitters, and the climactic battle sequence is marred by particularly sloppy computer imagery.

But the commitment of the outstanding cast — which also includes Get Out’s Daniel Kaluuya as the warrior W’Kabi and Winston Duke as M’Baku, the defiant but honorable head of a clan with mountain gorilla trappings — goes a long way toward selling the action in spite of technical problems. (Martin Freeman reprises his role as CIA agent Everett K. Ross from Captain America: Civil War; the casual viewer might be forgiven for not noticing that he is not in fact Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson, who was killed in The Avengers and seems to be, as far as the movies are concerned, still dead.)

Black Panther isn’t the visual breakthrough that Doctor Strange was, and the filmmakers haven’t yet figured out how to make its protagonist as engaging as his supporting cast. Still, they succeed where it counts: Black Panther makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe a bigger, more interesting, more engaging place, one where for the first time women and people of color aren’t limited to token or supporting roles.

Along with last year’s Wonder Woman, it marks the dawn of a new era of Hollywood fantasy in which heroes really can look like anyone — and are allowed to care deeply about honor and justice. If formulaic superhero adventures must dominate the big screen, let’s have more like this.

Also in March, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) reported that one in five children globally does not attend school, and that little progress has been made in improving school attendance over the past five years.

The 38-member Steering Committee was established in 2016 as the coordination mechanism for education in the 2030 Agenda. It is comprised of UN Member States, eight UN agencies, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and various international partnerships and organizations. The Committee issued its recommendations as it met for the fourth time from 28 February-2 March 2018, at the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Headquarters in Paris, France.

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay stressed that the commitments expressed in SDG 4 are ambitious, and that building education systems is a collective responsibility that can be achieved through cooperation among all stakeholders. Among its recommendations, the Committee calls for US$280 million a year to be invested in data collection, monitoring and reporting. It calls for institutions that have a UN mandate to monitor SDG 4 to be guaranteed financing, based on agreed responsibilities and shared costs. The Committee also encourages governments to develop holistic national evaluation systems, and to take part in regional or international learning assessments.

In handing down its recommendations, the Committee emphasized that education is a human right, and governments have a responsibility to provide it. The Committee endorsed a one-year advocacy campaign on SDG 4, which will be carried out by the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM), UN agencies, regional organizations, countries and civil society networks.

The High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress towards SDG 4 in 2019. Preparatory consultations will take place beforehand in Kenya, Bolivia, Thailand, Tunisia and France in 2018, followed by a Global Education Meeting in Brussels, Belgium, from 3-5 December 2018.

UIS statistics show that 9% of primary school-aged children and 33.3% of secondary school-aged children do not attend school. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in three children overall does not attend school, and girls are more likely to miss out than boys. Among those who do attend school, one in six does not achieve minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics.

UIS is the official data source for monitoring of SDG 4. Silvia Montoya, UIS Director, said UIS is developing further indicators to monitor equitable education and learning outcomes.

As energy is a ‘nexus issue’ that spans the breadth of the SDGs, our attention was also drawn to knowledge products that directly link energy to decent jobs (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

The Global Preparatory Meeting for Review of SDG 7 took place from 21-23 February, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Thai Ministry of Energy. The meeting highlighted progress on energy access in the Asia-Pacific region, but also remaining challenges. In her opening remarks, ESCAP Executive Secretary Shamshad Akhtar noted that the region remains “the most energy intensive” in the world. The SDG Knowledge Hub summary of the meeting is here.

As an input to the assessment of SDG 7, a series of 27 policy briefs was developed by the Ad Hoc Informal Multi-stakeholder Technical Group of Advisors on SDG 7. Each brief features key messages and statistics on progress so far, as well as priority actions to accelerate movement towards the Goal. The briefs are categorized into four sections: 1) advancing SDG 7 implementation; 2) interlinkages between SDG 7 and other Goals; 3) regional perspectives; and 4) “toward a sustainable and equitable energy future.”

Under the first heading, the papers look at trends in achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix, financing SDG 7 and more. The brief on electricity access notes the difference between having a source of electricity and having universal access, cautioning that the former does not guarantee the latter. The brief on cooking fuels highlights that 40% of households (3 billion people) still prepare meals using “traditional” stoves, which poses a risk to both human health and the environment. It notes that upwards of 4.3 million deaths each year are attributable to household air pollution, and lists priority actions for policy, planning, finance and monitoring, such that clean cooking fuels can be realized for all. The brief on increasing the share renewables notes that 80% of total final energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, but that 60% could of electricity be generated by renewables by 2030. The finance brief highlights the importance of policy measures on both the demand-side (i.e. de-risking investment, carbon pricing) and supply-side (financial system reform). It also outlines the potential for financial technology (“fintech”) solutions to facilitate the development of small-scale, distributed energy systems.

A brief linking energy, climate and transport calls for prioritizing alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

Ten policy briefs highlight linkages between SDG 7 and other Goals. The brief linking energy to poverty and inequality highlights that “energy is a precondition for economic development,” meaning that achieving SDG 7 is not only a goal in itself, but also a means of achieving others. The water-energy-food nexus brief notes that policy coherence is key to managing tradeoffs and synergies, given increasing needs across all three areas. Connecting energy to health, Policy Brief #10 recalls the above statistic on clean cooking fuels, also describing how energy enables health services (i.e. through vaccine refrigeration and equipment sterilization) and offering examples of how SDG 7 contributes to targets under SDG 3. The briefs linking energy to climate and transport call for prioritizing reduced emissions and alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

The ‘Regional Perspective’ category dedicates papers to energy trends in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Arab region, as well as a brief covering Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The fourth category unpacks long-term and systemic issues, such as energy pathways to 2050 and the linkages between indicators, data and energy. The papers were developed in conjunction with stakeholders from the UN system, bilateral governments, multilateral actors and civil society.

During the meeting, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Southeast Asia.’ The report describes macroeconomic and social trends, analyzes the current energy landscape and recent investment and deployment trends, and outlines the benefits of decentralized renewable energy. It finds that, although 65 million people in the region currently lack reliable electricity access, there remains potential to tap significant renewable energy resources whilst adding jobs in the energy sector. The report makes a case for diversifying energy production through renewables, noting that there were over 611,000 renewable energy jobs in the region as of 2016. The report also highlights socio-economic, health and environmental benefits from decentralized renewable energy, offering a goal-level mapping to the SDGs starting on page 131.

As previewed in last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Region convened from 1-2 March in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum discussed Goal 7 among the other SDGs to be reviewed at the HLPF. Case studies of national experiences in implementing the Goals in ECE countries were provided by governments and other stakeholders for discussion at the meeting. They examine how energy systems are being made more efficient, what initiatives have enabled increased investment, and the policies and measures that have been implemented to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.” A session on ‘transforming energy in support of the 2030 Agenda’ explored the reconciliation of countries’ emissions targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change with their short-term reliance on fossil fuels.

Additional knowledge products were released outside of the meetings. A separate report by IRENA finds that, despite the EU’s current reliance on fossil fuels, member countries “could cost effectively double the share of renewable energy by 2030.” The finding, one of many from ‘Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union,’ comes as part of a broader, bottom-up REmap analysis that assesses and aggregates countries’ and regions’ renewable energy potential. REmap’s aim is to build a roadmap that looks not only on technologies for electricity, but also for heating, cooling and transportation

A joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) and Facebook looks at options for bridging the “digital divide,” noting that nearly 4 billion people lack internet access. Titled ‘Powering Last-Mile Connectivity,’ the paper frames the issues partly as one of a need for better infrastructure to increase efficiency. The paper cites that mobile network operators spend up to US$3.8 billion on fuel alone to power infrastructure, and that for consumers, charging mobile phones is both costly and time-consuming if charging points are far away, as is often the case in rural areas. The findings highlight the importance of the interlinkages across the SDGs, particularly the interface between SDG 7 and SDG 9,

The Center for Global Development released a policy paper titled, ‘What Can We Learn about Energy Access and Demand from Mobile-Phone Surveys? Nine Findings from Twelve African Countries.’ While not explicitly covering SDG 7, the paper offers insight as to both survey techniques and challenges facing universal access to energy services (SDG target 7.1).

At the city level, new analyses by CDP find that 102 cities worldwide now source at least 70% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Detailed coverage of the CDP report, and related energy news from the BP, Coal India, and the Government of Ireland, is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The ninth meeting of the negotiating committee of the regional agreement on access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in LAC convened in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 28 February to 4 March 2018, to conclude negotiations of the agreement, which enshrines the protection of human rights defenders in environmental matters.

During the closing ceremony, Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís said the agreement will help fight crime, poverty, inequality and hate, and is crucial “for the very survival of our species.” He pointed to “environmental democracy” as a new legal term that implies the participation of all in protecting the environment.

Alicia Bárcena, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said the agreement ensures the right of people to participate in decisions that affect their lives and surroundings. She explained that the “second-generation accord” links the environment to human rights and rights of access, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

During the meeting, signatory countries invited all LAC countries to sign and ratify the agreement as soon as possible. The agreement will be open to the signature of the 33 LAC countries at UN Headquarters in New York, US, from September 27, 2018 to September 26, 2020. The agreement establishes the creation of a Conference of the Parties (COP), which ECLAC, serving as technical secretariat of the agreement, will convene no later than one year after the agreement enters into force and which will hold ordinary meetings at regular intervals, in accordance with what the Conference decides.

Speaking during the meeting, Miguel Ángel González, Chile, stressed that any decision made by an authority overseeing environmental matters must include a participatory analysis of what that decision means on the ground and for the populations involved. UNEP LAC Office Director Leo Heileman said the agreement provides the opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level.

Also during the meeting, ECLAC released the publication, ‘Access to information, participation and justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean: Towards achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ which reviews the laws and institutional frameworks that safeguard the rights of access to information, participation and access to justice in environmental matters in the 33 LAC countries. The publication draws on material compiled by the Observatory on Principle 10 in LAC, which analyzes legislation, policies, jurisprudence and treaties that guarantee the rights enshrined in Principle 10. The updated version of the publication, which was first published in 2013, reflects recent developments and the traction they have gained in the LAC region, and includes new examples of good practices and emerging issues.

The Forum outlined its commitment to eliminate gender gaps in the workplace in the ‘Call to Action of Chile.’

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Chile organized the Forum in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women. The event, which convened in Santiago, Chile, from 27-28 February 2018, focused on the theme ‘The Future of Work and the 2030 Agenda.’ Over 500 representatives from 39 countries, including more than 50 employers’ organizations and trade unions, attended the event.

The Forum addressed gender gaps in the workplace within the context of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). SDG 5 includes target 5.1, to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, and target 5.5, to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making. SDG target 8.5 aims to, by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value.

Participants shared progress and challenges related to achieving these SDG targets. The Gambia’s Vice President and Minister of Women’s Affairs, Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, reported that empowering women and enabling equal opportunities in the workforce is “a key pillar of our National Development Plan.” Jallow-Tambajang emphasized that businesses, from micro-credit and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, are taking steps to reduce inequalities, boost productivity and improve the Gambia’s economies.

Achieving equality in the labor force will require addressing women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work.

Richard Barathe, UNDP, observed that women’s equality in the labor force could contribute US$28 trillion to the global economy by 2025. But, he noted, this will require efforts to address women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, encourage women’s entry into the workforce and close the gender pay gap.

In the Call to Action of Chile, governments, the private sector and union members commit to “work every day” to promote equality and inclusion and to change working conditions to achieve greater equality between women and men. The signatories call on stakeholders to find innovative ways to apply lessons learned and to share the Forum’s messages on gender equity in their workplace and with other companies.

The Forum also discussed UNDP’s ‘Gender Equality Seal’ programme, which certifies companies that have eliminated pay gaps, increased the number of women in decision-making roles and made progress in ending sexual harassment in the workplace. UNDP supports partners in 17 countries around the world to meet gender equality targets.

The Forum’s website features a catalogue of solutions to accelerate gender equality. Solutions are organized around solutions to: eliminate the gender pay gap; promote labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors; build transformative partnerships; eradicate sexual harassment; promote women in business; foster women in leadership; and promote work-life balance.

On promoting labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors, UNDP describes a project that promoted the integration of women and girls in workplaces in Haryana, India, including a training program for women in the stainless steel sector. As a result, jobs opened in a sector that has not traditionally been an option for women in India. UNDP stresses that programmes focused on women “need not use a welfare approach” but can instead use a gender and development lens to focus on sustainable impact.

Recently announced resources approach transparency and accountability through the lenses of corruption, gender equality, agriculture, and financing for sustainable development. This brief also reviews recent releases on the monitoring and review process for the SDGs.

The SDGs acknowledge that corruption can be a hindrance to sustainable development, with target 16.5 calling for the substantial reduction of the practice, as well as bribery in all forms. Transparency International’s Marie Chene writes on Medium that civil society actors and activists can monitor corruption using alternative indicators and data sources, which also chart corruption’s impacts on SDG achievement. She also highlights the role of civil society actors in increasing accountability through peer reviews of countries’ Voluntary National Review (VNR) reports, which are submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and conducting parallel reviews and shadow reports that complement—and potentially challenge—countries’ official VNRs.

Transparency International released one such country-level “shadow report” for Afghanistan. The report titled, ‘Policy, SDGs and Fighting Corruption for the People: A civil society report on Afghanistan’s Sustainable Development Goals,’ builds on a series of analyses conducted in 2017, which uses a common methodology to examine country progress towards SDG 16. Looking particularly at SDG targets 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows), 16.5 (substantially reduce corruption and bribery) and 16.10 (ensure public access to information), the report outlines how corruption negatively impacts on development through poor service provision and insecurity. It highlights Afghanistan’s progress on these thress targets, such as anti-money laundering efforts and the establishment of institutions to protect against corruption, but flags that, in practice, there is an implementation gap and low inclusion of civil society in anti-corruption legislation. A Transparency International press release is available.

Also on target 16.4, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) announced a new initiative to measure illicit financial flows in Africa during the 49th session of the UN Statistical Commission, which was held from 6-9 March on the theme, ‘Better Data, Better Lives.’ The SDG Knowledge Hub’s story on that session’s discussion of the SDG indicators is here.

Turning to gender and accountability, as covered on the SDG Knowledge Hub, the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation, in partnership with Women Deliver and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), launched the ‘Practice Guide to Auditing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Gender Equality’ on the sidelines of the 62nd session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW 62), which is currently convening in New York. The guide reviews international commitments to gender equality and supports supreme audit institutions (SAIs) by developing an approach to ensure accountability and institutions’ meeting their commitments.

In the boardroom, BlackRock recently sent letters to 367 companies that have fewer than two female board members, asking these companies to justify the gender imbalance, Bloomberg has reported.

At the regional level and on agriculture-related SDGs, a research article in Sustainability informs the development of a “composite baseline index of the agriculture-related SDGs in Southern Africa to guide progress reporting.” The paper summarizes agriculture’s presence across the SDG framework, and uses data for eight indicators under five SDGs (1, 2, 6, 7 and 15) to develop the index for 13 southern African countries for which data on all indicators were available. The authors note that, in the face of data limitations and constraints, the results may be used to ensure accountability in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as a range of national investments and commitments prioritize agricultural developments. Further, the index can be used to track progress towards implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

On monitoring and accountability in the context of the broader 2030 Agenda, the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC) published the collaborative report titled, ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the Voluntary National Review Reports Submitted to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in 2017.’ The report aims to strengthen accountability by highlighting best practices in reporting, as well as gaps (notably around data). Highlights of the paper’s launch event and a detailed summary of the report by contributing author Nathalie Risse are available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A baseline of Australia’s SDG progress has been developed, with a dashboard to track 72 targets and 133 indicators.

The above knowledge products all point to the importance of transparency and data availability. These two pillars have been the focus of Australia’s approach to SDG implementation, as highlighted by Lisa Cornish on Devex. The 2018 Australian SDGs Summit was convened on 13 March 2018, in Melbourne. Previewed during the event, a baseline assessment of Australia’s progress towards the SDGs uses four methods to create a dashboard examining trends for 72 targets and 133 indicators. The document is being developed by the National Sustainable Development Council with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). With robust data and publicized findings, interested stakeholders can track the status of their priority goals, and become increasingly empowered to hold their governments accountable when progress is lacking.

On finance and accountability, Eurodad’s María José Romero writes on UNCTAD’s Investment Policy Hub that public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be less favored than standard public procurement processes if there is increased transparency about their costs. Although PPPs increasingly are used to finance development projects and can enable cross-sector collaboration, the cost of “capital, profit expectations by the private partners and transaction costs associated with the negotiation of complex PPP contracts” can detract from cost efficacy. The blog suggests that PPPs’ accounting practices can create a false narrative in governments’ balance sheets, and calls for increased transparency around PPPs and the disclosure of their long-term fiscal implications.

Over the last thirty years, the number of lives lost from severe weather events has decreased largely because of increased accuracy of weather forecasting and warnings, and improved coordination with disaster management authorities.

Issued on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2018, the report titled, ‘Multi-hazard Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ focuses on the need for community engagement and education, disaster preparedness and effective dissemination of warnings, all required for effective early warning. It incorporates the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems, disaster risk information and enhanced risk assessments.

Early warning is reflected in the SDGs, particularly those related to food security, healthy lives, resilient cities, environmental management and climate change adaptation.

The checklist provides a list of actions that national governments, community organizations and partners can refer to when developing or evaluating early warning systems based on four main elements: disaster risk knowledge; detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards and possible consequences; warning dissemination and communication; and preparedness and response capabilities. The document will be updated based on the development of technologies, advances in multi-hazard early warning systems and feedback from the users.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRR Mami Mizutori urged countries to incorporate the checklist into national and local DRR strategies, which are scheduled to be in place by 2020 in accordance with target (e) of the Sendai Framework for DRR (substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2020). She said that a multi-hazard approach to early warnings is critical for building disaster resilience. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said WMO is working to establish a global standardized multi-hazard alert system in collaboration with National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS).

Early warning is an important component of a number of international agreements. The Sendai Framework for DRR recognizes the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems. The SDGs address early warning, particularly those related to food security (SDG 2), healthy lives (SDG 3), resilient cities (SDG 11) and climate change adaptation (SDG 13). The Paris Agreement on climate change also mentions early warning systems as a focus area to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, reduce vulnerability, and minimize loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.

An outcome of the first Multi-hazard Early Warning Conference that took place in May 2017 in Cancún, Mexico, the checklist updates the original document, ‘Developing Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ which emanated from the Third International Conference on Early Warning in March 2006.

The report shows that agencies have accomplished 61% of their aims since WWF-7 took place in the Republic of Korea, and are continuing their efforts. The report also offers 14 policy recommendations to the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (HLPF) for when it convenes in July 2018 to review progress on the SDGs, including SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation.

The publication titled, ‘Synthesis Report on Implementation Roadmaps 2015-2018’ covers 16 water-related issues that the global water community previously identified as priorities in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Implementation Commitment (DGIC), an outcome of WWF-7. ‘Implementation Roadmaps’ (IRs) are intended to provide a framework for WWF partners to act on their commitments. The IRs provide continuity between each Forum, promote collaboration among partners, and contribute to global water-related processes. Between WWF-7 and WWF-8, review meetings took place in the Republic of Korea in 2016 and 2017 to monitor progress on these commitments.

The IR themes for the past three-year period since WWF-7 relate to overarching concerns of water security; water for prosperity and development; water for sustainability; and implementation mechanisms. Many of the themes identified at WWF-7 in 2015 foreshadowed specific water-related targets under the SDGs: for example, on water quality, WWF-7 participants agreed to improve water quality by 2030 by reducing pollution, minimizing the release of hazardous agro-chemicals, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and increasing recycling and safe reuse. In comparison, SDG target 6.3 is very similar, but refers to “hazardous chemicals and materials” instead of agro-chemicals, and includes a commitment to eliminate dumping. The report provides an overview of progress on each of the 16 themes identified for action.

The report’s policy recommendations for the HLPF highlight water security as a prerequisite to the achievement of all the SDGs, not only SDG 6. The authors call for increased financing to be directed towards the overall goal of water security and for financial flows to be channeled to sub-national and local governments, where appropriate, to enable a holistic approach to water management at the city level, with co-benefits in land planning, solid waste management, energy, and transport. Other recommendations reflect, inter alia, concerns for promoting complementarity between sewered and non-sewered city sanitation services, and increasing the visibility of climate-related risks in policy dialogues.

In their respective forewords to the report, Korea Water Forum President Jung-Moo Lee and WWC President Benedito Braga affirmed the work of many international, national, regional and local agencies, referred to as DGIC Champions and Core Groups, for their policy leadership and efforts in advancing progress on the various water issues. The report is published by the World Water Council in collaboration with the Korea Water Forum and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea.

The water accounting reports are meant to support implementation of national development plans as well as the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6).

Water accounting seeks to capture the value of water resources to the economy. The Botswana water accounts describe water use in the years 2015-2016. The Centre for Applied Research, Botswana, is drawing attention to the policy implications of the results, including the need to improve water-use efficiency, invest in non-conventional water resources, apply the knowledge gained in implementing Botswana’s Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and development plans, and ensure stakeholder participation.

In a journal article titled, ‘Economic Accounting of Water: The Botswana Experience,’ published in ‘Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C,’ the authors highlight that, while public attention focuses mostly on water service providers, self-providers such as mines and the agricultural sector account for more than half of total water abstracted from the environment. They call for greater attention to the role of self-providers in IWRM implementation.

The Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) partnership, led by the World Bank, provided initial training and support for producing water accounts in Botswana. WAVES, which promotes the mainstreaming of natural resources in national economy accounts and development planning, has been working with countries since 2013 to develop approaches to ecosystem accounting based on the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). It has pilot sites in India, Peru, and the Philippines. The UN Statistical Commission recognizes SEEA as the international standard for environmental-economic accounting. Subsystems of SEEA focus on specific sectors, including energy, water, fisheries, agriculture, and land and ecosystems.

The conclusions respond to the session’s priority theme, ‘Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.’

CSW 62 convened from 12-23 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with a focus on ‘Empowering Rural Women and Girls.’ CSW 62 considered the review theme, ‘participation in and access of women to the media, and information and communications technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women.’ Over 4,400 representatives from 170 Member States and more than 600 civil society organizations participated in CSW 62.

On information and communications technology (ICT), representatives of 12 countries shared national progress on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment through ICT. Belgium highlighted women’s underrepresentation in media, stressing that women “practically disappear” from media as they age, and shared tools developed to address this challenge, including awareness-raising campaigns. Denmark called for governments and enterprises to be more proactive in promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Saudi Arabia described initiatives to bridge the digital divide between men and women and urban and rural areas. New Zealand expressed concern about “digital harm,” including cyberbullying.

On land tenure, the Commission held a panel on ‘The role of rural women’s land rights and land tenure security in reaching the SDGs.’ Panelists underscored the importance of extending gender equality to land rights and ownership, saying that unless women have equal access to land, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will “become an impossible vision.” Out of 161 countries surveyed, 37 countries have specific laws that grant men and women equal rights to own, use and control land. Panelists urged advancing women’s land rights as a way to catalyze progress on women’s empowerment, including through better implementation of land laws, collecting data on gender-based rights and tenure security, and leveraging the SDG’s land indicators.

The CSW recognized synergies between the work of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including complementarities in the themes of CSW 62 and the 2018 HLPF with respect to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Commission considered a note by the Secretariat, titled ‘Input to the work of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (E/CN.6/2018/11),’ that summarizes the Commission’s potential contributions to the HLPF. CSW’s Agreed Conclusions will be transmitted to ECOSOC and the HLPF for inclusion in their work.

The CSW Agreed Conclusions recommend specific measures to end poverty and enhance women and girls’ food security and nutrition, access to education, health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, decent work, land and productive assets, and rural infrastructure and technology, such as safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and clean stoves. The Conclusions call for ending all forms of violence and harmful practices that impact women and girls.

Women and girls have clearly stated what they want: the rights to own property, the need for quality infrastructure, and the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.

UN Women’ s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described the Agreed Conclusions as a “vital step forward” for ensuring equality for women and girls in rural areas. She emphasized that women and girls have clearly stated what they want: “from the rights to own property, to the need for quality infrastructure, to the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.” CSW 62 Chair Geraldine Byrne Nason (Ireland) stressed that the Agreed Conclusions affirm the Commission’s commitment to leave no one behind, and provide real outcomes to address the lives of rural women and girls.

In the Conclusions, CSW emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship among the empowerment and women and girls, the realization of their human rights and gender equality and the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To ensure their full implementation, the Commission’s recommendations focus on: strengthening normative and legal frameworks and eliminating laws and policies that discriminate against rural women and girls; implementing economic and social policies for the empowerment of rural women and girls, including by building the resilience of rural women and girls to climate change and environmental degradation such as deforestation, desertification and loss of agricultural biodiversity and systematically measuring and incorporating the value of unpaid work performed by rural women and girls in calculations of gross domestic products (GDP) and formulation of economic and social policies; and strengthening the collective voice, leadership and decision-making of rural women and girls.

The CSW also held sessions on: data collection approaches for measuring progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment; gender-based cyberviolence; cooperation between global and regional mechanisms dealing with violence and discrimination against women; and other topics.

Numerous events took place on the sidelines of CSW 62. Estonia hosted an event on ‘Ending violence against women—opportunities and challenges of ICT.’ Speaking at the event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted how ICT innovations can expand economic pathways and improve service delivery and access. However, she observed, the digital gender divide is widening, and more and better data is necessary to understand “the scope of violence against women and girls facilitated by technology.”

The Women’s Empowerment Principles Forum discussed opportunities for business to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Speakers also shared good practices in implementing the Principles, to which almost 2,000 CEOs globally have committed. Participants highlighted the role of gender equality in achieving all of the SDGs, but underscored that gender inequalities remain pervasive in every dimension of sustainable development. In remarks at this event, Mohammed called for action in four areas: placing gender equality at the center of implementation; closing the financing gap, including by identifying innovative sources of funding; improving monitoring through disaggregated data on gender and strengthened national statistical systems; and strengthening accountability for gender commitments at all levels.

A ceremony marking the agreement was held on the sidelines of the sixth session of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES-6). The Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators was founded at the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD 13) in 2016.

The Thematic Assessment on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production, launched in February 2016 at IPBES-4, found that populations of pollinators around the world are in decline. The report aimed to provide policy makers with an independent assessment of the state of knowledge on the status and trends of pollinators as well as the policies and actions available to reverse that trend. The Coalition was founded at CBD 13 to cooperate actively in the promotion of pollinators, with members committing to: develop and implement national pollinator strategies to protect pollinators and their habitats; share experiences and lessons learned; collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders; and conduct research on pollinator conservation.

At IPBES-6, convening in Medellin, Colombia from 17-24 March 2018, Colombia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Ireland joined the Coalition. Current and new members reported on their activities to date:

Denmark reported how awareness on pollinators among decision makers, the scientific community, and the public has increased and noted the importance of bringing policy makers together, creating partnerships, and motivating each other to do more.

Germany reported that the federal government has committed to fight the decline of pollinators comprehensively, including with: a new action programme, science-based insect monitoring; and research on the causes of insect decline.

Colombia presented a proposed national strategy for pollinators, including actions on: knowledge valuation and monitoring; integrated valuation; capacity strengthening; adoptive management; and legislation.

Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed excitement to join the Coalition, and looked forward to sharing his country’s vast knowledge on pollinators.

The Dominican Republic noted the importance of working with the ministry of agriculture to encourage the use and protection of the domestic pollinator population.

Mexico and Ireland stressed the importance of awareness raising, outlining several current and planned activities in this regard.

Initiated by the Government of the Netherlands, the Coalition now has 16 members. The initiative is open to any country wishing to collaborate in the promotion of pollinators.

The promotion of pollinators relates to SDG 15 (life on land) as well as to SDG 2 (zero hunger).

44,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/getting-to-2030-tracking-sdg-indicators-for-evidence-of-implementation-progress/,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Getting to 2030: Tracking SDG Indicators for Evidence of Implementation Progress,"During the first two years of SDG implementation, it has been hard not to ask “Are we there yet?” or at least, “Are we getting there?” with the hope that evidence of global progress could be detected. Indeed, our review of the most-read stories on the SDG Knowledge Hub in 2017 revealed that readers are eager for assessments and measurements of SDG implementation.

The SDG framework, as adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, includes 17 headline Goals and 169 targets to be implemented by 2030. A key component for this agenda is the use of a set of indicators in order to measure global progress on the Goals and targets. While the Goals and targets were adopted in 2015, the indicators for the SDG framework were adopted in 2017, following the selection of over 200 indicators in a process overseen by the UN Statistical Commission.

But even with the valuable tool that the global indicator framework provides, monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda, which is to be implemented universally and in a way that ensures that no one is left behind, remains a daunting task. For several indicators, for example, assessment methods still must be defined. In addition, all countries must determine the indicators for which they currently track data, and where they need to concentrate resources on developing new data sets.

As international organizations, governments and practitioners around the world focus their work plans and strategies on the 2030 Agenda, data are being collected, reported on and organized in visualizations that can begin to tell the story of where we stand vis-à-vis our 2030 ambitions. This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation. As our readers’ preferences indicate, the data-driven approach is viewed as an essential component for keeping us accountable and on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and identifying the available data to conduct this tracking is an important step in this process.

Global Assessments

The centerpiece for global assessments is the annual report that the UN Secretary-General is mandated to produce. In 2017, the most-read SDG Knowledge Hub news story was a summary of this global assessment – the UN Secretary-General’s ‘Progress Report towards the SDGs.’ This report was released in June, prior to the meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2017), and provided a global overview of the situation with regard to the Goals. The report was released shortly after the indicator set was recommended for adoption and used existing data compiled by the UN. As indicator development and data collection improve over the coming years, this annual report will be well placed to provide the official, overall assessment of progress.

In addition to this annual document, the UN Statistics Division released an ‘SDGs Report’ during the Ministerial segments of the HLPF in 2016 and 2017, reviewing progress towards the 17 Goals and based on the latest available data (first SDGs Report and second SDGs Report). The data from the 2017 SDGs Report were presented as inputs during the HLPF’s discussions on specific indicators.

Apart from these two reports from the UN Secretariat, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung have used internationally comparable data to produce the SDG Index and the SDG Dashboards, which were released in 2016 and 2017. They plan to release a related overview of implementation in 2018. This contribution to the assessment of progress has ranked countries according to their performance on the SDGs, in an effort to spur a conversation about leadership on specific Goals and where greater effort is most needed.

The custodians of individual indicators are also providing global assessment data for the specific indicator(s) they have been tasked with overseeing, and many of these organizations have created portals for the SDG-relevant data they maintain. Earlier this month, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) launched an online platform for reporting on the status and trends of the world’s forest resources, for example. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) has created an online tool that will capture data on achieving the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The World Bank’s dashboards present data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) that help to monitor the SDGs, and provide visualizations that permit comparisons among countries.

Efforts to bring together information on all of the indicators for a single Goal are also underway. In preparation for the July 2018 HLPF’s assessment of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), UN-Water has coordinated the development of the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation.’ This report is being prepared by the custodian agencies for the SDG 6 indicators, and will include baseline data and updates on data availability for each of the SDG 6 indicators. The preparation of this report was discussed at the 27th and 28th meetings of UN-Water.

Civil society organizations have also set up data portals. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative runs the Target 12.6 Live Tracker, which shows progress on sustainability reporting around the world.

In the midst of this growing number of portals and reports on specific indicators, targets and Goals, the SDG-Tracker project, which was launched in March 2018, brings together the data from many of the portals noted above, in addition to other sources. This project extracts the data from sources including the UN, World Bank, World Health Organization and FAO, and is updated as its sources release new data.

National Indicator Tracking

National governments are the keepers of official statistics for their country, and seek to ensure that indicator methodologies and data collection processes will result in robust, reliable datasets. The custodian agencies for the SDG indicators rely on the official statistics of each country to develop their data sets. A number of countries have developed monitoring and reporting mechanisms to report on their relevant official statistics, and identify indicators for which they do not currently collect data.

For example, the US recently updated the platform that it launched in 2017. This platform reports data for 82 indicators, with measures being improved for an additional 84 indicators, and data being explored for another 80 indicators. This site was built as an open source tool, and the US reports that it is collaborating with the UK and Ghana on national reporting platforms. Australia has just released the ‘SDG Baseline for Australia,’ as it prepares its first Voluntary National Review for the 2018 HLPF.

At the end of 2017, the European Union released a report titled, ‘Sustainable Development in the European Union: Monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context,’ which is based on a set of 100 indicators developed by the EU for this process. In mid-2017, the Government of Sri Lanka launched a report and website for reporting on the status of its SDG indicators at the national level. The publication identified 46 SDG indicators for which data is already available, and 29 indicators for which data could be compiled.

In January, DESA hosted a meeting on national platforms, where officials from national statistical systems and experts discussed how standardized national-level repositories could make global assessments more consistent.

Community Indicator Systems

Data collection at the local level is particularly important for this global agenda that seeks to “leave no one behind.” In many ways, local communities are the best placed to identify what should be counted and what is not currently being counted. The process of collecting this data can also prove to be an important project in itself, with local participation serving to educate and engage the community in the stories that the data can tell.

Community indicator systems offer a way for actors to track well-being at the local level. These efforts can also support the global assessment efforts by helping to make differentiated data available, to achieve the 2030 Agenda’s objective of leaving no one behind. During a recent webinar on localizing the SDGs in the North American context, sub-national efforts in British Columbia, Hawai’i, Winnipeg and Baltimore were revealed to all involve the use of community-level dashboards as one way to engage actors in sustainable development implementation.

Data Processing on the Road to 2030

As with SDG implementation itself, each of these levels of assessment feeds into and draws from the others. Global assessments offer an overall snapshot of where the international community is collectively moving. National governments can see how their contributions fit into the global picture, and consider where they can demonstrate leadership, or are falling short, compared to their peers. Local indicator systems can be tailored to specific challenges and opportunities in specific communities, drawing on and contributing to national level data.

Each iteration of this implied conversation contributes to the continuous learning that is required to implement the 2030 Agenda, as interlinkages among the targets are leveraged and success and failures are identified, and then incorporated into further action. And these data sources and lessons learned do not yet consider what big data sources might be able to add to this conversation.

For our part, we will continue to report on the new platforms and monitoring and evaluation projects that are being developed, as we help our readers answer whether we are “there” yet on the road towards 2030.","This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation.

Co-facilitators Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, provided governments with updates regarding the timeline for the process and the proposed basis for negotiations.

The “repositioning” process started with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. Since the QCPR’s adoption in December 2016, the UN Secretary-General has delivered two reports containing reform proposals, in June and December 2017, as mandated by the QCPR. The reform proposals contained in the reports were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings organized by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, from 29 January to 22 February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” that respond to questions raised by Member States during the briefings. The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during the ECOSOC Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), which was held from 27 February to 1 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US.

The co-facilitators plan to send a timeline for consultations soon, with one or two meetings per week until April and with more meetings per week in April, as the deadline approaches.

Opening the meeting on 8 March, Boukadoum said the OAS summary circulated by the ECOSOC Vice-President on 6 March serves as an input to the discussions. Petersen noted that the deadline for finalizing the consultations is mid-April, until which time the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) will also evaluate the financial implications of the agreed reform proposals. The consultations are expected to commence on 16 March. He added that the co-facilitators would send an elements paper for the zero draft on 12 March, to which delegations are invited to submit written feedback by 14 March. The co-facilitators also plan to send a timeline for consultations soon, he said, with one or two meetings per week until April and with more meetings per week in April, as the deadline approaches. Petersen further proposed that the co-facilitators remain the “penholders,” as was the case with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, rather than discussing compilations of text.

Canada, Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), the EU and Norway said many issues do not require deliberations because mandates already exist, including for the Resident Coordinator (RC) system, the system-wide document and making UN’s work more efficient and accountable. They cautioned against reopening the QCPR by renegotiating issues included in it. Rather than that, they called for a short text and a process that respects clear deadlines, adding that they trust the co-facilitators to remain the penholders. The EU, supported by the US, stated that issues pertaining to ECOSOC, such as the OAS format, should be dealt separately, in the context of the ECOSOC review process. He expressed the EU’s full support for the Secretary-General’s proposals on the RC system, UN Country Teams (UNCTs) and the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs). He also expressed support for the proposals on creating a system-wide evaluation unit, restructuring the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) and the regional approach.

Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), and Pakistan, stressed that: the process should provide sufficient time for receiving inputs from Member States; the quality of discussions should be prioritized over deadlines; and the outcome needs to be substantive. G-77/China noted that the OAS summary can only serve as “food for thought” for governments, while only Member States’ inputs should be the basis for negotiations. To that end, he said the Group will submit a position paper that will include all the elements that should be included in the zero draft, based on both the explanatory notes and the opinions expressed in the ECOSOC informal briefings. He added that the ECOSOC reform should take place after the negotiations on the UN development system conclude, in a sequential and not a parallel manner. He also required clarification on whether the funding dialogue, proposed by the Secretary-General for agreeing on the new Funding Compact, will be part of this process.

The US said the draft should be limited in scope and have no programme budget implications. He added, supported by Mexico, that the ECOSOC review should start “in earnest” and take place in parallel, not sequentially.

Paraguay for the land-locked developing countries (LLDCs) highlighted that countries in special situations need to remain a priority in this process. Nigeria for the African Group stressed that the reform needs to address Africa’s priorities and be focused on: closing the widening digital gaps; addressing the “excruciating” costs of technologies for Africa; poverty eradication; and tackling international financial flows (IFFs). He added that the reform should also address “the perennial difficulty” in financing the RC system in Africa, as well as the development-humanitarian-peace nexus, through the lens of sustaining peace.

Switzerland noted that the Secretary-General’s reform proposals identify seven key areas, while the QCPR focuses only on three of them. She said the outcome should also capture the other four areas, including a road map for the Funding Compact. She underlined that the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) reform needs to be informed by the reform of the UN development system. Mexico also said discussions should not be restricted to the QCPR. He added that the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) needs to be protected, and its resources should not be included in the package being negotiated.

The Russian Federation announced the preparation of a position paper that will be sent to the co-facilitators. He said the process should focus on quality rather than on deadlines, and the resolution should be concise and set a path for the areas that need more discussions, such as the RC system and the Funding Compact.

Per the paper, the ECOSOC review process offers the potential to discuss whether the Council’s current arrangements are sufficient for supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related commitments, and offers the potential to make refinements as needed.

The ECOSOC review was mandated by UNGA resolution 68/1, which calls for government to conduct a review of reforms undertaken to strengthen ECOSOC following an earlier resolution (A/RES/61/16). Alya Ahmed Al Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Einar Gunnarsson, Permanent Representative of Iceland, serve as co-facilitators for the review process.

Titled ‘Review of General Assembly resolution 68/1,’ the informal background paper outlines “key issues” in the implementation of UNGA resolution 68/1 in the context of the 2030 Agenda. It includes sections on: strengthening ECOSOC’s common vision and strategy; pursuing substantive integration; fostering effective system-wide coherence and coordination; addressing the “development-humanitarian-peacebuilding continuum” and emergencies; bringing global attention to emerging issues; engaging stakeholders; improving working methods; and key questions for further consideration.

Some have criticized the “distinct but closely related” themes of ECOSOC and the HLPF as creating confusion.

According to the paper, some have criticized the current arrangements as creating confusion, especially regarding the “distinct but closely related” themes of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and ECOSOC. The paper therefore notes that Member States could further discuss the current approach of selecting and using an annual main theme for ECOSOC and a separate theme for the HLPF sessions held under its auspices. It adds that the work of ECOSOC and HLPF, including agendas and schedules, could be more strongly aligned, and decided upon with sufficient time for planning, coordination and building opportunities for synergy.

On leadership and strategic direction on the 2030 Agenda, the paper notes that Member States could discuss how ECOSOC can improve the impact of its overall policy dialogue and recommendations, through its Ministerial Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the HLPF and High-level Segment, or through the agreed conclusions, decisions and resolutions resulting from the ECOSOC system’s deliberations.

On integration, the paper indicates that there are approximately 30 UN bodies with a direct reporting relationship to ECOSOC, including: eight functional commissions; five regional commissions; three standing committees; one ad hoc body; eight expert bodies; and four related bodies – and discussions could explore ways to more effectively integrate the subsidiary bodies into ECOSOC’s work. The paper also suggests a discussion on the ECOSOC Integration Segment, addressing: whether it could be better timed to more effectively feed into the HLPF and ECOSOC High-level Segment; whether it should mainly discuss areas requiring significantly strengthened integration efforts towards the 2030 Agenda; and ways by which its policy recommendations could better inform discussions at the HLPF and at the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

The paper outlines that changes to the content and structure of the Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS) could be discussed to address its “unfulfilled potential” as an accountability platform for system-wide performance on the 2030 Agenda. This could be achieved, it notes, by holding two OAS sessions per year, including one that could provide policy guidance on system-wide action at all levels, and one that could focus on strengthening the normative-operational linkages across sustainable development, humanitarian assistance and peacebuilding efforts.

On engaging stakeholders, the paper indicates that more than 4,860 NGOs are currently in active consultative status with ECOSOC, and the growing demand for inclusion remains an important aspect of the Council’s work. It suggests to consider the challenge of streamlining the rules and practices of participation of such stakeholders in ECOSOC, its forums and Functional Commissions, noting that currently, the rules and practices “vary greatly.”

The paper also observes that there is scope for further improving ECOSOC system’s working methods to ensure that the sequencing of its sessions will culminate in the global review of the 2030 Agenda at the HLPF and the ECOSOC High-level Segment.

Member States held two informal meetings on the ECOSOC review process, on 6 and 26 February 2018. Per a letter dated 16 February 2018, the co-facilitators intend to prepare a food for thought paper in advance of the next meeting, scheduled to take place on 19 March.

The theme of this year’s World Water Day is ‘Nature for Water.’ According to the 2018 edition of the UN World Water Development Report (WWRD 2018) launched this week, if we want to address our planet’s current water challenges, we need to look to natural solutions. Sustainable water management cannot be achieved through business-as-usual. We must increase the use of so-called, nature-based solutions (WWRD 2018).

The global water cycle is facing many challenges. The overall water demand is increasing mainly because the global population is growing, economies are emerging, and consumption patterns are changing. Climate change is intensifying the water cycle, which means that dry areas are becoming drier and wet regions are becoming wetter. The majority of rivers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have become more polluted, presumably due to population and economic growth as well as the lack of wastewater management systems. Over 5 billion people could be affected by water shortages by 2050. Simply put, our planet and societies are facing several severe water management challenges, and affordable and effective sustainable solutions are urgently needed.

Learning from Nature

The good news is – we don’t have to come up with brilliant new solutions. The natural world surrounding us offers a multitude of so-called nature-based solutions to conserve and rehabilitate water ecosystems, across all sectors, and particularly regarding sustainable agriculture and sustainable cities. Nature-based solutions (NBS) – actions that are inspired and supported by nature, and use, or mimic, natural processes to manage resources – provide multiple services to address these challenges and offer further benefits.

Constructed Wetlands are an example of an untapped low-tech, cost-effective NBS for pollution control, securing water supply, and improving agricultural resource management.

Constructed Wetlands are an example of an untapped low-tech, cost-effective NBS for pollution control, securing water supply, and improving agricultural resource management. They are engineered systems using the natural functions of soil, plants, and microorganisms to retain water and improve water quality. Moreover, they recycle nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous), provide habitats and contribute to recreation, education, research, and landscape enhancement (under appropriate circumstances).

A study from the United Nations University (UNU-FLORES) shows that with the strategic introduction to an ecosystem at the collection and treatment point of wastewater, a community of 500 can irrigate about a hectare of agricultural land and fertilize five to seven hectares. Harvested plants from constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment can provide 12% of a village’s cooking fuel needs.

A constructed wetland has been installed along with a resettlement project in the City of Bayawan in the Philippines. Before, families living in informal areas directly discharged their wastewater into the sea. The City Health Office recorded a high number of cases arising from waterborne diseases (e.g. diarrhea). The settlement was relocated at the city outskirts and a new wastewater management system was built. The system consists of sewer pipes with small diameters and a combination of different types of constructed wetlands. Thanks to the new system, in total, people residing in 676 homes now benefit from safe sanitation and wastewater treatment. Moreover, coastal waters are protected from pollution and treated wastewater is reused in a horticulture and vegetable farming project.

More Knowledge Sharing is Needed

Though there are many such projects worldwide, there is a lack of information at all levels and the knowledge base on constructed wetlands needs to be improved. The Dresden-based institute of the UNU-FLORES is currently developing the Constructed Wetlands Knowledge Platform entailing an interactive map and a comprehensive database to assess the amount of wastewater treated globally by constructed wetlands and to support scientists, practitioners, decision-makers, and civil society in their efforts to establish this technology.

Nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands can provide multiple benefits to local communities and the environment. Successful projects have been implemented around the world. Still, there is a lack of information on these nature-based solutions, such as constructed wetlands, addressing local water challenges. More projects, such as the one by UNU-FLORES, are needed to improve the knowledge base and its accessibility – so that more nature-based solutions can be implemented to enhance water availability, improve water quality, and reduce risks associated with water-related disasters and climate change.

The first set of reports will be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 17), scheduled for early 2019.

UNCCD Parties adopted the new strategic framework during the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13) in September 2017. Unlike the previous 10-year Strategy where countries primarily reported against a set of “performance” indicators, future reports will highlight countries’ progress and impact in relation to five strategic objectives that seek to: improve the condition of ecosystems and affected populations; mitigate drought; derive global environmental benefits; and mobilize financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention.

In view of weak reporting capacity in some countries, the UNCCD’s PRAIS (Performance Review and Assessment of Implementation System) online platform provides access to partly pre-filled templates containing default data on three biophysical indicators (trends in land cover, trends in land productivity, and trends in carbon stocks above and below ground.) These three indicators were also adopted under the SDG framework for reporting on progress towards target 15.3 on land degradation neutrality (LDN).

Since 2014, the UNCCD Secretariat and Global Mechanism have provided support to more than 100 countries to embark on their LDN target setting processes. This initiative, as well as the launch of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) “enabling funding portfolio,” coordinated by the UN Environment Programme, are expected to lend support to countries in producing standardized and high quality reports. In addition, as part of preparations for CRIC 17, the UNCCD Secretariat and its partners are convening six regional capacity building workshops to explore the status of implementation and various issues linked to monitoring and reporting that will also touch on national and regional synergies with the SDG process.

The agreement creates one of the world’s largest trading blocks, and aims to dramatically increase intra-African trade by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services.

African leaders from 44 countries signed the AfCFTA during the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union (AU) Summit. Leaders had agreed to hold the Extraordinary Session at the 30th Ordinary Session of the AU. At the AfCFTA signing ceremony, AU Chairperson Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, said the AfCFTA represents the “culmination of a vision set forth nearly 40 years ago” in the Lagos Plan of Action, in which African leaders called for a continent-wide market.

According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the agreement has the potential to increase intra-African trade by 52.3%. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has estimated that eliminating intra-African tariffs could generate US$3.6 billion in welfare gains for Africa through cheaper goods and an increase in production.

The agreement is anticipated to benefit Africa’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up 80% of the region’s business, as well as women, who account for 70% of informal cross-border traders, and youth through employment opportunities. Apart from these advances towards the 2030 Agenda’s vision of leaving no one behind, the AfCFTA is an important step towards “achieving the SDGs and delivering on the African agenda of peace and prosperity,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. He said the entire UN system will support Africa as it moves towards the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, including through the Joint AU-UN Agreement for the implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.

UNECA Executive Secretary Vera Songwe welcomed the agreement as “a giant strike forward in continental integration, in the pan-African vision and in the development of our continent.” Songwe also underscored the importance of maintaining momentum on the agreement through effective implementation. To track implementation, the UNECA launched the AfCFTA Country Business Index, a tool that aims to monitor progress on the AfCFTA through surveys of business opinions on the agreement’s impact on trade. The AfCFTA Country Business Index tool will rank countries in four areas: AfCFTA implementation; ease of trade; trade for development, the SDGs and Agenda 2063; and AfCFTA impact.

AfCFTA will enter into force once the required number of countries – 22 out of the AU’s 55 member States – have ratified the agreement. As for signatories, to date, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Saharawi Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, the Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Western Sahara, and Zimbabwe have signed the AfCFTA.

The report, global in its focus, underscores the importance of such assessments in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity.

‘Assessing Environmental Impacts: A Global Review of Legislation’ finds a wide range of EIA legal requirements, globally. Some countries have strengthened their regulatory frameworks, but other countries have exhibited a trend of weakening the EIA process. On public participation, the report observes significant global variation in the role of public participation in EIAs. In some countries, requirements for public participation for EIAs have been expanded, particularly during the scoping and review stage. A few countries include specific provisions related to indigenous peoples’ participation in national EIA legislation.

On SEAs, the report observes that uptake and implementation of SEA legal requirements has been slow in many countries, and limited guidance exists on public participation and SEAs, including access to information. The report suggests that one reason for this trend may be that SEA legal approaches do not take into account strategic planning processes. According to the report, at least 40 countries have SEA systems in place, but only some of these countries have formal legal requirements to conduct SEAs.

Other report findings include: a need to improve measurement of ecosystem services, including addressing challenges related to a lack of available, accessible and fit-for-purpose data; and an increased focus on climate change and human health in EIA and SEA legislation. The report recommends application of a “migration hierarchy,” a sequence of actions to anticipate and avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as good practice.

The report features country examples of EIA and SEA arrangements. The examples focus on six steps in the process: screening; scoping and impact analysis; review of the EIA/SEA report; decision-making; follow-up and adaptive management; and public participation. For each step, the report shares examples from countries around the world.

Footage courtesy of DFAT.

CANBERRA — Water, sanitation, and hygiene is “fundamental” to Australia’s development assistance and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific told Devex.

Her comments at the WASH Futures conference in Brisbane, Australia, came as the Australian government announced an extension of a partnership between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the World Health Organization to deliver safe drinking water through the WHO-DFAT Water Quality Partnership.

“When you look at water, sanitation, and hygiene, they are fundamental to our overseas development assistance,” Fierravanti-Wells said in an interview. “Indeed, they are at the heart of our Sustainable Development Goals. If you do not have water, if you do not have sanitation, and if you do not have hygiene, then that is a catalyst for a whole range of other issues.”

Between 2012 and 2017, DFAT invested 15 million Australian dollars ($11.78 million) to the partnership. It has so far supported 15 countries in the Indo-Pacific region through the development of water safety plans to help identify complete water supply system, including hazards and risks, and ways to manage them safety. Water safety plans have been implemented across 882 water systems in the 15 countries, supporting more than 35 million people.

The new announcement sees the Australian government investing an additional AU$5 million over five years, and narrowing the focus to four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam.

While the financial investment and geographic focus is a reduction in Australia’s previous contribution, the partnership has still been maintained in an era of a reduced Australian aid budget. Here, Devex delves into what makes this program and partnership project a valuable investment to Australia.

Deliverables of the partnership

Previous Australian aid funding to the Water Quality Partnership supported phases two and three. Phases one and two began the process of building plans and momentum for them in countries being supported. Phase three had a strong focus on creating sustainability through capacity building and encouraging strong local ownership with the water safety plans.

The new funding extends the work of phase three — including capacity building — to specifically deliver water safety, good drinking water, and good sanitation services.

A gender focus was also introduced in phase three, which will be expanded upon in line with Australia’s aid priorities. Australia has a target of 80 percent of its aid to have a gender focus and last year they achieved 78 percent.

“Women are at the heart of what we do, and are the heart of what we do in the Pacific, and [it] will be important to see gender and gender issues — women and girls — at the forefront of the work we do with the World Health Organization,” Fierravanti-Wells said.

But Fierravanti-Wells said the ability to make an impact on vulnerable populations is the most important deliverable.

“We have to think about the fact that 1,000 children a day die from preventable diseases caused by lack of clean water and sanitation,” she said. “Two billion people do not have access to clean drinking water. And about 4.5 billion people around the world do not have access to or are affected by lack of proper sanitation services. So therefore what we do in our region, and what we do with the World Health Organization, will feed into these important objectives.”

Building and maintaining partnerships

The notion of partnerships is important in the Australian aid program today, including encouraging partnerships with foreign governments, NGOs, research institutes, and the private sector. And building and maintaining partnerships is important to the Australian government in continuing this partnership, according to Fierravanti-Wells.

The Water Quality Partnership allows Australia to work closely with recipient countries in the region to strengthen partnership and deliver safe drinking water. But it also allows DFAT and WHO to share knowledge and capability — and continue to build and maintain their relationship. Fierravanti-Wells said the partnership is complementary to the work WHO does, allowing DFAT to gain knowledge from them. And Australia can share their expertise in water management, having had to manage water in a dry climate.

But the partnership between DFAT and WHO has had to evolve to make the Water Quality Partnership more effective in its use of funds.

An Australian aid evaluation report released in 2014 identified high administration costs of the program due to dual administration both at WHO headquarters and from the Australian side within a South East Asia program hub. In 2012, program administration accounted for approximately 23 percent of total expenditure.

“The reason these four countries — Bhutan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam — have been chosen is that there is a particularly strong World Health Organization structure in those countries,” Fierravanti-Wells said

And by building the new phase of the project around countries with a strong WHO presence, duplication in administration is prevented and each partner can focus on their strengths.

The importance of WASH in Australian aid

According to Fierravanti-Wells, WASH programs “wash through” all aspects of Australian aid deliverables, making it essential to their work. She identified humanitarian responses as one of many examples where WASH crossed through other aid priorities as a fundamental area of support — a higher priority than rebuilding.

Beyond the Water Quality Partnership, Fierravanti-Wells sees Australian aid continuing to invest in, develop, and advance new ways of responding to challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene. The WASH Futures conference was a way of advancing this objective, with participants from the Indo-Pacific were financially supported by DFAT to attend and discuss challenges, issues, and solutions for the region in WASH.

“This conference itself having drawn people from so many parts of the Indo-Pacific is about generating those ideas,” Fierravanti-Wells said. “And when you look at the work that is going to be done over the conference, it is a very granular way that we approach these WASH issues — and I have absolutely no doubt there will be some absolutely fantastic ideas that come out of these days which we and our partners in this space will be able to capitalize on.”

“I’m putting it out there that new ideas are always welcome,” she added.","Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific, on gender issues and WASH. Footage courtesy of DFAT.

52,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-a-wrinkle-in-time,"Fri, 09 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘A Wrinkle in Time’,"Disney’s reimagining of Madeleine L’Engle’s faith-inflected sci‑fi fantasy classic wants to inspire young viewers, but it’s afraid to ask anything of them — and even more afraid of the book’s religious themes.

“If it’s bad art,” Madeleine L’Engle once wrote, “it’s bad religion, no matter how pious the subject.”

Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time is not religious in the same way as the beloved, faith-inflected sci-fi fantasy novel about three children — 13-year-old Meg Murray, her 5-year-old brother Charles Wallace and their 14-year-old friend Calvin — embarking on an interstellar quest for the Murrays’ long-absent father with the aid of three mysterious celestial beings.

Still, the movie has a religious dimension of a sort. Like Disney’s last PG-rated sci-fi fantasy, Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland, A Wrinkle in Time can be seen as a kind of secular faith-based film, no less insistent and heavy-handed about its gospel of inclusion, respect and self-esteem than, say, last year’s The Shack with its own gospel of therapeutic faith. Whatever you think of the message, such ham-fisted art undermines it.

Here is a sentence I did not expect to write: The film’s portrayal of the otherworldly Mrs. Ws — Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which — makes the depiction of the Holy Trinity in The Shack profound and numinous by comparison.

The Shack had Octavia Spencer as God the Father (or Papa); A Wrinkle in Time has Oprah Winfrey as the formidable Mrs. Which. Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who are played by Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, respectively.

Apparently if there’s a trio of unearthly, ageless personages assuming human form in order to guide members of our species on a journey of discovery, they will probably be played by a diverse trio of actors with an African-American woman presiding in some way. (A kind of Della Reese Principle?)

I can roll with that, and if I can roll with a movie imagining God choosing to appear to someone looking like Spencer (and I kind of can), I’m certainly willing to accept Oprah as — well, whatever kind of higher being this Mrs. Which is supposed to be. (The book explicitly identifies the Mrs. Ws as angels, but the movie never says what they are.)

The problem isn’t exactly Oprah, Witherspoon or Kaling, though it isn’t exactly not them, either. The problem is that, for all the colorfully extravagant costume design and glittery makeup, their characters are at best whimsical but not really odd or and never mysterious or compelling. They barely rise to the level of kooky shtick, and engender no sense of higher wisdom or even emotional connection.

I had problems with The Shack, but at least when Spencer told Sam Worthington that he had no idea how much she loved him, I accepted that coming from her.

Not only does Witherspoon’s Mrs. Whatsit never tell Meg (Storm Reid) that she loves her (a line that in the book turns out to have crucial plot significance), I wouldn’t believe her if she did, since nothing we see of her manifests the slightest comprehension either of love or of Meg.

I loved DuVernay’s Selma, and I care about diversity and representation in cinema. L’Engle’s book has been important to me since childhood, not least because of the religious themes, though I’ve never been a purist for adaptations. A daringly reimagined adaptation can honor the original far more than a dully literal version.

This version shifts L’Engle’s story, with its rural mid-20th century setting and white characters, to a diverse, contemporary L.A.-area setting (early scenes were shot in a middle-class Compton neighborhood). Meg is now the only child of an interracial couple (Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and her almost mystically gifted younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe, of Filipino descent) is now adopted.

On occasion it seems the story hasn’t been rethought enough. In the book, when Calvin (Levi Miller) shows up near the Murrays’ remote house at night, Charles Wallace demands to know why he’s there. When the same line is uttered on an urban sidewalk in broad daylight, it makes no sense in that quotidian setting. Why shouldn’t Calvin be there?

The whole movie suffers from that loss of atmosphere. It’s not just that the atmosphere is different; there’s just so little atmosphere of any kind.

“Wild nights are my glory,” says Mrs. Whatsit in a line straight from the book, but it’s only raining; the book’s howling winds and perilous storm don’t make it to Compton.

Some things about the book are relatively unfilmable. The climactic manifestation of evil, for instance, works on the printed page, but it would probably look ridiculous and anticlimactic onscreen.

Yet a fateful scene in which Charles falls under a malign influence that Meg and Calvin barely escape is creepy and dreadful in ways that could translate powerfully to film. Here it’s staged on a crowded beach, and it’s over before you know it.

There is exactly one exception: one of the book’s most unsettling effects, as the children arrive on the dark planet of Camazotz, they encounter an eerie suburban neighborhood in which children bounce balls in perfect union and rhythm, and respond to their mother’s calls to dinner at exactly the same time.

This one faithfully reproduced sequence has not been rethought or updated; the neighborhood and the mothers’ wide-skirted house dresses would be at home in a literal period adaptation.

Yet even here something important is missing: the maternal anxiety of the woman whose boy is dangerously, unrhythmically out of step. One of L’Engle’s themes is how society punishes misfits and oddballs, especially those with misunderstood gifts who haven’t yet learned to be comfortable in their own skins.

L’Engle’s Meg is an awkward misfit: angry, resentful and self-pitying; gifted, though not on her younger brother’s level. (Mr. and Mrs. Murray, both brilliant scientists, are also oddballs; only the twins Sandy and Dennys, dropped in the film, are normal.)

Yet the filmmakers, burdened by the cultural import of a $100-million sci-fi fantasy starring an African-American girl, can’t bear for Meg to have real faults or to be anything less than a positive model for girls and children of color.

So, instead of being a misfit, Meg is bullied by a clique of mean girls who leave her a note on the anniversary of her father’s disappearance suggesting that she should disappear too. Meg lashes out violently at one of them, but she’s only standing up for her little brother. It’s theoretically bad behavior, but the audience expects it — and it seems to impress Calvin.

The principal, a wholly sympathetic authority figure with nothing of the book’s prickly Mr. Jenkins but the name, tells Meg that she shuts people out and then wonders why they don’t like her, but we don’t see this behavior.

Meg is constantly affirmed and reassured; except for Mrs. Whatsit, everyone keeps telling how talented and capable she is, if she would only accept it. Yet the film sells short Meg’s gifts by fearing the story’s intellectual underpinnings, where Meg’s gifts shine.

One of the book’s most memorable bits — a scene that expanded my mind when I read it as a boy, and still shapes my thinking today — involves an explanation of space-time and the idea of a tesseract: a folding (or wrinkling) of space-time via a fifth dimension to travel instantly between vastly distant locations. (“The shortest distance between two points is not a straight line.”)

A version of this scene was shot for the film, with Meg herself presenting the principle in class (complete with a plastic model of an ant taking the place of the imaginary ant in the book’s in-text illustrations). A scene like this could have showcased the side of Meg the filmmakers want viewers to see: brainy and academically capable.

Alas, it seems this was too cerebral or something, and was cut. Now the idea of a tesseract is given a rushed explanation in a scene with Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and the key visual is only glimpsed in a computer animation in the background. How can filmmakers inspire young viewers if they’re afraid to ask anything of them?

The finished film tries to highlight Meg’s gifts in a ridiculous invented action scene evocative of a young-adult apocalyptic survival movie. “It’s a physics thing,” she says modestly, but the stunt they’ve just tried is the sort of thing that only works in video games and movies that are too much like video games.

The need to present an affirmative image extends to Meg’s parents. I appreciate the warmly rendered early scenes with the Murrays all together before Mr. Murray’s disappearance. Yet for all her father’s apologies to Meg for having left her and the family, the film doesn’t dare to touch on Meg’s deep disappointment on being reunited with her father and discovering that he isn’t the all-powerful figure capable of setting all to rights that she’d built him up to be in her mind.

Kaling’s Mrs. Who still speaks in quotations, although her frequent biblical references have all been excised, and there are fewer classical and historical references and more Outkast and Lin-Manuel Miranda. She doesn’t come across as someone who has trouble verbalizing; she just says quotes for no reason.

The dropping of the Biblical references is not incidental. When Mrs. Who quotes 1 John — “The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not” — that has thematic significance: The darkness, the Dark Thing, is strong, but light is stronger; this is not a dualistic, Manichaean story.

The movie’s tagline — “The only thing faster than light is the darkness” — seems to reverse this: Darkness has a natural advantage. The line doesn’t appear in the book, and I doubt L’Engle would approve. (That the movie conflates the darkness — the Dark Thing — with It, which is merely a local manifestation of darkness on Camazotz, is just one more disconnect.) Compared to this, Disney’s Narnia films retained far more of the Christian milieu of Lewis’ stories.

The aversion to religion is nowhere more evident than in the rousing enumeration of the Earth’s great fighters against the darkness. In the book, Jesus is given the first place, though there are others: artists and scientists (Leonardo, Shakespeare, Bach, Curie, Einstein) as well as Christian and non-Christian religious figures (Buddha and St. Francis as well as Gandhi).

The movie relegates all this to an afterthought, adding some racial diversity to the list (Nelson Mandela, Maya Angelou) and dropping all the religious figures, definitely including Jesus.

“Tomorrow there’ll be more of us,” smiles Mrs. Who benignly, quoting Hamilton. Tomorrow-land, according to Disney, may be a utopia with all kinds of diversity, but it seems there’s only room for one gospel.

53,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-paul-apostle-of-christ,"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Paul, Apostle of Christ’","Jim Caviezel co-stars as St. Luke the Evangelist in Affirm Films’ drama about the last days of St. Paul and the struggles of the Roman Christian community in the days of Nero.

“I expected more,” muses Mauritius, the Roman prefect of the Mamertine Prison, critically eying the frail, bald-headed, bewhiskered prisoner standing unsteadily before him.

Perhaps Mauritius is looking for some sign of the charisma and commanding presence that would mark a powerful leader of an infamous cult blamed for burning half the city — or possibly something to warrant the rumors of the prisoner’s supernatural powers and otherworldly character.

Either way, Mauritius wouldn’t have been the first to be less than impressed by the unimposing figure cut by Paul of Tarsus. (Per 2 Corinthians 10:10, Paul seems to have had a rap for being less powerful in person than his mighty letters would suggest.)

The year is A.D. 67, about a dozen years into the notorious reign of Nero, widely deemed responsible for the Great Fire of Rome and said to have scapegoated Rome’s Christian community, not just for the fire, but for hatred of humanity.

For this they were tortured and executed in heinous ways, including being nailed to crosses and set ablaze at night. (The depiction of the persecution is drawn from the Roman historian Tacitus; an opening title tacitly supports the late folk etymology of Nero’s human pyrotechnics giving rise to the term “Roman candle.”)

Paul, Apostle of Christ offers a compelling account the last days of St. Paul — played with gravel-voiced authority by James Faulkner (Game of Thrones; X-Men: First Class) — in a dungeon in the Mamertine Prison, facing execution for treason. It’s not the unmade epic about the life of Paul of Tarsus many would like to see, but what it is is worthwhile in its own right.

Writer-director Andrew Hyatt (Full of Grace) interweaves Paul’s story with two secondary story strands, one concerning Rome’s underground Christian community and the other involving the prefect Mauritius (Olivier Martinez) and his family.

Tying the story strands together is Paul’s old traveling companion, Luke the physician (Jim Caviezel). St. Luke slips quietly into Rome to visit Paul in prison and to bring from him some word of encouragement and guidance to the Roman Christians and the larger Christian world, in the process becoming entangled with Mauritius and his family.

The most dramatically and thematically interesting material emerges from the agonized deliberations of the Roman Christians under the de facto leadership of the missionary couple Priscilla and Aquila (Joanne Whalley and John Lynch), who are companions and fellow workers of Paul (mentioned as such several times in the New Testament).

Conflicting impulses divide the community: Should they remain in Rome, as light in the darkness? Should they seek a warmer welcome elsewhere? Or should they join other Romans opposed to Nero and oppose his tyranny by fighting fire with fire?

Even Priscilla and Aquila are split on whether to stay or go; there are no clear answers here. As for the question of fighting, when speaking to the community Luke strenuously repudiates this as contrary to the way and teaching of Christ — but when he talks to Paul about the horrors inflicted on the believers, he finds his conviction wavering. Though decisively rejected, the prospect and the plausibility of violence in the name of Christ is treated with a level of complexity welcome in such a film.

All of this means trouble at work for Mauritius; there’s also trouble at home. His wife, Irenica (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), is anxious about their daughter’s dangerous illness and worried that her husband may have incurred the wrath of the gods through lack of devotion — or deference toward his sectarian prisoner.

The prospect of a brutal but thoughtful pagan official with a seriously ill family member in a film like this raises the distinct possibility of a miraculous cure and a dramatic conversion. In Paul, Apostle of Christ, these possibilities are actually floated onscreen, which again suggests that the filmmakers may be thinking at least somewhat outside the box.

The conversations between Luke and Paul, which eventually lead to the sequel to Luke’s Gospel, the Acts of the Apostles, form the central arc. Paul recounts vignettes from his life to flashbacks of his early religious training and murderous opposition to what he sees as the heresy of Jesus' followers to his shattering Damascus Road encounter with Jesus Christ and his healing encounter with Ananias.

Luke and Paul have a comfortable relationship easing at times into good-natured banter, though it’s clear that Luke regards the “Old Man” with a species of awe, since everything Luke knows of Jesus has been mediated through Paul’s life and preaching.

If anything troubles Paul, it’s the weight of trauma he still carries from his early crimes as a persecutor of the Church. The stoning of Stephen (André Agius), the killing of a Christian child and other enormities weigh on him, heightened by visions in which he sees his victims standing silently as if bearing mute witness against him. The wordless resolution of this theme is perhaps the film’s most memorable and effective stroke.

Hyatt uses impressionistic slow motion for these visionary sequences, blended with flashback memories, breaking up what is otherwise a largely conversational film shot mostly in dimly lit interiors penetrated by atmospheric beams of light. (The most striking lighting effect involves a pagan offering made to a Roman deity — perhaps Asclepius, the god of medicine — represented as a vast disc-shaped visage like Rome’s famous Bocca della Verità, with bright beams blazing from its eyeholes like laser vision, ready to smite unworthy worshippers.)

At times the nonlinear storytelling leads to some ambiguity regarding the timeline. Some viewers might be confused by a reference in a closing scene to Paul’s two years under house arrest (with which the Book of Acts concludes). The reference is to Paul’s first Roman arrest before the Great Fire, a much less serious affair. (What’s especially tricky is that Paul’s surroundings in this scene are consistent with a house arrest, but the lodgings are not his own and two years don’t pass in the last minutes of the film.)

One oddity is the absence, even in dialogue, of other apostles, notably Peter, whose martyrdom in Rome is generally thought to have coincided closely with Paul’s. Presumably Peter would have been imprisoned like Paul or else with the underground Christian community, yet there’s no mention of him.

Hyatt is Catholic, so the silence about Peter in Rome — or even Linus and Clement, among his first successors as bishops of Rome — seems an odd missed opportunity. (On a subtle note, all the Roman Christian men have beards, which suggests that they’re probably mostly Jewish Christians with an occasional Greek like Luke. I would have liked to see a few clean-shaven Latin faces.)

Shot on a budget and a tight schedule in Malta (where Gladiator and Troy, and more recently Risen, were shot), Paul, Apostle of Christ is remarkably authentic-looking. The screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful, with only occasional missteps, ranging from an occasional poorly chosen phrase (like Luke’s “thoughts and prayers”) to a late moment in which a character who has suffered a trauma more dangerous than Paul’s floggings is up and about far too quickly.

Paul, Apostle of Christ is dedicated to all who have been persecuted for their faith. This potentially raises a sticky point.

Jesus warned Christians to expect persecution, and from his own crucifixion until today the Church has never been without opposition. Today, in fact, Christians around the world are being persecuted as never before. Yet at times the memory or idea of persecution has outstripped the reality.

After the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, Christians often looked back on the early centuries of the Church as a period of constant, ferocious persecution by one Roman emperor after another. In reality, with notable exceptions (including the persecutions of Nero and especially Diocletian), persecution was generally sporadic, haphazard and not state-sponsored. (Some skeptical historians have even questioned the Neronian persecution, though its historicity is accepted by most scholars.)

In our day, global persecution notwithstanding, American Christians are generally far less aggrieved than many of us are inclined to think. It’s easy to imagine many comfortable viewers watching Paul, Apostle of Christ as if it were not only a story of our heritage, and one that resonates with the experiences of suffering souls around the world, but a mirror of our own experience.

On the other hand, the film’s clear repudiation of violence in the name of Christ, its repudiation of efforts to seize the reins of power by any means necessary, and its theme of seeing enemies as human beings are especially welcome today. Sometimes in the effort to resist evil one risks becoming what one opposes, or worse. Paul, Apostle of Christ suggests that it’s always better to suffer evil than to be brought to its level in resisting it.

Oommen C. Kurian

The world’s progress in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depends to a large extent on India’s progress. India plays a strong leadership role at the global level around meeting these targets set by the international community in 2015. In July 2017, India reiterated its commitment to meeting the SDGs when it submitted a Voluntary National Review report on seven goals including poverty, health, hunger and nutrition, as well as gender equality at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

Despite progress in recent years, India continues to be hobbled by high incidence of mortality and morbidity. Disease, malnutrition and preventable loss of life pose a huge economic challenge and are a drain on the nation’s human resources. Indian policy documents have started acknowledging this lately. For one, the Economic Survey 2016 by the Ministry of Finance acknowledged that while there are intrinsic reasons to invest in maternal and early-life nutrition programmes, they are particularly important for their high returns on investment. These programmes contribute to early physical and cognitive development that significantly influence the success of subsequent interventions—schooling and training— and outcomes in adulthood. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent months has used various platforms to emphasise the importance of “development for all” and “development of all”. The prime minister recognises that a country aspiring to reach double-digit economic growth rates—and sustain them—must focus on health and nutrition policy, which are the mainstays of a productive workforce. This thinking is amply reflected in the ambitious Ayushman Bharat initiative as well as the National Nutrition Mission.

The SDGs are fundamentally interdependent goals and as such, action is required across various sectors in order to achieve them. Further, several of the goals and their collective externalities have the potential of contributing to India’s economic growth. For India to realise its growth potential, it is crucial to address the building blocks of better health, enhanced nutrition, women’s empowerment, and digital financial inclusion—all of which have the power to unlock the demographic dividend. In this context, the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) explored the various issues related to the implementation of the SDGs in India through a high-level conference on 30 August 2017. This volume builds on the themes discussed at the conference. India’s performance on the SDGs is critical for the world to achieve the goals. Is there an “India model” that can offer lessons to the world? For that, India must deliver on the SDGs in an equitable manner and ensure development for all citizens. India needs to move forward on this agenda by working on the SDGs in an integrated manner.

Meeting health goals has implications on India realising its demographic dividend and its growth potential. Indeed, India stands to lose some US$4.58 trillion every year due to productivity losses related to NCDs and mental illness, among other health problems. Every year, more than 60 lakh people are being pushed below the poverty line by prohibitive health expenses. Public expenditure on health is only 1.4 percent of GDP, and although India’s total health expenditure stands at 4.7 percent of GDP (around INR 5 trillion) – much of it is out-of-pocket expenditure. Similarly, while 20-30 percent of healthcare is sought through the public sector, almost 70 percent of care is sought in the private sector.

The public-private mix of financing and service provision for health in India raises the question: Do solutions also need to be hybrid? The SDGs bring with them the challenge of finding a comprehensive approach – the goals are intrinsically linked, they focus on multi-sectoral action, and they emphasise equity. Can India respond to this challenge by leveraging the entire health system – involving both the public and private sectors –to deliver on national goals?

India’s high economic growth and increasing food production have failed to transform the nutritional status of its population. Malnutrition, in turn, has a deep impact on cognitive development in children. It is estimated that in India, every US$1 invested in nutrition has a return of $36 (or three times more than the global average). Both academic research and India’s experience on the ground show that to address malnutrition, a multi-sectoral approach is required. This translates to prioritising action across poverty alleviation, education, gender empowerment, agriculture, and sanitation. Joint planning to make programmes nutrition-sensitive is key to addressing malnutrition, along with independent implementation and joint monitoring. How can a multi-sectoral approach help solve India’s complex challenges?

Lack of data often hinders effective evaluation of health schemes and reduces the scope for mid-course correction. There is a need to strengthen the national statistical system to allow for goals to be tracked at disaggregated levels. Technology must be harnessed to streamline processes, and there should be an integrated system which allows for analyses to be run across different data sets. Experience of data-use by stakeholders needs to be discussed to identify systemic constraints that hamper evidence-based decisionmaking in the country’s health sector.

Finally, an integrated set of solutions is needed to address complex issues challenging the economy and society. Ensuring progress on gender, health, and nutrition will be key to driving India’s economic growth and development. While India has focused on a set of reforms, those in the area of human development have not received adequate attention. These reforms are critical to India’s growth. India should acknowledge the strong linkages between national goals and act in an integrated manner, leveraging national initiatives like ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ and ‘JAM trinity’ (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) to improve development outcomes.

India for the World; India for India

Shalini Rudra

Solutions to development challenges in a nation with 1.3 billion people should be more than just scalable replications of venerable remedies offered by the wealthy nations. This was the scope of the conference, “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, held in Delhi in August 2017 and attended by stakeholders from government, academia, and development organisations.

The conference was one in a series of events that are being organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) to ponder issues related to the implementation of the SDGs framework in India. The theme of the event was linking the SDGs to India’s growth agenda. The discussion was framed around the criticality of such frameworks in offering solutions to reconcile sustainability with equitable development, focusing on health and allied sectors.

Mr Sunjoy Joshi, ORF Chairman, in his welcome address said that the SDG framework was a robust and comprehensive development objective that represents India’s aspirations. The SDG goals, Mr Joshi said, should remain at the core of responsible policy-making being embraced by India to attain the country’s economic and social goals.

The health-nutrition-sanitation triad of well-being holds the key to a nation’s social, political and economic advancement. Contrasting realities across India—of excellent performance in some attributes and massive failure in others—projects India as a hub of innovating resilient policies that juxtaposes contrasts. For instance—on one hand, India’s economic aid diplomacy has made an impact across Africa and Asia, while on the other, it is home to almost a quarter (195 million) of the world’s undernourished. Even as India steadily gains ground as a global power, it is yet to complete its own domestic transformation and address its fundamental developmental challenges.

Investing in health, nutrition and sanitation, mandated under the SDGs framework, also gives the Asian economies scope to harness the strengths of the largest cohort of the young. By spearheading policies to reap the benefits of a healthy demographic dividend, developing economies like India and China have the potential to make the present century, truly the “Asian century”.

To push the SDGs agenda, the key highlights of policies and programmes in India should be on developing a robust institutional framework supported by the right kind of combinations of skills and financial resources. Second, India needs to find solutions by employing data-driven analytics and monitoring solutions to strategise course correction. Thus, work on the 2030 agenda should begin with an acknowledgement of the interdependence and links between goals, with all complexities intertwined. While developing solutions to mitigate the development challenges, countries like India have had success stories that are worth looking at. Mr. Yuri Afanasiev, the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in India, observed that India has on various occasions exhibited a business model that can be replicated. He referred to the successful implementation of the JAM trinity—Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile penetration—as well as Indian leadership in generic drugs manufacturing and production and distribution of low-cost LED bulbs.

These schemes have defied problems linked to scalability by channeling the least-cost and most innovative methods, and maximising the involvement of government to co-produce sustainable development. India, being the largest functioning democracy with immense scope of industrial growth, can mobilise its strengths to conceptualise participation in an industrial revolution of smart manufacturing. Discussing the cornerstone position of the democratic system, Mr Afanasiev emphasised how due processes in a democratic setup like India work out solutions to problems with a certain degree of sustainability and efficiency. Thus, instead of simply emulating established successful models from elsewhere, India must build on its people’s strengths of innovation and creativity—and call it ‘jugaad’ with a positive spin.

In his address, Dr David Wilson of the World Bank highlighted aspects related to human development in India. He noted that while India is ranked by the World Bank as the world’s third-largest economy by purchasing power, in the World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index, India stands 105th out of 130 countries—behind all the BRICS countries and Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Another paradox is that India has the largest number of tertiary graduates in the world while being home to the largest number of the world’s illiterates. India ranks a low 116th of 157 countries on the SDG Index and given its population share, India has an uphill task ahead to achieve urgent improvements in education, employment and health. In fact, child health and nutrition is of fundamental concern because of its long-term impact on individual well-being and the economy. India has the ability to identify developmental concerns and the capacity to arrive at policy solutions. The case of successful HIV/AIDS prevention programmes through vast community engagement and effective surveillance is an important example of India’s organisational ability and programme management. Here, management and administration of national and state-level AIDS Control Society has played a major role.

Policy-making in India is effective because it builds on existing strengths and works around the weaknesses of institutions and models. Similarly, India formed major national and international partnerships with developmental agencies (such as BMGF, USAID, DfID, and the World Bank) for programme support, technical inputs and capacity building.

To achieve the SDGs, India must display an urgency and adopt a similar model that harnesses the skills at the national, state and local levels. India should expand its focus beyond conventional public-health strategies and devise alternatives that are based on community engagement, accountability, and the recognition of rights. Social and economic inclusion are also necessary to achieve greater impact from various technical public-health solutions. With advances in science and technology, policymakers and programme managers can make use of Big Data, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and other technologies for efficient targeting and delivery of various services.

Communication and outreach have also improved tremendously and should be used effectively in programme design. The eradication of Tuberculosis, for example, is an area where direct benefits of such technological coordination and community engagement can make an immediate impact. The Government of India has allocated an increased share of budget towards TB eradication. However, the constant search for a cost-effective model of healthcare delivery is critical, as sometimes, different solutions are required for varied problems.

Overall, it is important that India continues its focus on development innovations and programme implementation based on dynamic partnerships between government, the private sector, civil society and communities. Further, promotion of citizen engagement, accountability, and rights can further accelerate the approach toward the SDGs. India should embark upon achieving Agenda 2030 with an approach that market failure in the delivery of social goods and services such as health and education is a problem everywhere. But collaborations with the private sector for ideas, delivery expertise, finance, can be leveraged to the advantage of the public sector to boost the human capital agenda underlying the SDGs.

The UHC Trajectory: Ensuring Quality Health Services and Financial Protection to All

Priyanka Shah

Goal three of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires all countries to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. This entails access to quality essential health care services; access to safe, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines; as well as financial risk protection for all at all ages. UHC could, therefore, be regarded as an umbrella goal for health in the new development agenda. The importance of this particular target cannot be overemphasised – it not only transcends all other health-related targets but also draws linkages with the rest of the development goals. The achievement of UHC is critical to the success of the overarching vision of the SDGs, which is “to leave no one behind”. Given the population size and health burden of India, one can also posit that the global accomplishment of the SDGs is contingent on India’s success.

While healthcare in India has witnessed considerable progress over the past decade, the pace of improvement has been slow and the country continues to be plagued by multiple challenges. A Lancet study published in 2017 ranks India 127th in terms of meeting the United Nations health-related SDGs – the lowest among its BRICS peers (Figure 1). It is clear, therefore, that India’s fast economic growth has failed so far to translate to significant progress in the health sector. To ensure sustained growth levels, the country requires a strong and healthy workforce – this is possible only when citizens are protected against health-related financial risks and can access quality health services. If India is serious about goal three—as it should be, given that health is a building block for the country’s growth and development—it needs to address the various obstacles to the accomplishment of UHC.

Figure 1: Performance on the Health-related SDG index among BRICS countries

First, it is imperative to look at UHC through a gender lens. This does not mean a discussion on women’s health alone, but an approach to UHC that is inclusive in nature and attends to the needs of men and women. What is needed is a shift in narrative: to recognise that the onus of a woman and child’s health does not fall on women alone but on the entire society. Addressing such issues requires going beyond health and delving into challenges that arise from societal attitudes, and gender discrimination when it comes to nutrition, education and sanitation. Given the patriarchal nature of Indian society, gender equity in health would need approaches that are much more women-centric and supportive of their multiple roles. These social determinants and root causes should be recognised while framing policies to extend UHC in the country.

Next, achieving UHC requires long-term, high-level political commitment. This, unfortunately, has been absent in the Indian context. At a macro level, the government spends a measly proportion (1.18 percent) of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health – among the lowest globally. The long-awaited National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 proposed to increase public health spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025. This is disappointing, to say the least, given that eight years from now India intends to continue spending well below the current world average of 5.99 percent. Together with low public sector investments in health, the system also suffers from poor coordination caused by the presence of a vast number of vertical health programmes (many of which deal with similar issues) and several institutions within the health department that must work together if they are to deliver anything worthwhile. This often leads to bureaucratic apathy and inertia, which tends to slow down delivery of healthcare services and hampers the smooth functioning of the healthcare system.

Finally, given that the private sector is the largest provider of healthcare services in the country, it would be impossible to achieve the 2030 goals without its active involvement. The government, however, should keep the lead as no country has built a successful health system devoid of a central authority. The challenge is in defining the role that the government wants the private sector to play in the provision of healthcare and how it can ensure that funds are spent efficiently. One way to do this would be through price control, as already done with stents. This is an effective tool to extend quality health services at affordable prices. Other such mechanisms need to be explored and implemented to maintain a balanced participation from the private sector.

Way Forward

While it may be tempting to follow the path that other countries have embarked upon to achieve UHC, it is important to remember that India has its own unique challenges and therefore requires context-specific solutions. Within the country, too, certain states are performing exceptionally and so rather than looking outside for lessons, India should look inwards and take lessons from the successes and failures of its own states.

Central to the UHC theme are access, affordability and quality. Given the crucial role of the private sector in the healthcare delivery system, India needs to begin seriously finding an ideal mix of public-private investments. It would also help to clearly define and distinguish the purview of public and private sectors within the health system. The government should leverage private sector resources to fill in the healthcare delivery gaps. Resource allocation is a critical decision that also needs to be taken. Speaking at a high-level consultation organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr. C.K. Mishra, Health Secretary, stated that majority of resources should be directed towards “primary healthcare, to preventive and promotive health. It does not make sense to go on increasing hospital beds and simultaneously go on increasing the number of patients in the country. Therefore, all policies must converge on getting investment into primary healthcare”. In fact, the NHP released this year calls for two-thirds of health resources to flow into the primary health sector.

Should investments flow from public or private sectors, and how much? Where should resources be allocated? How can underlying socio-economic issues causing gender inequities be addressed? How can government accountability and transparency be maintained to ensure political commitment for UHC? Often, asking the right questions is the key to finding solutions. In order to redesign the Indian healthcare system so as to make it conducive to UHC, India needs to first recognise its failures. Perhaps it is time for a dose of realism – identifying gaps and flaws will only help find viable solutions and lead to informed policy-making.

Addressing Malnutrition through a Multi-Sectoral Approach: The Unfinished Agenda and Emerging Challenges

Malancha Chakrabarty

India has won significant battles against malnutrition. Unlike a few decades ago, instances of severe malnutrition such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are now rare. Latest figures from the National Family Health Survey revealed that there has been a ten percentage-point decline in stunting from about 48 percent in 2005-06 to 38.4 percent in 2015-16. However, national figures mask regional variations. On the one hand, there are states like Kerala and Goa which have a low burden of undernutrition. On the other hand, there are states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh which have a high incidence of undernutrition. Within the states, there is also considerable variation. For example, despite Odisha having stunting levels of 34.1 percent (also known as ‘high prevalence’) certain districts such as Cuttack (15.3 percent) and Puri (16.1 percent) are among the top 10 ‘low stunting level’ districts in the country. Similarly, in Karnataka, districts like Mandya have stunting rates as low as 18.6 percent while others such as Koppal have levels as high as 55.8 percent. Overall, however, India’s record in addressing undernutrition has been much poorer when compared to other countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Thus, the war against undernutrition is hardly over and meeting the World Health Assembly targets will be an uphill task for India. Moreover, the problem of undernutrition in India coexists with the problem of overweight and obesity and associated non-communicable diseases for a small, affluent section of the population.

The panellists at the ORF-BMGF conference agreed that India has a plethora of policies that address almost all aspects of the undernutrition problem but the implementation of those policies has been uneven. According to Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, the fundamental flaw in India’s approach has been its “food-centric” understanding of undernutrition. The discourse on undernutrition has largely ignored the social determinants of undernutrition; in particular, the role of women has been underappreciated. Gains in nutrition will be much faster with a more “woman-centric” approach towards tackling undernutrition because it is not food but birth which determines whether a child will be stunted or not. In Menon’s words, “the biggest risk factor for being stunted is who you are born to”. A highly significant burden of stunting is borne by the fact that children in India are born to mothers who are also stunted, uneducated, and not empowered enough to take care of their children. According to Menon, women-centric factors account for a bulk of the difference between high and low stunting rates in India’s states. Therefore, nutrition policies must try to address the key determinants of undernutrition such as women’s body mass index, women’s education, early marriage, and access to ante-natal care.

The panel observed that a multi-sectoral approach towards addressing nutrition is the need of the hour because nutrition does not belong to a single ministry. In fact, narrow departmentalism has been a critical constraint in the case of India. Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development stressed that a whole range of initiatives, better sanitation, clean drinking water, and trained rural medical practitioners, were required to achieve better nutrition in rural areas. Nutrition outcomes tend to be better in areas where public investments have also been made in primary education and health centres, along with nutrition interventions. He gave the example of China where there was a dramatic reduction in child undernutrition and infant mortality during the period 1949-1979—a number of initiatives were behind such success. First, the green tea kettle in school enforced the habit of making children drink boiled water. Public health facilities were improved through immunisation against diseases and training of traditional doctors. Lessons must also be learnt from better-performing states and districts of India. Sinha also underscored the role that communities play in improving the nutritional status of the population by highlighting the successes of women’s self-help groups in states such as Tamil Nadu.

Saumya Swaminathan, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research, emphasised the need for dietary diversity and absorption of nutrients, as over half of the Indian population is deficient in micronutrients. This is mainly because of a cereal-based diet. Carbohydrates account for over 80 percent of the diet along with small portions of fat. The bulk of the population is completely deficient in proteins and micronutrients. However, fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and minerals are beyond the reach of most of the people in India who are poor. Access to a healthy diet that is rich in essential nutrients is necessary but not sufficient for better nutrition if the body is not able to absorb the nutrients. Often, young children, even from high-income households, get colonised by infections due to exposure to contaminated air and water.

The panel made the following recommendations. First, nutrition policies must take into account the role of social factors, particularly gender inequality. It will be next to impossible to address the challenge of undernutrition without addressing the key issues of early marriage, lack of control over child birth, and poor health of mothers. Most interventions must be targeted to two age groups: children between 0-1,000 days and adolescent girls. This is so because the first 1,000 days are crucial for the baby. Undernutrition during this period can have profound implications on the development of the child into a healthy adult. Similarly, it is important to target adolescent girls because they are likely to be the future mothers. Second, to address the issue of diabetes and micronutrient-deficiency, it is important to invest in improving nutrition literacy in India. Third, the basket under the public distribution system must be widened to include pulses, and processed fruits and vegetables to ensure dietary diversity. Last, linking agriculture to nutrition is critical. Farmers must be encouraged to produce nutritious crops and vegetable not only for the market but also for household consumption.



Equity through Accountability in the Health Sector: Towards UHC in India

Oommen C Kurian

Multi-sectoral convergence and integrated solutions considering regional specificities are needed in the health sector. To facilitate effective implementation in a situation of wide district-level disparities even within states, a performance-based categorisation of districts similar to what Karnataka has tried will be immensely useful. Availability and use of regular, good quality health data thus becomes a policy imperative. “Accelerating Growth and Development in the SDG Era”, the panel discussion organised in August 2017 by ORF and BMGF, explored issues of data in health and nutrition towards the SDGs.

Better data is needed for making a robust case for more state intervention in sectors like health and nutrition, and for harnessing the strengths of the well-entrenched private sector to achieve public health goals. In May 2016, the Health Secretaries of the States and Union Territories of India gathered in the capital and issued “The Delhi Commitment on Sustainable Development Goals for Health”. Among other measures, the document called for greater investments in health data collection, analysis and research. Given that the success of global SDGs over the next 15 years will largely depend on India’s performance, it is important to measure progress closely and ensure mid-course corrections when needed.

Real-time data flow will also have a major role to play in breaking the thick wall of suspicion that exists between the private and the public health sectors in India, given the inevitability of private sector engagement. After all, 70 percent of the population depends on the private sector for care. Data flow in itself can be a confidence building measure. High-quality data will be essential to ensure that the country’s health programmes hurdle the last mile. Huge unused bed strength in the private sector and long waiting lines in the public sector co-exist in India in secondary and tertiary healthcare, and a robust information infrastructure is a necessary condition for any solution that reconciles issues of financial and physical access using government’s bargaining power.

India has covered some ground in terms of streamlining its public-sector health information infrastructure. At present, as Graph 1 shows, 676 out of the 700 Indian districts regularly report public facility-level data to the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). Ninety-seven percent of Sub Centres, 94 percent of Primary Health Centres, and 85 percent of Community Health Centres submit regular health data. The quality of the HMIS data has improved over time, and some important information on improvements in equitable distribution of health infrastructure has become available.

Graph 1: HMIS Data Reporting from Public Hospitals: All India.

Over the last decade, a 65-percent increase in public health infrastructure in Adivasi areas was recorded, compared to the much lower 10-percent increase in non-Adivasi areas. Similarly, the gap in human resource availability in the public sector between Adivasi and non-Adivasi areas has come down in the last ten years from 21 percent to three percent. It is also known that immunisation coverage is improving rapidly for Adivasi areas in states like Odisha and Chhattisgarh, at a much higher rate than the respective state averages. Gender gap in under-5 mortality rate too, is narrowing down, noted Mr Manoj Jhalani, Additional Secretary & Mission Director, NHM, during the ORF-BMGF event.

The National Health Mission (NHM) is using data from diverse sources including HMIS to zero down on geographies and populations that need more attention, and high-priority districts thus identified within Empowered Action Group (EAG) states already receive per capita 1.3 times more funds than other districts. Quality and reliability of the HMIS data still remains a problem despite improvements; and on some parameters, the difference between HMIS estimate and a third-party survey estimate can be reportedly as wide as 50 percent. Underutilisation of other existing datasets like National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) surveys remain a concern too.

India has not fully tapped into the potential that Information Technology (IT) offers to integrate the health information systems in the country. Notification of EHR standards was done to facilitate interoperability. The NHP 2017 has suggested that a national digital health authority will be responsible for developing common standards, notifying them, and to ensuring that there is buy-in from stakeholders. This is important, as the private sector, which provides care for almost 70 percent of the population is still mostly outside the purview of the national health information system. To overcome this binding constraint, a National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) is currently being rolled out.

Much of the health policy debate in India typically happens post-facto: not during or before decisionmaking. To enable focus on using data, resolution of structural issues on both supply and demand sides are required. Given the complexity of the systems and the multiple stakeholders involved, there is a need for transparency in the datasets behind policy decisions for the sake of open and democratic decisionmaking. A strong digital architecture will help address both the supply as well as demand level concerns.

The government is doing considerable work around e-Health information systems, according to Mr Ashish Sharma, Partner, Strategy&. The digital architecture will need to be open and inclusive so that the private sector participates voluntarily. In addition, it needs to be universally adoptable so that even if different stakeholders build components individually, these are built consistently and uniformly across the overall system.

The new health information infrastructure will also have to find ways of overcoming the inter-sectoral, inter-ministerial incoherence and inter-organisational incoherence in terms of numbers. Prof. Aasha Kapur Mehta of IIPA, New Delhi pointed out that, for example, while NITI Aayog’s three-year action agenda seeks to reduce MMR to 120 per 1 lakh live birth by 2020, the National Health Policy 2017 aims to decrease the MMR to 100 per 1 lakh live births by 2020. Therefore, India has two different targets for the same year for MMR. The Indian Statistical Service, which forms the backbone of the National Statistical System, needs to be reformed and overhauled, starting with the vital registration system.

The trained personnel who collect data have been one of the first to bear the brunt whenever there is a cut-back, and over time, this has had an impact on the quality of the data collected, particularly morbidity data. The administrative data on morbidity exists in hospitals, but are never compiled or analysed. As a votary of the open data initiative, India needs to find ways of organising existing data in the system in a manner that every stakeholder finds useful. Improved levels of standardisation at the point of data collection will facilitate data use, and policy discussions informed by relevant numbers.

India has a great opportunity: it has the resources, owing to the consistently high growth rate, freeing up for improving healthcare coverage for its population. Giving priority to health is an area where perhaps India can learn from China, according to Dr David Wilson, Global Lead for Decision & Delivery Science of the World Bank. The Chinese government had concluded that catastrophic health spending forced so many Chinese to save at such disproportionately high rates, to an extent that they could not consume and contribute to the rebalancing of China’s economy towards domestic consumption-led growth. China had a real economic reason to invest in universal health coverage, apart from equity. Given that India has a considerable proportion of its population falling under the poverty line every year because of healthcare spending, public health spending in India can be an investment for the future.

To make that investment meaningful, high-quality data is inevitable. India is planning to undertake an ambitious step towards UHC through the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS), which will reportedly cover 70 percent of the Indian population. Ensuring a seamless transition from the existing RSBY to the proposed NHPS will require insights from the analysis of RSBY scheme data as well as survey data on impact. It is time for India to drop the much-discussed apprehension to programme evaluations and to liberate data being collected at institutions and by schemes including the RSBY data to facilitate independent evaluations.

Human Capital in the Knowledge Age: Investing in India’s Billion-Person Data Set

Samir Saran

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will prompt a tectonic shift in the way the world has traditionally organised economies. The Knowledge Age is giving way to a new barometer of economic aptitude – one that is predicated on possession of data and information, rather than the conventional advantages of cheap labour, or even coal and petroleum. This is because the ability of modern-day innovations, such as mobile supercomputing and machine learning, to enhance the way we live, work and exist is contingent on the consumption of data. In a context where data is the key to economic success, India is uniquely positioned to distinguish itself as a formidable actor. While data is regularly exchanged among developers, advertisers and consumers for services, its value is linked to the capabilities of the population it describes.

India is home to a young, billion-person community. Correspondingly, the country has the potential to access and develop a billion-point (1.3 billion to be precise) data set. Access to data of that scale is uncommon and generally monopolised by a handful of private stakeholders. In the United States, for example, the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) source and analyse the data of billions of diverse users on a daily basis. Similarly, in China, the BAT conglomerate (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) dominate the data collection market of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. India is the only country that has integrated data into its public infrastructure – the Aadhaar programme enables every resident of India to register for a unique biometric identification. With 1.18 billion Aadhaar enrollments, India is the largest country in the world with a unique digital identity.

The challenge for India, however, is to streamline systems to cultivate a data set that is educated, healthy and sustainable so that both the capacity of Indian citizens and the corresponding value of their data are strengthened. This re-conceptualisation of individuals essentially overturns India’s approach to human capital investment itself – where such investment is no longer viewed as an altruistic, social welfare enterprise, but instead as an economic imperative that is necessary to sustain the country’s rapidly expanding economy. Technology-based innovation has proved to be a successful social model in the past, and it can certainly be a remedy for the pervasive gap in services and skills that exists in Indian society today. If India is able to bridge this gap, it has the chance to possess a nearly unparalleled source of human capital and data that will catalyse the country’s growth for the foreseeable future.

Commodifying Human Capital

The state of the human will define the state of the economy. To reflect this reality, India will need to reshape its understanding of social services and investment. For nearly 50 years following independence, India’s economy was largely insulated. This meant that for years there was minimal external competition on its products, and in turn, on the quality of its labour force. Investments in health, education and skilling were therefore considered parallel social initiatives and rarely featured in the country’s growth strategies, if at all.

Today, however, in a global environment increasingly dependent on data, human capital investment serves both an economic and a social purpose. Simply put, human development and economic growth should be viewed as interdependent measures. To reflect this reality, India must turn towards technology-based solutions to develop a healthy and well-educated society and capitalise on its data set.

A Technology-Driven Framework for Investment

The digital platform presents India the opportunity to approach investment in human capital as a pragmatic, value-creating scheme that improves human knowledge and capacity. Where traditional social institutions have struggled, India’s expansive digital economy can assume an efficient and cost-effective service-delivery mandate. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme is a classic example of this potential. In an effort to streamline the way subsidy benefits were handed out, the government cut out the middleman and began depositing subsidies directly into eligible citizens’ bank accounts. The result? An overwhelming decrease in subsidy scams, duplication and service-delays, which also saved the government some INR 50,000 crore.

Digital innovation for the bottom of the pyramid changes the approach to public goods delivery altogether – from a supply-driven mechanism to a more effective demand-driven one. In public institutions, if app-based programmes provided education and health coupons directly to beneficiaries instead of the institutions themselves, schools and hospitals would be forced to compete for customers, at least in urban and peri-urban settings. It would also allow communities to establish self-arranged solutions and mitigate governance or accessibility issues.

Investment through digital innovation can also ensure a greater level of oversight at the state and local level. Through decentralised programmes, customised by state and locality, digital applications can source baseline data regarding health and education indicators, starting with civil registration and vital statistics. This initiative would create a real-time monitoring system of states’ progress in human development. A subsequent system could develop based off of this data that incentivises or rewards states that successfully improve their human development capacities.

Similar to how governments invested in the steam engine during the First Industrial Revolution or in financial systems during the rise of Wall Street, in this age, the Indian government can find value through investment in the health and education of its growing labour force. As the investments in social services materialise, India’s human development capacity will expand, leading to more qualified participants in the labour market and a more sophisticated set of available data. For India, in the Knowledge Age, its prospects for economic growth and power will be inextricably tied to innovations in technology, data and human capital investment.

‘Faces of the SDGs’ highlights passionate individuals from the produce sector with their own personal Sustainable Development Goal, as part of the Netherlands-based company’s efforts to encourage greater uptake of the SDG challenge throughout the supply chain.

During the Fruit Logistica and Biofach trade fairs in February, Eosta shot the first of a series of portraits of produce professionals with specially-designed SDG cubes; each giving participants the option to choose their preferred goal from a total of 17.

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals framework was adopted by all member countries of the UN, with the aim of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030.

Although former secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged governments to “take the lead with decisive steps,” at the same time he called on businesses to “provide essential solutions and resources that put our world on a more sustainable path”.

Michaël Wilde, sustainability & communications manager at Eosta, said: “We want to take the SDGs out of the theoretical policy space and move them firmly into the commercial environment where economy meets ecology. We hope to create more awareness for these goals both within and outside the produce sector.

“Giving people the possibility to choose their most important goal out of the 17 takes them out of their role as a buyer, farmer or trader,"" he added. ""It creates room for a different kind of conversation about the future of our planet and everyone’s personal role in working towards a cleaner and fairer world.""

Eosta is one of the first companies in the fresh food industry to have actively incorporated SDGs into its current business model. The UN goals have been thoroughly studied and connected to the indicators of the company’s ‘Sustainability Flower,’ an assessment and transparency model developed and used by the company.



The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals form part of the organisation’s sustainable development agenda, with each goal comprising targets to be achieved over a 15-year period.

Goal 12 – ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns – is of particular relevance to the global fresh produce sector. However, Eosta estimates that close to ten further Sustainable Development Goals would be impacted positively if the sector began farm more responsibly.","Eosta, the organic fruit and vegetable marketer and campaigner for fairer practices in agriculture, has announced the launch of the ‘Faces of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)’ campaign; an initiative aimed at raising awareness of UN SDGs across the fresh produce sector.

The set of 27 Policy Briefs on SDG 7 and interlinkages with other SDGs includes a new Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action. The Global Agenda is intended to serve as roadmap towards achieving universal energy access by 2030 and maximizing its positive impact on other SDGs.

The launch event took place on 18 April 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The multi-stakeholder SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group was convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) to support the review of SDG 7 at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2018. The Advisory Group is comprised of representatives of 50 organizations, including 21 from the UN system, as well governments, other international organizations and stakeholders.

The proposed Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action aims to catalyze time-bound and measurable actions, grouped into four interlinked categories:

Advancing SDG 7 implementation through: prioritizing clean-cooking solutions; closing the electricity access gap; accelerating the pace of transition towards renewable energy; scaling up investments in energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy; doubling global financing for SDG 7; scaling up capacity-building and education; enhancing innovation; and investing in data collection systems and data analysis.

Accelerating the transformation towards a sustainable and inclusive future by: promoting transformative investments; transforming human behavior from energy-intensive lifestyles to more sustainable patterns; strengthening decision-making through improvements in energy data collection, indicators and monitoring; and harnessing the power of all stakeholders to drive change.

Marcel Alers, UN Development Programme (UNDP), introduced the policy brief on financing SDG 7. He noted that there is a big financing gap for universal access to clean fuels, with current annual investment at US$240 million, versus annual funding needs of US$4.4 billion to 2030. He cautioned that investment is not spread equally, with developed and middle-income countries being able to access finance while many developing countries are currently left out. He emphasized that annual global financing for SDG 7 needs to double, from the current level of US$500 billion to US$1 to 1.2 trillion per year by 2030. He stressed that private finance is central to meeting SDG 7.

Noting that around 90% of the population is at risk of heart and lung disease due to air pollution exposure caused by inefficient use of energy, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO), presented the policy brief on energy and health. She announced that on 2 May WHO will launch new statistics on air pollution. She also underscored that all SDG 7 targets are critical enablers for universal health coverage and will advance progress towards achievement of SDG 3 (health).

Presenting the brief on energy and education (SDG 4), Rakshya Rajyashwori Thapa, UN International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said 300 million children are affected by the lack of energy in schools, 60% of which are girls. She noted that youth literacy levels are lower in countries with electrification rates below 80%, adding that efforts to electrify schools have lagged behind. She explained that the publication recommends, inter alia, adopting policies that incentivize and prioritize investment in energy access in the education sector, and catalyzing support through stakeholder engagement, public advocacy and outreach to influence decision makers.

Noting that more than 1 billion people lack access to electricity and more than 3 billion lack access to clean cooking, with women bearing the greatest burden of this energy poverty, Sheila Oparaocha, Executive Director, ENERGIA, presented the document on energy and gender (SDG 5). She said the publication recommends, inter alia: establishing gender responsive global and national energy sector policies; promoting and investing more in clean cooking technologies; and reducing barriers in the energy industry for women, while also increasing their representation in national and global energy bodies.

Rabia Ferroukhi, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), spoke about the role of SDG 7 in achieving SDG 8 (decent jobs and economic growth). She noted that renewable energy deployment has led to growing employment, and predicted that this trend will accelerate. She explained that the policy brief on energy and jobs recommends, inter alia: designing active labor market policies to respond to evolving market needs; coordinating education and training policies with the needs of the renewable energy sector; ensuring that jobs are decent; and undertaking measures to minimize disruptions in the energy transition through social protection measures and retraining efforts.

Sheila Watson, FIA Foundation, presented the policy brief on energy and transport (related to SDG 11). She explained that transport is the single largest energy user in many developed countries, while transport energy demand has been rising faster than in any other sector. She noted that energy consumption in the transport sector will continue to grow predominantly in developing countries. To respond to these trends, she said the publication recommends, inter alia:

implementing fuel economy policies to improve the efficiency of light and heavy duty vehicles and promoting electric and zero emission vehicles;

improving the efficiency of trucks, including fuel economy standards, and ‘green freight’ initiatives, including consolidated logistics;

phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies;

investing in safe walking and cycling infrastructure;

addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport; and

accelerating research in efficient batteries and energy storage systems.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative, UN Office of the High Representative of Least Developed Countries (UN-OHRLLS), said we must ensure that the most vulnerable will not be left behind. She identified two areas of action as essential: capacity building for countries on policy and project design for SDG 7; and facilitating access to finance for the most vulnerable countries. She added that political leadership and national strategies are essential for the achievement of SDG 7.

In the ensuing discussion, Denmark suggested reflecting this approach to SDG 7 in the HLPF Ministerial Declaration, and to highlighting at next year’s HLPF under the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that SDG 7 is essential to achieving all the other SDGs. Supported by Pakistan, she emphasized the need to focus on SDG 7 also as part of the Climate Summit to take place in September 2019 in New York, US. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) underscored the need for a conversation about rebalancing budgets to support sustainable energy. Other stakeholders focused on the need for rights-based approaches to partnerships that involve indigenous communities and to ensure inclusive benefits for them.

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The project has reached around 30,000 people.

UNFG also hosts an annual youth event, which focuses on urban agriculture, resilience, community engagement and food security, and aims to ensure that the voices of youth are heard in implementation of the SDGs. In northern summer 2018, UNFG will launch a partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) to showcase equipment used by small-scale farmers in the field, highlighting the importance of technological innovation to promote food security. UNFG also partners with the NYC GreenThumb Programme, Brooklyn Grange, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), among others.

The event took place on 22 April 2018, at the Westin Hotel Grand Central in New York, US, in advance of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum). The Fair was organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), in collaboration with the UN Global Compact, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Addressing lessons learned about investment, Cristina Duarte, Cabo Verde’s Former Minister of Finances, Planning and Public Administration, noted that building institutions and regulatory systems conducive to investment can take 10-15 years, and it requires policy coherence and integration. Admasu Nebebe, Ethiopia’s State Minister of Finance and Economic Cooperation, spoke about the importance of investing in human development, noting that Ethiopia is currently investing 25% of its national budget in education. He observed that Ethiopia is the country with the third-largest public investment in infrastructure, which he said is also essential for attracting private investment.

The acting mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, said the local government has collaborated with the national bank of Colombia to develop a strategy to target extreme poverty eradication and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Sergio Londoño Zurek, who is also the Director General of the Presidential Cooperation Agency (APC-Colombia), also reported that 55,000 people live in extreme poverty in his city.

Anne Simpson, California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), observed that the SDGs bring benefits for pension funds because they address risks. She said that after the 2008 financial crisis, CalPERS decided to rethink investment in terms of long-term value creation, and concluded that it needs to manage three types of capital: financial; human; and natural. As these three types of capital are also addressed by the SDGs, she said, the Goals are great for the sustainable investments that funds must harness in order to pay pensions.

Simpson moderated a series of presentations on successful PPPs in Kenya, Nigeria and Brazil. Ormat Olkaria III (Kenya) – the first privately funded and developed geothermal plant in Africa – reflects the importance of successful risk allocation between the private sector and public sector in achieving efficiency. The project was funded through two separate rounds of equity and debt financing, resulting in profits for the private investor and a decrease in energy costs for consumers.

Among the ingredients that led to the project’s success, Paul Mbuthi, Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, noted the government’s focus on removing barriers to investment such as tariffs, as well as shouldering the high costs of the first explorations. Nachman Isaac, Ormat, explained what makes projects bankable and thus prone to success: long-term power purchase agreements; strong sovereign support, including support letters from the government; strong existing provisions that guarantee the recovery of a sufficient part of the investment; international arbitration; stable and predictable regulatory frameworks; and risk sharing.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) – OLAM Farmers Partnership (Nigeria) provides smallholder rice farmers with access to a profitable and reliable market, and OLAM with a consistent source of high quality produce. The project leverages multilateral financing from IFAD to attract funding from a large multinational firm (OLAM) to provide a consistent source of income to small-scale farmers, which, in turn, should lead to increased capital investment by the small-scale farmers. Odoemena Benjamin, IFAD, said multilateral agencies can help governments catalyze the necessary resources for projects aligned with national needs and priorities.

The Renewable Energy Market and Pacific Hydro Wind Farms (Brazil) was financed by a national development bank, and shows that private infrastructure investment can be successful even without financing and/or guarantees from international lenders. Based on the success of this project, Pacific Hydro is currently pursuing several much larger renewable energy projects in Brazil, illustrating how smaller investments can spur larger-scale, long-term investments.

The panel discussions were followed by thematic parallel working groups on ‘Large-scale, Capital- intensive Infrastructure,’ ‘New Investment Opportunities in Agriculture,’ and ‘Innovative Financial Instruments to support the SDGs.’

The agreement was announced at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of the GEF-7 replenishment.

The meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 April 2018. The GEF-7 replenishment will formally conclude during the GEF Assembly, which will convene from 27-28 June 2018, in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

The talks for GEF-7 included a review of the ‘Sixth Overall Performance Study of the GEF’ (OPS6), which notes that the GEF occupies a unique space in the global environmental financing architecture because of its broad focus and role as a financial mechanism for environmental conventions. Participants also considered programming directions during GEF-7 (FY19-FY22), and recommended updates to the STAR allocation methodology, including measures to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable GEF-recipient countries, among others.

The talks for GEF-7 were called for in October 2016, at the 51st meeting of the GEF Council, which requested the Trustee, in cooperation with the Secretariat, to initiate the discussions. Subsequently, meetings took place in Paris, France (28-30 March 2017), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (3-5 October 2017), Brasília, Brazil (23-25 January 2018) and Stockholm, Sweden (25 April 2018). Participants in the negotiations included: existing and potential Contributing Participants; representatives from non-donor recipient countries representing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean; NGO/CSO representatives from a donor country-based NGO/CSO and a recipient country; representatives of the private sector; and representatives of GEF Agencies and the conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism.

The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol. The GEF also funds activities in the areas of sustainable forest management, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.

Previously, the GEF Trust Fund was replenished by US$2.75 billion (GEF-1), US$3 billion (GEF-2), US$3.13 billion (GEF-3), US$3.13 billion (GEF-4), US$4.34 billion (GEF-5) and US$4.43 billion (GEF-6).

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

Its outcomes will serve as a contribution to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF).

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum convened from 9-12 April 2018, in Indore, India. Its outcomes include: a dialogue among Asian mayors and city authorities on how the 3Rs and resource efficiency can make their cities sustainable; a declaration by cities; the launch of a report on the state of 3Rs in the region; and awards recognizing Indian recipients for their contributions to the 3Rs in their country.

The Eighth Forum’s theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3R and Resource Efficiency – A 21st Century Vision for Asia – Pacific Communities,’ focused on how the 3Rs, resource efficiency, and promoting the principles of a circular economy can contribute to achieving the targets of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). For example, a plenary session devoted to water noted how street cleaning, improved waste management infrastructure and practices, no open defecation, and basic sanitation services can reduce water pollution and water scarcity, improve the provision of clean drinking water, and reduce vector- and water-borne diseases, as well as improve resilience to natural disasters.

A plenary session on air examined how cleaner streets and the prevention of open trash burning reduces asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Participants also discussed ways to switch from the common practice in Asia of burning agricultural wastes such as rice straw, which reduces air quality, to recycling the wastes to produce bio-ethanol for use as fuel and chemical inputs.

Other plenary sessions addressed: how 3R principles and strategies can contribute to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems from land-based activities, particularly marine litter; how to “green” small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and get them involved in the circular economy; 3Rs technologies appropriate for addressing special waste issues, such as plastics, e-waste and medical wastes; and financing 3R infrastructure and programs. A parallel event examined strategies for addressing marine litter in the South Asia region.

During the Forum, a parallel Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue convened on the theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3Rs and Resource Efficiency,’ co-chaired by the mayor and commissioner of the host city of Indore, respectively, Malini Laxman Singh Gaur and Manish Singh. The Dialogue discussed the contribution of the 3Rs to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Guar and Singh discussed Indore’s efforts to meet the seven targets of SDG 11 before the 2030 deadline, including efforts on housing, transport, participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning, municipal waste management, green and clean public spaces, and disaster and climate resilience. Special sessions of the Mayors’ Policy Dialogue addressed waste challenges specific to Asian cities such as plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical wastes.

The Mayors’ Policy Dialogue concluded with the signing of the ‘Indore 3R Declaration on Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air in Cities’ by mayors and city authorities of 37 Asian cities. The declaration calls for collective efforts on 3R and resource efficiency and the signatory cities pledge to, inter alia:

Accelerate holistic waste management;

Implement local-level actions to make cities clean, safe, smart, resilient, resource efficient, inclusive and sustainable;

Partner with civil society organizations (CSOs), including integration of the informal recycling sector with the formal waste management chain;

Work towards a complete ban on the use of plastics in eco-sensitive or eco-fragile areas, including in tourist areas close to oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;

Work for wastewater treatment and reuse; and

Focus on effective management of special waste streams such as micro-plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical waste.

Two more cities signed the Declaration before the close of the Forum, and it remains open to signature by other Asian cities through 2030.

The Forum also launched a report titled, ‘State of the 3Rs in Asia and the Pacific.’ Mandated by the sixth Forum in 2015, the report is envisioned as a regular assessment of Forum member State progress towards achieving the commitments in the Ha Noi 3R Declaration (2013-2023) adopted at the fourth meeting held in 2013 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The 2018 report makes a series of recommendations, including: highlighting 3Rs as part of the global sustainability agenda, particularly SDG 12; continued prioritization of resource productivity, waste prevention and reduction activities; ensuring comparable and credible data across countries in Asia and the Pacific; and giving greater attention to e-waste, marine litter and coastal plastic waste, micro-plastics, food waste and food loss issues in the region.

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum was organized by the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ), and India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was attended by delegates from 45 countries, including government representatives of 28 Forum participating countries.

Created by the East Asia Environment Ministers Meeting in 2008 based on a proposal by Japan, the Forum is intended as a framework for high-level policy dialogue on the 3Rs among central and local governments, international organizations, aid agencies, research bodies, NGOs and the private sector. As of the Fifth Forum held in Surabaya, Indonesia, the platform was extended to include participation by Pacific nations, particularly the Pacific small island developing States (P-SIDS).

65,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/canadian-audit-report-highlights-need-for-stronger-federal-leadership-for-sdg-implementation/,"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Canadian Audit Report Highlights Need for Stronger Federal Leadership for SDG Implementation,"24 April 2018: The Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development of Canada’s Office of the General Auditor has released a report on Canada’s preparedness to implement the SDGs. The audit concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs because, at the end of the audit, no governance structure, implementation plan or system to measure, monitor and report progress were in place.

To implement the SDGs domestically, national governments must not only take direct action, but also support implementation by other actors including cities, local communities, business and civil society organization, and develop a system to measure, monitor and report on progress. To assess – or audit – whether national governments are taking the necessary steps to fulfill these responsibilities, the International Organization of Supreme Audit Organizations (INTOSAI) developed a framework, and more than 80 audit organizations committed to performing such assessments. The audit for Canada based on the INTOSAI framework was presented by Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development Julie Gelfand, who is part of Canada’s office of the Auditor General.

The audit report titled, ‘Canada’s Preparedness to Implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,’ concludes that the Canadian federal government is not adequately prepared to implement the SDGs. According to the report, at the end of the audit period in November 2017, no governance structure for implementation or implementation plan existed, only limited national consultations and engagements had occurred, and no system to measure, monitor and report on national progress was in place. However, the report notes that Canada’s federal budget, published after the audit concluded, provides for the establishment of an SDG Unit to support coordination of SDG implementation, and support for Statistics Canada to expand monitoring and reporting activities relating to SDG implementation.

On federal leadership, the report recommends:

Establishing a federal governance structure that clearly articulates roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of other responsible and accountable federal organizations;

Developing an inclusive communications plan and engagement strategy to raise awareness of the SDGs, and consult and engage other levels of government and Canadians, including measures to report the results of consultations and take them into account when establishing national targets; and

Establishing and communicating an implementation plan to achieve national targets and the SDGs in Canada, including: clearly defined and attributed accountabilities for involved federal organizations; provisions for effective cooperation with other levels of government and with relevant stakeholders; clear national targets; coherent actions, which will collectively achieve the national targets; and a system for measuring results and for monitoring and reporting national progress in SDG implementation.

The report further recommends that lead federal organizations and departments should analyze the extent to which their policies and programmes could contribute to SDG implementation in Canada, in order to set realistic targets and identify policy and programme gaps.

In ‘The Commissioner’s Perspective’ published by the Office of the Auditor General, Julie Gelfand concludes that three years after Canada committed to implementing the 2030 Agenda the audit shows that “Canada has yet to complete some of the fundamentals—such as establishing a governance structure and plan—to position itself to deliver on this international commitment.”

The report on Canada’s readiness to implement the SDGs is the first of a series of national audits in different countries expected to be released in the coming months. In early 2018, the government of the Netherlands released a report, also aligned with INTOSAI’s framework, finding that the Government needs to focus more on the importance of policy coordination and cooperation between central and local governments, the connection between the SDGs and the national budgetary cycle, and the need to better include SDGs and sustainable development in general in primary and secondary education.

Canada is expected to present its first Voluntary National Review on progress on SDG implementation at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), taking place in July. To prepare that report and strengthen SDG implementation, Global Affairs Canada recently launched a portal for consultations and laid out its plan for SDG implementation.

Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This summary provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received from Parties regarding the three questions.

Inputs that were submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Party submissions thus far include those from Australia, China, Ethiopia, the EU, Fiji, Indonesia, Norway, Palestine, Saint Lucia for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group. Input has also been provided by Switzerland, Costa Rica, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden, supported by Monaco.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), many of the submissions concede that current emission trajectories and policies are at odds with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The CARICOM submission reiterates support for the global average temperature rise to remain below 1.5°C, given that climate change impacts are already being experienced in the region with lower warming levels. It laments that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not yet on a pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The submission states that CARICOM countries’ economic and physical survival is already being threatened, and their adaptive capacity challenged or potentially exceeded. It warns that the observed temperature change in the region is greater than the global average stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea level has risen by around 20 centimeters over the past 100 years, and heat waves are already impacting ecosystems. [Report of CARICOM Workshop on IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C and Talanoa Dialogue] [Caribbean Marine Climate Change Report Card 2017] [US Global Change Research Program’s Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary]

China’s submission underscores that efforts to address climate change are inadequate, and notes “huge gaps” in pre-2020 mitigation ambition and action. It indicates that: developing countries are still facing financial difficulties and barriers in delivering climate actions; greenhouse gases (GHGs) are still rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere; and good practices and opportunities regarding mitigation, adaptation and international cooperation have been identified through through the Technical Examination Process on mitigation (TEP-M) and adaptation (TEP-A).

Fiji’s submission discusses, inter alia: political will and effective policymaking, including the Fijian Government’s introduction of innovative green fiscal measures to stimulate investments and economic growth in a range of sectors; successful mitigation initiatives, including solar home systems, a renewable energy revolving fund and solar islands; and Fiji’s progress on adaptation in the housing, transport, agriculture, energy, health and education sectors.

The Arab Group’s submission laments inadequate funding flows to developing countries, including for the transition to more climate-friendly technologies. It states that a carbon market with carbon pricing should not be considered as a source of funding or as a catalyst for action, and describes the adverse impacts of response measures in many developing countries, particularly those that are heavily dependent on a single sector or commodity.

The EU’s submission confirms that the EU is set to surpass its goal of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, and that the EU 2030 climate and energy framework will lead to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030; noting that the reduction target has been translated into a legislative framework that will ensure objectives are met. It also describes, inter alia, the EU’s share of global emissions, its specific mitigation efforts, and governance and an ongoing review of energy and climate policies in the EU.

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), the CARICOM submission reaffirms that 1.5°C mitigation pathways are the only way forward, and highlights that regional efforts are underway to provide detailed assessments of the impacts of 1.5°C warming. It states that CARICOM expects scientific evidence presented through the Talanoa Dialogue to highlight the need for more ambitious, updated NDCs by 2020 to enable vulnerable communities, such as those in small island developing States (SIDS), to survive.

China’s submission calls for climate targets to be aligned with the SDGs, and for global climate goals to be equitable, taking into account the principle of common but differential responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).

The EU stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.

The Arab Group’s submission supports a regime that acknowledges differing circumstances between developed and developing countries. It notes that the level of developing country actions directly relates to the level of developed country support, and highlights the need for adequate, predictable and sustainable means of implementation for developing countries to implement their NDCs and build resilience.

Underscoring the aim of collectively meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the temperature and long-term mitigation goals, the EU’s submission states that the EU’s NDC and its domestic mitigation targets are consistent with reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. It notes that the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) will provide clarity on the scale of the challenge to meeting the temperature goal, and on how this compares to the 2°C goal. The submission also discusses the need for creating enabling environments for transitioning to low emission development pathways, and progress made by various EU countries on such transition.

How do we get there?

On the third question (How do we get there?), submissions discuss various actions required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. China’s submission underscores the need to, inter alia, encourage technology innovation and enabling policies to promote an “energy revolution,” and accelerate structural changes in the economy to decouple emissions and economic growth. It calls for stimulating climate-friendly lifestyles, and providing developing countries with adequate financial, technological and capacity building resources for mitigation and adaptation actions.

In its submission, Fiji calls attention to the need for: adequate, predictable and sustainable finance for mitigation efforts; innovative climate finance; development of institutional capacity; access to technology; overcoming economies of scale; and enhancing national carbon sequestration. It also explains that Fiji will adopt “no regrets” adaptation measures, which include: better management of natural resources, particularly of coastal habitats, land and water; disease vector control; and improved spatial planning.

The Arab Group’s submission recommends, inter alia: ensuring that equity and CBDR are implemented across the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP); considering the impacts of the implementation of response measures and removing barriers that may hinder technology development and transfer; establishing a clear process for monitoring progress and reporting of financial support; and ensuring that the provision of funding achieves a balance between adaptation and mitigation.

The EU’s submission highlights the EU’s ongoing work on a proposed strategy for meeting the long-term Paris goals to be presented by the first quarter of 2019, noting that all its member States will develop national low-carbon mid-century strategies. The submission stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). It describes, among others, the EU policy framework for domestic action and preparing for enhanced action, and sectoral opportunities and policies to enable the transition. The submission outlines the EU’s assistance to other countries in transitioning towards low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways; and, stressing the need for a just transition, calls for mitigation action by and with non-Party actors.

68,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/delegates-debate-scope-of-migration-compact/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Delegates Debate Scope of Migration Compact,"6 April 2018: Delegates debated the root causes of migration that the Global Compact on Migration should address, whether the text should include new commitments, as well as whether to emphasize the non-legally binding nature of the document. Many supported a strong focus on children and the gender dimension of migration, with Australia calling to also add reference to people with disabilities. This third round of intergovernmental negotiations on the Compact convened from 3-6 April 2018, in New York, US.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference to convene from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico.

While Jamaica noted that all migration brings positive development outcomes, Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and China said that, when mentioning the positive role of migration in development, the text needs to read “regular” migration.

Many countries, including Austria, for a group of 27 European States, Norway and Australia, welcomed the stronger language of the revised draft on human rights and the protection of vulnerable migrants. Russia said the strong language on human rights is not justified.

Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Austria for a group of 27 European States, Norway, and Mexico welcomed strengthening the gender dimension of migration in the text.

Comoros, for the African Group, and Ethiopia stressed that the root causes of migration such as poverty and development would require the implementation of projects in countries of origin, thus call for a new, separate objective and actionable area on international cooperation on financial support for countries of origin to implement projects that address the root causes of migration, as well as for a special fund and a capacity building mechanism. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, expressed concern that the language on root causes of migration – such as corruption, access to justice, respect of human rights, good governance, rule of law, and strong civil society – has been reduced. South Africa noted that conflict as root cause would be better placed in the Global Compact on Refugees, while in the Global Compact on Migration, the root cause should be underdevelopment and addressed through, inter alia: infrastructure development; market access; investment in agriculture; technology transfer; investment in education and training; and respecting official development assistance (ODA) commitments.

Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, said paragraph 39 of the revised draft, which recognizes “the discretion of all States to determine their national legislation and policies with regards to the implementation of the actions envisaged in this Global Compact” is problematic as it leaves it to the discretion of the Member States to implement the actionable commitments and weakens an already nonbinding document. China insisted on changing the term “actionable commitments” in “policy options and best practices,” explaining that the Compact should not create new commitments for Member States. Brazil stressed that the sovereignty of the State is not absolute, but it is limited by international law. Thus, States are sovereign to decide who are irregular and regular migrants, within the parameters of international law. Japan called for flexibility in implementation and follow-up. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia warned against using prescriptive language in the text, suggesting “should” or “could” instead of “must” or “commit.”

Several countries, including the African Group, Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, Tuvalu, and the Holy See welcomed the inclusion of reference to migrants affected by the slow onset of climate displacement in the document. Nauru, for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (P-SIDS), said the Compact should include calls for the international community to plan for the management and support of climate-related migration. Ethiopia said climate change and natural disasters should be approached as root causes and addressed under each objective and actionable area. Canada called for adding language on climate migration in the Guiding Principles section. China said climate change causes refugees and not migrants, thus it should be addressed in the Global Compact for Refugees. Russia requested the deletion of references to the Paris Agreement on climate change and to the UN Convention to Combat Diversification (UNCCD).

The African Group and the Holy See called for the abolishment of migration detention camps and detention of migrants. Pakistan noted that the draft focuses too much on drivers of migration in countries of origin and too little on creating opportunities in destination countries. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia called for emphasizing the duty of nations to accept the return of their nationals, consistent with human rights law.

Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, called for measures to support family reintegration and for legal pathways for low-skilled families to migrate with their children. The need to protect migrant children was also emphasized by Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, and Bangladesh, Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Guatemala, Turkey, Venezuela, Norway, Mexico, Panama and the Republic of Moldova.

On implementation and follow-up and review, Austria for a group of 27 European States, expressed hope to receive a proposal on the capacity building mechanism, information on the financial implications of the proposals in the text, as well as clarifications of who are the actors involved in each of the proposals (States regions, the UN, stakeholders).

Several countries, including China and Russia, requested clear emphasis in the text on the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. Bangladesh and Uganda stressed that references that the document is not legally binding makes the text weak.

The next round of negotiations will take place from 14-18 May 2018 in New York, US.

The NAP Expo aimed to discuss country experiences, best practices, lessons learned, gaps and needs, and information on support provided and received in relation to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. It also offered a platform for countries to interact with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and others providing support for NAPs, as a means to improve access to financing for NAPs.

The event convened amidst alarm bells sounded by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who called for “a race to the top – with political will, innovation, financing and partnership” to counter “the most systemic threat to humankind” that is climate change. [Opening Remarks at Press Encounter on Climate Change by UN Secretary General António Guterres] [UNFCCC Press Release]

Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under NDCs.

The urgent need for adaptation action in light of the “relentless pace of climate change” is reflected in recent updates from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO confirmed the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to be among the most destructive on record, with damage costs exceeding US$250 billion in the US alone, and March 2018 to be the third warmest on record. [WMO Press Release on 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season] [WMO Press Release on March 2018]

The main topics of NAP Expo 2018 were: systematic observations, monitoring and evaluation, and learning from experience from past climate shocks; assessing vulnerability and risk; designing implementation strategies while taking into account vertical and horizontal integration, and different pathways over time; and financial support for the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

Areas of adaptation addressed at the Expo included: climate information services (CIS), climate data and scenarios; monitoring and evaluation; linkages among adaptation, the SDGs and disaster risk reduction (DRR); consideration of gender in NAPs; lessons learned from the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs); long-term adaptation planning and transformation; adaptation in the agriculture sector; water crises and other climate shocks; adaptation in human settlements; and applying traditional and indigenous knowledge. Emerging topics such as big data and artificial intelligence were also discussed.

NAP Expo 2018 was the fifth consecutive NAP Expo, organized by the UNFCCC Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) in collaboration with various organizations.

The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF) in 2010. Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The process is supported by the LEG and though initiatives such as the NAP Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) and the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs Programme (NAP-Ag). NAP-GSP is a joint programme by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to assist developing countries to advance NAPs. NAP-Ag, carried out jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and UNDP, focuses on climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector.

The scenario recognizes that extending current efforts, such as efficiency mandates, carbon taxes or renewable energy support, is insufficient. It argues that concurrent climate policy actions, and the deployment of disruptive new technologies in government policy environments to incentivize investment and innovation will be required.

In 2013, Shell published its New Lens Scenarios focused on mountains and oceans, which, for the first time, featured scenarios with energy-system modeling to 2100, enabling the viewing of long-term transitions in their entirety. These scenarios showed that the application of CO2-targeted policy frameworks would lead to net-zero emissions in the energy system by the end of the century. However, because this falls short of the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sky Scenario looks at a possible decarbonization pathway of achieving net-zero emissions from energy use by 2070.

Under the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040.

The scenario begins with the current structure of economic sectors and government policies, and assumes “very aggressive, but plausible,” ratcheting up of policy commitments through the first two global stocktakes (GSTs) under the Paris Agreement. It notes that, following the GSTs, greater uncertainties regarding policy implementation and technology development exist, which is why the scenario aims to be both ambitious and realistic by adopting an approach grounded in the energy system’s current reality combined with the long-term temperature goal.

In the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040. Liquid hydrocarbon fuel consumption would decrease by 50% between 2020 and 2050, and fall by 90% by 2070. The scenario also includes sector transformations in transport, buildings, industry, electricity and energy.

The Sky Scenario is based on the following assumptions from now to 2070:

a change in consumer mindset where people preferentially choose low-carbon, high-efficiency options to meet their energy service needs;

a step-change in energy efficiency;

carbon-pricing mechanisms adopted during the 2020s, leading to a CO2 cost embedded in consumer goods and services;

the electrification rate of final energy more than triples, with global electricity generation nearly five times the current level;

new energy sources grow by a multiple of fifty, with primary energy from renewables surpassing fossil fuels in the 2050s;

10,000 large carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are built, compared to fewer than 50 in operation in 2020; and

net-zero deforestation is achieved, and an area the size of Brazil is reforested offering the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Shell has also published quantitative data sets for the Sky Scenario for public use.

72,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-report-scores-countries-progress-towards-gender-equality/,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Report Scores Countries' Progress Towards Gender Equality,"29 March 2018: The World Bank launched a report finding that, in 104 economies, at least one law or regulation prevents women from working in specific jobs, and 65 economies have implemented at least one reform that advances gender equality. The publication titled, ‘Women, Business and the Law 2018,’ is the fifth in a series of biennial reports that measure gender discrimination in legal treatment and its economic consequences.

The 2018 report focuses on seven indicators of gender equality and women’s economic participation: getting a job; providing incentives to work; accessing institutions; going to court; using property; building credit; and protecting women from violence. For the first time, the report provides scores for each indicator. The “getting a job” indicator had the highest number of reforms (28 economies) followed by the indicator on “building credit” (24 economies). The indicator on “using property” had the fewest number of reforms, with only Ecuador showing positive reform.

The UK, New Zealand and Spain each scored in the top 20 economies across all seven indicators. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income countries tend to have the highest average scores across the indicators, while economies in the Middle East and North Africa generally have the lowest average scores across most indicators, the authors note.

Over 2.7 billion women around the world are legally restricted from having the same job choices as men.

According to the report, over 2.7 billion women around the world are legally restricted from having the same job choices as men. On access to jobs, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working in 18 economies. In Bhutan, Guinea-Bissau, Pakistan and Suriname, women cannot register a business. The report describes how “legacy legislation” contributes to certain job restrictions that reflect outdated safety standards. For example, almost half of Commonwealth economies limits women’s jobs, with these restrictions dating back to the UK’s Mines and Collieries Act 1842. Similarly, eight out of nine Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) restrict women’s jobs, stemming from a 1932 Soviet Union Law, and 75% of Francophone Africa economies restrict women’s employment as a remnant of a 1954 French West African ordinance.

On protecting women from violence, 59 economies lack laws on sexual harassment in the workplace. In the Middle East and North Africa, 35% of the economies received a score of zero on the indicator, meaning that there are no laws or regulations that protect women from violence. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 19% of economies scored zero on the indicator. In addition, Haiti, the Federated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan also received a zero.

More than one-third of economies still restrict women’s agency and freedom of movement. Such restrictions cover applying for a passport or national identity card, choosing where to live, being the head of a household, or traveling outside the home or country, among others.

Over the last two years, there have been 87 changes towards legal gender equality across 65 economies. Four out of the five economies implementing the most reforms are in Sub-Saharan Africa: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. The DRC reformed its family code, allowing married women to get jobs, sign contracts, open bank accounts and register businesses in the same way as married men. The DRC also removed restrictions on women’s ability to work at night, and removed the obligation for a married woman to obey her husband. Kenya enacted its first domestic violence law, and has improved access to credit information. Bulgaria, Kiribati and Poland eliminated all restrictions on women’s employment. Colombia’s Constitutional Court found labor code prohibitions on women’s work in mining and other “arduous” or “hazardous” jobs to be discriminatory.

The report features a case study on women’s financial inclusion that examines how legal and regulatory environments influence women’s demand for financial services.

73,https://hackaday.com/tag/siglent-sdg-1025/,"Sun, 08 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Hackaday,Siglent SDG 1025,"For those of us who like to wrangle electrons from time to time, there are some exceptional deals out there for low (or at least lower) cost imported test equipment. If you’re willing to part with a few hundred dollars US, you can get some serious hardware that a decade ago would have been effectively outside the reach of the hobbyist. Right now you can order a four channel oscilloscope for less than what a new Xbox costs; but which one you’ll rack up more hours staring at slack-jawed is up to you.

Of course, these “cheap” pieces of equipment aren’t always perfect. [Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking. Fortunately, the function generator accepts an external clock which can be used to increase its accuracy, so he decided to build one.

[Paul] starts off by going over the different options he considered for this project, essentially boiling down to whether or not he wanted to jump through the extra hoops required for an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). But the decision was effectively made for him when his first attempt at using a more simplistic temperature controlled oscillator failed due to an unfortunate misjudgment in terms of package size.

In the end, he decided to spring for the OCXO, and was able to use the USB port on the front panel of the SDG 1025 to provide the power necessary for the crystal to warm up and remain at operating temperature. After he got the oscillator powered, he just needed to put it in a suitable metal enclosure (to cut down external interference) and calibrate it. [Paul] cleverly used the NIST WWV broadcast and his ears to find when his frequency standard overlapped that of the source, therefore verifying it was at 10 MHz.

Hackers love accuracy, and accordingly, we’ve seen a number of frequency standard builds ranging from extremely cheap to luxuriously overkill.","[Paul Lutus] was pretty happy with his relatively affordable Siglent SDG 1025 Arbitrary Function Generator, but found its accuracy to be a bit lacking.

74,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-ready-player-one,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Ready Player One’,"The sell for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One is a little like the sell for Jurassic Park, except instead of dinosaur shock and awe, it’s pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe.

So the T-rex from Jurassic Park is actually in there, along with King Kong, the Iron Giant, Lara Croft, Marty McFly’s time-traveling DeLorean and Adam West’s Batmobile, a notable weapon from the Alien franchise, an iconic setting from a celebrated horror movie, an ’80s-centric score that includes Van Halen, Tears for Fears and Joan Jett, and far, far too many video game and cinematic homages and Easter eggs to document, even if I saw the movie a dozen times, which would definitely be at least 10 times too many.

Worlds collide in Ready Player One in a digital mashup multiverse called the OASIS, a sci-fi virtual vale akin in its own way to J.M. Barrie’s Neverland or C.S. Lewis’ Narnia, a patchwork of disparate mythologies all hugger-mugger. (Barrie juxtaposes pirates, mermaids, fairies, American Indians and flying children; Lewis draws on Greco-Roman and Norse mythology, Hans Christian Andersen, Beatrix Potter and Kenneth Grahame, Arthurian legend, Father Time and even Father Christmas, and, of course, the Bible.)

J.R.R. Tolkien detested such pastiches, but the sort of person who loves Tolkien for the encyclopedic depth of Middle-earth will often love the very different encyclopedic quality of Narnia — or the OASIS.

Ready Player One is a curator’s garden of delights, and if you love the sort of things that go into it and you don’t mind your carrots and peas touching (the way Tolkien did), this movie might be your candy store.

You know there’s a “but” coming, right?

The world of the OASIS exists in 2045 alongside an oppressive dystopian future from which the virtual reality of the OASIS is the only escape for most people.

Take our hero, a young orphan named Wade Watts (The Tree of Life’s Tye Sheridan), who lives in the high-rise trailer-park slums of what used to be Columbus, Ohio, with his aunt and her abusive boyfriend (Susan Lynch and Ralph Ineson).

Wade’s life is lived as Parzival, a digital character with a shock of fair hair like The Legend of Zelda’s Link (circa Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, twin hanks flowing like curtains framing his forehead) and a sword emblem on the back of his jacket in token of his Arthurian nom de jeu.

And here’s the thing: Ready Player One, adapted from Ernest Cline’s novel by Zac Penn and Cline himself, wants to go all in on pop-culture nostalgia shock and awe in virtual-reality fantasy — but it also wants to leave us with the salutary notion that reality is, like, important, too (so kids, remember to unplug, go outside and interact with people in real life).

After all, reality is “the only place you can get a decent meal,” according to tech wizard James Halliday (Mark Rylance), co-creator of the OASIS. Well, actually, Halliday is dead, so it’s a digital version of him in the OASIS who says the thing about decent meals.

But Ready Player One isn’t interested in decent meals, and we never see anyone preparing or enjoying one. Anyway, Halliday is referencing Groucho Marx, so the movie’s best line about “reality” is just one more blasted Easter egg.

Reality is also purportedly the only place where a boy and a girl can really get to know one another, fall in love and certainly kiss. Anyway, Wade is perhaps meant to look foolish for thinking he’s in love with a legendary gamer he knows only by her digital alter ego, Art3mis, a punk-rock action heroine with spiky pink hair and anime-ish oversized eyes.

Certainly Art3mis thinks Wade a fool, and pointedly tells him that he knows nothing about her; certainly she doesn’t actually look like her avatar. And Wade definitely makes a serious mistake by giving Art3mis his real name inside the OASIS. (Always remember, kids, how very foolish it is to give strangers personal information online.)

But eventually Wade meets the face behind Art3mis, which belongs to Samantha Cook (Ouija’s Olivia Cooke), and his digital crush merges pretty seamlessly into the real world. Fortunately for Wade, Samantha is a) actually female, b) actually attractive, and c) neither too old nor too young for him. This does not go without saying (in the OASIS nobody knows you’re a dog).

Samantha isn’t even a different skin tone from Wade, which might not have mattered, except insofar as not mattering would have mattered. She does have a feature she is embarrassed about, which Wade pointedly dismisses as unimportant to him. That Wade himself lacks Parzival’s sculpted cheeks and flippy white locks does not come up.

Eventually there is a real-world kiss, but the individuals in question have spent very little real-world time together. The bottom line is that Ready Player One wants to tell us that reality matters, but the movie really has no interest in its posited “reality” — which is, of course, just a grimmer and less stimulating fantasy.

The plot pits Wade, Samantha and a trio of allies — Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zhao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) — collectively known as the “High Five” against the ruthless CEO of Innovative Online Industries, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn).

At stake: total control of the OASIS. The arena: a series of competitive challenges embedded in the OASIS by Halliday before his death. Yes, rebel gamers must play video games to save the internet from a corporate villain. Remember, this is the movie’s “real world.”

Resolving the challenges involves getting inside Halliday’s head and understanding his defining regrets in life: love lost through fear; friendship lost through resentment. (Don’t be afraid to take the risk, to kiss the girl, to face your pain.)

These are potentially potent themes, but, despite another soulful performance by Rylance, Halliday never emerges as a vital character whose regrets in life amount to much more than scavenger-hunt clues, Maguffins, Rosebuds. The man is (let’s remember) dead, and, while his OASIS alter ego, Anorak, lives on, it’s not him.

It’s not impossible that the figure of Halliday could have had some real poignance. Not only is he played by Rylance, on some level he parallels Spielberg, who did as much as anyone to create the world of 1980s pop-culture nostalgia celebrated here. (Ready Player One doesn’t explicitly celebrate the Spielberg legacy as much as it might have — for one thing, Spielberg didn’t want to make it all about him, and in some cases the rights to certain properties weren’t available anyway — but in any case it’s impossible to imagine the Iron Giant without E.T. or Lara Croft without Raiders of the Lost Ark.)

Perhaps flashbacks of the real Halliday, scattered throughout the film, would have made the theme of middle-aged regret more vital. Perhaps if the drama ultimately turned on vital real-world relationships, the theme of embracing reality wouldn’t feel like a tacked-on public-service announcement.

Perhaps if saving the world involved more than battling a corporate suit for control of the OASIS — perhaps if it involved people’s real-world needs and the lousy state of the world — it might even be moving.

Hey! Did I mention Art3mis drives Kaneda’s bike from Akira and a knife-wielding Chucky shows up to wreak mayhem? Would you believe there are nods to Speed Racer and ThunderCats? How about Battletoads and Halo? I’m just scratching the surface.

75,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-a-quiet-place,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘A Quiet Place’,"Real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and director John Krasinski star in a smart monster movie centered on a winning premise — and an even more winning family.

Early in A Quiet Place, the four unnamed members of an unnamed family clasp hands around the supper table and close their eyes for a silent family grace before meals. Such an unremarkable daily gesture of domestic togetherness and piety might be likelier to crop up, ironically, in a post-apocalyptic horror movie than in any other Hollywood genre.

There is something about living from hour to hour for weeks and years in constant peril of vicious predatory monsters roaming the earth that makes one alive to the gift of a meal with loved ones. There is something, too, about the humdrum ritual of giving thanks for daily bread that weaves together yesterday, today and tomorrow with threads of hope and trust, keeping alive the ordinary and at least momentarily banishing the monsters.

It’s not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad — per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs — have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young’s Harvest Moon — sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly — is the most tender screen dance in ages.

Evelyn and Lee are archetypal parents, nurturing and self-sacrificing. Evelyn, carrying their fourth child for much of the movie, home schools Marcus (Noah Jupe, about 12) in math and English, along with doing the cooking and cleaning, though she can handle the family’s lone shotgun as well as Lee.

Bearded Lee tinkers with the elaborate surveillance system with which he has tricked out their remote farmhouse compound and takes Marcus on father-son hunting-gathering expeditions, training him to assume, if necessary, Lee’s role as chief provider and protector.

There isn’t much concern about traditional gender roles in their relationship, and the considerable masculinity on display is anything but toxic. A couple of years ago, in a pair of essays on problems around the negativity of religious representation in Hollywood movies, I noted that positive depictions of Catholic faith and identity in major Hollywood films in recent years tend to be almost exclusively in a particular sort of horror film. Perhaps a good husband and father, like a good priest, is nowhere likelier than in a horror movie of another sort.

On the other hand, their eldest, Regan (Millicent Simmonds, about 14), resents that Marcus is always the one to accompany Lee on his trips — and Marcus would be happy to let his older sister go in his place. But Lee wants Regan to stay home and help Evelyn in his absence.

This is perhaps only partly because Marcus is the oldest boy. It may also be because Regan is hard of hearing, and Lee’s attempts to jerry-rig a cochlear implant that will help her have not yet been successful. Regan fears, too, that there is another reason: She worries that her father blames her, as she blames herself, for a tragedy that is like a wound that won’t heal.

Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness — the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival. For one thing, the family members were already fluent in American Sign Language when the monsters arrived. (Simmonds, excellent in Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck last year, is really deaf, and she coached her fellow cast members in ASL.)

Silence is an effective device in a filmmaker’s arsenal, but few films rely on it quite so extensively — or on the shattering power of even a quiet noise at the wrong moment. A Quiet Place contains almost no spoken dialogue, though characters occasionally permit themselves bare whispers and, on the rarest of occasions, even shouts.

An especially sharp touch in the film’s sound design is the pitching of key moments to Regan’s auditory point of view, depriving the viewer of the sonic cues she doesn’t have. Almost as unsettling are moments in which we hear what the sharp-eared monsters hear.

The Abbotts are survivors, even by necessity survivalists, and they have built a life for themselves that excludes all but the quietest sounds. (The family go barefoot as much as possible, and the creak-free floorboards have been painted so that even Regan can navigate soundlessly. In one scene, Regan and Marcus play Monopoly, rolling the dice onto cloth and using soft objects as makeshift pieces.)

Still, accidents happen, and the movie builds up the defenses around the Abbotts in the first half so we can watch them crack and crumble in the second half. Sooner or later, of course, there will be a childbirth scene, and babies cry. (Notably, there is no ambivalence about Evelyn’s pregnancy; even in this post-apocalyptic landscape, life is an absolute good.)

Perhaps the film’s most dreadfully effective moment involves an utterly mundane household danger — one that would make viewers squirm and wince in any movie but is especially terrible in a movie in which the one thing one must never do is scream.

Monsters and even fear can potentially be kept at bay. More insidious are grief and guilt.

Regan isn’t the only one who blames herself for the family’s great sorrow, and both Evelyn and Lee live with the parental imperative to protect their children at all costs, which, of course, isn’t entirely possible. “Who are we if we can’t protect them?” an anguished Evelyn asks in what should be a moment of joy.

One of the film’s key assets is its minimalism. The story begins on Day 89, with no invasion sequence and little back story. In the time-honored tradition of Jaws and Aliens, the monsters are kept offscreen for as long as possible.

The filmmakers occasionally succumb to the temptation to do more, to the film’s detriment. Marco Beltrami’s creepy score is at its best when it goes subtle and unnerving; too often it seems like a score for a louder horror movie.

Some of the information conveyed via news clippings and Lee’s whiteboard is overkill; the movie tries to make a mystery of something that should have been obvious. (I had barely described the film’s premise to my 11-year-old when he proposed what is meant to come as a third-act revelation.)

What finally sells the film are the performances — all of them.

Blunt, so steely in another smartly made high-concept alien-invasion movie, Edge of Tomorrow, makes Evelyn’s maternal devotion no less formidable than her earlier character’s military edge. Krasinski, best known from The Office, wears the survivalist family-man role so naturally I can scarcely imagine another current actor improving on the performance. (A friend recently commented that it is hard to imagine many young male actors today persuasively playing competent fathers; Krasinski is clearly one who can.)

Both children are excellent, but it’s Simmonds, in perhaps the pivotal role, who especially shines in a performance evoking all the overwhelming emotional complexity of adolescence, whether or not there are predatory monsters about. Even though A Quiet Place is a terrific film just the way it is, I can’t help wishing there were more families like this in other kinds of movies.

76,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/non-party-stakeholders-provide-inputs-to-the-talanoa-dialogue/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Non-Party Stakeholders Provide Inputs to the Talanoa Dialogue,"2 April 2018: Since January 2018, the Talanoa Dialogue Platform has been receiving submissions from UNFCCC Parties as well as non-Party stakeholders on the three focal questions of the Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This article provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received before the 2 April deadline from non-Party stakeholders.

Inputs submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The online portal will remain open for submissions throughout the year. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), most submissions demonstrate that current emission trajectories and policies are not in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, highlighting that impacts of climate change are already being felt, while also emphasizing positive actions that are already being taken by various actors but which need to be scaled up. A submission from UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) underlines that current national climate plans – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – would almost deplete the carbon dioxide budget for a 2°C scenario by 2030, and far exceed the 1.5°C budget. It underscores that more ambitious NDCs will be necessary by 2020, building on the existing extensive knowledge about cost-effective policies and measures that can be taken. Analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) of a range of studies shows that, even if fully implemented, current NDCs would lead to between 2.7-3.7ºC of warming.

The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) submission takes the assessment a step further, applying an equity lens to the NDCs of 32 Parties, representing 80% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing whether each NDC represents a fair contribution or not. The CAT findings show that not only are global efforts insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but furthermore, the majority of NDCs assessed were found to be inconsistent with the CAT criteria of a fair contribution. According to the submission, only seven governments of the 32 reviewed have implemented 1.5ºC or 2ºC targets, four of which, it claims, are not backed up by sufficient policy action. The CAT submission also shows that currently implemented policies are expected to result in a further growth of global GHG emissions by about 9-13% between 2020-2030.

A submission from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) considers the finance aspects of the current state of play, noting that while climate-related funding is increasing, it is not growing quickly enough to keep the world on a 2ºC pathway.

Many of the inputs also make note of the climate change impacts being felt already. ActionAid International’s submission, on behalf of the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance (CLARA), highlights the “irremediable impacts” the world is already seeing due to the current overall “lock-in” of 1ºC of warming, including the loss of human development potential, negative impacts on livelihoods, and damage to ecosystem integrity caused by climate change and inappropriate land-use purposes and practices.

Actions being taken by private actors also form the basis of several submissions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) submission provides an overview of positive change and commitments undertaken by investors, including: globally, the share of low-carbon supply-side energy investments grew by six percentage points to 43% from 2014-2016; over 50 investors have signed a statement of support for the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and investors holding US$28 trillion in assets under management have signed on to Climate Action 100+, a collaborative five-year global initiative committing investor signatories to engage actively with the world’s top emitting companies. A submission from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that over 350 companies have committed to setting science-based targets, which are absolute GHG emissions reductions in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C. However, while these actions demonstrate a positive direction, the IIGCC submission underscores that the existing action could and should be scaled up, noting the need for governments to set the right enabling policy frameworks, including clear, long-term legislative programmes it highlights as “critical to the ability of investors to assess and manage climate-related risks and to invest in opportunities that support a low carbon, more energy efficient and climate-resilient world.”

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), many of the submissions highlight the emissions reductions and mitigation actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the adaptation and resilience actions required to ensure a safe future. In line with the official mandate of the Talanoa Dialogue, many submissions refer specifically to the long-term goal reflected in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, outlining the need to phase-out net GHG emissions in the second half of the century at the latest, achieve peak emissions in all sectors – energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture – by 2020, and consider the overall carbon budget as guidance for enhancing NDCs in 2020, with UNEP calling this the “last opportunity to close the 2030 emissions gap.”

Noting that the world’s major economies subsidize investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction amounting to US$18-70 billion per year, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) submission outlines the need to curtail fossil fuel supply as an essential part of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, outlining a vision for a managed decline in fossil fuel use. The submission highlights the potential for such a transition to result in social and economic benefits, including through the reinvestment of added tax revenues from fossil fuel production, particularly if these are redirected towards meeting the SDGs. The WRI submission also highlights the need to ensure a vision in which the SDGs and climate action are mutually reinforcing, noting that climate impacts have the potential for detrimental effects on the achievement of the SDGs, whereas well-designed climate policy measures for mitigation and adaptation can advance core development objectives, including health (SDG 3), decent employment (SDG 8), energy access (SDG 7), transport accessibility (SDGs 9, 11), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and landscape protection and biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15).

How do we get there?

Having identified the significant gap between current actions and policies and that which is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the submissions relating to the third question (How do we get there?), identify policies, plans and sectoral actions that need to be put in place to achieve the long-term goals. Underscoring the need to enhance ambition, the submissions also highlight opportunities for broader achievement of social and economic benefits, and interlinkages with the SDGs.

Setting long-term, low-GHG emission development pathways is identified as a key tool in response to the third question. The submission by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) underscores that “developing national and local long-term pathways is critical for the low-carbon transition,” highlighting the importance of creating broad stakeholder ownership of a long-term vision, as well as informing short-term policy decisions in light of deep decarbonization goals.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) submission highlights the economic growth and new employment opportunities that can be created through a transition to a clean energy future, noting that the millions of new jobs that will be created in activities related to deployment and maintenance of renewables and energy efficiency measures would “more than offset” job losses in fossil fuel sectors. Specific policy measures suggested within the submission include: ensuring the quick implementation of renewable energy targets in current NDCs; considering options for strengthening renewable energy targets in NDCs; and broadening the scope of renewable energy components in NDCs.

Many submissions note the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector. Noting that the aviation sector currently accounts for 4.9% of the warming impact on earth, and that international shipping is responsible for 2.6% of global emissions, Climate Action Network (CAN), with the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), and Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), respectively, call for decarbonization pathways for these sectors to be developed, detailing the measures that can be taken to make these achievable, and highlighting the sensitivity of these sectors to climate change impacts. The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) submission, on behalf of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the SLoCaT membership, identifies 20 “quick win actions” for the transport sector as well as a “global macro roadmap” to achieve a net-zero emissions transport sector by 2060-2080.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) submission also recommends action to be urgently enhanced, highlighting the mutually reinforcing nature of well-designed economic and climate policies, which it claims could add 1% to average economic output in G20 countries by 2021, rising to almost 5% by 2050 if the economic benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding or storm damage, are factored in. Specifically, the OECD submission makes several recommendations, for example to integrate climate imperatives into structural reform and broader national development strategies, including sustainable infrastructure, “reflecting the role of the physical environment as a fundamental pillar for strong, sustainable, balanced growth.”

Many submissions also note the importance of non-state actors in advancing climate action, including cities, civil society, and corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, among others.

77,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-devil-and-father-amorth,"Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Devil and Father Amorth’,"The director of The Exorcist makes a documentary about the most famous exorcist of modern times. The result is not greatly to either of their credit.

“He who sups with the devil,” a wise medieval proverb has it, “needs a long spoon.”

William Friedkin, forever known as the director of The Exorcist, may or may not appreciate that proverb, but in The Devil and Father Amorth, a 69-minute documentary featuring Father Gabriele Amorth — perhaps the world’s best-known exorcist until his death in 2016 — Friedkin does interview two people who clearly do.

One is Jeffrey Burton Russell, a historian noted for a five-volume history of demonology who talks about how depressing it was to “work with evil all the time.” His advice: “Don’t concentrate on the devil all the time. … Concentrate on the good, concentrate on God, concentrate on the positive, and don’t think that much about the evil side.”

The other is Bishop Robert Barron, the winsome and media-savvy auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles and founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries. To Friedkin’s astonishment, Bishop Barron adamantly pronounces himself unworthy of “getting in close quarters” with the devil. “People like Father Amorth may be able to do it,” he says cautiously. “I would never dare to do it.”

Clearly, Father Amorth dares. Over a 30-year career, from 1986 to 2016, he performed what he claimed were hundreds of thousands of exorcisms (160,000 as of 2013), averaging up to nine exorcisms per day for years at a time — a furious rate that has elicited astonished criticism from sober Catholic commentators like canonist Edward Peters and apologist Jimmy Akin. (Full disclosure: I know both Ed and Jimmy, especially Jimmy, who is an old and close friend.)

Often wrongly billed as “the chief exorcist of the Vatican” or “the pope’s exorcist,” Father Amorth was never attached to the Holy See, but to the Diocese of Rome, where he was authorized to act as an exorcist but had no special title.

Still, as a co-founder of the International Association of Exorcists, the author of a number of books about demons and exorcism, and a frequent public commenter in the media, he was the de facto public face of the exorcist community. In this capacity, he was known for sensational, extravagant claims, most famously condemning the Harry Potter books as satanic in origin and pronouncing not only Hitler and Stalin, but all rank-and-file Nazis, to be demon-possessed.

None of this comes up in The Devil and Father Amorth. In fact, other than the 20 minutes or so of handheld video footage of the exorcism of an Italian woman — her ninth exorcism, administered on Father Amorth’s 91st birthday, less than five months before his death — we see very little of the celebrity priest himself.

Instead, after an extended introduction filmed at various locations connected with Friedkin’s more famous movie, including Georgetown’s iconic Exorcist steps, the balance of the film is largely made up of interview footage.

Interview subjects include a brother and sister who credit Father Amorth with successfully exorcising the sister, a second woman who is the subject of the present exorcism, and a number of talking heads. Among these are Friedkin’s Exorcist collaborator, the late William Peter Blatty, who adapted his own novel for the screen, and a number of eminent medical and psychological authorities who speak cautiously about the limits of their fields and diagnoses like dissociative trance disorder.

Friedkin makes much of the novelty of his filming of an exorcism, asserting that the Vatican has never before given permission for an exorcism to be filmed. Actually, the Vatican does not directly oversee all exorcisms worldwide, and exorcisms have been filmed before.

For instance, in 1991, ABC’s 20/20 filmed and broadcast the exorcism of a woman who was said to have been inhabited by as many as 10 demons, most memorably one who self-identified as “Minga.”

That 1991 broadcast included moments more striking than anything in Friedkin’s footage of Cristina, administered at the Society of St. Paul congregational residence in Rome where Father Amorth lived and worked.

Although Father Amorth tells us that the devil speaks and acts through Cristina, it seems the devil has little on his mind beyond angry recalcitrance.

The ritual begins with the priest, his long purple stole draped over Cristina’s shoulders, along with a large rosary around Cristina’s neck, thumbing his nose at the devil as he leads Cristina and about a dozen of her family members in the Lord’s Prayer.

Among others, Father Amorth invokes Padre Pio and his own mentor, Father Candido Amantini, who also performed exorcisms for some 30 years. On the wall over Cristina’s head is a photograph of Pope Francis, who has talked more about Satan than the last two popes combined.

Presently, Cristina becomes agitated and begins rocking and writhing in her chair, obliging others to restrain her. Her outbursts — generally inarticulate snarls and cries like “No!” and “Stop!” — are uttered in a voice that sounds unmistakably like an audio editing chorus effect. I am only a permanent deacon and a film critic, not a priest and certainly not an exorcist, but if Cristina’s voice hasn’t been digitally tweaked, for my money the devil needs a new sound design team.

Friedkin’s audio chicanery detracts from what seems to be the sincerity of the woman’s distress, whatever its origin or nature. The very humdrum nature of her outbursts supports their authenticity; a calculated or scripted performance would presumably be more dramatic.

“Send the priest away! I can’t stand it!” she cries. “She belongs to me!” She refuses to answer the priest’s questions about when the possessions began and identifies herself as “Satan” and “legion” or “armies.” At one point, Father Amorth sternly tells the evil spirit it is damned forever and gets the reply, “It’s you who are damned!”

One of the more intriguing exchanges is left untranslated. When Father Amorth asks her how many devils are with her, she says something that sounds like “80 million,” but on cross-examination clarifies as “80 chiefs” (Italian capi).

Sometime after the ordeal is over comes a bizarre coda in which Cristina and her boyfriend allegedly arranged to meet Friedkin in the town of Alatri’s Cathedral Basilica of St. Paul (“considered to be a sacred place,” Friedkin hilariously clarifies, in case this is unclear).

Friedkin offers a complicated account for why this encounter, which winds up taking place in another church, wasn’t filmed, but the bottom line is that we have only his lurid account, scored with screeching strings and dramatized with impressionistic images and sounds, blending the earlier exorcism with glimpses of the church’s interior. Make of it what you will.

Toward the end of The Devil and Father Amorth comes an anecdote that made me cringe. Father Amorth couldn’t wait to reach heaven, an acquaintance says with a chuckle — so that he could beat the devil with a cane. I hope the one-liner does the man a disservice.

If Cristina and Father Amorth seem sincere, the same cannot be said of the filmmaker. Beyond the audio effects and the suspicious unfilmed incident, Friedkin seems more interested in spinning his interview subjects’ answers than in hearing out their perspectives.

For Blatty — a practicing Catholic who researched the real story behind The Exorcist for a nonfiction account, and fictionalized it only when he couldn’t get the family’s permission to write the real story — the hunt for the devil was genuinely part of a larger quest for God.

Friedkin gestures toward this pious move in the closing seconds of the film, but there’s no hint of such a sentiment in the preceding 60-odd minutes.

Whatever Bishop Barron or others may have said about God or Jesus, virtually nothing of this sort made it to the screen. Nor is there any perspective on behaviors that might open the door to demonic influence: involvement in occult activity, magic or divination, for instance.

In a secular age, the mystery of evil can serve for some as a useful signpost to the greater power of good. Sometimes, though, people don’t see past the sign itself, and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in 1975, rightly warned against “obsessional preoccupation with Satan and the demons.”

There is little, if any, genuinely religious dimension to The Devil and Father Amorth. It’s basically a “boo” movie in documentary form — that, and an exercise in brand reinforcement and exploitation.

In an era of found-footage horror movies, genre fans may get a kick from the suggestion that there could be something to this “woo-woo” after all.

Pious viewers may be gratified by the film’s validation of their worldview and the reverential treatment of a conservative fire-and-brimstone clergyman. Skeptics will find confirmation of their disbelief in the film’s evident jiggery-pokery. Few, perhaps, will find much to challenge the preconceptions they sat down with.

A while ago, asked to name a film set in the Middle Ages with a persuasively medieval spirit, I settled on Eric Rohmer’s charming 1978 oddity Perceval le Gallois. Based on a 12th-century French Arthurian poem, it’s a musical of sorts, with sung narration from onstage minstrels playing medieval tunes, and ending with a startling eight-minute musical Passion play.

I have never seen anything like Rohmer’s Perceval. That includes Bruno Dumont’s Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc — improbably enough, another French musical about an innocent young medieval hero, adapted from poetic writings and prominently contemplating the crucifixion of Jesus in song.

Yet Jeannette too offers a medieval vision that is astonishing in its challenge to modern sensibilities, even if the literary source in this case is from around the turn of the 20th century — the writings of the French Catholic poet Charles Péguy — and the eclectic music, blending electronica, Baroque themes and guitar-shredding hard rock with other textures, is jarringly anachronistic.

Jeannette’s medieval vision is expressed, above all, not by the saint herself, nor in the relatively brief visitation of silent heavenly figures whose message Joan interprets for us, but in the ecstatic mystical discourse of a young nun played by a pair of stone-faced twins (stay with me) who also appear as St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Margaret, alongside St. Michael. You probably already know whether or not this movie is for you, don’t you?

There is nothing in the opening minutes to foreshadow all this weirdness. The film opens with an extended shot of a stream in the French countryside (a title informs us that it is summer 1425) in which 9-year-old Jeanette (Lise Leplat Prudhomme) appears, artlessly singing a capella, offering prayers to her patron saint John and the Holy Trinity, as a pious young peasant girl might do.

Her song quickly takes an unsettling turn, though, as the words of the Lord’s Prayer are subverted into an elegy:

Our Father who art in heaven

Your name is so far from being hallowed

And your reign from coming …

Jeanette is deeply troubled by the state of the world, by suffering and especially war, and by the damnation of souls. In a conflicted, Christological expression of the mystery of evil, she laments that the world has seen 14 centuries of Christianity since God sent his beloved Son to suffer and die, not to mention the saints, and yet “what reigns on the face of the earth is perdition.” Over and over Jeanette returns to the haunting refrain, “And there is nothing; there is never anything.”

Jeannette is a dialogue, and a mutual cross-examination, not only among the main characters of the drama, and above all between man and God, but also between the poet Péguy and the filmmaker Dumont, and even between Péguy the Socialist unbeliever of 1897 and Péguy the believing Catholic of 1910. It is also, of course, a dialogue between both artists and Joan herself (a dialogue some might consider one-sided, though Péguy might have demurred, at least in 1910).

Both as a believer and an unbeliever Péguy was an idiosyncratic, contradictory figure. Deeply nationalistic, ardently Socialist, he became an anticlerical unbeliever in high school, yet he always loved the Middle Ages and was fascinated by Joan of Arc all his life.

In 1897 Péguy completed an immense dramatic trilogy, called simply Jeanne d’Arc, surveying the life of the Maid of Orleans. By 1908 he had experienced a recovery of faith, and in 1910 — a decade before her canonization — he published The Mystery of the Charity of Joan of Arc, reworking material from the first of the earlier work’s three parts, which dealt with her childhood in the village of Domrémy.

Where the earlier work presented Joan in secular, nationalist terms, as an icon of an earthly, Socialist kingdom, the later one is awash with religious concerns. (Mystery of the Charity became the first of another trilogy of “mystery” poems, “mystery” here evoking medieval mystery plays as well as invoking the mysteries of Christ’s life and the theological virtues.)

Péguy’s conversion is reflected in the shifting depiction of Madame Gervaise, a Franciscan nun whom I understand the 1897 work depicted critically for fleeing the world’s problems to work out her private salvation, but who in Péguy’s later imagination becomes a voice of divine wisdom. (The screenplay draws on both texts, the 1897 and the 1910.)

Before Madame Gervaise, though, Jeannette is cross-examined by a young friend named Hauviette (Lucile Gauthier), who voices common sense and conventional piety. Unlike the neighbors, who know Jeannette to be devout and charitable and suppose her to be happy, Hauviette “sees things as they are” and knows that everything makes Jeannette unhappy.

Hauviette’s counsel is reasonable: Why carry the weight of the world on your shoulders? Do your best and hope for the best; trust God and don’t ask him to justify himself, since we can’t anyway.

But Jeannette can’t be satisfied with this. What do individual acts of charity accomplish, since suffering never diminishes? What did Jesus accomplish? Could he have died in vain?

The response to Joan’s anxieties is a breathtaking 18-minute sequence at once sublime and at least bordering on ridiculous. There is a sense of revelation in the dramatic arrival of Madame Gervaise that is enhanced by the unexplained casting of twins (Aline and Elise Charles), giving the nun’s soteriological and sacramental mystical theology an almost literally ecstatic quality. (Ek-stasis is Greek for “standing outside oneself.”)

The same twins appear later, more colorfully attired yet silent, as Sts. Margaret and Catherine, but it feels as if the voices of Margaret and Catherine have already been heard in Madame Gervaise.

What the nun offers is, on the one hand, an even more uncompromising restatement of the problem of evil, countered by a poetic vision of time from the perspective of eternity.

On the one hand, the earth is full of suffering and profaning of holy things — and all of us, even the best among us, are complicit cowards and liars who allow sinners to damn themselves. All love and friendship are false and we are all alone (though in spite of our inability to love we somehow love anyway).

On the other hand, the creation of the world and the redemptive sacrifice of Christ are not vanished, past realities, but pervade all of time and space: every parish and village, especially in the even-present offering of the Paschal mystery, yet also embracing the non-Christian world, which is in some way Christian, too. Redemption — true, eternal happiness — are present realities; though non-Christians and even Christians may not understand it, we do not wait for happiness, but possess it now.

Human suffering has a role in God’s plan — though the suffering of the damned is different, and Madame Gervaise warns against Jeannette’s blasphemous notion of saving the damned from hell, even to the point of imagining suffering perdition on their behalf.

The gravity with which the sisters intone Péguy’s poetry, with its chant-like reliance on simplicity and repetition, gives this sequence a semi-liturgical feel. There is also, of course, an undeniable element of humor in the dissonant musical styles — from the eclecticist Gautier Serre, credited as Igorrr — veering from a capella to classical guitar to thrash metal, with Jeanette and the twins (briefly doffing their wimples) solemnly flailing their long tresses like medieval headbangers.

Yet it never dissolves into camp or burlesque. A provocateur who has invoked the names of both Jesus and Satan in the titles of past films, Dumont is at least interested in religious ideas, and he’s definitely interested in the gray area between the outrageous and the absurd.

While he wants to have fun with the material, Dumont doesn’t appear to wish to deconstruct or debunk it. Whatever Dumont or his cast make of Péguy’s text, or however much or little they even understand it, the dancing sequences become a kind of prayer. At one point the twins and Jeannette begin miming invisible walls, gesturing toward the unseen.

Wisely, Dumont lays a naturalistic foundation in the opening scenes, starting with the stream (evoking perhaps Jeannette’s stream of consciousness), which helps to hold the later craziness together. The crucial sequence, in a sandy plain amid loudly bleating sheep, is full of huge blue skies; with her matching blue dress, Jeannette is already closer to heaven than Hauviette in her earth tones.

All the singing was recorded live, a crucial element of truthfulness that in turn restrains the choreography to rather simple, unpolished moves (lots of jumping up and down and running in circles), to winningly authentic effect.

Ultimately, of course, Jeannette cannot accept Madame Gervaise’s Franciscan counsel of abandonment to divine Providence and nonviolent acceptance of suffering and evil. Energized by a sign from God and the appearance of her heavenly visitors, she will set out to “kill war.” (Following suit, Péguy was an early World War I volunteer and an early casualty in 1914.)

The film’s second half finds Joan or Jeanne (Jeanne Voisin), now about 15, wrestling with her inaction since receiving her call, obstacles she has faced and concerns about lying to her parents. Finally, there is the emotional upheaval of leaving home to go to war, escorted by her unassuming young uncle (a hilariously low-key Nicolas Leclaire, who raps all his songs and dabs through his improvised dance moves).

It seems the first half relies more on Péguy’s 1910 Mystery of the Charity and the second half more on the 1897 Jeanne d’Arc. (Jeanne’s uncle isn’t a character in the 1910 work, so his scenes must come from the earlier work.) At times it feels overly repetitive, though it remains agreeable and often moving.

Certainly there’s nothing in the second half to rival the Madame Gervaise sequence. Does that highlight undercut the later material or elevate it? I may need another viewing to decide. In any case, what a highlight! The next time someone asks me for a film with a persuasively medieval spirit, my answer will be more complicated.

80,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-secretary-general-announces-initiative-for-global-disarmament/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Secretary-General Announces Initiative for Global Disarmament,"24 May 2018: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced a vision and agenda for global disarmament, aiming to eliminate nuclear arsenals and other deadly weapons around the world. He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

Business and the Fourth Wave of Environmentalism (Environmental Defense Fund) analyzes survey responses from more than 500 executives to better understand how top executives view and use emerging technologies. Key findings included:

70 percent of executives say their company is already actively investing in technologies that help solve environmental problems.

78 percent believe that new technologies will compel businesses to improve their environmental impact on their own, regardless of pressure from regulators, consumers or investors.

75 percent of companies consider the environmental impact of a technology when deciding to implement it.

80 percent of business leaders believe consumers will start holding businesses more accountable for environmental impact due to the ubiquity of new technologies.

Extending Our Horizons: Assessing Credit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate (UN Environment, Oliver Wyman and Mercer) sets out a methodology for assessing risks and opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. The methodology is based on input from 16 global banks.

Global Carbon Account 2018 (Institute for Climate Economics) finds that 46 countries and 26 provinces/cities have adopted carbon pricing policies. The report also estimates that carbon pricing initiatives generated $32 billion in revenues in 2017 — up from $22 billion in 2016.

Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2018 (UN Environment, the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre and Bloomberg New Energy Finance) finds that global investment in renewables exceeded $200 billion for the eighth year in a row, with China investing a record $126.6 billion — up 31 percent compared to 2016 levels. The report also finds that a record 98 GW of new solar capacity was installed globally last year, outpacing fossil fuel power generating capacity additions.

The Production and Use of Renewable Natural Gas as a Climate Strategy in the United States (World Resources Institute) explores renewable natural gas (RNG) production trends, climate benefits, economic feasibility and more. The report concludes that renewable natural gas could serve as a viable climate change strategy in the United States when it meets two conditions: It is produced from waste; and its use reduces methane emissions to the atmosphere.

SDG Sector Roadmaps (WBCSD) lays out a methodology to help companies establish their sector’s current level of interaction with the SDGs across the value chain; identify their sector’s top opportunities for impact, as well as barriers, potential solutions and impact accelerators; and establish key action items and monitoring systems that chart a course towards the sector’s 2030 vision.

The Work Ahead: Machines, Skills, and U.S. Leadership in the Twenty-First Century (Council on Foreign Relations) assesses the impact that technological advances will have on jobs and workers in the U.S., as well as the implications for the U.S. economy and national security. The report also lays out seven recommendations to help U.S. leaders meet the workforce challenges of the 21st century.

Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report (International Energy Agency, the International Renewable Energy Agency, United Nations Statistics Division, the World Bank and the World Health Organization) provides an update on the world’s progress against global energy targets on access to electricity, clean cooking, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Key findings include:

1 billion people — or 13 percent of the world’s population — still live without electricity; an estimated 674 million people are projected to still live without electricity in 2030.

3 billion people — or more than 40 percent of the world’s population — do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies.

As of 2015, the world obtained 17.5 percent of its total energy consumption from renewable sources; the global renewable share is expected to reach 21 percent by 2030.

Why Carbon Pricing Matters: A Guide for Implementation (WBCSD) makes recommendations to policymakers on how to best implement a carbon price. The guide also draws on business insight to identify the top-5 reasons why policymakers should adopt carbon pricing: lowest-cost pathway; technology neutrality; flexibility; transparency and burden sharing; and long-term signals encouraging development.","Building Pressure (CDP) ranks 13 large publicly listed cement companies, representing 15 percent of global cement production, on their business readiness for a low-carbon transition.

The two-day expert group meeting, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), featured in-depth discussions on climate action, ocean action, plastic pollution in the ocean, food loss and waste, and sustainable transport as they relate to SCP.

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is one of the six Goals for which governments will conduct an in-depth review at the HLPF’s 2018 session. During the expert group meeting, participants recalled that SDG 12 is the “least well resourced” SDG, according to a report of the UN Secretary-General.

On SDG 12 stocktaking and HLPF preparations, Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA, said the market is “not getting it right” on the true costs of consumption and production. He highlighted the extensively interlinked nature of the SDGs and targets, and called for using empirical information to decide which interlinkages to prioritize for action, but said these choices must be context-specific.

Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of Secretariat of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (10YFP) at the UN Environment Programme, reported on the formation of the ‘One Planet Network,’ a multi-stakeholder network that will serve as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12. Cecilia Lopez Y Royo Di Taurisano, 10YFP Secretariat, said most activity has taken place in the area of SCP readiness, with less activity in SCP implementation. She reported a notable increase in the number of SCP policies and instruments, but said approximately half of these are voluntary, and only 11% are financial instruments.

Participants discussed the need to make an economic case for SCP at the global level, and considered whether the private sector will respond to potential efficiency gains as an incentive to improve SCP, or only regulation. One suggested the need for better branding of SCP. On SCP’s interlinkages with other issues, a government representative highlighted her country’s toolbox to allow national focal points to bring SCP to the table of negotiations in other areas.

The idea that SCP is highly interlinked with other Goals continued to emerge in the session on climate action. Annika Lindblom, Finland’s Ministry of the Environment and Secretary General of the National Commission on Sustainable Development, said SCP “directs attention to the interface of climate and poverty.” She said Finland has combined the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change in order to address material usage and energy usage together. The framework is called ‘Carbon Neutral and Resource-wise Finland,’ and includes a medium-term climate policy plan to 2030 and action plans on procurement, product innovation and support for investments.

Hannah Janetshek, German Development Institute, said that while SDG 12 can have “strong co-benefits across the entire agenda,” it could also increase competition for resources, especially as policies seek to expand access to services in order to leave no one behind.

Mathilde Bouyé, World Resource Institute (WRI), said targets from SDGs 11 and 12 are poorly reflected in the NDCs, specifically 11.6, 11.c, 12.3 and 12.c. Jocelyn Blériot, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, added that so far, the focus of a low-carbon economy has been on energy, with less emphasis on raw material extraction and production. He called for an approach beyond ‘Recycling 2.0.’ With three billion new consumers coming soon, he said we must think differently, such as shifting from selling goods to selling services.

Suggesting that “most people don’t care about the impact of what they buy,” moderator David O’Connor, WRI, suggested that businesses should force people to opt out of positive behaviors rather than require them to opt in. Blériot suggested that regulations are needed in addition to business-led action, and said a number of governments are creating circular economy road maps, including Finland and France, in which businesses must consider what will happen to a product at the end of its first useful life.

In the course of the meeting, participants identified tradeoffs between SDG-related issues that have implications for SCP. These include:

Energy efficiency can be improved by certain thermostats, but recycling could be a challenge given the rare pollutants they contain. Similar challenges were noted with disposal of solar panels.

Lego plans to begin producing blocks out of sugarcane instead of plastic, but harvesting the needed sugarcane could increase land competition.

Plastics are part of the packaging innovations that have reduced food waste.

The interests of marginalized groups could come into conflict with the creation of marine protected areas.

Given these and other trade-offs, Gerald Singh, University of British Colombia, called for choosing priorities to prepare for “sub-aspirational” SDG scenarios. Bouyé said some countries are creating incentives and compensations for vulnerable populations who may be affected by SCP implementation. For example, El Salvador and France are among those including a climate solidarity package in their NDCs.

Wilberforce Kisamba-Mugerwa, Chair of Uganda’s National Planning Authority, reported that the HLPF is not sufficient for creating awareness of SCP, and urged involving sub-national leaders.

Edda Fernández Luiselli, Mexico’s Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources, said that in the Latin American and Caribbean region, sustainability must be promoted as a tool for competitiveness, not an environmental issue. She said that in LAC, the SDG implementors must be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which represent 80% of GDP.

Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, reported on efforts to link the existing ‘OneNYC’ plan with the SDGs, noting that after Hurricane Sandy, the City realized that prevention and protection must be equitable. She gave examples of New York’s waste management policies, such as ‘zero waste by 2030’, which includes bringing recycling to public housing and making public schools zero waste. She announced that New York City will present the first-ever ‘Voluntary Local Review’ at the 2018 session of the HLPF, and said it will map city-level efforts against the SDGs to enable discussions and exchanges with other cities and countries about best practices and filling gaps.

During the sessions on SCP and ocean action and plastic pollution in the ocean, Arthur Andambi, Permanent Mission of Kenya, said Kenya banned plastic bags in 2017. He announced that Kenya will host a blue economy conference from 26-28 November 2018, and noted that Kenya has proposed to host, along with Portugal, a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020.

Sian Sutherland, Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet, said the use of plastic for food and drink packaging represents a momentary use with consequences that last forever, and recommended that governments take action on this. Another participant noted that plastics play a key role in packaging innovations that reduce food waste.

Participants developed ideas for bringing together communities of practice around targets that are closely linked. Arden-Clarke suggested creating a working group on value chains, which could cover both food and plastics. He noted that the upcoming session of the Trade for Sustainable Development Forum will meet on the theme of sustainable value chains for SDG 12, and suggested that a working group on value chains could take advantage both of this event and the subsequent blue economy conference in Kenya.

Several presentations informed participants of the current status of plastic pollution in the ocean and efforts to address it. Speakers noted that plastic production is expected to double or triple within ten years, while the volume of additives in plastic and products’ complexity make recycling a limited solution. Participants observed that many consumers know about the problem, with one suggesting addressing the dynamic between consumer and retailer in order to “beat the speed of regulation.”

Recent actions taken to reduce plastic, as reported by the experts, include:

In the Maldives, schools have eliminated single-use plastics as of April 2018;

In the Netherlands, an affordable grocery store opened a plastic-free aisle;

The UK recently announced the Clean Oceans Alliance to reduce plastic waste in Commonwealth states;

In Switzerland, major supermarkets placed a five-cent fee for plastic bags, reducing demand by 80%.

Additional ideas were brainstormed, including:

Use extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies with regard to plastic packaging, as well as industrial fishing and the loss of gear;

Work with mineral water bottling companies to shift to other types of bottles, and hold a conference with the five largest bottled water companies in the world to secure commitments on going plastic-free;

Create legislation covering supermarkets’ responsibility, especially as some have said, “we would love to be legislated into” reducing plastic; and

Use blockchain technology to track ships, fishing nets and other aspects of fishing supply chains and manufacturing.

One participant said demand is only part of the solution, and legislation is required when producers and packagers are not ready to come to the table. A government representative said that despite regulations and laws, the petroleum industry can perpetuate a bad situation in a country through lobbying and investments.

On food loss and waste, experts including James Lomax, UN Environment, and Harry de Gorter, Cornell University, US, explained that in food and agriculture, unlike other areas of SCP, efficiency is not the problem. Calories are produced very cheaply already, which leads to consumption of the wrong food – non-diverse, high-calorie, and corn-based – in turn creating an obesity crisis. Moreover, when food is wasted, the water, energy and wildlife habitat used in creating the food are also wasted. However, decreasing production and consumption will increase prices. Redistribution of surplus is not the solution, Lomax stressed, and will only entrench the system of waste.

Participants stressed the need for consumer campaigns and public outreach, such as conducting food waste audits in schools. They also noted the importance of measurement and monitoring, such as through the food waste index led by UNEP and partners, and through initiatives to separate food waste from the waste stream.

On whether there is a business case to be made for reducing food waste, one participant said the westernization of diets is driving the crisis, and it is difficult to make a business case to address that. However, Richard Swannell, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), said businesses can experience a favorable rate of return on reducing food loss and waste in under two years, and companies that measure how much is wasted through the entire process of producing the food in the first place realize the need to reduce waste.

Regarding SDG 12’s status as the least funded SDG, participants suggesting linking food waste to other issues, highlighting that it is difficult to mobilize funding for what is perceived as a first-world problem. They also called for more measurement of gains from reducing food loss and waste, which will lead governments to invest.

The trends are particularly concerning regarding energy access and clean cooking fuels, whereas progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy is accelerating.

The publication provides a global overview on progress towards SDG 7 and its targets relating to energy access including access to clean cooking fuels, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It concludes that the rate of progress on all targets is insufficient to achieve SDG 7. At the same time, the analysis shows that the rate of increasing access to electricity has recently overtaken the rate of population growth for the first time, and that energy efficiency is increasing in the industrial sector. The publication further notes that country experiences indicate which mix of targeted policies and international support can be successful in promoting clean energy and energy access around the world.

“We must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.” – Adnan Z. Amin, Director-General, IRENA

Presenting the report at the 4th Sustainable Energy for All Forum, held from 2-3 May 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin said, “the report is an important signal that we must be more ambitious in harnessing the power of renewable energy to meet sustainable development and climate goals, and take more deliberate action to achieve a sustainable energy future.”

Specific findings on SDG 7 targets include:

Access to electricity: One billion people (13% of the world population) continue to live without electricity. At current rates, 674 million people would remain without access to electricity in 2030. Experience in a few countries has shown that home solar energy systems or mini-grids are a promising technology to provide access in rural areas.

Access to clean cooking fuels: Three billion people (40% of the world population) remain without access to clean cooking fuels. The resulting indoor air pollution causes approximately 4 million deaths per year. The main reasons for lack of progress are low consumer awareness, financing gaps, slow technological progress and lack of fuel distribution infrastructure.

The main reasons for lack of progress are low consumer awareness, financing gaps, slow technological progress and lack of fuel distribution infrastructure. Energy efficiency: Global GDP continues to decouple from growth in energy demand with energy intensity declining on average 2.2% per year, compared to 2.6% required to double energy efficiency by 2030. Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked.

Progress was driven by improved energy efficiency in the industrial sector, whereas the transport and heating sectors are lagging. Several large economies show signs that their primary energy use demand has peaked. Renewable energy: Modern renewable energy use (excluding traditional uses of biomass) has increased to 9.6% of global energy consumption and is projected to reach 21% by 2030 under current policies. This is insufficient to achieve the “substantial increase” required under target 7.2 and to mitigate climate change. While falling costs have accelerated growth in renewable electricity to 22.8% per year in some countries, electricity only represented 20% of final energy consumption in 2015. Growth in the use of renewables in transport and heating is much slower at 2.8% per year.

The note was prepared in order to advance discussions at the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48), convening during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany.

The document (FCCC/SBSTA/2018/INF.2) provides information on cooperative activities, initiatives and programmes since the SBSTA 46. On the relationship with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the document explains that the 2030 Agenda recognizes the UNFCCC as the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and that the UNFCCC Secretariat can help countries achieve the SDGs. It describes UNFCCC activities towards SDG implementation, focusing mainly on SDG 13 (climate action), as well as engagement with activities and relevant agencies for achieving SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 15 (life on land).

The document showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with UNEP, FAO and ILO, among others.

On mitigation-related cooperative activities, the note highlights implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the role of the NDC Partnership, which supports developing countries in implementing their NDCs and achieving the SDGs. It showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with, inter alia: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to support climate and SDG-aligned finance and investment action in the context of sustainable development; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) to enhance countries’ capacities to integrate adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs into activities in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work.

On technology, the note outlines cooperation related to, inter alia, the technology facilitation mechanism to support implementation of the SDGs. It highlights the Secretariat’s participation in the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and in the high-level seminar on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

The note also describes cooperative activities related to climate finance, capacity building, adaptation and action for climate empowerment (ACE). It underscores the UNFCCC’s participation in a review forum for the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, which discussed the role of teachers and teacher training, as well as implementation of education for sustainable development in achieving SDG target 4.7 (ensuring all learners acquire knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development).

Additionally, the note provides an overview of activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) that help achieve the SDGs. On SDG target 2.4, on ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices, the document highlights the UNFCCC’s role in identifying knowledge gaps around agriculture and fisheries that hinder implementation and scaling up of adaptation.

On SDG target 5.5, on ensuring women’s participation and equal opportunities for leadership, the document references knowledge resources on gender-sensitive approaches and tools for adaptation. On SDG target 11.3, on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the note highlights a synthesis report on adaptation in human settlements, prepared under the NWP, which shares key findings, good practices and lessons learned on adaptation in human settlements. Regarding SDG target 11.B, on increasing the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing mitigation and adaptation policies and plans, the document outlines the Secretariat’s efforts to catalyze climate resilience action in human settlements through an adaptation knowledge portal.

The document also describes NWP activities related to: SDG target 6.A, on expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes; SDG target 9.A, on facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries; and SDG 13. The note also highlights the potential of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform to help advance the SDGs, particularly SDG target 13.B, on promoting mechanisms for building capacity for climate change-related planning and management for local and marginalized communities.

The VLR, to be presented during the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), will be modeled after the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs Penny Abeywardena made the announcement on 1 May 2018. According to the press release on the announcement, New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs, and its VLR will highlight the City’s achievements in sustainability since 2015. The VLR will be presented during the HLPF’s “sessions dedicated to local government engagement.”

The VLR, produced by the Global Vision | Urban Action programme of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs in close collaboration with relevant NYC agencies, compiles and presents existing New York City’s data and programs, the press release notes. An article by Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, indicates that the VLR will look at the City’s progress on a set of key SDGs, and will both reflect on successes and identify areas where New York can learn from others to address remaining challenges.

New York’s Global Vision | Urban Action programme shares innovations in sustainability with cities and countries around the world, “using the lens of the SDGs.” Established in December 2015 by the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, the programme seeks to, inter alia: engage with experts and representatives from New York City and the international community interested in achieving the SDGs; organize public events, expert meetings, and site visits to allow participants to see the SDGs in action and learn from each other about successes and challenges they face; and research links between New York City’s sustainable development work, the Mayor’s commitment to equity, and the SDGs. Hiniker reports that since the establishment of the programme, the City has hosted tours, panel discussions and other events to discuss how NYC is localizing the SDGs.

Global Vision | Urban Action also identifies links between the SDGs and the 2015 ‘One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City’ (OneNYC), the City’s roadmap on economic growth, sustainability, and resiliency. OneNYC commits to lift 800,000 New Yorkers out of poverty or near poverty by 2025, to expand access to nutritious and affordable food, and to fight against climate change and strengthen resilience, among other goals. As outlined in the document, ‘OneNYC 2018: Progress Report,’ which assesses New York City’s progress on the plan, New York’s accomplishments so far include: a “record job and wage growth” and a “record low unemployment,” with gains in all five boroughs; and the lowest poverty level since the Great Recession. The report also notes that New York is the first major city or state in the US to commit to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels, and the first city to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The OneNYC plan is available on the OneNYC website, along with its progress reports each year. The website also includes a list of indicators and initiatives related to the plan, and links to the NYC Open Data platform.

The HLPF will convene from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, on the theme, ‘Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ It will conduct in-depth reviews of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report reflects on Africa’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and makes recommendations for integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The report titled, ‘Integrating and Tracking Performance on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: From Theory to Practice,’ urges countries to consider the interlinkages among the two agendas’ goals, targets and indicators to ensure horizontal and vertical integration of initiatives into national development plans. In the report, horizontal coherence refers to coherence between a national development plan and a country’s international development commitments and initiatives. Vertical coherence relates to synergies among goals, targets and indicators, such as between the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. According to the report, levels of convergence between the two frameworks include 90% convergence at the Goal level, and 69% at the target level.

To support integration, the report presents the UNECA’s integrated planning and reporting toolkit, which aims to facilitate integration of multiple development frameworks into national development plans and to track implementation progress. The toolkit is intended for use by line ministries and others responsible for development planning at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as for civil society and the private sector to track progress.

The 2018 report also looks at how the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, respectively, are driving business strategy.

To generate the report, Ethical Corporation surveyed over 1,500 business professionals in a range of roles and sectors around the world, with 70% coming from Europe and North America. The survey identified how companies and business leaders are seeking to transform operations and outputs in order to deliver on the SDGs and Paris Agreement.

Among the findings, over two-thirds of corporate-brand respondents indicated that their company is integrating the SDGs into business strategy, which the authors note represents a significant and consistent increase in the two years since the Goals’ adoption in 2015. Of the remaining third of respondents, half indicated that they do not intend to do this in the future. Regionally, businesses in Europe and Asia-Pacific feature higher rates of integration than those in North America.

On the stage of SDG integration, 82% of respondents noted that they are currently in the mapping stage or integrating the Goals into business strategy. Only 12% claimed that the SDGs have been integrated across departments with clear goals set.

Despite this incomplete integration, the report finds that over half of respondents’ companies are using the SDGs as a framework to report on and communicate sustainability impacts. Thus, the authors underscore a risk of “SDG washing,” with companies using the SDGs as a communication tool “without much actual adaption to strategy or measurement of their impact towards the Goals.”

Indeed, 56% of respondents’ companies are not measuring their contributions to the SDGs. These findings are consistent with recent reports by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and KPMG.

On the primary SDG with which companies are engaging, the reports finds SDG 13 on climate action to be the clear leader across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America, with roughly two-thirds of companies in each region identifying SDG 13 as that which they engage in the most. The report also finds promising scope for climate action by US cities, states and corporations alike, highlighting the #WeAreStillIn movement as an important convergence of like-minded actors in response to the US announcement of its intention to withdraw the country from the Agreement. While respondents primarily see governments as being the most influential actors in ensuring that the Paris Agreement is met, over one-third felt that companies will be most influential. The report indicates that the vacuum of climate leadership from the US federal government has increased expectations and placed an onus on business leaders to carry climate objectives forward, as 68% of respondents report expecting their respective companies to “take a lead in helping meet the Paris Agreement.”

Similarly to previous years, responses show that there is still much progress to be made. In particular, businesses are struggling to measure the return on investment (ROI) of sustainability activities. However, 75% of respondents stated that “their CEO is convinced of the value of sustainability,” a slight increase from previous years.

The draft will remain under silence procedure until 4 May at 1:00 pm, and if there are no objections, it will be sent to the UNGA plenary for consideration.

In a letter to Member States, co-facilitators of the negotiation process Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, wrote that they count on governments’ “continuous spirit of flexibility and cooperation” so the membership can adopt the text as is and proceed “without further delay” with the changes required to ensure a UN development system that is “strategic, accountable, transparent, collaborative, efficient, effective and results oriented,” as called for in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR).

On ‘A new generation of UN country teams (UNCTs),’ the draft text requests the Secretary-General to work through the UN Sustainable Development Group, and in consultation with concerned Member States, to determine appropriate criteria regarding the presence and the composition of UNCTs, based on country development priorities and long-term needs and the approved UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). It further requests the Secretary-General to conduct a review of the configuration, capacity, resource needs, role and development services of multi-country offices, in full consultation with involved countries to improve their contribution to country progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda, to be presented at the 2019 session of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment (OAS).

By the text, governments welcome measures by the Secretary-General for advancing common business operations, including common back-offices, and with the target of 50% common premises by 2021, to enable joint work and generate greater efficiencies, synergies and coherence.

On ‘Reinvigorating the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC) system,’ Member States decide to separate the functions of the RC system from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative. They also decide to provide sufficient funding annually from 1 January 2019 through:

A 1% coordination levy on tightly earmarked third party non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source;

Doubling the current UNDG cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and

Voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

This proposal for funding the RC system, which the co-facilitators describe as a hybrid solution, was circulated separately in late April for governments’ consideration. The write that it represents an effort to reflect different views while ensuring the “necessary predictability and sustainability of resources that an impartial and empowered Resident Coordinator system will need.” The co-facilitators intend to circulate a technical note containing details on the key elements of the RC funding model.

On ‘Funding the UN development system,’ the text invites Member States to contribute on a voluntary basis to the capitalization of the UN Joint Fund for the 2030 Agenda at US$290 million per annum. By the draft, governments welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to launch a Funding Dialogue in 2018 with the view to finalize a Funding Compact in the form of a commitment between the UN development system and Member States. They further request the Secretary-General to report on the outcome of the Funding Dialogue at the 2019 OAS. They specifically note that the Funding Compact “relates to voluntary funding” of the UN Development system as well as other contributions.

On ‘Following-up on the UN development system repositioning efforts at the global, regional and country level,’ the text requests the heads of the entities of the UN development system, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, to submit a system-wide strategic document to the 2019 OAS.

The draft resolution also requests the Secretary-General to report to ECOSOC on progress in the implementation of the mandates contained in the resolution, as well as on the mandates contained in the QCPR resolution, as part of his annual reporting to the 2019 OAS. The Secretary-General needs to report also to the UNGA 74th session, for its further consideration and to inform the next cycle of the QCPR to be launched in 2020.

Ahead of the meeting, FAO published a synthesis report of existing scientific research titled, ‘Soil Pollution: A Hidden Reality,’ warning that pollution poses a worrisome threat to agricultural productivity, food safety, and human health, but “far too little is known about the scale and severity of that threat.”

Around 500 soil experts, policy makers and other stakeholders attended the GSOP18, which was co-organized by FAO’s Global Soil Partnership (GSP) and Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS), UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment), the Secretariats of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS Conventions Secretariat), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Symposium aimed to contribute to implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by serving as a platform to assess the latest information on the status, trends, and actions on soil pollution.

Participants assessed the status of soil pollution worldwide and explored options for its prevention as well as remediation. Specific themes included: the impact of agricultural fields and other land uses; the impact of soil pollution on food production and safety, the environment and overall human well-being; remediation of polluted sites; and developing policies and setting thresholds for addressing soil pollution and the global status of soil pollution.

The FAO synthesis report found, inter alia, that: production of chemicals has grown rapidly in recent decades and is projected to increase annually by 3.4 percent until 2030; in 2015, the European chemical industry produced 319 million tons of chemicals, of which nearly half were deemed hazardous to the environment; and levels of persistent organic pollutants in human milk are significantly above those considered safe, with a higher incidence in India and in some European and African countries. The report also raised concern about a near-doubling of the amount of manure left on pasture, which can contain high amounts of heavy metals, pathogen organisms and antibiotics. Other sources of soil pollution highlighted in the report include approximately 110 million mines or other unexploded pieces of ordnance that are scattered across 64 countries on all continents, and high concentrations of radionuclides in “almost all soil in the northern hemisphere.”

Ongoing GSP initiatives to track the global status of soil pollution were highlighted, notably the 2015 Status of the World’s Soil Resources report, and the 2017 Global Assessment of the Impact of Plant Protection Products on Soil Functions and Soil Ecosystems, which is one of the follow up actions to the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management that were adopted by the GSP in 2016. The role of the BRS Conventions in coordinating the phase-out of persistent organic pollutants (POPs); production of global norms for sound environmental management; and fostering partnerships with stakeholders was highlighted. The meeting also discussed the implementation of the 2017 UN Environment Assembly Resolution on soil pollution.

Building on diverse national and regional case studies of soil pollution featured at the meeting, participants highlighted organic compounds and emerging contaminants as one of the main challenges. They called for a global assessment of soil pollution that includes modeling chemical production and emissions, prioritizes highly contaminated sites, and assesses, at country level, the main contaminants and impacts. The importance of developing accessible technologies to assess soil pollution was also emphasized.

During the closing session, the GSP Secretariat announced plans to establish two working groups to continue work on some of the key issues addressed at the Symposium. The two groups will focus, respectively, on developing guidelines for assessing, mapping, monitoring and reporting on soil pollution, and managing soil pollution. ITPS and its partners are developing an outcome document from the Symposium that will summarize the scientific evidence and data presented, as well as ideas for overcoming existing challenges and future steps, that will serve as a road map for the ‘Be the solution to soil pollution’ campaign and other future actions.

The GSP was established under FAO in 2012 as a mechanism to develop an interactive partnership and enhanced collaboration between all stakeholders, to improve the governance of and promote sustainable soil management. The ITPS was established at the first GSP Plenary Assembly in 2013 and is composed of 27 top soil experts from all regions. Its main function is to provide scientific and technical advice on global soil issues to the GSP and to specific requests by global or regional institutions.

The Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management were adopted by the 4th GSP Plenary Assembly and endorsed by the 155th session of the FAO Council in 2016. They provide technical and policy recommendations on achieving sustainable soil management.

91,https://cyclingmagazine.ca/mtb/sdg-tellis-dropper-post/,"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Canadian Cycling Magazine,First impressions: SDG Tellis dropper post,"When SDG made the decision to wade into the increasingly crowded dropper post market with it’s new Tellis post, the company didn’t want to just add another option without adding anything new. The company has been focused for decades on making saddles and grips, and didn’t need to make the move to dropper posts, but felt it had something new to offer.

SDG’s Tellis is designed to address four problems common to dropper posts: durability, simplicity, affordability, and lever feel. After two years of development and testing in Kamloops, B.C., the company is confident they have achieved their goals with the Tellis. “It is an affordable, easy to work on and above all else, a reliable dropper seat post,” the company says.

When it came to testing the Tellis, the Huntington Beach, Cali.-based company leaned heavily on SDG Global Sales Director, and Chief Tester Devyn Pelley, in Kamloops. Pelley set up a secret science shed with a reciprocating linear actuator motor to cycle the Tellis post for six months, as a complement to the lab testing in Taiwan. In a more traditional form of testing, Pelley also thrashed the Tellis on his local Kamloops trails, riding through -20 Celsius to make sure the post’s feather-light actuation would continue to work flawlessly through a Canadian winter.

SDG's science shed test set-up SDG bathed the Tellis in a slurry of grit and mud for the test process

Wanting to test more than cold weather functionality, Pelley developed a self-contained vat of muddy grit that encapsulated the seal around the shaft. The machine ran for months as in an effort to promote real world exposure to water, mud and debris. SDG reports the Tellis system remained clean and functioning even after countless hours of cycling through the muddy water.

SDG’s Tellis dropper post comes in 125 mm and 150 mm travel options, though 100 mm and 170 mm options will be added later in the summer, and is available in 30.9 mm and 31.6 mm seat post diameters. The internally routed post comes with a 2 year warranty.

First impressions: SDG Tellis dropper post

I’ve been testing the 150 mm version of the Tellis and so far it has lived up to all of SDG’s claims. The post feels solid, with no rotational movement, and the lever has a nice, light feel to it, as advertised. The Tellis was quick and very straightforward to install. Attaching post connect to the cable head, which makes installing the post in the frame simple. There’s little fiddling with cables and wrenches on the post side, as you try get the post into the frame.

From there, you just thread the end of the wire through SDG’s remote lever, and you’re on your way. The lever itself is equally simple and functional. The clamp can be attached without removing everything else off your bars, and its slim design doesn’t take up valuable cockpit space. A pinch bolt locks the cable in place, and a barrel adjuster allows for a small amount of fine tuning for the posts engagement point. True to its word, SDG has done the research and refinement to give the Tellis an incredibly light actuation feel and the lever paddle is easy to find and operate, which is appreciated when you come across an unexpected scenario and suddenly need your post out of the way.

The 3d forged head on the Tellis makes the overall post length shorter, which anyone with limited real estate in their frames seat tube will appreciate. It does mean tightening the seat clamp bolts requires a bit more dexterity with a wrench, but that is easily worth it for the shorter length and the post is still simple to install.

Two of the big claims SDG makes are that the Tellis is reliable and easily serviceable. Both hinge on the fully sealed cartridge system the post relies on for its travel. Reliability can only be tested over time, but the scratch resistant coating in on the posts lowers has held up to several tests already without signs of wear. Riding conditions have been better described as “deep dust” than “wet slop” lately on the wet coast, but that rarely lasts long. The Tellis will see rain and grit soon enough, and I’ll report back on long term reliability after a couple months of that.

Serviceability on the Tellis appears quite straightforward, and SDG has created handy YouTube videos for service and installation SDG has opted for the sealed cartridge system for exactly that reason. Part of the posts reasonable cost does come through the posts minimal available adjustments. There’s no return speed adjustments on the Tellis, which sends your seat up towards you at a quick, but not lightening fast rate. There’s also minimal positioning adjustments at the lever end. The narrow bar clamp means you have more space to move the lever inboard or outboard, and the svelte lever should give you room to rotate the lever. But most of the adjustments do come by physically moving the lever around on the bar.","When SDG made the decision to wade into the increasingly crowded dropper post market with it’s new Tellis post, the company didn’t want to just add another option without adding anything new.

92,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/43-governments-and-80000-individuals-pledge-action-on-plastic-pollution/,"Thu, 03 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"43 Governments and 80,000 Individuals Pledge Action on Plastic Pollution","30 April 2018: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) has declared that the “tide is already beginning to turn” on tackling single-use plastics and reducing microplastics in cosmetics and toiletries, thanks, in part, to the efforts under the Clean Seas Campaign.

According to UNEP, raising awareness on the impact of plastic pollution has helped to build global momentum to tackle plastic pollution. One year since the Clean Seas Campaign’s launch, 43 governments, representing half of the world’s coastline, have signed up to the Campaign. Many of these governments have made specific commitments to protect oceans, ban or reduce single-use plastics and encourage recycling.

The Indian state of Sikkim, which was the first Indian state to ban disposable plastic bags in 1998, has banned the use of packaged drinking water in government offices and at government events. Offices are now using large reusable dispensers, filtered water and reusable water bottles for meetings. Sikkim has also banned the use of Styrofoam and thermocol disposable cutlery and plates throughout the entire state as part of efforts to decrease plastic pollution and tackle its garbage problem. The state is working to enforce these bans through an awareness program and penalties.

At an individual level, nearly 80,000 people have taken the Clean Seas pledge to eliminate single-use plastics and microbeads from their lives, with many of them changing their behavior to use cloth bags or demand the removal of single-use bottles from their offices. These individuals are also advocating for their governments and the private sector to address plastic pollution.

In another example, SLO active, a social enterprise dedicated to cleaning up the ocean, release a guide titled, ‘Plastic Pollution: Single Use Plastic Impact on our Oceans.’ It features facts and figures on plastic pollution and discusses problems, such as the ocean ‘garbage patches,’ or gyres, and single-use plastic and microplastics. The guide then describes the impact of plastic pollution and presents four types of potential solutions to minimize this impact: single-use plastic alternatives; plastic recycling initiatives; beach and ocean cleanup; and a list of plastic pollution charities. As an illustration, the guide proposes alternatives to single-use plastic, ranging from reusable water bottles, shopping bags and coffee cups and reducing disposable cutlery, plates and packaging.

Still, UNEP cautions that the scale of the plastic pollution problem “demands a global response.” As an example, the equivalent of one garbage truck of litter is dumped in the sea every minute, amounting to eight million tonnes of plastic that ends up in the world’s oceans. Over the next five years, the Campaign aims to create “unstoppable momentum” towards a truly circular economy. UNEP Executive Director said the Campaign is working to “redefine the world’s relationship with plastics” and transform the way humans consume plastics to secure the health of the world’s oceans.

As of April 2018, the following countries had signed on to the Clean Seas Campaign: Bahrain; Barbados; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica, Denmark; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; Finland; France; Grenada; Iceland; Indonesia; Israel; Italy; Jordan; Kenya; Kiribati; Madagascar; the Maldives; Malta; Montenegro; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Oman; Panama; Peru; the Philippines; Poland; Saint Lucia; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; South Africa; Spain; Sri Lanka; Sudan; Sweden; United Kingdom; and Uruguay.

94,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-solo,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Solo’,"Watching Disney’s Solo is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers.

In the 40-plus years since Star Wars took the box office and pop culture by storm, no plot point or line of dialogue, however essential or trivial, has avoided endless scrutiny and second-guessing from fans and skeptics alike.

How could the Death Star’s catastrophic vulnerability, so obvious that Rebel analysts spotted it immediately, have been overlooked by Imperial engineers? How could Han Solo boast that the Millennium Falcon “made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” when a parsec is a unit of distance, not time?

Watching Disney’s Rogue One and Solo, the two stand-alone “Star Wars Story” movies that come without episode numbers and opening crawls, is a little like watching the legendary Dutch Boy trying to plug the leaks in the dike with his fingers … as new leaks burst all around him.

Rogue One proposed that the Death Star’s weakness was secretly intentionally engineered by an Imperial saboteur. Yet, when the saboteur contacted the Rebels, he inexplicably didn’t simply tell them the vulnerability, potentially pre-empting the horrific battle for the plans and the whole plot of Star Wars. (That’s before we get to Darth Vader in Star Wars arguing, “If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?” when, following Rogue One, he should be saying “LOL, I literally chased you here from the scene of the crime.”)

Now, thanks to Solo, “making the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs” finally makes sense. It’s just that, also thanks to Solo, it makes no sense for Han to cite this as evidence that the Falcon is a fast ship. Given Solo’s version of the Kessel Run affair, the Falcon could be the slowest hunk of junk in the galaxy and still do it in under 12 parsecs. Speed is literally irrelevant. Han’s curious boast is emptier than ever.

If it seems disproportionate to spend four or five paragraphs in this review basically addressing one line in another movie, consider that Solo spends possibly 45 minutes basically addressing the same line — and still makes a hash of it.

I will write this review in less than a day, for a paycheck that is less than 1/100th the cost of a single second of Solo’s running time. (With a reported $250 million budget, Solo is the most expensive Star Wars movie ever made. The average cost of each second of its 135-minute screen time is more than $38,000.) More people will watch Solo on opening day than will ever read this review. So, really, what’s disproportionate?

Co-written by veteran Lawrence Kasdan and his son Jonathan, directed with unswerving vanilla competence by Ron Howard (taking the reins after Lego Movie maestros Phil Lord and Christopher Miller lost a no-confidence vote with Disney brass), Solo isn’t terrible by any means.

We meet young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) as an orphaned delinquent surviving the mean streets of Corellia with his girlfriend Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke). In the course of time, each of them winds up in the company of interplanetary criminals. Han joins a gang of outlaws led by a cantankerous desperado named Beckett (Woody Harrelson), while Qi’ra becomes right-hand girl to the silky-voiced crime lord Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany).

Fans will be rewarded with decent accounts of how Han and Chewbacca first met and how Han won the Falcon fair and square from the flamboyant gambler Lando Calrissian, played with wit and charisma by a terrific Donald Glover. There are also answers to questions no one was asking, like where the surname “Solo” came from. (Turns out it’s not just an on-the-nose character name.)

If that last is a bit of a groaner, there’s nothing here like the wince-inducing dialogue or wooden acting of George Lucas’s prequel trilogy. On the other hand, there’s nothing like their visionary quality either.

It may be hard to recall, but there was a time when one of the main pleasures of a Star Wars movie, including the prequels, was being taken to places the likes of which no movie had ever taken us and seeing things we had never seen before.

From the seemingly endless underbelly of the Imperial Star Destroyer in Star Wars’ opening shot to The Empire Strikes Back’s chaotic 3-D obstacle-course chase sequence through an asteroid field, from the groundbreaking puppet work of Yoda and Jabba the Hutt to the breathtaking cityscapes of the Naboo capital and Courscant, Star Wars was always dazzling us with unprecedented visions and vistas.

Technological innovation was responsible for a lot of that visual novelty, of course, but poetic imagination was also part of the equation.

J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens at least offered a few memorably evocative images, like the immense hulk of a long-ruined Star Destroyer on the surface of Rey’s home planet. Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi had, among other things, that haunting silent sequence in which Laura Dern’s character singlehandedly took out the enemy flagship by ramming it at light speed.

Is there a single novel visual in Solo that lingers in the imagination?

Perhaps the sinuous, spine-like articulated monorail train wending its way around snowcapped mountains in the train robbery set piece — a Western-inspired sequence honoring Han’s gunslinger vibe — expands our visual horizons a bit. I’m at a loss to think of much else.

And even that train robbery sequence doesn’t have the visual impact it could have, partly because, like so much of the movie, it’s bleakly underlit and has a flat, washed-out look.

Where Revenge of the Sith was full of (what looked like) spectacular golden-hour late-afternoon cinematography, a lot of Solo is set in dull, hazy landscapes bereft of sunlight or shadows. For a film that’s supposed to be a sort of space Western, that’s an odd choice.

Solo is the first film in the new Disney franchise with a white male lead. Besides Qi’ra, there are two notable female characters: Beckett’s partner and significant other Val, played by Thandie Newton, and Lando’s robotic companion L3-37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge), a woke navigator droid whose bitterly sarcastic commentary on the subjugation of droids is an explicit extension of the implicit feminism and racial diversity of earlier installments.

Despite this lip service to diversity, Solo’s female characters fare poorly. Vague spoiler warning: One of them chooses a stupid, pointless fate in the service of an unnecessary plot point, accomplishing nothing in the process.

Another is scarcely better served, while the third makes a crucial choice that might be called empowering, but doesn’t seem to fit the character or to have the emotional impact it ought to have, especially in a film that wants to be a Han Solo origin story.

The thing is, Ehrenreich’s young Han is a far cry — too far — from the aloof Bogartesque cynic indelibly embodied by Harrison Ford through two of the first three Star Wars films. I can imagine young Han becoming colder and harder, but not becoming less empathic.

Our hero might be a slick operator and an outlaw, but he’s also a sensitive, compassionate guy. Per the astute observation of my friend Emily Snyder (of Patheos’ “Pop Feminist” blog), with whom I saw the film, it’s hard to imagine the Han whose only answer to Leia’s declaration of love was “I know” having a history of such emotional availability as we see in his relationship with Qi’ra.

On the other end of the spectrum (or at least another end) is Lando’s relationship with L3-37. L3 bluntly remarks that Lando has an unrequited romantic attraction to her. There’s even a vague exchange about how such a pairing would “work” (L3 indicates that it’s possible).

It would be one thing if it were an open question whether Lando’s feelings were real or a figment of L3’s overheated cybernetic imagination. But no, clearly his “love” is true. This is how Disney says “Love is love” in a Star Wars movie in 2018.

“Everybody needs someone,” says Val. Her interracial relationship with Beckett is a welcome Star Wars first, I think, given that Billy Dee Williams’ Lando got nowhere with Leia. If Leia were at all flattered by Lando’s admiration, she might have felt differently had she known just how undiscriminating his tastes could be.

It’s not a total waste of time. There’s a clever plot twist or two and some worthwhile creature design. Ehrenreich’s performance is engaging on its own terms, and the film takes a big leap forward when Glover shows up.

Is that enough? For a certain type of Star Wars fan, it may be. It has to be. This is what Star Wars is now — and what it will be for the foreseeable future.

95,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word,"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Pope Francis: A Man of His Word’,"Veteran filmmaker Wim Wenders’ documentary sets out to connect the dots from one of the Church’s most beloved saints to the current pope.

Pope Francis: A Man of His Word opens with a God’s-eye view on a city that is neither Rome nor Buenos Aires. It is Assisi, where a visionary named Francis challenged all of Christendom with his radical reappropriation of the Gospel: his joyful celebration of the evangelical counsels, his enthusiastic embrace of poverty and of the poor and outcast, his celebration of the natural world, and his peacemaking efforts between Christians and Muslims, including his famed visit to the Sultan al-Kamil.

Wim Wenders, whose eclectic career has embraced arthouse dramas, documentaries, music videos and concert films, approaches the subject of his latest nonfiction film from an unusual perspective: the significance of an unprecedented papal name.

St. Francis of Assisi has long been among the most beloved of Catholic saints, even among those who don’t share his faith, and his most consequential 21st-century namesake remains popular among both Catholics and non-Catholics. Wenders sets out to connect the dots between the medieval Italian friar and the 21st-century Argentinian Pope, making the case that behind their widespread appeal is a message the world needs to hear.

A movie is only as good as its villain, and Wenders’ opening voice-over invokes nothing less than the problem of suffering and evil: natural disasters; terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; threats to the environment and extinction of species. Against this backdrop the “radical answers” of these two men named Francis stand out with fresh urgency.

Neither the life nor the papacy of the former Jorge Bergoglio is Wenders’ subject. Instead, Pope Francis focuses on characteristic themes of his preaching and teaching — particularly those most accessible to viewers of any faith or of none — as well as the engaging personality and common touch with which he advocates them.

These include Francis’ advocacy for the poor, immigrants and refugees; the perils of consumerism and the problem of unjust distribution of wealth; stewardship of the environment and an integral ecology; the horror of war and international arms trade; and the importance of understanding and peaceful coexistence among the world’s religions.

Francis himself brings these themes to viewers, looking and speaking straight into the camera in excerpts of interviews shot for the film in various Vatican City locations, including the Vatican Gardens. Intercut with these interview clips are images from globe-hopping pastoral visits to the Americas, Africa, the Philippines and elsewhere, with the Pope interacting with children, prisoners, hospital volunteers, refugees and disaster victims. The flow of images is subtly enhanced by an unobtrusive string-based score (mostly bowed instruments with an occasional guitar).

As a final touch, Wenders highlights the Franciscan foundations of the Pope’s concerns with evocative footage shot to look like clips from some lost silent-era St. Francis movie that I now wish really existed. (Wenders cross-fades into the first of these clips, shot on a hand-cranked camera from the 1920s, from one of Giotto’s frescoes in the Upper Church of Assisi’s Basilica of St. Francis which the silent footage matches perfectly.)

Focusing on Franciscan answers to global problems means, on the one hand, that Pope Francis is wholly positive in tone. Whatever tensions exist between Francis’ message and his personal failings, or whatever stumbles, gaffes or controversy have marked his papacy, are beyond the scope of Wenders’ interest.

As Pope Francis talks about the horrific crime of child sexual abuse and the necessity of holding accountable guilty priests and complicit bishops, viewers may think of the still-unfolding crisis in Chile, regarding which the Pope has acknowledged “grave errors” on his part, but the film leaves viewers to wrestle with such tensions on their own.

On the other hand, Wenders’ approach truncates Francis’ thought in various ways.

For one thing, there’s little sense of the theological vision underpinning his preaching. Little is said about Jesus — a reference to Jesus crucified in a discussion of theodicy is a notable exception — and nothing at all about Satan or hell, topics particularly notable in the Pope’s preaching.

Ideological selectivity is a factor. The controversial line “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord … who am I to judge him?” is included, but not Francis’ critical views on gender theory. The environmental and economic concerns of Laudato Si (Care for Our Common Home) are emphasized, but there’s no mention of Francis’ indictment of abortion as part of the “throwaway culture.”

And while viewers will learn that Francis is against “proselytizing,” they won’t hear his positive exhortations regarding evangelization.

The full scope of Francis’ thought has something to challenge almost everyone. The film rightly highlights themes and ideas that are stumbling blocks to some on the right — Donald Trump boosters may bristle at the Pope’s criticism of “building walls,” and Wenders himself adds a dig at “alternative facts” — but the members of U2 (who recently endorsed the move to legalize abortion in their native Ireland) could nod their heads pretty much through the whole film.

Maybe not the whole film. Rare exceptions include dismissive remarks about feminism and men’s movements as “isolated” and opposed to sexual complementarity and reciprosity. Even when Francis goes on to talk benignly about the importance of women in leadership roles, his language may sound a bit jarring to more progressive American and European ears.

Not incidentally, the film paints a similarly selective and even misleading portrait of St. Francis, along the usual lines noted by G.K. Chesterton on the first page of his excellent little sketch Saint Francis of Assisi, as a proto-archetype of “all that is most liberal and sympathetic in the modern mood; the love of nature; the love of animals; the sense of social compassion; the sense of the spiritual dangers of prosperity and even of propriety … a sort of morning star of the Renaissance.”

Such hitches and omissions notwithstanding, there’s no avoiding the power of Pope Francis’ genuineness, his expansive Christian humanism and his rapport with people of all walks of life. His celebrated turns of picturesque speech are in evidence: “spiritual Alzheimer’s disease”; “living with the accelerator down”; “globalization of indifference.”

More than once we see tears on people’s faces — and, while one might suspend judgment at the sight of a politician brushing away a tear as the Pope addresses a joint session of Congress, tears on an inmate’s tattooed face as Francis embraces and preaches to prisoners or washes and kisses their (also tattooed) feet on Holy Thursday are another matter.

The mystery of suffering and evil looms above all in a 2014 papal visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem and a 2015 multireligious gathering at Lower Manhattan’s 9/11 Memorial.

Similarly, in pastoral visits to a volunteer-run hospital in the Central African Republic, a typhoon-devastated Philippines and a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, Francis’ active solidarity with those who suffer evokes, however dimly, the Crucified Jesus to whom he pointed when asked about the problem of evil.

Some of the most memorable images emerge from these somber visits: Francis praying silently at Auschwitz or standing in a light rain wearing a translucent yellow plastic raincoat, clasping the hands of an elderly Filipino woman (also in yellow plastic) as she reverently kisses his hands.

There are also lighter moments, such as a droll Q&A with schoolchildren and a gentle papal exhortation to parents to play and waste time with their children.

The film ends with Francis citing a prayer he says he prays daily (ascribing it, following a popular misconception, to St. Thomas More) that includes a petition for a sense of humor. The last shot, of Francis grinning broadly into the camera, lingers long after the credits roll.

If Pope Francis: A Man of His Word isn’t the documentary final word on the 266th pope, in a way it’s something better: It’s a winsome, challenging call to take the Gospel more seriously and to work to make the world around us a little bit better.

96,https://nationvalleynews.com/2018/05/17/sdg-ambulance-numbers-slashed-paramedics-begin-strike/,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Nation Valley News,SDG ambulance numbers slashed as paramedics begin strike,"CORNWALL & SDG — Many fewer ambulances are on the road now that the paramedics serving Cornwall and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry have begun legal strike action.

The paramedics are among 230 Cornwall city workers that went on strike this morning. The city, mandated provider to SDG of ambulance and a number of other services, failed to negotiate an agreement with involved union locals of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

As a result of the impasse, fewer ambulances and paramedics will be maintaining emergency service coverage in both Cornwall and the surrounding United Counties.

The city concedes that only three ambulances will respond to urgent and emergent calls during the day, down from the regular complement of nine. The nighttime roster drops from the usual six to just two union-staffed ambulances for the whole of SDG and the city. The cuts are imposed as per a previously negotiated “essential services agreement,” mandated by the province, that partly limits paramedics’ right to strike.

Echoing a warning issued by the United Counties, the city says that residents should only call 911 for medical in the event of “severe emergencies such as shortness of breath, chest pain, major traumatic injury or unconsciousness.” It advises taking a personal vehicle or taxi to the hospital, calling Telehealth Ontario toll-free at 1-866-797-0000, visiting a pharmacy, clinic, or doctor as alternatives to calling an ambulance.

“We have reached out to our partners, including area hospitals, fire services, police and taxi companies to ask for their assistance in responding to non-emergency calls during the strike,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services. “We hope this will allow us to focus on emergency calls only.”

During the strike action, no routine ambulance transfers will take place. But in the event of a “major emergency,” striking paramedics will still be called onto the job, the city assures.

“It certainly didn’t need to come to this,” said Amanda Palieps, president of paramedic local CUPE 5734, “but the City walked away from us on Tuesday afternoon and we didn’t see them or hear from them at all on Wednesday. We needed to be talking to hammer out a deal. It takes dialogue to bargain. Their absence tells us they were not serious about avoiding a strike.”

Main issues in the dispute include concessions sought by the City, and wages remain outstanding as well, according to the union.

Inside workers, represented by CUPE local 3251, have a strike deadline of May 23. Should they join their co-workers on the picket line next week, an additional 150 workers will be off the job.

“The city made what they called a ‘final offer’ on Tuesday,” said Alison Denis, CUPE National Representative. “Whatever they choose to call it, it contained all the same problems that yielded a 93 percent strike vote two months ago. Our members gave us a resounding direction with that strike vote. We’re very willing to try and find a resolution that works for both parties. But that would require the City to be here, actually bargaining. That is how this strike will get resolved.”

The paramedics have been without a contract since 2016.

Members of CUPE Local 1792, who work at long-term care home Glen Stor Dun Lodge, have also reached an impasse in their negotiations, but as they do not have the right to strike, their issues will be resolved by interest arbitration, according to the union.

It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized. The prioritized SDGs are: SDG 2 on zero hunger, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 15 on life on land, and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

Per its summary, the Republic of Congo established a steering committee in charge of following-up on the SDGs, and is preparing an action plan for SDG implementation that should provide information on related costs for their implementation. It notes mobilizing funding for the effective and efficient operationalization of the SDGs as one of the main challenges facing the country.

Senegal’s messages note that the process of alignment between the SDGs and the ‘Plan for an Emerging Senegal’ (PES)– a policy framework to get Senegal onto the road to development in 2035 –was launched in January 2016 by the government. Its priority actions cover nearly 77% of the SDG targets. It also reports that “inclusive” mechanisms, such as an SDG monitoring platform for CSOs, were established, but that participation of some stakeholders such as the private sector, parliamentarians and local elected representatives, should be further strengthened.

In its messages, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announces that the SDGs and sustainability will be a central focus of Expo 2020 Dubai, and its SDG National Committee serves as a platform for multi‐stakeholder engagement. The Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, is vice-chaired by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, and comprises 17 federal government organizations, according to the VNR messages.

On progress related to SDG implementation, the UAE indicates that the SDG National Committee has: prioritized targets “to pursue on an annual basis;” determined criteria for incorporating SDG targets into the national development agenda; assessed the scope of SDG implementation “given resource capacities and constraints in a particular year;” and developed a comprehensive communication strategy to engage societal stakeholders on the SDGs. The UAE also notes that: a Private‐Sector Advisory Council reports to the vice‐chair of the SDG National Committee; it has a Minister of State for Youth Affairs; it launched the Emirates Youth Council; and seven emirate‐wide Local Youth Councils are involved in official deliberations concerning SDG implementation.

Viet Nam states that the 17 SDGs have been nationalized into 115 Vietnamese SDG targets and in its national action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It adds that sustainable development principles have been mainstreamed into its 2011-2020 Social and Economic Development Strategy and its 2016-2020 Social and Economic Development Plan. The country’s key messages note that the Viet Nam Business Council for Sustainable Development aims to enable the business community to share and spread good practices, and to play an “important role” in realizing the SDGs.

Per the messages, Viet Nam has a number of policies aimed at promoting social equality to ensure that no one is left behind, and the country has achieved a number of SDG-related results. For instance, its national multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.9% in 2015 to less than 7% in 2017; 93.4% of households in 2016 had access to safe water, and 99% of Vietnamese households had access to electricity during the same year.

Colombia’s executive summary notes that in addition to the SDG initiatives it reported on in its 2016 VNR, it has developed a national strategy (CONPES 3918) to implement the goals. The strategy, it says, includes, inter alia: a monitoring process with national indicators and quantifiable targets; institutional responsibilities; a plan for strengthening statistical capacities; and a communication strategy seeking to promote alliances with non-governmental actors.

The summary indicates that the website www.ods.gov.co comprises updated information on the country’s progress towards the goals, and that a mapping of resources from different public domestic sources and their allocation to each SDG has been prepared as a starting point for the development of a financing strategy. It also reports that a joint initiative is being developed with the private sector where companies can provide information that will enable them to make their SDG support more visible, and dialogues took place in different parts of the country to highlight SDG challenges and successful experiences.

According to its main messages, Ecuador has developed SDG “Flagship Interventions,” and has established mechanisms for the alignment, monitoring and evaluation of its planning with the 2030 Agenda. Among the SDGs to be examined in depth at the HLPF 2018, the VNR messages report that: guaranteeing universal access to water (SDG 6) is a priority for the Ecuadorian government and the “Safe Water and Sanitation for All” strategy is being implemented; and various programmes have contributed to maintain more than 16% of the national territory under conservation or environmental management (SDG 15). The messages also note that the VNR’s preparation was based on contributions from the government, private sector, academia, civil society and local governments.

Andorra reports that each “action” submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval must be associated with the SDGs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aligned its annual master plan for international cooperation with the goals. Its VNR summary notes that the Andorran private and financial sectors have integrated the 2030 Agenda into their social responsibility strategies, and education for sustainable development is a key concept of the Andorran education system, which it says, also integrates in a transversal way, education for human rights and democratic citizenship. It stresses the need to strengthen the production of statistical data, adding that the government has approved it statistical plan 2018-2021.

On SDGs examined in the VNR, Andorra says that in addition to the six goals reviewed in depth at the 2018 HLPF, it has also included Goals 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action), which are of particular importance for the country. On the VNR preparation, the Andorra’s summary states that an inter-ministerial team was set up to draft the report, national bodies representing civil society were asked to participate in the drafting process, and an emphasis was placed on the collection of statistical data. It also reports on the launch of a public consultation on the Internet and on an awareness and information campaign on the VNR.

100,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-migrants-refugees-and-data/,"Mon, 25 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Migrants, Refugees and Data","With the struggles of migrants and refugees dominating news cycles, this SDG Knowledge Weekly brief collates knowledge pieces on the subject and brings earlier reports to the fore, to shed light on the issues anew.



The 2030 Agenda recognizes the positive contributions of migrants. In the declaration, heads of state and government commit to “cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights” (paragraph 29), which is similar to language used in SDG target 10.7. The SDG Knowledge Hub has covered the Global Compact on Migration (GCM) process, including the most recent round of negotiations, their outcomes, additional consultations and the Secretary-General’s report, ‘Making Migration Work for All.’ This policy brief highlights research and thought pieces behind the process and issues.

At the start of the calendar year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued a publication titled, ‘World Migration Report 2018.’ The ninth of its kind, this volume “demystifies” migration, noting in its forward the heightened importance of understanding migration’s complexities in today’s “post-truth” era. Using data through June 2017, the report outlines: global migration trends; regional development; the current migration governance structure; features of current news coverage of migration; and linkages between migration, social exclusion and other hardships faced.

IOM also issued a report titled, ‘Migration in the 2030 Agenda,’ which compiles papers linking migration to thematic challenges across the SDGs. The papers suggest ways to address migration as part of efforts to implement individual Goals. As highlighted by IOM, migration is included in SDG targets 4.b, 5.2, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7, 10.c, 16.2 and 17.18.

A pilot study by IOM’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC) represents an effort to illustrate how far migrants are left behind, using harmonized census data. It discusses the potential to use such data to further monitor progress towards the SDGs, disaggregated by migratory status. SDG target 17.18 calls to increase the availability of data disaggregated by migratory status (among income, gender, age and other characteristics).

IOM GMDAC also authored a bulletin on a tool to quantify displacement and mobility. It describes IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), which aims to enable decision-making and targeted assistance in times of crisis. The DTM tracked over 30 million individuals across 72 countries in 2017, and is continuously being expanded in partnership with actors from the private sector and academia, and has fed into other reports, including the Global Report on Internal Displacement noted below. The GMDAC’s ‘Data Bulletin’ series informs the GCM process, with support from the EU.

The GMDAC previously developed Migration Governance Indicators (MGI), which have been used as a basis for assessing “well-managed migration policies,” per SDG target 10.7. The indicators help governments review the extent to which their migration policies are comprehensive, identify gaps, and advance the dialogue on migration, particularly in the context of the SDGs and the GCM. The first MGI assessment report for 15 pilot countries was released in 2016; a second report reviewing a new set of countries is forthcoming.

Also on data, the Migration Data Portal offers a tool to visualize and analyze migratory flows by country or region, as well as examine important data points on migrants’ vulnerability, well-being and remittance payments and costs. The Portal also features information on migration policy and public opinion, which can also affect other indicators such as migrants’ well-being. A summary guide is available on Data Driven Journalism. The Portal’s blog offers additional support, including a post on how to improve data on missing migrants, given the urgent need to address the more than 27,000 migrant deaths and disappearances recorded since 2014.

These efforts to collect and manage migration data are not implemented alone. The Global Migration Group (GMG) and Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) released a flagship publication in November 2017 with the IOM, World Bank Group, Governments of Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, and the broader UN system. The report is divided into four parts: concepts and criteria on migration; reasons for migration; linkages between migration and development; and protection of migrants. Titled, ‘Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ the report aims to be the go-to guide for integrating migrant priorities, policies and data into national development plans and strategies. It synthesizes best practices and lessons learned across the 16 GMG members, highlighting data needs, sources and gaps, and calling for common measures that allow comparisons migration patterns across countries and regions.

The KNOMAD partnership publishes regularly on ‘Migration and Development,’ and released its 29th brief on the subject in April 2018. This brief focuses on migration and remittances, reviewing trends in remittance and migration flows and the topic of “transit migration” where migrants temporarily stay in a country other than their intended final destination. The brief describes reasons for transit migration (both push and pull factors), regional patterns, and transit migration’s impacts on individuals, families, and the three countries involved (origin, transit and destination). The brief also notes that a significant percentage of transit migration is facilitated by smugglers. A full list of KNOMAD publications is available here.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released a report that finds over 2.5 million migrants were smuggled worldwide in 2016. Titled ‘Global Study on Smuggling of Migrants,’ the publication describes major smuggling routes around the world, and quantifies the scope of the issue, estimating that smugglers are collectively paid over US$7 billion per year. It underscores that smugglers expose migrants to risks including violence, theft, exploitation, kidnapping and death.

June 20 marked World Refugee Day. Released one day prior, the UN Refugee Agency’s (UNHCR) ‘Global Trends’ report examines forced displacement in 2017. It finds that over 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced as of the end of 2017, 16.2 million of them being displaced that year. More than half of displaced persons are children. Of these figures, the report notes that 40 million people are internally displaced, 25.4 million are refugees who have fled their home countries to escape conflict, and 3.1 million are asylum seekers.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released a publication titled, ‘Global Report on Internal Displacement.’ The report focuses on the global displacement landscape and regional overviews, progress in reducing internal displacement, and the need for better data. It flags displacement from natural disasters as a key driver within countries, noting the issue as “both a cause and consequence of insecurity and low or unequal economic and social development.” The report sees national sovereignty as an opportunity, calling for country-led strategies to account for internal displacement risk, build governance capacity and integrate the risk into existing mechanisms. Harjeet Singh, ActionAid International, flags the report’s coverage of climate migration in an op-ed on IPS News. Separately, IOM’s Environmental Migration Portal also serves as a platform to share knowledge on the migration-environment nexus.

In its discussion on the budget for 2021-2027, the EU is proposing a near-tripling of funds for migration, asylum and border management. The Center for Global Development reviews the proposal here. Stay tuned for more on the EU budget and aid in the coming weeks.

In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs.

VNR main messages were also available for Palestine, a UN observer State.

Countries have taken various approaches to highlight their main messages: some mainly focus on the SDGs under review at the 2018 HLPF, while others take a broader approach by referring to the 17 SDGs as a whole. Two highlight that they are considering an 18th SDG, specific to the national context. Countries generally outline efforts to implement the SDGs at the national level, while a few report on implementation efforts at the sub-national level and on integrating the SDGs as part of their international development frameworks.

At the sub-regional level, it reports that: by May 2018, 28 out of 32 Mexican states had SDG monitoring mechanisms in place; the federal government has developed a guide to incorporate the 2030 Agenda approach into state and municipal development plans; but capacity of sub-national governments need to be strengthened.

Paraguay says it has been working since 2016 to advance the alignment of the National Expenditure Budget with its national development plan ‘Paraguay 2030’ and the SDGs, and has created the Inter-institutional Coordination Commission for the implementation, follow-up and monitoring of the SDGs, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Related to the SDGs to be reviewed in depth at the HLPF, Uruguay reports that 95.2% of its population has access to safe water, and it is one of the most electrified countries in Latin America. It also indicates that work related to raising awareness on the SDGs was initiated in 2017.

Australia stresses the value of a “fair go,” calling for action on fairness, justice and equality of opportunity, and adding that the government has adopted an approach to the SDGs that gives policy responsibilities and priorities to the “relevant” agencies and levels of decision. Its 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, it says, highlights Australia’s responsibility to contribute to global efforts to reduce poverty, alleviate suffering and promote sustainable development.

Canada notes its commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs at home and abroad. It reports that: federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how their policies and programs are contributing to the SDGs and their targets; Canada’s 2018 Federal Budget allocated new funds to establish an SDG Unit to track Canada’s progress on the SDGs; the government will mainstream a gender-responsive perspective in the implementation of the SDGs; and it will launch a process to develop a national strategy on the 2030 Agenda through collaboration with all levels of government, Indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders.

Exiting a period of “prolonged economic crisis,” Greece says the country has endorsed eight national priorities for adapting the SDGs to national needs and circumstances, in line with the recent adoption of the National Growth Strategy, and it plans to implement a “whole-of-government” approach coordinated by an Inter-Ministerial Coordination Network, steered by the General Secretariat of the Government. It also plans to develop a National Implementation Plan for the SDGs in 2019, by engaging “all stakeholders at all stages,” and to involve actively the Hellenic Parliament in the overall SDG follow-up and review process.

Ireland says its VNR addresses the 17 SDGs at the national and global levels, it has mapped existing policies and programmes against each of the 169 SDG sub-targets, and a national stakeholder forum will have its inaugural meeting in June 2018. It notes that its SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 is a framework for SDG implementation, and announces that the government will publish a new White Paper on International Development in the second half of 2018 to further strengthen the alignment of Ireland’s aid programme with the SDGs.

Malta says the Sustainable Development Act adopted by the government in 2012 mandates the government to mainstream sustainable development in its policies, and the government plans to launch ‘Vision 2050,’ as a framework for the mainstreaming of sustainable development across all levels of government. On institutional arrangements, Spain indicates that a High Level Group on Inter-Ministerial Coordination, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, reports directly to the President of the Government on progress related to the 2030 Agenda’s implementation. It also notes that an Action Plan for the Implementation of 2030 Agenda assigns Ministerial responsibilities for each SDG, and the Autonomous Communities and local entities have been asked to localize the Agenda.

UN Observer State

Palestine reports that its Council of Ministers issued a decree establishing a national team headed by the Prime Minister’s Office and “composed of all relevant partners” to head SDG monitoring and implementation. It says its National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 includes 75 of the SDG targets, and it has adopted a set of principles to ensure the active participation of non-governmental actors in SDG implementation. Palestine proposes a 18th SDG on “Ending the occupation, and the consolidation of the independent State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” and states that “the continuation” of Israel’s occupation, and its “systematic and widespread violations of international law” is the biggest impediment for Palestine to achieve the SDGs.”

The HLPF will take place from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, and will consider the theme, ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’ VNRs will be presented during the Forum’s ministerial segment, from 16-18 July.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever. WHO announced that the number of new cases fell in April and May, meaning that the outbreak is no longer a national health emergency. [UN Press Release on Lassa Fever]

On 17 May, the UN marked the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) with a message urging an end to discrimination against LGBTI people. In conjunction with the Day, UNAIDS noted that men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the communities most affected by HIV. However, UN agencies report that more than 40% of countries criminalize same-sex relationships, effectively blocking gay and lesbian people from accessing healthcare and social services. UN Women, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UNAIDS are working with the Global Network of People Living with HIV to end HIV-related discrimination and epidemics of AIDS by 2030. [UN Press Release on IDAHOT]

On 4 June, UN General Assembly President Miroslav Lajcak convened an interactive civil society hearing in New York, US as part of the preparatory process for the high-level meeting on fighting tuberculosis, which takes place on 26 September 2018. Lajcak had previously advised Marie Chatardová, President of the UN Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), that negotiations towards an outcome document from the high-level meeting would begin in early June. [Summary of 23 May Meeting]","On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status.

The 2017 annual report is the fourth annual progress report on the implementation of UN-Habitat’s six-year strategic plan (2014-2019). The publication focuses on: ongoing processes related to strengthening UN-Habitat; specific challenges related to urbanization and human settlements and UN-Habitat’s response strategy; and UN-Habitat’s coordination role of monitoring and assessing implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the NUA.

Among the examples of the organization’s work in 2017, the report discusses UN-Habitat’s contribution to conflict resolution through addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus in Iraq, helping to reintegrate Yazidis, who have been victims of ethnic and religious violence. In alignment with SDG 11, other SDGs with urban dimensions and the NUA, UN-Habitat: provided emergency relief supplies such as water; constructed sanitation and health facilities; provided emergency shelter; and built capacities of local and national authorities in urban planning and management.

In an effort to promote the central role of housing in ensuring the sustainable development of cities and human settlements, UN-Habitat helped develop a Global Housing Strategy to assist countries in adopting strategies, policies and legislation for sustainable urbanization that ensures citizen engagement. For example, in Mexico, UN-Habitat helped provide housing by introducing a mechanism for measuring city prosperity, enabling the city of Zapopan to adopt a strategy that ensured the centrality of housing and individuals to all urban planning initiatives.

UN-Habitat coordinates monitoring and assessment of implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the New Urban Agenda.

To advance the SDGs by reaching out to low-income populations, UN-Habitat partnered with Infonavit, a Latin American mortgage lender, to ensure access to affordable mortgage financing. The report also highlights UN-Habitat and Infonavit’s collaboration on establishing an SDG Certification Programme for Housing, which will assess the compatibility of real estate development projects with relevant SDGs, particularly SDG 11, and provide real estate developers with greater incentives to develop projects that comply with the SDGs.

The report also discusses UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index (CPI), which offers tools for cities to formulate policies. The Index has been adapted to respond to SDG and NUA monitoring and reporting, and helps harmonize methodologies with agreed standards and indicators. The report explains that, inter alia: over 400 cities are implementing the CPI; 52 national statistical offices are using UN-Habitat’s tools and guidelines producing urban data and indicators that support SDG monitoring and reporting; 181 national and local authorities and partners have implemented sustainable urbanization plans and strategies; and 374 urban observatories are using UN-Habitat tools, methods and data in monitoring urban trends at national and local levels.

The report notes that mainstreaming UN-Habitat’s four cross-cutting issues (youth, gender, climate change and human rights) requires that every project contribute to the NUA and the SDGs.

According to the report, UN-Habitat’s financial performance on urban land legislation and governance reflects the importance of land in sustainable urbanization, risk reduction and rehabilitation. In addition to urban land issues, the Bank met or exceeded its implementation targets on research and capacity building, and development of methodologies to monitor implementation of the urban dimensions of the SDGs.

106,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-elects-next-president-ecuadors-foreign-affairs-minister/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Elects Next President: Ecuador's Foreign Affairs Minister,"5 June 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has elected María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility of Ecuador, as President of its 73rd session (2018-2019). She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

107,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/dust-disrespects-political-boundaries-lets-act-together/,"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,"Guest Article: Dust Disregards Political Boundaries, Let’s Act Together","In March this year, an unusual sand and dust storm nicknamed ‘Mars on Earth or Orange Snow[1]’ transported and deposited dust that transformed European landscapes into a surreal orange-tinted scenery. An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

The 2018 UNLEASH SDG Innovation Lab brought together 1,000 youth from 108 countries for an 8-day intense programme designed to accelerate innovative solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

The event took place from 5-6 June 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The STI Forum featured ten substantive panel discussions and a series of 90-second innovation pitches selected from numerous submissions related to the SDGs under discussion.

The STI Forum is a component of the UN’s Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The TFM also includes an Inter-Agency Task Team on STI for SDGs (IATT), a 10-Member Group, and an online platform.

Opening the meeting, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Marie Chatardova stressed the need for technologies to address the vulnerabilities of those most left behind. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Chef de Cabinet for the UN Secretary-General, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology and robotics, will generate new solutions to SDG implementation.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, said “STI roadmaps” serve as a practical building block for policy makers, the private sector, civil society and development partners to integrate STI into national development plans and budgets. He said the Bank will leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to: develop the foundation for sustainable, technology-led economies; expand the capacity of people and institutions to thrive in a society resilient in the face of disruption; and harness disruptive technology, data, and expertise to solve development challenges and manage risks.

Andrew Keen, author of ‘The Internet is Not the Answer’ and ‘How to Fix the Future,’ called for greater regulation of companies and data privacy, adding that the UN is the right place to begin this conversation. Miguel Ruíz Cabañas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mexico, called for the UN to collect and analyze information and develop best practices and exchange of information so governments can utilize technological change and AI while minimizing risks.

Arun Sundararajan, New York University, US, noted that it is not pragmatic to try to regulate online platforms, which will increasingly mediate people’s relationships with markets, but we need to negotiate with them as with institutions. He emphasized that we need to start a democratization of these platforms and ask them to come up with a clear, simple set of principles and take a positive role in society.

Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, addressed the environmental costs of technology. For example, the electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining equals the electricity use of the Czech Republic.

Peter Major, UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), said the CSTD focuses on the positive implications of big data to fight typhoid in Uganda and help farmers respond to food security and drought in India and other countries. He called for linking traditional knowledge with modern science, as well as examining ethical challenges and bridging the digital gap.

Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, United Arab Emirates (UAE), observed that, in order to achieve the SDGs, we will need to capture the data from ongoing experiments. Beyond big data, we will need access to data from other complex projects, she said. Thomas Philbeck, World Economic Forum, stressed that “the way we talk about technology matters” and asked for caution when using language that might lock us into dangerous narratives, such as fear or technology or “worshipping” technology.

For the SDGs to succeed in Africa, technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential.

Erika Kraemer-Mbula, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, stressed that for the SDGs to succeed, they need to succeed in Africa. She noted that Africa is estimated to double its population by 2050, and will have the world’s largest work force, comprised especially of youth. Microenterprises will thus be vital to employment, she said, and technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential for sustainable development. She called for thinking beyond education to learning systems that blend different types of science.

Suresh Nair, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India, gave an example reflecting the benefits of genetic engineering and biotechnology. To address the decrease in arable land as well as pressure to use less pesticides and the urgent need to increase food productivity, he highlighted “host-based resistance.” By using plants’ natural resistance, he said crop yield can increase, which lessens the pressure to convert forestland into farmland and prevents biodiversity loss. To that end, he recommended carrying out vigorous screening of crop germplasm to identify appropriate resistance against major pests and devise molecular tools to get a better understanding of insect pests.

During the Forum’s discussions, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) called for encouraging the development, transfer, and diffusion of technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms. He called for making the TFM online platform operational as soon as possible.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said internet access depends on a few major companies in the developed world, and LDCs lack the needed infrastructure to attract them. He stressed that access to information and communications technologies and the internet is essential to graduate from LDC status and not to relapse after graduation. He expressed hope that the Technology Bank for LDCs, inaugurated on 4 June 2018, will provide the LDCs with the support they need. Turkey noted that the Bank, which is hosted by Turkey, will strengthen the capacity of LDCs to scale up and deploy technology and innovation, and strengthen partnerships between governments, the private sector and other stakeholders.

Brazil called for addressing inequalities caused by the digital divide. Japan said that every country should develop an STI roadmap for each SDG to ensure no one is left behind.

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

CANBERRA — For much of the past year, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been carrying out a rigorous assessment into how businesses, government departments, civil society organizations, and more have been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. That voluntary national review, the nation’s first, looks at how SDGs are woven into all sectors — as well as the challenges faced in assessing them.

In the report launched in Sydney on June 15, Australia chose a case-study style of reporting with snapshots into activities across the 17 goals. The aim is to demonstrate both that the SDGs are a core part of government policy and services delivery, and that there is wide external support to help make the goals a success.

Australia’s SDG implementation strategy

The SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

According to the review, Australia’s approach to SDG implementation is to identify key areas of activity appropriate to Australia’s “national circumstances.” At the federal level, policy requirements will be determined by priorities delegated to government agencies or other levels of government.

Progressing the SDGs: What are the barriers and solutions to national implementation? At Australia's second Sustainable Development Goals Summit, held in Melbourne on March 13, participants highlighted a number of barriers to implementing the SDGs on a national scale, in a country that considers the goals more linked to the Millennium Development Goals than to domestic politics.

It is nearing three years since the SDGs were adopted in September 2015, yet the review finds that Australia is still engaging domestically to identify policies and programs that are contributing to the outcome of the goals.

During the report launch, Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop identified four goals of particular importance to Australia: Gender equality; inclusive and sustainable economic growth; ocean conservation; and peace and governance — goals 5, 8, 14, and 16 respectively.

“There is a very strong alignment between the SDGs and Australia,” Bishop said. “What is important, though, is that we all work in partnership, government, business, civil society, private sector, the public sector. This is an effort for us all.”

Three hundred and twelve government and nongovernment agencies were consulted for the review. Key stakeholders engaged to provide feedback for the VNR included the Australian Council for International Development, Global Compact Network Australia, United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, U.N. Association of Australia, People with Disability Australia, National Congress of Australia’s First People and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Nongovernment sectors including universities, businesses, and civil society are expected to contribute to the goals in building public awareness, as well as progressing the implementation of the SDGs “beyond ‘business as usual’ to make a real impact.”

Australia’s strengths, the report suggests, lie in innovation, technical capability, and its willingness to share knowledge with the world. Building upon this, DFAT hopes they can reduce inequality within Australia and globally.

Investigating interlinkages

Due to the cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, it is important to look at how the goals connect and where associations can be made for greater impact. Through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s work, Australia is applying this approach in their SDG implementation.

“CSIRO’s work has shown that taking such an approach, identifying both positive and negative interactions, could help us achieve global outcomes at a significantly lower cost through thoughtful coordination of otherwise fragmented action,” the report reads. “Likewise, identifying trade-offs ahead of time could enable conflicts among objectives to be managed before they become institutionalised.”

Through this work, Australia is hoping to demonstrate that the SDGs can act as a “tool” for organizations to identify and mitigate risk and opportunities outside of their core business or functions. This will allow the SDGs to move from government-supported action to whole-of-Australia supported action.

Equally, by encouraging collaboration between organizations, Australia hopes to create stronger interlinkages between the goals.

“For example, the South Australian Government’s Health in All Policies initiative takes a ‘joined-up’ policy development approach to achieve better public policy outcomes and simultaneously improve population health and wellbeing,” the report says. “Such an approach is based on the understanding that health is not just the product of health care activities, but is influenced by a wide range of social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants of health.”

What about data?

SDGs show slow progress, not on track to reach 2030 targets, UN reports Conflict and climate change drove at some of the most significant setbacks documented in the 2018 SDGs report, such as a rise in global hunger rates.

Clearly missing from the report is data demonstrating where Australia lies in relation to progress against each goal, with targets that would determine what demonstrates success domestically as well as through its foreign aid program. But the report does lay out Australia’s data strategy for the SDGs.

According to the report, Australia will need “relevant, quality and timely statistics” that provide evidence for national decision-making and policy.

“We have made concerted efforts to identify relevant, pre-existing data sets that match or closely align to the SDG Indicators,” the report says. “In line with the UN Statistical Commission guidance, Australia has approached the issue of data analysis, identification and reporting from the perspective that countries will approach the indicator framework in line with their own national priorities and capabilities.”

In identifying relevant indicators for the SDG, the Australian Bureau of Statistics undertook a data mapping exercise to identify government-held data sources that could be used as an SDG indicator. But this is not a straightforward process.

“Like other countries, Australia has challenges in identifying datasets,” the report says.

Identifying data custodians and developing a single point of truth where there are multiple custodians are important. Australia is still trying to determine data collection and analysis methodology for a number of SDG indicators that have no current accepted methodology for collection.

Domestically, Australia is working to develop an SDG data platform to make relevant government datasets on SDG indicators available and will indicate the status of Australian data collection against all 232 SDG indicators — a portal expected to be updated based on available data and information, and not a static snapshot from a point in time.

Across time, it is expected this platform will help to identify progress, becoming an SDG reporting platform to support future VNRs.

Australia’s data strategy also takes into account support for neighboring countries through the foreign aid program to enhance their ability to collect, interpret, and analyze data that will help them in determining in-country needs and progress.

Case studies to illustrate Australia’s implementation approach

For many of the case studies used in the report, SDG linkage occurs as an afterthought.

To highlight Australia’s work to support goal 15 on forest management, the report uses the Australian Business and Biodiversity Initiative, an cross-sectoral alliance of organizations promoting the mainstreaming of biodiversity into business practices and decision-making.

But the initiative was established in 2014, before the adoption of the SDGs, and therefore the linkage to the goals tenuous.

Yet the format does help to demonstrate how the SDGs are at the core of “business-as-usual” operations in Australia, as well as the diverse role individuals and organizations outside government can play in their implementation.

Highlighting the work of Plan Australia in developing Free to Be, an interactive online map to help girls and women identify safe spaces in large cities, shows that addressing social challenges is important to Australia — and encouraging these ideas and initiatives will lead to greater change that can be seen by 2030.

The response

On the whole, the VNR has been largely applauded by Australia’s NGOs, that see it as a milestone in SDG implementation. But they also see the challenges it poses — both in Australia’s policy and reporting style.

For ACFID Chief Executive Officer Marc Purcell, the report highlights the challenges Australia faces in addressing health, economic, and social issues faced by Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The environmental challenges are also great, with the Great Barrier Reef under threat from climate change and policies enabling maritime pollution. And poverty continues to grow.

Still according to Purcell, the nature of the case study report showed the value of early adopters’ work, but also showed that examples were “few and far between.”

“To have any realistic chance of achieving the goals by 2030, Australia needs to rapidly transform the way it’s working and put sustainability at its heart,” he said. “We should not be imposing the burden of our failure to act on the next generation. The time for talking has passed, now is the time for action on the SDGs.”

Australia’s VNR will officially be presented to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development at the U.N. in New York, on July 17, by Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the minister for international development and the Pacific.","Australia’s SDG implementation strategyThe SDG implementation work is led by DFAT through a whole-of-government, interdepartmental committee on the SDGs.

Photo by: Kelli Rogers / Devex

SINGAPORE — It’s day two of the annual Sustainable Development Goals innovation lab UNLEASH, and the six innovators from across the globe making up team “Shanka” seem confident with the progress they’ve made on how to boost social and emotional learning for children. But by early next morning, the bravado has seeped out and tired eyes look up from a table littered with hastily scribbled ideas. Just days away from pitching their final idea to a panel of experts, they have more questions than answers.

“We talked until late last night. We’re still in problem framing,” says team member Najmuzzaman Mohammad, chief product officer for a Bangalore-based network of impact funds.

Mohammad is one of 1,000 young people from 109 countries who participated in the annual innovation lab that began May 31. The carefully selected millennial thought leaders gathered in classrooms and halls at various university campuses across Singapore, aiming to address some of the biggest global problems. In just five days, 170 teams of former strangers worked to define their own unique problem related to the SDGs — and come up with a viable solution.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively.” — Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group

Working under a time crunch and governed by a precise methodology, participants in self-directed groups presented their progress to facilitators to pass through “gates” to the next stage of innovation. It’s a unique model, not only because it brings young talents together from around the world, but also because the ultimate goal is not necessarily the ideas or products pitched on the final day of the event.

Moving forward, participants will have access to an online platform to stay connected with each other, as well as with the expertise and financial muscle of corporations, think tanks, foundations, nonprofits, and angel investors. UNLEASH partner Deloitte has also promised seed funding and pro bono services to three to five of the solutions developed in Singapore. But the lab is less about the pitch, and more about investing in a movement — one that will generate 13,000 UNLEASH innovators by the time the lab finishes its final year in 2030.

“This has been more about seeing how can we mobilize some really, really smart young people to down the road become a force of nature collectively,” said Henrik Skovby, executive chairman of the Dalberg Group, who helped develop the UNLEASH idea and garnered support from about 250 partner organizations to make it happen.

The process

On Sunday, the “Water Lead” team — a group of five women scientists and engineers from four continents — is back at square one after spending eight hours “thinking too big,” explained Jen Loudon, a wastewater laboratory technician from the United States.

“We took three steps back … but we’re about to take five forward,” her Australian teammate Lisa Walpole told Devex.

To create an environment for innovation and spur creativity in just one week, the event in Singapore was highly curated. In fact, “a lot of this is actually down to minute plans,” Skovby said of the structured schedule that details activities from the moment talents arrive until their departure.

As a result, “there's very limited chance of this not succeeding,” he said in terms of participants having a positive experience and walking away with an understanding of the innovation methodology. “If there is something that doesn't work on the logistical side for you, it takes away focus. So everything we can do, we do.”

To start, UNLEASH flies 1,000 talents — chosen from a competitive pool of 7,500 applicants — from all over the world to a new city every year and puts them up for a week. The event costs about $4 million, without factoring in in-kind contributions. Covering all costs ensures the diversity in income and education level of its participants, which the lab considers its most fundamental aspect and biggest draw.

The innovation process is broken up into five stages, managed by facilitators from partners such as Dalberg, Deloitte, the United Nations Development Programme and expert consultants in this year’s eight focus areas: Zero hunger, education, health, water, energy, cities and communities, responsible supply chains, and climate action. A thick deck of activity cards prompts participants through problem framing, ideation, prototyping, testing, and implementing.

Every day, the teams must present their progress to a lead facilitator in order to move to the next stage of innovation. It isn’t easy, and many of the teams at UNLEASH will revisit problem framing multiple times throughout the process — while some might not graduate to ideation at all. The Water Lead team tried and failed to pass their gate on day three, but the exercise and ensuing conversation with facilitators prompted them to think differently about the issue they’d chosen to tackle: Lead-contaminated water and ensuing health concerns due to unregulated mining in Nigeria.

“I hate exercises in futility, but I think actually without going through everything we went through yesterday, we wouldn’t be able to narrow it down to what could work versus what just isn’t feasible at all,” Loudon said.

Nigerian teammate Adesinerola Adio-Adepoju, who brought the problem of lead contamination in her country to the table, described the process as a roller coaster, and a lesson in patience: “It’s almost like UNLEASH did this intentionally,” she told Devex. “They want you to get to that point where you boil over, just so you get all the bad energy out of your system so you come back to cool. We boiled over last night, and now we are cooling off, it’s good.”

The personal

On day five, Team Shanka’s Mohammad is tired, but optimistic. The group set the activity cards aside, he said, and spent a night sharing experiences from their own childhoods to spark ideas about what it takes to teach empathy and compassion at a young age.

“We actually developed a passion for it after we shared a story and realized, ‘this is something that we really need to work on because this has affected each of us.’”

Working with a team of six people sharing insights from six different countries is challenging, but it also provides more confidence that they’ve identified a strong problem to solve, he added.

Every year will see changes to the UNLEASH model as the secretariat responds to participant feedback. This year included a bigger focus on personality and team building, explained Murrayl Berner, UNLEASH 2018 innovation lab lead.

“This is an incredibly passionate set of individuals, and they're amazing and wonderful and talented in their own right — and they're also human,” Berner said. “So, you show up at something like this, you're incredibly jet lagged, you're out of your element.”

On day one, talents were prompted to identify whether they were a “thinker,” “sayer,” “doer,” or “feeler,” as well as to write down their motivating reason for participating. Equipped with this insight, along with talents’ professional backgrounds, facilitators then created diverse groups within each SDG topic area. It has become UNLEASH tradition that the ideation of team names and team charters happens long before any SDG solutions.

This year also gave the talents a chance to escape their own thematic area and chat about each other’s solutions in an idea marketplace in downtown Singapore: “Again, it's not about one team, it's about everybody, about the process and the connections and the learning,” Berner said.

Team Shanka’s socioemotional learning app for parents didn’t win them a chance to pitch in the finals, although it will be featured in the UNLEASH Solutions Catalogue, along with all the of the ideas that came out of the lab this year.

Mohammad sees room for improvement in the innovation methodology, which he felt was too broad, with activity cards prompting far more than can be accomplished in five days. He suggested UNLEASH bring in more veteran entrepreneurs to weigh in on the process design. And according to Skovby, it sounds like that will be part of UNLEASH’s future. Already, several talents who participated in Denmark flew to Singapore to act as facilitators, and 2019 will see the addition of an advanced track for entrepreneurs who have already developed a product that needs acceleration.

“It will be for you guys,” Skovby told the audience of talents at the final pitch competition, where eight teams — ranging from a social media-based sex education program to a system of nets that can help reduce farmers’ food waste — walked away with the title of top innovation of the week. “For people who have done good stuff throughout the year, we will invite again to come to UNLEASH.”

On Tuesday’s pitch day, the Water Lead team shared their solution of a simple, low-cost water treatment system for removal of heavy metals in rural Nigeria’s water supply. They didn’t advance to the final “Dragon’s Den” pitch competition, where the top spot for water went to a team that designed a safe latrine solution for a slum in South Africa.

Still, Adio-Adepoju got what she wanted out of the week, she told Devex: “I didn’t come here with a solution, I came here with a problem. I don’t have all the answers, but with young professionals in these many different fields, chances are you will talk to somebody who can provide feedback or a different insight. I feel like this is my United Nations.”

The reporter traveled to Singapore with the support of UNLEASH. Devex retains full editorial independence and responsibility for this content.","At UNLEASH, team Shanka worked for five days to come up with a way to strengthen social and emotional learning in young people.
We’re still in problem framing,” says team member Najmuzzaman Mohammad, chief product officer for a Bangalore-based network of impact funds.
Mohammad is one of 1,000 young people from 109 countries who participated in the annual innovation lab that began May 31.

113,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/fifth-committee-considers-un-management-reform-proposals/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Fifth Committee Considers UN Management Reform Proposals,"31 May 2018: The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) began its consideration of the UN Secretary-General’s proposals on decentralizing management structures at UN Headquarters. Delegates called for enhancing transparency and accountability, streamlining processes and reducing bureaucracy within the UN system.



Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, UN Secretary‑General’s Chef de Cabinet, presented the proposals that were previously conveyed to Member States in March 2018 in a report titled, ‘Shifting the management paradigm in the UN: implementing a new management architecture for improved effectiveness and strengthened accountability.’ UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres presented the report in a meeting with Member States on 22 May.

Viotti said the reforms aim to move the UN from a centralized to decentralized Secretariat, and from a bureaucracy focused on process to an institution focused on results. She said the overhaul will involve segregating policy from operations to allow the Secretariat to constantly assess and improve the effectiveness of policies and administrative support functions. Another proposal, on moving to an integrated supply chain management approach, she said, will ensure that missions and field offices receive goods and services at the right time. She noted that the Secretary-General also has advanced proposals for better policies in support of managers with regards to procurement and human resource management, as the current structures are particularly slow and cumbersome.

The proposals would create several new features and management functions from within existing resources, including:

a Uniformed Capabilities Support Division that will serve as a “one‑stop shop” for troop- and police‑contributing countries for administrative and logistical issues;

a Support Partnerships Service focused on situations where the UN provides support to non‑UN entities, particularly African peace support operations;

a new Business Transformation and Accountability Division focused on performance, monitoring, self‑evaluation and compliance functions;

a Management Client Board;

a Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance; and

a Department of Operational Support, focused on surge support to entities in weak environments.

Viotti explained that creating the latter two proposed departments will require “a great deal of change” in the subsequent six months, with close to 70 posts for the new departments needing to be reprofiled, advertised and filled. She said the Secretary-General will need to find a solution for the staff who will be affected, which entails determining if those staff members could be retrained, moved laterally or would prefer to take a buy‑out package. She further noted that staff guidance and training will be undertaken in the coming months.

Some departments will be integrated, she added, noting that health‑care management and occupational health and safety, currently split across three departments, will be consolidated into a single division. The administrative law, and conduct and discipline functions also will be brought together. The global information technology functions will be consolidated into one office.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, Chairman of the UN Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), said ACABQ largely recommends approval of the concept and design of the new structures proposed by the Secretary‑General. He recommended that the Secretary‑General be asked to consider consolidating under a single administrative structure the proposed Office of Human Resources in the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the proposed Human Resources Services Division in the Office of Support Operations of the Department of Operational Support.

On delegation of authority and accountability issues, he said the Committee considers that the UNGA should be provided with further details, including on progress made towards establishing well‑defined roles and responsibilities.

In the ensuing discussion, governments expressed support for the envisioned management reform. Supported by Angola for the African Group, Brazil and Pakistan, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed the need to ensure equitable geographical representation and gender parity at all levels, and called for increased access to UN procurement opportunities for developing countries. The African Group requested information on how the proposals will impact offices away from UN Headquarters.

Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ) and with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the US, underlined that structural changes must be supported by cultural changes, including in leadership and accountability. Singapore, for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), said ASEAN will pay particular attention to the role of oversight bodies in the proposed new structures. China said internal risk control must be strengthened.

Mexico noted that the implementation of the management reform proposals should not include requests for further financing. He asked how and according to what timetable will Member States be able to examine and evaluate progress and make relevant adjustments.

Cuba said Member States’ commitment to reform must move beyond words into actions and, to that end, Member States should pay their assessed contributions in a timely fashion. She noted that simplifying procedures and ensuring commensurate decentralization of decision‑making processes must go hand in hand with the strengthening of planning tools and systems of accountability. She further called for making senior managers accountable for poor performance.

Russia stressed that Member States must maintain “real leverage” over UN human and financial resources. She recommended the Secretariat prepare further information on the nexus between that reform and ongoing reforms, in particular the deployment of Umoja.

Japan proposed that the Secretariat make programme performance information available to the public and Member States through dashboards.

The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO-IOC) is the custodian agency for the indicator.

The GOA-ON, a collaborative international network of 475 members from 80 nations, is committed to increasing global ocean acidification observation capacity in support of SDG target 14.3, which calls to “minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.” SDG target indicator 14.3.1 focuses on “average marine acidity measured at an agreed suite of representative sampling stations. It is within the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

In the 14.3.1 indicator methodology, experts provide detailed guidance to scientists and countries on how to carry out measurements in line with best practices established by the ocean acidification community. The methodology outlines how to collect information that is transparent, traceable and globally comparable. According to the IOC, improved observation and research on ocean acidification is critical for supporting scientific and governmental efforts towards climate adaptation and mitigation.

The GOA-ON Executive Council also discussed efforts to increase global ocean acidification observing capacity, in line with the Council’s UN Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitment. As part of its commitment, the GOA-ON is working to build capacity in regions that have limited observation and limited ocean science capacity. The Council and its Secretariat are organizing capacity building workshops on ocean acidification monitoring and experimentation best practices and providing sensor kits to allow scientists to collect reliable data and contribute to the global ocean acidification monitoring effort.

The GOA-ON Secretariat includes the IOC of UNESCO, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, US and the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICCC) in Monaco.

P. Nadda on Monday said India will achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target in maternal mortality by 2022 while the government's Ayushman Bharat, popularly known as Modicare, is aimed at changing the face of the country.

""India has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 139 per lakh (100,000) live births by achieving 130 by 2015. At this rate, we shall achieve SDG target of 70 by 2022, ahead of target timeline of 2030,"" Nadda said as he highlighted the achievements of his ministry in the last four years.

He said annual maternal deaths have fallen from 44,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2015, a reduction of 12,000, which is saving of 30 mothers per day. The country reduced its MMR by 37 points from 167 in 2011-2013 to 130 in 2014-16 due to strategic changes including focus on life cycle approach and multi-sectoral approach, he said.

Nadda said India's vision of universal health coverage is based on assured range of comprehensive primary care, linked to robust secondary and tertiary care being translated through Ayushman Bharat.

""Modicare is the world's largest healthcare programme. Its objective is not political. It is for changing the face of the country. Obamacare may be something else but Modicare is about the need to change the face of the country. We will solve all problems that will come our way,"" he said.

Ayushman Bharat programme has two components -- the PMRSSM promising medical cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for 10 crore poor and vulnerable families, which is about 50 crore individuals or 40 per cent of the country's population. The second component, Prime Minister Health and Wellness Centres (PMHWC), aims to convert 1.5 lakh primary health centres and sub-centres to Health and Wellness Centres.

""This will change the healthcare landscape in the country. We are moving as per the set timelines for implementing Ayushman Bharat. We shall be signing MoUs with 14 states on June 14. Under PMHWC, approval for transformation has been given to 19,000 this year.

""By second-third week of July, we will be ready with the IT platform. Identification of beneficiaries in rural areas is done 80 per cent. We want to provide a glitch-free system from the start. So, once the IT testing is done, the Prime Minister will launch the programme,"" he said.

Nadda further said that the government has given total flexibility to the states to choose their health system and how it suits them the best and further government is ready to provide the financial support also.

""Under free Drugs and Diagnostics Service Initiative medicine worth Rs 14,000 crore have been disbursed in last two and a half years. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis program, more than 2.38 lakh patients have been benefited. Amrit outlets provide drugs for cancer and cardiovascular diseases at 60-90 per cent discount. These outlets have helped patients save Rs 346.59 crore so far,"" he said.

Further, the minister said work has begun on the new AIIMS at Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Nagpur, Kalyani (West Bengal), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Bathinda (Punjab), Guwahati and Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh).

It's also a decent weight, an attractive as well as functional design, well constructed and reasonably priced to boot(y).

Pros: Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made

Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made Cons: The minimal padding might feel a bit too firm for some

The cutout isn't overly large compared to my previous saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow (which Lara tested in 2015), but it is well positioned and I found it does a great job of relieving pressure – absolutely crucial to a saddle's comfort. The Allure tips the scales at a respectable 268g (claimed 260g), just a shade more than the Diva.

> Find your nearest dealer here

SDG says this female-specific saddle is designed for all riding disciplines, and I found it performs well both on and off road. It is relatively narrow, at 143mm, and is only available in this one width; this, combined with the cutaway side profile, allows unrestricted leg movement, aiding pedalling efficiency. I actually prefer this narrowness to the 152mm-wide Diva.

It is quite long too, at 265mm, with a slim down-curved nose. This gives you plenty of room to shift your weight forward for climbing, while the seat's flat shape makes it easy to move around.

Construction

The low-profile Allure is made from high-quality materials and is well put together. It sports a lightweight nylon fibre base and LPU foam padding – although some might find the padding a bit too minimal. Compared to the more generously upholstered Diva Gel Flow, it has a very firm feel and it did take me a few rides for my behind to adapt to it. The Allure's wings are not as flexible as the Diva's either, although this didn't pose any problem, particularly because of its narrower width. Having spent several long days in the saddle, I can vouch for its comfort.

The Allure comes in two models: with titanium-alloy rails, tested here, or chromoly rails. The Ti-alloy version, as well as saving weight, is a little more forgiving because the titanium offers slightly more flex than chromoly, and helps absorb road vibrations. You pay for the privilege, though, as the chromoly model retails around £20 less, but then it weighs about 50g more.

Price-wise it compares well with others we've tested on road.cc. A lighter but similar sounding firm-rather-than-armchair option that Sarah got on well with is Fizik's Luce S-Alloy, at 250g and £86.99, and Tass liked the Specialized Ruby Expert, rrp £115 and weight 256g. But you can pay less: I really liked the £49.99 Fabric Scoop Gel saddle; no cutout but lots of comfort and not that much heavier at 273g.

> Buyer's Guide: 9 of the best women's saddles

Ultimately, I found the Allure very comfortable, and I'm impressed by its durability – the synthetic cover hasn't scuffed in a few months of riding, and it's easy to wipe clean. I also like that it doesn't look 'girly' and it comes in a veritable rainbow of colours so you can coordinate it with your bike.

Verdict

A firmer feel than some, but ultimately comfortable for long day rides and for off-road use too

117,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-won-t-you-be-my-neighbor,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor?’,"New film focuses on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood but looks beyond the show to its role in Rogers’ life and the larger world.

Morgan Neville’s documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? briefly debunks a silly, subversive urban legend about the seemingly preternaturally gentle host of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood: a lurid fantasy about his imaginary military past and the many people he supposedly killed in Vietnam; the tattoos allegedly hidden by that cardigan sweater, etc.

There’s no mention of another fanciful story that I believed, and wanted to believe, when I first encountered it possibly 15 to 25 years ago. Perhaps you’ve heard this one, too: The story goes that Mr. Rogers’ car was stolen from the Pittsburgh WQED parking lot where he worked — but a day or two later, it showed up again with a note from the thieves reading, “Sorry, we didn’t know it was yours.”

The first story offers confirmation of our more cynical tendencies; the second, of our more generous impulses. The nasty discovery that reality is so often more complicated, darker and less reassuring than surface appearances suggest is repeated so often that we may be tempted, some of us, to suspect that goodness, sincerity and gentleness can never be trusted.

Yet we also want to believe, some of us, that even car thieves are human beings who were children once, and that however far in life they may have strayed from the lessons of respect and honesty Mr. Rogers tried to teach them long ago, somewhere deep down they still know those lessons are true. Perhaps, even if they can live with that contradiction in their day-to-day crimes, the cognitive dissonance of stealing from Mr. Rogers might be a bridge too far for them.

The first story is ludicrously false. The second probably isn’t true — but it could be true, in principle.

“Love is at the root of everything,” says Fred McFeely Rogers in an archival clip in Won’t You Be My Neighbor? “All learning, all relationships.”

Then, just as you’re thinking (if you’re like me) about all kinds of relationships that are rooted in anything but love, and wondering how anyone can say anything so saccharine-sounding, he adds a clarifying zinger: “Love or the lack of it.”

There, in a way, is the substance of Rogers’ entire career and especially of his iconic television show, which debuted a half-century ago in 1968. For decades, he simply tried to supply the love that might be lacking in a child’s world — at home, at school, in their neighborhoods, and especially in the rest of their television viewing.

That’s a lot of lack. As gentle as Rogers and his show were, Neville (20 Feet from Stardom) reminds us that they weren’t too Pollyanna to tackle tough subjects like divorce, anger, death, assassination and war, all in ways children could understand.

Utilizing a straightforward blend of archival footage, interviews with Rogers’ family and colleagues, and metaphorical animated segments depicting Rogers as his puppet alter ego, Daniel Stripéd Tiger, the film focuses on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood but looks beyond the show to its role in Rogers’ life and the larger world.

Neville touches on Rogers’ early Presbyterian seminary training and studies in child psychology as well as his discovery of television and the early television work in which he created puppets and characters and wrote music that would later go into Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.

The film also explores the cultural context and impact of Rogers’ work, from his responses to Vietnam and the assassination of Robert Kennedy to backlash from critics decrying his focus on children’s feelings and his affirmation of their specialness and parodies like Eddie Murphy’s Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood sketches on Saturday Night Live.

Disturbing footage of a segregationist dumping bleach into a recently desegregated swimming pool with black and white children swimming together provides context for a segment from the show in which Mr. Rogers and the singing policeman Officer Clemmons — played by African-American performer François Clemmons — sit together in front of a wading pool soaking their bare feet together singing There Are Many Ways to Say I Love You.

The segment ends with Rogers pointedly drying Officer Clemmons’ feet with a towel in overt imitation of Christ washing and drying the disciples’ feet in John’s Last Supper account, a symbol of service that Christ exhorted his followers to do for one another.

Clemmons talks about his misgivings as an African-American about playing a police officer, but admits Rogers’ vision won him over. He also talks about Rogers’ concerns about Clemmons’ homosexuality and the danger to the show’s funding if Clemmons were outed (and debunks any notion that Rogers himself was gay).

His last memory of Rogers, from their last show together, is a warm one: He recalls Rogers looking at him while uttering his signature line about making “every day a special day by just your being you.” Asked if he were talking to Clemmons, Rogers replied, “Yes, I have been talking to you for years. But you heard me today.”

Rogers’ Christian faith, Won’t You Be My Neighbor? acknowledges, was implicit in his whole approach; his show wasn’t preachy, but he was always preaching.

Rogers’ show was countercultural in style as well as substance. Appalled by the abrasive tone and hyper pacing of much television fare, Rogers went as slow, quiet and reassuring as possible, which is simply who he was, but also what he believed children needed.

He believed that the images we take in become who we are, and he offered children the good stuff. He never worried about holding their attention, and he never had to. Every child watching felt that he was speaking to him or her, because he was. To use a term much derided nowadays, Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood offered a safe space for children in a world they were quickly learning could be scary and cruel.

Rogers believed that television had the power to unite a nation into a single neighborhood, and in that quest he was a steady but lonely voice in the wilderness. As popular as he was and as profound an effect as he had in many lives, he couldn’t outweigh the combined influence of most pop culture that wasn’t him.

For a few formative years of our lives, Mr. Rogers showed us the way. Why don’t we walk that way? Because of all the voices dominating the discussion ever since.

Yet, like those (probably) mythical car thieves, we know deep down that he was right. An unlikely TV star in his day, Mr. Rogers he has become an even unlikelier Internet icon of goodness and gentleness. Every time disaster or terrorism strike, people share memes of his famous quote about looking for the helpers. Paradoxically, the harsher and more polemical our public discourse has become, the more this beacon of generosity and empathy has been celebrated by nearly everyone.

Ultimately, this is not because of the style or substance of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, but something unquantifiable and unreproducible: Rogers’ manifest goodness. His hopes for a more united country may have been dashed, but in one respect he undoubtedly succeeded: He wanted to make goodness attractive, and he did.

Is Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood hagiographical? Is it necessarily a bad thing if it is? Hagiography is usually a bad thing in biography because most of us aren’t saints. (One remarkably hagiographic detail: Each morning, after swimming laps — there’s underwater footage of Rogers’ slight frame in the pool — he stepped on the scale, and, according to the man himself, every day he weighed in at 143 pounds: a number that, to him, signified the 1-4-3 letters of the words “I love you.”)

Rogers wasn’t a perfect man, even if one of his sons recalls that it could be difficult “having a second Christ for a father.” But when his widow, Joanne, recalls reassuring him toward the end of his life, as he contemplated the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats in Matthew 25 and wondered out loud if he were one of the sheep, that if anyone qualified as a sheep, he did, it’s hard to imagine any reasonable person disagreeing.

We can’t live in Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, and our world will never greatly resemble it. But what’s stopping us, any of us, from trying to bring to our interactions with others a little more of what we admire in Mr. Rogers? Is the divisiveness and cruelty of our world a reason not to treat each other with kindness and love, or is it more important to do so?

Like Jesus, like Mr. Rogers, Won’t You Be My Neighbor? challenges each of us to try to be better neighbors.

A. God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in the next. (Baltimore Catechism)

Q. What is thy only comfort in life and in death?

A. That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Savior Jesus Christ. (Heidelberg Catechism)

For countless Catholics of a certain age, whether practicing or lapsed, the first question and answer above, instilled in them in CCD classes or parochial school, are as much a part of them as their own names, or more so. For Paul Schrader, as for me, my father and his father before him, the second question and answer have similarly deep roots.

First Reformed is not the first Schrader film to quote these opening lines of the Calvinist Heidelberg Catechism. They also appear in his 1979 film Hardcore, which is largely set in Los Angeles, but is 100% about the Dutch Reformed mecca of Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Schrader grew up, and where my father, a Dutch Reformed pastor in my youth, went to college and seminary.

In Hardcore, George C. Scott tried to explain the TULIP acrostic for Calvinism’s “Five Points” to an amiably baffled sex worker. Forty years on, First Reformed finds its protagonist, Ethan Hawke’s Rev. Toller, facing a world in which his theological tradition seems if anything even more incomprehensible. The words of the catechesis of his youth will always be with Toller, as with Schrader, but what comfort or assurance do such words offer today?

Toller’s post — a small Dutch Colonial clapboard church in upper New York state, built by 18th-century Dutch emigrants — is significant historically, but scarcely in any other way.

Toller guides more tourists on weekdays than congregants Sunday morning, explaining the church’s ties to the Underground Railroad, pointing out historic graves in the church cemetery and selling souvenirs in the gift shop.

The church’s upcoming 250th anniversary is a big deal. The celebratory “reconsecration service” (less euphemistically, a kind of last hurrah) will be packed with dignitaries, most of whom have never darkened the church’s door and will never return. A metaphorical shot of Toller laboriously raising a toppled headstone encapsulates his function at First Reformed Church: He is propping up a monument.

It would be easy, if premature, to view this hollow shell of a church as representative of U.S. or Western Christendom. Actually, Christianity is alive and well, after a fashion, at nearby Abundant Life — a megachurch that resembles (as megachurches are wont to do) a mashup of mall and convention center, which might suggest a different sort of a hollow shell.

Well-funded and efficient, Abundant Life is bustling with programs and activity. (A subtle physical exchange between a boy and a girl in a small choir practicing “Are You Washed in the Blood?” is typical of Schrader’s attention to the disconnects below the surface in conservative communities.)

Loose change from the megachurch’s cushioned pews could just about cover First Reformed Church’s operating budget; in fact, it more or less does.

A placard in front of the smaller church gives it away: First Reformed is now “An Abundant Life Historical Church.” Toller’s paychecks are signed by the genial, well-connected Pastor Jeffers (Cedric Kyles, aka Cedric the Entertainer), and Jeffers’ wealthy donors cover the church’s expenses.

If that’s not mortifying enough, Toller knows that his job is partly a lifeline thrown to him by Jeffers in the wake of the breakup of his marriage following the death of his son in Iraq. Then a military chaplain, Toller had encouraged his son to volunteer. He now views Iraq as an unjustified war, and U.S. foreign policy may not be the only area in which he has lost faith.

In this humbled condition, Toller strives as best he can for what remains to him: authenticity. He belongs to a particular tradition, but he immerses himself in the likes of Thomas Merton, Soren Kierkegaard and medieval Christian mysticism (his reading material includes a copy of the anonymous 14-century work The Cloud of Unknowing).

At an Abundant Life small group, when a participant struggles with the hard reality of good Christians leading lives that are not so abundant, Toller tries to offer a dose a biblical realism regarding prosperity theology (though he’s shouted down by an indignant Jesus bro who’s tired of feeling bad for the less fortunate, or something).

Toller’s life is a daily existential crisis resonating with the struggles of other fictional men of the cloth, often Catholic, trying to serve a seemingly remote God in a world seemingly indifferent to what they have to offer.

Brendan Gleeson’s formidable rural Irish priest in Calvary is a recent example. Other notable precedents include the protagonists of Graham Greene’s The Power and the Glory, Luis Buñuel’s Nazarín, and, most relevantly, Robert Bresson’s Diary of a Country Priest, based on the novel by Georges Bernanos.

Schrader’s seminal study Transcendental Style in Film, published when he was just 26, explored what he argued were spiritually evocative techniques associated with select filmmakers, including Bresson. Schrader’s own interests as a filmmaker, though, have generally run in other directions.

In First Reformed, Schrader makes greater use than ever before of what he calls the “transcendental toolkit” — but it’s still very much a film from the writer of Taxi Driver. If Toller partly evokes Bresson’s wan, saintly curé, in time we see that he’s also part Travis Bickle, which can be as difficult to watch as it sounds.

Actually, Bickle himself was already indebted to Bresson’s curé: Among other things, all three characters keep journals which they update in voiceover. They also share troubling stomach ailments, an incarnational manifestation of a spiritual “sickness unto death.”

But where Bresson leads us through his protagonist’s dark night of the soul to the triumph of grace, as First Reformed unfolds it begins to look as if fallen nature might have the last word, at least for now.

The arena for this showdown of nature and grace is established in a pivotal conversation between Toller and a depressed young environmentalist radical named Michael (Philip Ettinger).

Though wholly secular, Michael respects Toller (in gratifying contrast to his opinion of the team at Abundant Life, which seems “more like a company” to him). Their meeting is arranged by Michael’s concerned wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried), who is pregnant with a child Michael can’t see bringing into so troubled a world.

This dialogue brings together two of the most contentious causes célèbres of the right and the left: abortion and environmental concerns.

In the best line from their exchange, Toller tells Michael that the trauma of taking life outweighs any trauma of suffering it to come into the world. Yet for Michael the threat of looming environmental catastrophe isn’t merely the most important thing, it’s literally the only thing that matters.

Michael's dilemma mirrors one that troubles many dedicated pro-life activists: How does one live day after day in a shadow of so vast a crisis without succumbing either to complacency or numb despair on the one hand or to madness and fanaticism on the other?

The tension between Michael’s despairing environmental apocalypticism and the life of the child in Mary’s womb persists throughout the film, though the pro-life theme remains implicit while the environmental theme in all its urgency and destructive potential becomes the dominant concern.

“You’re always in the Garden,” Jeffers chides Toller (meaning, of course, Gethsemane), in a pastoral conversation not unlike the one Toller’s doctor tries to have with him. “Even Jesus wasn’t always in the Garden.”

It is humiliation upon humiliation that this glib, shallow man of God may be right about Toller’s increasingly worrisome behavior.

Worse, Toller himself, no less than Jeffers, is in the pocket of a local fat-cat businessman (Michael Gaston) whose oil company has an abysmal environmental record. The word of God is not fettered, St. Paul wrote from prison, but Toller finds there are topics he may not be allowed to discuss. Even a private memorial service held far from any church comes under scrutiny. (I have never seen a scattering of ashes scene so deliberately depressingly and unpoetically shot.)

In the last act Schrader unexpectedly changes cinematic gears, and even genres, with a surreal sequence borrowing directly from a film with similar eschatological concerns, Andrei Tarkovsky’s The Sacrifice.

It’s effective as homage, though what works organically in The Sacrifice doesn’t work the same way here (I think; I might need a second viewing to be sure). Certainly it sets up the mad finale, which is as harrowing as the The Sacrifice’s famous climactic shot, and as ambiguous.

In the end, like The Sacrifice, First Reformed seems to me somehow unresolved. Hope and despair struggle to the end, but the despair is anchored in crushing realities, while the hope is nebulous and chimeral. All the urgency of Pope Francis’ eco-encyclical Laudato Si is here, but too little of its humanism, and very little hint of its redemptive vision.

“Will God forgive us?” is the question to which First Reformed returns again and again. The first time it comes up, Toller’s response is, “Who can know the mind of God?” These are both vital questions, and neither is as simple as it may seem, but the second question is a poor response to the first.

First Reformed depicts a religious culture, like the biosphere, in crisis, perhaps sickness unto death. But it is not a rejection of the former, any more than the latter. For one thing, Michael’s secular despair is hardly more attractive than Toller’s tormented faith.

Nor does the film simply despair of mankind or embrace nihilism. Mary, the film’s most sympathetic character, and for Toller (and probably for Schrader) an icon of goodness, wants her baby. This is a sign of hope, not only that the world should go on, but that human beings should be part of it.

First Reformed can hardly imagine a hopeful future for the world, because it seems human beings can’t or won’t change. The world is broken; human beings are broken; religion is broken.

Yet the film is full of longing for redemption: for healing of wounds, forgiveness of sins, and, in some unguessable way, vindication of faith. Toller hopes that his journal is a kind of prayer. Perhaps Schrader hopes the same for his film.

Caveat Spectator (spoiler warning): Some gory and disturbing images and themes including bloody aftermath of a suicide and a terrorism theme; references to a sexual affair and an intimate, not exactly sexual physical encounter; brief rude humor. Mature viewing.

119,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom,"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’,"The ‘fivequel’ (or a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) has nothing to say and no case for its own existence.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom runs two hours and 10 minutes, and if you bracket the first five minutes and the last five minutes, any random five minutes in the remaining two hours are probably more enjoyable than any random five minutes of the previous Jurassic World movie, and probably any five minutes of Jurassic Park 3.

There are images worth looking at, for one thing. Visually, not much from Colin Trevorrow’s 2015 Jurassic World has stuck with me beyond Chris Pratt holding three velociraptors at bay with hand signals and steady nerves (and later absurdly cruising alongside the raptor pack on a motorcycle).

J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage; The Impossible) has a better eye and a gift for atmosphere and creates painterly, sometimes powerful images. He also displays a Spielbergian gift for pushing the audience’s buttons. I jumped and laughed repeatedly, sometimes in the same five minutes.

As the five-minute stretches pile up, though, the movie goes back to the same tricks too often. The “bigger fish” trope is used at least twice too often, and the kitchen cabinet door from the first film becomes a dumbwaiter door here that is used repeatedly.

Eventually, all those five-minute stretches add up to two hours and 10 minutes that have to tell some kind of story that ought to be about something. Fallen Kingdom is a “fivequel” (or, if you prefer, a middle movie in a sequel trilogy) with nothing to say and no case for its own existence beyond brand momentum and the employability and photogenic looks of Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.

If Fallen Kingdom did have something to say, it might be about environmentalism and exploitation of nature. After the disastrous collapse of the new Jurassic World theme park (and hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements), the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar are on their own — and facing extinction from the island’s volcanic activity (a plot point going back to the original Michael Crichton novel, so we can’t ding the filmmakers for it).

This makes the dinosaurs objects of considerable preservationist concern and action. Howard’s character, Claire Dearing, now a crusading conservationist, might as well be a different character from the buttoned-up sexist stereotype of the first film (she’s closer in spirit to her park ranger in Pete’s Dragon).

Claire and Pratt’s one-time raptor trainer Owen Grady are no longer an item, but she manages to persuade him to join her on a rescue mission to Isla Nublar, accompanied by an anxious tech wizard (Justice Smith) and an ex-Marine paleoveterinarian (Daniella Pineda). To be clear, the mission is to rescue dinosaurs — a mission that occasions some debate, as well it might.

Unlike other endangered species, dinosaurs play no integral role in the balance of an ecosystem, nor are they valued by preservationists for their biodiversity (only the villains talk about the dinosaurs as resources). Instead, Claire’s brief for the dinos rests on human appreciation and empathy: We like seeing dinosaurs and they are living, breathing creatures that deserve our respect and compassion.

Neither consideration is without merit, though the waters are muddied by talk of “dinosaur rights.” (In Catholic moral thought, human beings have moral obligations regarding animals and owe them kindness, but animals lack by nature the capacity for moral agency and responsibility and thus are not properly subjects of “rights.”)

Backing for the mission comes from Sir Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell, affecting a British accent and an unwonted joviality), an old business partner of (and stand-in for) the late Richard Attenborough’s John Hammond. Cromwell’s household includes his unscrupulous right-hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), his stern housekeeper Iris (Geraldine Chaplin) and his young granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon), on hand to be this movie’s spunky menaced child.

Where the last film’s ruthless paramilitary figure was played by Vincent D’Onofrio in low-rent Brian Dennehy mode, this time we’ve got Ted Levine in low-rent Woody Harrelson mode. (Both D’Onofrio and Levine have much more interesting modes, so the slight is to the film, not the players.)

None of these characters is more than one-dimensional. Claire and Owen were one-dimensional characters in the first film, but now that Claire’s not an ice queen and Owen is at least less of a sexist jerk, I’m not sure they have even one dimension.

Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm is on hand, barely, to testify about the inevitable consequences of human irresponsibility. This sets up a contradiction at the heart of the drama that the filmmakers have no idea how to solve.

The dinosaurs can’t be contained on Isla Nublar or anywhere else. Not only does life always find a way, unscrupulous human efforts to exploit the dinosaurs will always offer the dinos opportunities to break free. Realistically, dinos are an unpredictable hazard not only to human beings but to whole ecosystems.

Yet our heroes love the dinos and want them to live — and the longer the franchise wears on, the more the movies love the dinos too, even if the “oo” and “ah” always gives way to running and screaming.

Of course even reconstituted dinosaurs ought to be treated humanely. At the end of the day, though, if it’s them or us, there’s only one right answer, and the movie seems to struggle with that. One line even seems to suggest that what dinosaurs really need is for humans to get out of the way.

Perhaps I’m thinking about this too hard, or perhaps the writers should have thought harder. Certainly the plot is one utterly predictable development after another (most of which my 15-year-old daughter actually predicted as the movie unfolded).

The last movie featured a genetically engineered hybrid supersaurus called Indominus Rex, a powerful, intelligent amalgam of T-rex and other species, most ominously including velociraptor. It was supposed to be ominous, anyway; I found it a lame reveal, since I had assumed that of course raptor DNA was in the mix and wondered whether the intelligence might reflect a more transgressive choice to mix in mammalian DNA, possibly even human.

Now they’ve got an even smarter, more advanced designer dino called an “Indoraptor,” a hybrid based on Indominus Rex, but with, you know, more raptor. What’s next, “Velocindoraptor”? Apparently velociraptor is the cowbell of dino design and the filmmakers are Christopher Walken. How is the imaginative scope so limited?

What makes this even weirder is that the Fallen Kingdom throws in some unrelated transgressive science involving human DNA, seemingly at random and with no connection to the main dinosaur theme. This goes nowhere and does nothing, at least in this movie. (Spoiler alert: The science in question involves human cloning.)

The first five minutes are soured for me by a particularly cruel killing of a random character overtly recalling a far crueler killing in the previous Jurassic World. (I assume this is cowriter Colin Trevorrow tipping his hat to himself.)

The last five minutes crash and burn completely as the heroes struggle with doing something unthinkable before taking a head-smacking cop-out to get the ending the movie wants, which is not actually the ending this movie wants, but the ending the next movie wants.

This is, more and more, the new normal in the evolution (or re-engineering) of Hollywood blockbusters. As audience expectations adapt, third acts and resolutions are becoming optional. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is what a movie looks like when the goal is less to send viewers home satisfied than to send them home anticipating the next movie, which is not the same thing.

Representatives from several agencies on the table as well as key community partners were in attendance.

“We’re very happy with what was accomplished in the past year,” says Inspector Shawna Spowart at the Cornwall Community Police Service. “The Situation Table provides wrap-around support for those who are experiencing extremely stressful and risky periods in their lives.”

From its launch in May 2017 until early May 2018, the work accomplished by the Situation Table has helped 30 local individuals and 11 families.

The CSDG Situation Table is composed of 26 frontline, acute care and social service agencies that work collaboratively to help ensure the safety of individuals, families and groups of people who are at high risk of suffering from violent acts.

When a case is referred to the Situation Table, the various partners in the project, which include school boards, the police, the Children’s Aid Society, the Cornwall Community Hospital and the Canadian Mental Health Association, meet and work together to reduce the imminent risk of harm, usually within 24 to 48 hours. The Situation Table remains involved in the case until the level of risk has been reduced.

“An early collaborative intervention from the Situation Table has proven it helps prevent crimes and improve the safety and well-being of the community and local residents,” explains Elyse Lauzon-Alguire, Situation Table Chair and Interim Coordinator. “Rapid mobilization Tables such as the CSDG Situation Table make police services part of a stronger safety net, rather than being the entire net themselves.”

Most situations that come to the Table concern a single individual, a family, or a group of people that are affected by multiple risk factors, including mental health issues, domestic conflict, addictions and homelessness. The CSDG Situation Table works to mitigate the risks rather than wait for a harmful incident that would require an emergency response, all while protecting the privacy of the people being assisted.

121,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/agency-wire/86463-asia-pacific-to-only-meet-sdg-4-warns-un,"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devdiscourse,"Asia-Pacific to only meet SDG 4, warns UN","The Asia-Pacific region is on track to meet only one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, a senior UN official has warned, underscoring that the global success in achieving the 2030 development agenda is ""highly reliant"" on India's performance.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for action to end poverty, protect the planet, improve health, education, and ensuring that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

""When we look across the SDGs right now, Asia-Pacific as a whole is on track to meet only one of the 17 SDGs. We are only going to meet the SDG on education.

""While that is a great achievement -- universal education in a region as vast as the Asia-Pacific -- it is not enough,"" UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) Deputy Executive Secretary Kaveh Zahedi told PTI here.

Zahedi was in New York to participate in the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development at UN headquarters last week that reviewed progress towards several of the SDGs.

As nations across the world implement national development programmes in line with development goals, the UN official emphasised that success in the SDGs will in large part depend on its success in India.

He noted that the success on the Millennium Development Goals, to some degree, could be attributed to China's poverty reduction and its efforts in lifting millions out of poverty.

""We are highly reliant on India's success to demonstrate the global success on achieving the 2030 Agenda. It is going to depend on ambition and vision at the highest level of government and also depends on money and investment,"" he said.

Zahedi raised concern over the region ""moving backwards"" on parameters of inequality besides the emerging ""digital divide"" within and between countries.

""The region is becoming more unequal. Not only are we not going to achieve the SDGs, we are moving in the wrong direction. I don't think any of the countries will say that they are hundred per cent on the track to meet SDGs just yet,"" he said.

He noted that inequality in the region is not just in income and wealth, but also in terms of access to vital services like education, health, social protection, environmental degradation and impact of disasters.

""We also see a digital divide emerging within countries and between countries, which, in a way, is setting the pattern for future inequality when people will rely on mobile, 3G services to access education, health services,"" he said.

Referring specifically to the SDG on access to affordable and clean energy, he said while in the past 20 years access to energy has increased, access to clean fuel, especially clean cooking fuel, has not. About 2.2 billion people in the Asia Pacific region still cook with traditional bio mass fuel and a majority of those people live in China and India, he noted.

Zahedi, however, lauded India's efforts towards increasing the renewable energy component in its overall energy mix. India is undertaking the transformation of its energy mix towards renewable energy, with particular emphasis on expanding the use of solar and wind power, including off-grid.

By 2022, India plans to produce 175 GW of renewable energy that will include 100 GW of solar power. The rate of expansion in this sector in India is highest in the world.

India has also partnered with France and other countries to launch the International Solar Alliance as a tangible contribution to the ongoing collective global efforts on climate action. More than 60 countries have already joined this alliance, which has now been registered at the UN as a multilateral treaty.

""Countries need to set a vision and ambition for themselves. India has done that (in the energy field). From the 100 GW of solar ambition by 2022 to putting in place the solar alliance, it is a statement of intent from India that is absolutely vital,"" he said.

Zahedi also said that countries need to increase their investments if they are to achieve the SDGs.

""Regionally, we need an investment of up to 1.7 billion dollars to achieve universal access to energy. It's an extraordinary investment that is needed but it is not happening right now. We see that the major investments are not aligned with the SDGs,"" he said.

Highlighting an urgent need for nations to speed up development efforts, he said economic growth alone will not bring the results that the countries are seeking.

""Just economic growth will not help with sustainable and inclusive development. If we have a challenge when it comes to inequality, we cannot just grow out of that problem. We need to invest in overcoming that problem, we need to invest in education, healthcare, reducing the vulnerability of various populations and those that constantly get dragged back into poverty after each financial crisis and extreme weather events,"" he said.

""The message is that economic growth alone really will not resolve our problems and has not resolved our problems. It is important but it is not enough. We have to see investments in the SDGs, in building the social safeguards, in building the resilience that will bring ultimately the SDGs success,"" he said.

122,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/where-are-we-in-achieving-sdg-15/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?,"Biodiversity is essential for all life on Earth, including human life. Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.
For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households.
Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection.

The Global Councils on SDGs consist of interdisciplinary networks of decisionmakers from different areas, that seek to find innovative solutions for SDG implementation. Council members are invited to participate for a two-year term, with the aim to provide actionable insights, propose policies, develop technological solutions, and mobilize resources to drive progress towards the goals. The Councils were launched in February 2018 at the World Government Summit in Dubai, UAE.

The event titled, ‘The Future of Government and Implications for Agenda 2030: Introducing the Global Councils on SDGs,’ took place on the sidelines of the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF), on 17 July 2018.

Opening the meeting, Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative of UAE, noted that nine Councils have been established so far, and that eight other councils will be launched during the “second phase” of the initiative. The existing Councils target nine SDGs and are headed by the following officials: SDG 1 (no poverty) is chaired Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank; SDG 2 (zero hunger) is chaired by Christopher Fearne, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health, Malta; SDG 4 (quality education) is chaired by Irina Bokova, former Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) is chaired by Adnan Amin, Director-General, IRENA; SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) is chaired by Imad Fakhoury, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Jordan; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) is chaired by Aisha Bin Bishr, Director General, Smart Dubai Office, UAE; SDG 13 (climate action) is chaired by Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, UAE; SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) is chaired by Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand and former Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) is chaired by Mari Kiviniemi, Deputy Secretary-General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Radheya Alhashmi, Prime Minister’s Office, UAE, noted that the Councils are not limited to “VIPs” but should involve “all different actors of the community,” and called on them to come up with innovative ideas. She explained that during their first year of work, Councils should define initiatives that are impactful, while in their second year, they should collaborate and promote integration across their initiatives.

Yasir Al Naqbi, also from the UAE Prime Minister’s Office, announced that the 2019 World Government Summit will take place from 10-12 February 2019 in Dubai. The World Government Summit is a knowledge exchange platform at the intersection of government, technology, and innovation that functions as a thought leadership platform and networking hub for policymakers, experts and pioneers in human development. The Summit was commissioned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE, in 2013, and takes place annually.

Mohieldin said sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

In a session featuring Council chairs and members, Mahmoud Mohieldin said the SDG 1 Council, composed of 22 members, plans to produce global knowledge products, and will organize a competition to tackle poverty that will engage “many people” from academia and the private sector, among other areas. He announced that specific deliverables would be shared during the 2019 World Government Summit, and noted that sharing by examples is as important as funding when it comes to implementing the SDGs.

Adnan Amin, said there is a “huge interest” in being a member of the SDG 7 Council, with 150 applications having been received. He remarked that there is no enabling framework to take forward energy efficiency, and the SDG 7 Council could create momentum around this issue.

Meera Al Shaikh, Smart Dubai, on behalf of Aisha Bin Bishr, reported that the SDG 11 Council is composed of 11 members from various horizons, among others, from the World Council on City Data (WCCD) and IISD Reporting Services. She said the Council will use science, technology and innovation (STI) approaches as part of its framework, and will have a second meeting during the week of 23 July.

Eric Dawson, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peace First, and member of the SDG 16 Council, indicated that the Council will leverage the power of young people to create more peaceful and inclusive societies at all levels. He said the Council will: organize a global youth challenge for peaceful and inclusive societies; identify problems young people want to solve; and connect them to mentors and funding to support solution-oriented projects.

Masamichi Kono, Deputy Secretary-General, OECD, on behalf of Mari Kiviniemi, remarked that the SDG 17 Council is overarching and horizontal, and will operationalize partnerships in coherence with the other SDGs. Among its activities, he said the Council will define a clear roadmap on how partnership can lead to more effective SDG implementation, and is considering the establishment of a knowledge facility related to SDG governance. He reported that the Council had its first meeting on 2 July, and that it is composed of officials from, inter alia, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), UNDP, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), Slovenia and Finland.

During the meeting, participants also shared information on SDG implementation in countries. Juwang Zhu, Director, Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said that compared to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs are characterized by: a greater commitment from the top; stronger ownership and buy-in by Parliaments; better coordination; more emphasis on evidence-based analysis; and some “shift away” from the work in silo approach. He remarked that leaving no one behind (LNOB) is becoming the “yardstick” to measure real progress, and noted the various bottom-up initiatives carried out by stakeholders, including by business and civil society organizations (CSOs). He said the UAE is a small country with a strong commitment to global partnership, as it devotes more than one percent of its gross development product (GDP) to development cooperation.

Inge Herman Rydland, Special Envoy Agenda 2030, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway, outlined the importance of integrating the SDGs in national budgets, since this contributes to greater policy coherence and a better acceptance of the policy agenda. Timotej Šooš, National Development Strategy Lead, Slovenia, reported that his country is “doing quite well” on many areas of the SDGs, and noted the need to work more horizontally, across sectors. He also underscored the “very important role” of Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) for SDG implementation.

Al Naqbi said the UAE presented its voluntary national review (VNR) at the HLPF on 16 July 2018. He reported that: the UAE Minister of Youth is 22 years old, which makes her the youngest minister in the world; 33% of UAE Ministers are female; and the Head of Parliament is a woman.

Pakistan is scheduled to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report titled, ‘Where Pakistan Stands on the Implementation of the SDGs 2018,’ was produced by AwazCDS-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Development Alliance, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Pakistan and UK Aid, and first circulated in March 2018. The report documents the findings of an SDG assessment carried out by stakeholders at the provincial and federal levels. Per the authors, the assessment has been shared with government bodies, parliamentarians and other stakeholders to “generate a dialogue.”

The assessment of Pakistan’s SDG implementation is based on a framework comprising the following components: alignment of national, provincial and local SDG priorities; defining institutional coordination mechanisms; prioritizing SDG accelerators; integrating SDGs into budgets and financing the SDG agenda; data, monitoring and reporting; advocacy, resources and partnerships; private sector and local government engagement; SDG 16 indicators and related initiatives; and civil society organizations (CSOs) engagement with the government.

The report notes that SDGs 1 (no poverty), 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) are a priority for the country, and that the government has approved a national SDG framework that includes national SDG targets and indicators. It says Pakistan has established SDG units under its SDG task forces at the central and provincial levels, and has notified parliamentary task forces on SDGs to oversee implementation of the national framework. It also indicates that governments at the federal and sub-national levels partnered with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to undertake a “comprehensive” consultative process across all provinces and regions of the country.

On challenges, the authors express disappointment when it comes to the implementation of policies related to the SDGs. They note “extremely weak” institutional coordination at “every level” of government, and among SDG task forces and units on SDG implementation progress and challenges. They indicate that the federal government has a Prime Minister SDG Support Fund but most members of the SDG task forces are unaware of this mechanism, and they outline a lack of data availability at the central level to track SDG progress. They find that SDGs are still unknown for “many,” adding that most CSOs, NGOs, media organizations, and others are unaware of the efforts being made by the government to implement the SDGs. They also call on the government and NGOs to “approach” the private sector for financial and technical support.

Ahead of the 2018 HLPF, CSOs from Canada and Switzerland, among others, also have issued independent reports discussing their country’s progress and challenges on the SDGs.

The report covers developments from 2015-2017 on migration and sustainable development in the region, and identifies SDG targets that are directly and indirectly related to human mobility. Titled ‘Situation Report on International Migration: Migration in the Arab Region and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ the report is published in the lead-up to the anticipated adoption of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018.

The three-part report addresses: trends in international migration in the Arab region; changes in migration governance in 2016 and 2017; and linkages between international migration and the SDGs.

Approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region.

The report finds that approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region, and numbers of women migrants have increased, due to recent conflicts and violence. Various sub-regions have different migration patterns, with the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) hosting a larger concentration of migrants than anywhere else in the world, and the Mashreq region serving as a source of labor migration and displacement due to conflict.

In terms of migration governance, Arab countries maintain restrictive and gender-based policies on access to nationality. However, the report notes some improvements in upholding the rights of migrant workers and in combating human trafficking.

The authors identify four types of relationships between migration and the SDGs: the level of development in an area as a driver for mobility; migration as an opportunity for development; migrants as contributors to development in their countries of origin and also in their countries of destination; and mobile populations as vulnerable populations whose specific needs should be considered.

They highlight SDG target 10.7 on facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, as well as other relevant targets: protecting migrant workers’ labor rights and providing a safe and secure working environment, especially for women (SDG 8.8); reducing the transaction costs of remittances (SDG 10.c); expanding scholarships for students from developing countries (SDG 4.b); eliminating trafficking in persons, especially of women and girls, and forced labor and exploitation (SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2); and ensuring meaningful data collection (SDG 17.18).

The report refers to several international frameworks that can help governments assess their own policies: the Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration; the Migration Governance Framework; the Migration Governance Index; and a dashboard of indicators of measuring policy and institutional coherence for migration and development.

126,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholder-report-measures-up-uk-performance-on-sdgs/,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholder Report 'Measures up' UK Performance on SDGs,"17 July 2018: An event convened in the margins of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) celebrated the launch of the report titled, ‘Measuring Up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’ Organized by UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and hosted by PwC, the discussion reviewed the report’s key findings and methodology.

Bringing together experts from over 100 organizations across the UK, the report offers the first comprehensive review of SDG delivery in the country, covering all 17 Goals and 143 of the 169 targets. Emily Auckland, UKSSD Co-Chair, emphasized that the scope primarily focuses on domestic delivery of the SDGs within the UK, and that the report does not compare the UK to other countries. On the authoring process, she explained that each chapter of ‘Measuring Up’ —the first section of which reviews progress on a Goal-by-Goal basis—was led by one or two UKSSD members, based on their strengths and area of expertise. The report’s second section examines procedural aspects of SDG delivery in the UK, including governance arrangements and the roles of stakeholders.

The report finds that the UK performs well on 24% of the targets, has performance gaps on 57%, and shows little to no policy change or otherwise poor performance on 15%. For 3% of targets, there were not enough data available to make an informed assessment. The report utilized publicly available data from international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and World Bank, as well as from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). UKSSD also notes that in authoring the report, they identified data gaps on the UK’s impacts abroad, including through supply chains and on marine pollution. Although accounting for the country’s global reach is embedded in the thinking, UKSSD noted, additional measures are needed take stock to take stock.

Areas of high performance include SDGs 3, 4 and 17. The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15.

Areas of high performance by the UK include SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). The UK appears to perform poorly on SDG 15 (life on land), and on several Goals (2, 5, 9 and 13) not a single target is marked as green (“good”). In terms of efficiently accelerating progress, the report notes that although the UK’s implementation framework of Single Departmental Plans (SDPs) are a practical way of delegating authority, there is a risk that doing so will reduce recognitions of interlinkages across the Goals and targets, thereby siloing efforts or reduce their effectiveness. Thus, the report calls for cross-departmental action to ensure policy coherence.

Dominic White, Co-Chair, UKSSD, highlighted that the report is put forth in the spirit of collaboration, offered in lieu of government capacity, to recognize what a performance review looks like from a stakeholder perspective. He emphasized synergies between the UK and global contexts, noting that this is “where sustainable development comes home.” On methodology, he underscored the stringency of the review, noting that UKSSD applied the “leave no one behind” principle when analyzing targets: if a person or group is not getting the full benefits of a target, the target is not scored as green.

Looking ahead, White described the ‘Measuring Up’ report and the UK’s intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the 2019 HLPF as opening a “policy window” where experiences can be built on and taken further, and gaps identified by the report can be addressed. The discussion also raised the broader importance of “voluntary stakeholder reviews” (VSRs), which can serve as a baseline for, or to complement, inform, strengthen—or in some cases refute—countries’ official VNRs on progress towards the SDGs.

The event follows the report’s initial launch, held at the UK House of Commons on 3 July 2018. The ‘Measuring Up’ project has been supported by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), Pearson, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Sodexo, DNV GL, PwC, Stakeholder Forum and Thai Union.

SDG target 12.6 calls for companies to “integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.”



Titled, ‘In Focus: Addressing Investor Needs in Business Reporting on the SDGs,’ the paper offers guidance to companies to ensure that their disclosures help mobilize the finance needed to achieve the SDGs. The publication’s forward notes that investors seek information on 1) how businesses are reaping results from their competitive advantages connected to the SDGs, and 2) the relevance of the SDGs to overall strategies.

The report aims to facilitate greater comparison across companies, and strengthen the case for investment in line with the SDGs.

Aimed primarily at the “corporate sustainability reporting practitioners” who are responsible for integrating SDG information into their companies’ reporting processes, the report intends to build on existing disclosure standards to facilitate greater comparison across companies. The publication stresses that it does not seek to impose an additional reporting standard or framework on companies, but rather seeks to “demonstrate what good, investor-relevant business reporting around the SDGs looks like” to strengthen the case for investment in line with the Goals.

In a press release on the publication, GRI CEO Tim Mohin says that investors prefer to see balanced reporting and companies’ targets mapped against the SDGs. Doing so in line with common standards, he notes, can enable more consistent and comparable data.

The paper highlights four C’s of sustainability reporting: concise, consistent, current and comparable. With this information, the authors note, investors can direct capital flows such that they not only amplify business opportunities and generate profits, but also yield social and environmental returns for society, in line with the SDGs. Further, not achieving the SDGs can impede business profitability, and thus reduce investors’ returns.

The report’s ten key recommendations focus on: message and approach; strategy and governance; report content; and data format. They address characteristics that companies can take to ensure meaningful SDG uptake—such as rewards for meeting SDG targets—as well as best practices, such as providing links to raw data so analysts can review or normalize it as needed. The recommendations are placed in context, with the report describing how reporters and investors can align their engagement efforts, for example, so that investors can understand the potential short-term trade-offs required to realize long-term gains.

The paper also distinguishes between an SDG approach and an environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach, noting that the former considers external impacts by the business, but does not cover corporate governance, which can often be a means of delivering environmental and social outcomes.

The report follows an earlier document that outlines actions companies can take in line with the SDGs, titled, ‘An Analysis of the Goals and Targets.’ It also recognizes the 2017 ‘Stockholm Declaration’ on Investors and corporate SDG reporting.

GRI, PRI and UN Global Compact note that the ‘In Focus’ report will be followed in late 2018 by a publication titled, ‘Integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting: A Practical Guide,’ from which some of the In Focus graphics are taken.

On the first day, governments began an “in-depth review” of selected SDGs, with a session on global progress towards SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Delegates heard that “the world is not on track” to meet the SDG 6 targets by 2030, in view of increasing freshwater pollution, water stress, and a declining share of official development assistance (ODA) for water-related activities.



The review of SDG 6 featured several high-level speakers, including Danilo Turk, Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace and former President of Slovenia, and Leo Heller, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation. The review of SDG 6 was aided by the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report,’ which was prepared under UN-Water coordination and presented by Stefan Uhlenbrook, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The discussion was moderated by Joakim Harlin, UN-Water.

Delegates discussed their national efforts to achieve SDG 6 and highlighted the need for good governance and partnerships. Several speakers underscored the links between water, peace and security, and Turk proposed holding an international conference on water management to discuss infrastructure and financing. Many speakers lamented the fact that the HLPF would only devote three hours to a review of SDG 6 during its four-year cycle.

IWMI said cities can be water producers, not only water consumers.

Non-governmental speakers also presented their perspectives on SDG 6. Claudia Sadoff, International Water Management Institute (IWMI), stated that cities can be water producers, not only water consumers. The Major Group for Workers and Trade Unions cautioned against privatization, and called for water utilities to be “re-municipalized” to improve equity in service delivery. Other speakers noted the need to promote efficiency of water use in the agriculture and energy sectors.

Among other issues discussed during the opening day of the 2018 HLPF was the US$200 billion shortfall in SDG financing. Keynote speaker Jeffrey Sachs, Columbia University, proposed ways to cover this shortfall, including by closing tax havens, taxing the five big technology companies, and establishing a global carbon tax.

In addition, the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) anticipated the launch of a financing framework for SDG data, in October 2018. Also on the use of data for monitoring progress, participants raised the need for disaggregated data to reveal inequalities and lack of inclusion, for example, of people with disabilities.

The 2018 Index and Report find that no country is on track to achieve all of the SDGs, and progress is slowest on the environment-focused goals, such as SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land).

Christian Kroll, Bertelsmann Stiftung, explains in an SDSN press release that the Index’s calculations and projections indicate that all “countries will miss many of the SDGs if they do not up their game.” He stresses that countries face different challenges in achieving the SDGs, but they all have in common “the need to change current policies” to move towards SDG implementation and achievement.

While Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank the highest on the global SDG ranking, the report cautions that even high-ranking countries still face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs. For instance, Sweden is not on track to achieve SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 13 or 14. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) rank last in progress towards SDG achievement.

Countries experiencing conflict have experienced reversals in their SDG progress, particularly on Goals 1 and 2.

The report finds that many developing countries have made significant progress on SDG 1 (no poverty) and related measures on access to education and health services and to basic infrastructure. The report warns, however, that countries experiencing conflict have experienced reversals in their SDG progress, particularly on Goals 1 and 2.

The SDG Index 2018 also includes a measure of country progress on the 2030 Agenda’s principle of “leave no one behind,” for the first time. According to the Index, many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are performing poorly on this principle, as shown by progress towards targets on regional disparities in health care on SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and on learning outcomes under SDG 4 (quality education). The Index observes that comparable data on non-OECD countries’ progress on tackling inequality are not available, underscoring an urgent need to increase investments in data systems.

The report also analyzes Group of 20 (G20) government commitments to achieving the SDGs. It finds that almost all G20 countries have made some efforts to implement the SDGs, but all of these countries also fall short in areas related to government accountability mechanisms, budgeting and public management. The report identifies Brazil, Mexico and Italy as performing relatively highly on institutional implementation measures, as evidenced by SDG coordination units and strategies, while the US and the Russian Federation perform the worst. The report further observes that no G20 country has “fully aligned” its national budget with the SDGs.

The 2018 Index includes new data and indicators, which means that country performance cannot be compared with previous SDG Index scores.

130,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-analyzes-countries-readiness-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Analyzes Countries’ Readiness to Leave No One Behind,"18 July 2018: A briefing note and index launched in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) reviews the readiness of 86 countries to “leave no one behind.” With the SDGs in effect for nearly 1,000 days, the Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI) ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018’ explores the extent to which countries have the required data, policies and financing in place.

Elizabeth Stuart, ODI, emphasized during the launch event in New York, US, on 18 July 2018, that “we know what it takes” to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda, as articulated by the Index:

data to identify who is left behind and take stock of progress;

a reprioritization of policies to ensure that affected communities receive the resources they need;

finance, particularly in the areas of education, health and social protection; and

a rethinking of donors’ “risk appetites” to go beyond a poverty reduction agenda.

The 2018 Index builds on an inaugural Index released in 2017, adding a policy indicator on resilience, in line with the theme of the 2018 HLPF. Data collected on the additional indicator show that, of the 86 countries reviewed, more than half (46) are “not ready” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective. Stuart said a new indicator will be added annually, in line with the theme of each year’s HLPF.

The updated Index includes all countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018. On progress, the briefing note highlights that much of the progress made since last year has been in the realm of data, and 11 countries have improved their index score since 2017. Overall, ODI finds that 55 countries are “ready” to meet their commitment, 24 are “partially ready,” five are “not ready,” and two have insufficient data to make an informed assessment. The briefing note concludes that “many countries are insufficiently prepared” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective, with a quarter failing to enact appropriate policy frameworks. Further, the briefing note flags as a concern the finding that, despite the theme of the 2018 HLPF, most countries fail to identify, let alone prioritize, those most at risk of being left behind in the preparation of their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and other adaptation projects. A search of 57 countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change found that almost half did not contain a single mention of ODI’s keywords relating to a leave no one behind agenda.

ODI’s Index considers four indicators of outcomes: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment.

During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, highlighted that the leave no one behind terminology can “mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people,” and can be viewed from a variety of lenses, including income, geography, gender or location. On this, he noted a UNDP discussion paper to be released in the coming weeks titled, ‘What does it mean to leave no one behind?’ that will present a framework for implementation. Steiner also flagged that the SDGs are not a starting point, but rather a reminder of what we have left to do, following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. He and Stuart acknowledged, however, that the SDGs were agreed during a “high water mark for multilateralism,” and that in today’s very different political environment it is important to “keep driving through” and continue a positive narrative.

Isidoro Santana, Minister of Economy, Planning and Development, Dominican Republic, outlined challenges his country is facing, especially on tax capacity and domestic resource mobilization. He lamented that although a significant amount of public funding goes towards education, this leaves other social issues unattended. He noted that the Dominican Republic and many other middle-income countries (MICs) face a decline in official development assistance (ODA) at a time when domestic resources are not yet able to fill the finance gap, and addressing this could help to deliver the leave no one behind agenda.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, Canada, described measures that her government has taken to achieve leaving no one behind domestically, highlighting indigenous communities, affordable housing, and safe, clean drinking water as areas needing more action. She noted policy reforms that aim to lift children out of poverty, enhance workers’ benefits, and introduce a rights framework for indigenous communities, calling the SDGs an opportunity to link the “usual and unusual suspects together.” Caesar-Chavannes also emphasized Canada’s “feminist foreign policy,” saying it provides a gateway to being able to name and talk about those who are left behind. She noted investments in Canada’s national statistics office to add capacity on disaggregation and better tracking of outcomes.

While ODI’s Index primarily focuses on countries’ readiness to leave no one behind, it also considers four indicators of outcomes in order to demonstrate actual progress: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment. It aggregates data on these outcomes to assess whether countries are on track to leave no one behind, scoring them as on track, off track or making partial progress.

ODI’s analysis finds “a clear correlation” between countries’ readiness and outcome scores.

131,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/synthesis-report-highlights-challenges-in-meeting-global-water-goals/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Synthesis Report Highlights Challenges in Meeting Global Water Goals,"5 July 2018: The world is not on track to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), according to an UN-Water Report based on the latest data available for the 11 SDG 6 global indicators. The report titled, ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation,’ offers the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) a “joint position from the UN family on the global status on SDG 6 and other water-related targets.”



SDG 6 has eight targets, addressing: drinking water; sanitation and hygiene; water quality; water-use efficiency; integrated water resources management; water-related ecosystems; and means of implementation. The Synthesis Report outlines the challenges faced under each of these targets, provides charts depicting country and regional performance, discusses accelerating progress on the Goal, and provides summaries of ‘key messages’ on each target. The report concludes with general recommendations, including adopting “smart technologies” and engaging in multi-stakeholder partnerships, among other measures.

On drinking water (SDG target 6.1), coverage increased from 81% to 89% between 2000 and 2015, but progress among the lowest-performing countries has been insufficient to achieve universal coverage by 2030. On sanitation (SDG target 6.2), access to basic sanitation services increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period, but rural areas lag behind, and managing fecal sludge has become a challenge. The report highlights that substantial investment will be required, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, to install sewerage networks and sanitation systems, as well as strengthen the capacity of local and national authorities to manage them.

While progress monitoring on water and sanitation drew on data from at least the year 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, Synthesis Report authors observe that there has been a shorter history of collecting data on the other SDG 6 targets.

On water quality and wastewater treatment (SDG target 6.3), the report notes challenges for both developed and developing countries, especially with regard to monitoring industrial pollution. Preliminary estimates suggest that, in high to middle-income countries, 59% of household wastewater flows are safely treated, while the extent of industrial pollution is unknown.

On water-use efficiency (SDG target 6.4), the report finds a wide range of efficiency levels across the globe, and calls for additional indicators and data that can reflect improvements in agricultural use of water, and reduced losses in municipal distribution networks.

On integrated water resources management (IWRM) (SDG target 6.5), the report finds that most progress towards implementation has been in the areas of cross-sectoral coordination and public participation at the national level, but levels of financing, action on gender issues and aquifer management still remain low.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG target 6.6), the authors report that the world lost 70% of its natural wetlands over the last 100 years. Artificial water bodies such as reservoirs and rice paddies have increased; however data collection systems do not differentiate between artificial and natural wetlands. They call for further detailed data on water-related ecosystems and their benefits, and for complementing local data with earth observation data.

On means of implementation (SDG targets 6 a. and b.), the report cites research findings that the capital investments necessary to reach SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are around three times the current levels of investment, and that investments in achieving other targets will also require a significant increase.

The authors argue that achieving SDG 6 is crucial for achieving the rest of the 2030 Agenda. They also emphasize the interdependence among SDG 6 targets, noting, for example, the energy sector’s role in water withdrawals, and the possibility of reducing water pollution to increase access to freshwater.

To help develop key messages to be conveyed to the HLPF, an online multi-stakeholder dialogue on the report was launched on 2 May with a briefing for UN Member States. The dialogue, which will continue through September, will seek input according to the following guidelines: overall feedback (2-16 May); main messages for the HLPF (25 June to 9 July); and looking forward and next steps (31 August to 14 September).

At the HLPF, further discussions on achieving SDG 6 will take place in the context of several water-related events. They include, inter alia: a half-day review of SDG 6 implementation hosted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); a UN-Water side event on global progress on water and sanitation; a ‘Water and Faith Communities’ side event organized by the Ecumenical Water Network; and a side event on ‘Ensuring Intergenerational Policy Dialogues for the Achievement of SDG 6,’ which will explore opportunities for greater youth engagement, organized by the Water Youth Network, UN-Water, the International Hydrological Programme of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IHP) and the World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW).

132,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wri-report-recommends-greater-alignment-of-sdg-ndc-implementation-to-enhance-action/,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WRI Report Recommends Greater Alignment of SDG, NDC Implementation to Enhance Action","17 July 2018: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change should be implemented jointly to help scale up actions and impact, according to a study that finds that, in most countries, climate actions under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national targets under the SDGs have been defined and advanced separately.

The paper, which was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), examines the ways in which the alignment of the two processes can be increased, despite their distinct histories, communities of actors and political dynamics.

The paper titled, ‘Connecting the Dots: Elements for a Joined-Up Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement,’ explains that the SDGs and climate actions embedded in NDCs are still largely implemented under distinct tracks, despite growing recognition of the strong connections between the two agendas, the opportunities they present for synergies, and the “short window of opportunity” for addressing the interlinked challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, poverty, rising inequality and fragile governance.

Drawing on examples and lessons learned from 11 countries and the EU, the publication outlines efforts to bridge the two implementation tracks, and explains that a growing number of countries have began taking concrete steps to advance both agendas as one. More specifically, the report provides options and examples for linking institutional, policy, financial, and monitoring and reporting frameworks that support joint implementation, which can reduce transaction costs and enhance policy coherence.

The paper describes five areas where countries are taking action to jointly implement the agenda: 1) ensuring institutional coordination; 2) ensuring alignment of and synergies between nationally relevant SDG targets and climate actions; 3) mainstreaming the SDGs and NDCs jointly into national planning and budgets; 4) optimizing financial resources; and 5) designing mutually supportive monitoring and reporting frameworks.

Cross-fertilization between SDG and NDC targets can lead to greater ambition.

On coordinating institutions, the paper explains that SDG and NDC lead institutions can build on their different strengths and authorities to more effectively engage governments and other stakeholders, and calls for consistent leadership and bringing the climate and development communities together.

On alignment of and synergies between SDG and NDC targets, the paper notes that climate policymakers have acknowledged limited understanding of the ways in which the SDGs can support climate policymaking, while sector ministries often view NDCs as technical documents that are difficult for use in policy planning. It explains that cross-fertilization and alignment can lead to greater ambition, and calls for designing single long-term carbon-neutral, sustainable development strategies.

The paper states that while few countries have sought greater alignment, Mexico released a study identifying NDC actions with the greatest SDG benefits as priority “development accelerators.” In addition, Kenya undertook an SDG impact assessment for its National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022. Both studies, it notes, call for, inter alia, measures to maximize climate action benefits on inequality reduction and gender equality.

On jointly mainstreaming both agendas into policy planning and budgeting, the paper recommends: sector-specific guidelines; consistent use of performance frameworks and budget-tagging systems that consider the objectives of both agendas; a comprehensive gap analysis of both agendas; monitoring; and involving SDG and NDC lead institutions in planning processes. The paper discusses Colombia’s use of consistent guidelines and support for building the SDGs and NDCs into local development plans, and explains that several countries have also started reviewing and enforcing SDG-NDC mainstreaming.

On optimizing budgetary and financial resources, the paper recommends, inter alia, mobilizing and tracking SDG-related and climate finance, and integrated fiscal and regulatory reforms to help scale up finance for both agendas.

On mutually reinforcing monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks, the paper states that: consistent sets of SDG, climate and other development indicators and common data strategies support integrated monitoring of outcomes, and national progress reports can more systematically address SDG-climate linkages. It outlines the ways in which the Philippines, Finland and Kenya have assessed the relevance of global SDG indicators in monitoring climate actions, especially adaptation, noting that several countries have included SDG and NDC reporting in annual growth reviews and budget processes.

In addition, the report describes the ways in which international development can better support national efforts to link the two agendas, and urges development partners to support national efforts to link implementation efforts through an integrated approach to capacity building and project planning.

The report suggests that global reporting frameworks under the Paris Agreement and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) could better support national efforts to merge SDG and NDC implementation, and contends that the HLPF and Talanoa Dialogue offer near-term opportunities for countries to develop synergies to ramp up national ambitions.

133,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/twi2050-assays-global-transformations-for-the-sdgs/,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,TWI2050 Assesses Global Transformations for the SDGs,"12 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), The World in 2050 Initiative (TWI2050) launched its first report exploring transformational pathways to attain the SDGs. The report is based on the premises that no science-based pathways exist for successfully achieving all the SDGs simultaneously, and the global transformations necessary to achieve the Goals urgently need a “robust scientific foundation and fact-based way forward.”

The report titled, ‘Transformations to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,’ notes that attaining the SDGs by 2030 requires “deep transformation” at all levels and across all areas of human activity, new social values and norms, and changes in “individual belief systems” that shape attitudes and behaviors. It shows that transformation towards a sustainable future is possible, but ambitious action is needed “now.” This calls for, inter alia, investing in future priorities such as high-quality schools, improved health systems, efficiency and zero-carbon energy, environmental conservation and restoration, better food systems, more sustainable lifestyles, good governance institutions, and global cooperation initiatives to leverage dynamics towards the implementation of the SDGs.

The report identifies major sustainable development challenges that are described by the SDGs, namely:

many people are trapped in an extreme poverty that is multidimensional, and have high and rising inequalities of income, employment and social status;

human activity is degrading the physical environment and the global commons;

demographic stresses are arising from high fertility rates (mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Middle East), rapid urbanization (especially in Africa and parts of Asia) and rapid aging; and

weak and bad governance, failing institutions, a rise in nationalism in many countries and regions, intensifying international conflicts, and eroding multilateral systems are undermining the local, national and global capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda.

The publication also outlines the need to move beyond the sectoral and fragmented approach, and it focuses on six “exemplary transformations” needed to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Those are: human capacity and demography; consumption and production; decarbonization and energy; food, biosphere, and water; smart cities; and digital revolution. The report also emphasizes the need to link these transformations with governance considerations, arguing that transformations require governance structures and capabilities, political action, and the formation of actors of change at local, national and global levels.

During the report’s launch event on 12 July, Jeffrey Sachs, Director, Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), outlined the importance of making governance work and of “re-establishing planning,” since, he said, there is currently “no planning” in much of the world, and a lack of capacity to think ahead. Alessandra Casazza, UN Development Programme (UNDP), explained that in many African countries, for example, planning systems need to be modernized, but governments favor incremental changes to “drastic changes,” and budgets are often based on sectoral approaches. She added that some countries are starting to adopt program-based budgeting and other cross-sectoral approaches, but their effectiveness requires political will and leadership, in addition to capacity.

Among elements the report should consider in the future, participants noted the need to assess the financial resources required to implement the “transformations” identified. Others called for examining the transformations needed at the country level, and for relying not only on models, but on other approaches as well. Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Deputy Director General, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), remarked that a 2019 edition of the report could be complementary to the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), also scheduled to be released in 2019.

Prepared by more than 60 authors and 20 organizations, TWI2050 uses a framework that allows modeling and analytical groups, such as integrated assessment and Earth system modelers, to explore jointly a series of measures needed to achieve all the SDGs, while accounting for synergies and trade-offs.

TWI2050 is a global research initiative that seeks to “provide the fact-based knowledge” to support the policy process and implementation of the SDGs, and to address “transformational challenges” related to achieving the 17 SDGs “in an integrated manner.” The initiative brings together a network of more than 150 participants including leading policymakers, businesses, modeling and analytical teams from around the world. It was launched in 2015 by IIASA, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), and the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC).

Country Reviews and Civil Society Spotlight Reports

As 46 countries discussed their VNRs (a summary of main messages is here), civil society organizations were present to hold governments to account. Civil society organizations were also active throughout the Forum to share their own findings in the margins of official VNR presentations.

Numerous civil society reports, also known as “spotlight reports,” have been released to provide another assessment of countries’ progress than what governments present during the VNR sessions. As UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed noted during the Partnership Exchange on 13 July, these reports can serve to confirm, strengthen or sometimes even refute official VNRs. Also on 13 July, a side event titled ‘SDG Implementation at National Level: What’s the Point of National Reports?’ shared knowledge across civil society actors, and discussed whether spotlight reports lead to changes. An IISD Reporting Services summary of the event is available here.

AwazCDS-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Development Alliance, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Pakistan and UK Aid, released a report titled, ‘Where Pakistan Stands on the Implementation of the SDGs 2018.’

The British Columbia Council for International Cooperation (BCCIC) authored a publication titled, ‘Where Canada Stands, Vol. II, 2018: A Sustainable Development Goals Shadow Report’

Platform Agenda 2030 released a report titled, ‘How Sustainable is Switzerland: Implementing the 2030 Agenda from a Civil Society Perspective.’

UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) launched the report, ‘Measuring up: How the UK is performing on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.’

Coalition 2030 released a report evaluating Ireland’s progress on each SDG. The report notes that the country’s National Implementation Plan for the SDGs 2018-2020 is a first step, but progress has been slow and that more action is needed. A press release is also available.

Additional releases on the Action for Sustainable Development platform respond to the official VNRs for Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Mexico, Palestine, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Sudan.

In addition to these country-specific reports, a civil society report titled, ‘Spotlight on Sustainable Development 2018: Exploring new policy pathways,’ reviews “how to overcome obstacles and contradictions in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda,” also looking at cross-cutting policy ideas and individual SDG “spotlights.” It is published by the Arab NGO Network for Development (ANND), the Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR), Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), Global Policy Forum (GPF), Public Services International (PSI), Social Watch, Society for International Development (SID), and Third World Network (TWN), supported by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. The authors note that the world is off-track on delivering the policy changes needed to enable SDG achievement.

The authors of the Spotlight Report 2018, also provide 18 national reports. A corresponding post by Jens Martens, Global Policy Forum, stresses that implementation issues and countries’ being “off-track” is not due to a lack of financial resources, but rather the need to ensure policy coherence and reduce contradictions. Martens also highlights military spending and improving regulations for sustainability and human rights as key areas to address.

Additionally, a middle ground of sorts seemed to emerge in reporting: the Government of Germany invited an independent, international peer review of the country’s 2016 sustainable development strategy, which delivered its insights at a side event on 12 July.

Another actor with a potential voice in reviewing SDG progress is each country’s parliament. Together 2030 and partners released a civil society handbook for engaging parliaments in support of the SDGs, opening with an explanation of parliaments’ relevance to SDG implementation. The document features engagement strategies to approach private meetings, run SDG trainings and launch public campaigns, identifying entry points into parliamentary activities and noting which strategies are most valued by members of parliament themselves.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) also led an initiative to bolster the official VNR sessions, by convening a series of “VNR Labs” during the HLPF ministerial meeting. The Labs aimed to take stock of countries’ experiences with the reviews to date, and to provide an informal space for dialogue focused on key themes, including leveraging interlinkages, leaving no one behind, data, and mobilizing resources, among other topics.

Data and Ensuring that No One is Left Behind

With SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals) under review each year, a number of reports and initiatives continued to be developed around data, analyzing interlinkages across the SDGs, and evaluating progress towards key principles that underpin the 2030 Agenda, such as leaving no one behind.

Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched their 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards Report. Assessing where each country stands in terms of SDG progress, this iteration of the index and dashboard also ranks countries based on their aggregate performance, incorporating trend data for the first time. Sweden, Denmark and Finland stand atop the ranking, but the authors note that several indicator and methodology changes mean that this year’s findings are not comparable to those of 2017. Overall, the report finds that conflicts have reversed progress in many parts of the world, and that no country is on track to meet all SDGs. A Q&A with SDSN Director Jeffrey Sachs is available on Devex.

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) highlighted its Arab Development Portal, developed in partnership with the Coordination Group of Arab, National and Regional Development Institutions (CG), the Islamic Development Bank and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) to track progress on SDGs in the region. Initially launched in 2016, the Portal, UNDP notes, is now available to everyone. Additionally, UNDP and the RISE Institutes of Sweden launched the ‘SDG Trend Scanner,’ which provides “an opportunity to understand key disruptive trends” through an SDG lens. It also creates a platform to compare different trends and trend assessments, as well as identify trends that feature “low probability, high impact characteristics.”

The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released the second version of a tool to analyze and visualize interlinkages amongst SDG targets. The SDG Interlinkages Analysis & Visualization Tool (version 2.0) methodology builds on the official SDG indicator framework, World Bank and other time series data, proxy indicators from other sources and a comprehensive literature to identify relationships between pairs of targets. The tool allows for quantitative analysis of SDG interlinkages, which, the release notes, can inform policy-making, priority-setting, resource allocation and monitoring efforts. A separate post on Eco-Business by Zafirah Zein highlights the importance of analyzing interlinkages amongst SDG targets, describing the Millennium Institute’s iSDG model.

An analysis by The Brookings Institution seeks to quantify how many people might be left behind, as well as identify those the world is set to “help,” by 2030. The authors’ study examines 21 “people-focused” SDG targets, segmented into absolute and relative terms (i.e. zero poverty versus reducing road deaths by half) and distinguished by life and death issues or basic needs (i.e. child mortality versus gender equality of opportunity). Preliminary findings suggest that, for six indicators alone, over 40 million lives are at stake. The study also features a country-by-country analysis that identifies where targeted actions are needed.

The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) launched its ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018,’ on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is forthcoming. The Index reviews the readiness of 86 countries to leave no one behind, looking at measures taken in the realms of data, policy and finance. A second ODI paper, titled ‘Leaving no one behind through enabling climate-resilient economic development in dryland regions’ looks at the issue in dryland economies. Linking data and the leave no one behind agenda, a blog by ODI’s Elizabeth Stuart released prior to the HLPF calls for “governments to be honest about failure and rigorous in analyzing progress.”

Engaging Businesses

With a variety of private sector actors in New York for the 17 July SDG Business Forum, a range of events and papers highlighted efforts that leaders in the private sector are taking to contribute towards the SDGs.

Harvard Kennedy School’s Corporate Responsibility Initiative and Business Fights Poverty released a paper titled, ‘Advocating Together for the SDGs: How civil society and business are joining voices to change policy attitudes and practices.’ The paper outlines six key building blocks for responsible and effective advocacy collaboration: 1) respect government’s leadership role; 2) put the interests of people and planet first; 3) invest sufficient resources at the outset to gather necessary data and evidence to build understanding; 4) understand and manage stakeholder dynamics; 5) ensure consistency between external positions and internal policies; and 6) conduct advocacy collaboration transparently. It features several examples of corporate-NGO advocacy efforts, as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives on global frameworks, such as We Are Still In.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) released a document prepared for the HLPF, which reviews ‘Business Action for Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ The paper identifies business actions on each of the SDGs that were reviewed, recommending that governments work with the private sector to build collaborative frameworks and policies that will leave no one behind, incentivize investment, and set a solid foundation for public-private partnerships and public procurement processes.

The UN Global Compact Local launched a report demonstrating how local networks can close gaps in SDG achievement. Titled, ‘Global Compact Local Networks: Accelerating National SDG Implementation 2018 Edition,’ the paper considers systematic business engagement through five areas of activity: awareness raising; capacity building; recognizing leadership; policy dialogue; and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Under these activities, the document describes case examples from more than 30 countries.

A paper by econsense takes a business view of the SDGs. Titled, ‘Taking on Sustainable Development in Germany,’ the paper advocates for an open dialogue with all stakeholders and encourages the German government to further-embrace the SDGs. Econsense emphasizes the need to recognize partnerships with the private sector as a means of not only driving SDG implementation, but also setting norms and ethical principles.

The World Business Council for Sustainable Development also co-organized multiple events that highlighted additional report in the areas of water, sanitation and health (WASH), chemicals, human rights, investor needs and business reporting, on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is forthcoming.

Three panels consisting of speakers from civil society, the private sector and the UN system described the context for the evening’s event, articulated the links between sustainability, oceans and climate, and offered examples of public-private partnerships to help deliver the SDGs.

Organized in Partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) and the UN Global Compact, the event provided new perspectives, including from youth, on how to make the world more peaceful and inclusive. Genevieve Jiva, Fiji, one of the Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassadors, described the process of a Talanoa dialogue, noting that it seeks to answer three questions: Where are we? Where do we need to go? How do we get there? These are the questions, she described, that the Youth Ambassadors address as they travel with Peace Boat to raise awareness and inspire action on the Goals.

Challenges and Opportunities

Speakers discussed current challenges, raising issues of ocean plastic, elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poverty, food insecurity and food waste, but also identified areas of hope. Cora Weiss, Hague Appeal for Peace, noted that peace makes it possible for sustainable development to happen, highlighting the recent peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea as setting the stage for progress. Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, in remarks delivered by video, flagged that more people need to know why the ocean and environment matter.

Echoing Earle, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that humanity has not been sufficiently taught about the need for action. Thomson cautioned that the world is still on a path to three degrees warming, a “dangerous uncertainty.” He emphasized the need for multilateralism, “now more than ever,” to teach humanity how to implement the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

We are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.

Former Astronaut Col. Ron J. Garan described an example of a man on a horse, who, when asked where he was going, responded, “I don’t know, ask the horse!” Drawing comparisons to Thomson’s remarks, he noted that “we are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.” He underscored the need for a new perspective, articulating how his experience in space shifted his worldview. We as a global society, he noted, need to move from a model of fragmented nation-states that consume as if there are unlimited natural resources, to one where we are common occupants of a single planet, recognizing our finite supplies.

Going Forward

Andrew Friedman, AJF Financial Services, Inc., expressed his desire to one day live in a world where we don’t have to use the word sustainable, because sustainability is already ingrained into everyday life. To get there, he offered perspective on action being taken outside of the UN system. Friedman emphasized the role of organizations like US SIF (the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as key to making progress in the private sector, and highlighted the need for shareholder activism.

Robert Skinner, UNOP, highlighted how the Office acts as a gateway and platform to connect and convene actors, including those from the private sector, noting similarities to Peace Boat as a means of sharing information to create a better world. Dan Thomas, delivering remarks on behalf of Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact, also recognized that Peace Boat provides a means for decision-makers and civil society alike to connect informally, outside a more formal UN setting.

Yoshioka Tatsuya, Peace Boat Founder and Marie Chatardová, President of ECOSOC, each highlighted that without peace, we cannot achieve the SDGs. International frameworks such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris Agreement on climate change, they noted, are both a vision and a means of achieving a sustainable, peaceful world.

Peace Boat is docked in the Hudson River, across town from UN Headquarters where the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is currently underway. Event participants pointed out that it offers an opportunity for networking and idea exchange outside of UN Headquarters. Peace Boat has featured the circular SDGs logo on its hull since 2016, and visits more than 100 countries per year to raise awareness on the 2030 Agenda.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

The Summit reflected on synergies between Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda and supported efforts to promote women’s empowerment and tackle corruption.

The 31st ordinary session of the AU convened in Nouakchott, Mauritania, from 25 June to 2 July 2018, under the theme ‘Winning the Fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation.’ The Summit included the 36th Ordinary Session of the Permanent Representatives’ Committee, the 33rd Ordinary Session of the Executive Council, the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of States and Government of the AU.

On the AfCFTA, 49 out of the AU’s 55 member States have signed the agreement establishing the AfCFTA. Chad, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Ghana, Kenya, Niger and Rwanda have ratified the AfCFTA. Participants adopted five priority sectors: transport; communication; finance; tourism; and business. Leaders urged member States who have not yet done so to sign and ratify the agreement and urged member States to abstain from entering into bilateral trading agreements until after the AfCFTA enters into force.

The Assembly approved the AUDA’s establishment as the AU’s technical body and requested the AU Commission to develop a statute for AUDA for adoption at the January 2019 Summit. The Assembly recognized the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency as the organization responsible for implementation of Africa’s Agenda 2063 and implementation of various African development programmes and initiatives. The Assembly agreed the implementation of African development programmes and initiatives would transition from NEPAD to AUDA.

During the opening session, President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, who also serves as the AU Chair, described partnership as the common thread in the Summit’s deliberations. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed stressed sustainable development as the center of the UN’s strategic partnership with the AU. She observed that Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “share a common vision” and provide the basis for the AU-UN Partnership framework for development. She called for aligning policy, programming and accountability on the agendas to amplify impact at regional and country levels.

Mohammed reflected that, in spite of huge challenges, Africa is making “continuous progress”, as evidenced by declining child and maternal mortality, increasing access to all levels of education and increasing decision-making roles held by women, in line with SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality). She said the AU Great Green Wall can protect millions of people from climate change and desertification impacts while integrating renewable energy and investments in value chains, in line with SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land).

On peace, security and migration, Mohammed praised Africa as a “generous humanitarian actor,” describing the continent as one of the “most reliable contributors” to UN peacekeeping operations. She further noted that Africa hosts more than one-quarter of the world’s refugees and displaced people, showing “a solidarity that is often missing elsewhere.” AUC Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat stressed the importance of the free movement of persons, saying Africans should not “be foreigners on their own continent.” He urged member States to ratify the AU Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment to ensure that Africans are treated with dignity and respect across the continent.

The Summit also addressed reports on peace and security and progress on reducing armed conflicts in Africa in line with the ‘AU Master Roadmap on Practical Steps to Silence the Guns in Africa by 2020,’ one of the key projects of Agenda 2063. Participants commended Zambia and Zimbabwe for being the first countries to submit written reports on their implementation of the Roadmap and called on member States to emulate their example.

A panel discussion on corruption focused on evaluating Africa’s progress in fighting corruption and developing additional strategies to tackle it. The Assembly encouraged member States to tackle illicit financial flows, invest in the demographic dividend and strengthen national anti-corruption agencies. Mahamat called on governments to follow up on the recommendations of the Tabi Mebki Panel on illicit financial flows, underscoring the potential contribution of these lost resources to finance Africa’s development.

On SDG 5, Kagame and European Union (EU) Commissioner Mimica co-hosted a joint AU-EU ‘Women in Power’ side-event on the role of women in driving political, social and economic development. Participants supported accelerating efforts towards gender equality and women’s empowerment, stressing such progress as fundamental to achieving all the SDGs.

The Summit also addressed, inter alia: the AU budget, which has been reduced by 12% compared to 2018 in line with management effectiveness reforms; a common position on the UN high-level meeting on Tuberculous; and appointments. The Summit designated the theme for the 2019 Summit as the ‘Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons in Africa: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement.’ [AU Press Release on Opening] [AU Press Release on Key Conclusions] [AU Press Release on Gender Equality Side Event] [President Kagame Statement] [UN Deputy Secretary-General Statement]","6 July 2018: Heads of State and Government attending the 31st ordinary session of the African Union (AU) discussed the AU institutional reforms, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the establishment of the AU Development Agency (AUDA), and peace and security, among other topics.

Many speakers called for justice, dignity and a human rights-based approach to affordable housing in cities. Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, argued that housing (SDG target 11.1) is the most significant issue facing cities today, and highlighted the injustice of development that destroys urban neighborhoods and displaces residents.

Marc Pecsteen, Permanent Representative of Belgium and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), chaired the session reviewing SDG 11. Discussions drew on the joint report by UN-Habitat and partner agencies, released on 9 July, which outlined global progress and challenges for sustainable cities. The report titled, ‘SDG 11 Synthesis Report: Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ presents UN agencies’ joint position.

Benjamin Rae, Statistics Division, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), stressed that, if States continue to rely on the private sector for housing, then they are obliged to ensure markets provide affordable housing.

Rohit Aggarwala, Columbia University, noted there is no “one size fits all” formula for achieving the various SDG 11 targets, and called for thoughtful and comprehensive management of urban issues and appropriate distribution of powers.

Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, New York City, highlighted that New York is the first city in the world to submit a voluntary local review to the UN, and has declared 11 July to be Global Goals Day in honor of the SDGs. She highlighted commonalities between the SDGs and the OneNYC campaign, including: principles of growth, equity, sustainability and resilience; consultative processes with local agencies, residents and businesses; commitment to leave no one behind; and measurement of progress. Noting that “progress is in fact possible,” she highlighted the city has achieved cleaner air and water, record wage growth, and tripled the number of children accessing quality early childhood education.

Jean Todt, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, observed that urbanization is strongly correlated with the use of motor vehicles. He highlighted the economic and social cost of road accidents, and argued that road safety (SDG target 11.2) should be considered part and parcel of sustainable mobility and transport, citing a combination of necessary policy elements, including affordable public transport and infrastructure for motorized and non-motorized transport.

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, noted that, while the percentage of slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing has decreased, their absolute numbers nevertheless has increased. She defined three key challenges for implementing SDG 11: housing affordability (SDG target 11.1), accessibility and adequacy of housing; management of urban sprawl (SDG target 11.3 on sustainable human settlement planning); and access to public spaces (SDG target 11.7). She added that monitoring progress will depend on having common definitions and units of analysis, and drew attention to UN-Habitat’s National Sample of Cities as a model for aggregating data from different cities within a country so as to discern dominant patterns.

Meera AlShaikh, Project Manager, Smart Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighted the high ecological footprint of urban areas and presented Dubai’s strategies for providing solar energy, increased use of recycled water, and various technologies including blockchain, AI and ICT services to enable Dubai’s transformation as a smart city.

Other speakers emphasized the need for finding new approaches to citizen participation, participatory governance by the urban poor, cities’ connections with rural ecosystems, post-disaster management to “build back better,” and the need to stop gender-based violence.

Many UN Member States, major groups, UN agencies and international organizations made interventions from the floor, highlighting country and programme experiences. Delegates linked improvements in urban spaces to poverty alleviation, and some countries, including Brazil and Sierra Leone, stressed the right to housing as an integral part of sustainable cities. They noted the particular needs of women, persons with disabilities, youth, and elderly persons, and drew attention to conflict as a driver for migrants and refugees moving to cities. Several delegates gave examples of “smart city” approaches that not only promote the use of digital technologies but also increase social inclusion, environmental sustainability and quality of life for urban residents.

Many also cited air quality as an important element of sustainable cities, noting the benefits of electric vehicles for reducing air pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) noted that only 12% of cities meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.

Concluding the session, Abeywardena highlighted that “this is not just about SDG 11,” but about the roles that cities will play in achieving all the SDGs.

Drawing on experiences from 16 predominantly megadiverse countries, the report highlights examples of good practices and remaining challenges in four key areas related to biodiversity mainstreaming. These include: at the national level, including national development plans and national budgets; in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors; in development co-operation; and the monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity mainstreaming. The analysis examines countries that span all income groups, from high-income economies such as Australia and France to lower-income economies such as Ethiopia and Madagascar.

The report notes that, for biodiversity mainstreaming to be effective, it should occur across all levels of government and include all relevant stakeholders, as entry points interact and are located at different levels of governance. To support implementation, the publication points out that mainstreaming initiatives need to be accompanied by budgetary allocations.

The report recommends, inter alia, that governments prioritize actions that underwrite a strong business case for biodiversity. These include: conducting a national assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services outlining the key pressures on biodiversity and incorporating, where possible, the full social benefits that ecosystems and ecosystem services provide, including monetary values where feasible. These also include integrating biodiversity-related considerations into sector-level resource assessments – for instance, agriculture, forestry, fisheries – and identifying key pressures in each case. Other actions to be prioritized include: investing in statistical and/or data systems to establish an evidence base on the drivers, pressures and state of biodiversity; and developing targeted messages that support collaborative solutions.

The Forum, organized in collaboration with the European Commission, Mexico, Egypt, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, was held at the margins of the second meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation SBI 2 under the CBD.

Announced at the ICLEI triennial World Congress, the ‘ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024’ identifies pathways towards sustainable urban development.

Convening in Montreal, Canada, from 19-22 June 2018, the meeting, which aimed to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by strengthening action taken in urban areas worldwide, emphasized that building sustainable cities will help realize the SDGs, particularly SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which, participants stressed, can be used as a “central lever” to advance all 17 SDGs.

The ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, which was adopted by the ICLEI Council on 30 May 2018, in advance of the World Congress: provides guidance for action by ICLEI members and network cities; lays out a roadmap for advancing sustainable urban development through 2024, taking into account the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda (NUA); and describes a new model of more inclusive sustainable development governance.

The strategic vision focuses on systems thinking, which highlights the complex relationship among urban systems, and emphasizes an integrated approach to policy and planning. It lays out five interconnected pathways towards 1) low emission, 2) nature-based, 3) circular, 4) resilient and 5) equitable and people-centered development, and supportive policy approaches related to sustainable governance and management, innovation and science, and innovative finance models.

The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

The five pathways aim to cut across sectors and jurisdictional boundaries and create connection points across urban systems to enable local and regional governments to take an integrated approach to sustainable urban development, for example, by determining where equity intersects with resilience or where nature-based solutions can contribute to resilience building. The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

In the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, ICLEI members pledge to: scale up and expand the model of sustainable cities and regions; make sustainability a fundamental and inextricable part of local and global development; tackle the most pressing issues with the long-term interests of citizens in mind; and undertake a collective effort for global change across all sectors and levels of government.

More specifically, the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024 aims to, inter alia: promote 100% renewable energy; support industrial legacy in cities transitioning to sustainable economies; lead the transition to a green economy through sustainable public procurement networks; connect climate action to urban development and engage local and regional governments in making Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) fit for the Paris Agreement; and lead the implementation of global biodiversity targets at the city and regional levels.

More than 1,000 participants attended the congress, representing local, regional and national governments, international agencies, the private sector, academia, community groups and other partners.

The ICLEI World Congress, first held in 1990, takes place every three years to showcase the efforts of local and regional governments to advance sustainable urban development. ICLEI is a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions in over 100 countries committed to sustainable development, which acts as a bridge between local and regional governments worldwide.

The side event titled, ‘Stakeholder Engagement in the HLPF and its Review in 2019,’ was organized by the Major Groups and Other Stakeholder (MGOS), and took place on the first day of the HLPF.

Opening the event, Jeffery Huffines, CIVICUS, noted that in 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and another one at the level of the UNGA. In addition, beginning in September 2019, he said governments will begin a process of reviewing the HLPF’s format and organizational aspects.

The HLPF was established in 2013, through UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 67/290, in accordance with paragraph 84 of ‘The Future We Want,’ the outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Resolution 67/290 was followed by the adoption of UNGA resolution 70/299 in July 2016 that clarifies various elements related to the follow-up and review functions of the HLPF, including the specific themes of the Forum for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as the set of SDGs to be reviewed in depth in those years. Resolution 70/299 also notes that progress in its implementation and in the implementation of UNGA resolution 67/290 will be reviewed by the UNGA at its 74th session (2019-2020) “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.

In the context of this upcoming review process, panelists at the side event highlighted concerns and suggestions with regard to MGOS participation in the HLPF. Stefano Prato, Society for International Development, noted that despite a “significant shrinking” of space for civic engagement, there is capacity to “bridge democratic and bureaucratic deficit.” He called on MGOS to take concrete steps to ensure the participation of “right-holders” (such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, migrants and refugees), in the Forum. He also called on MGOS to “connect the dots” by linking engagement mechanisms between various thematic platforms, such as financing for development (FfD) or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). He underlined the need to better organize, engage more closely with the regional level, and change the nature of the HLPF in a way that allows taking “collective” decisions on issues that need to be addressed.

Mohammed Ali Loutfy, Disabled Peoples International (DPI), said: coalitions composed of civil society and stakeholders should be better supported and recognized as part of SDG reviews; more stakeholders should be involved in SDG implementation at the national level; and there should be increased engagement with local authorities and grassroot groups, and improved coordination between UN agencies and civil society. He called for bringing different participatory processes together, and suggested to have stakeholders represented in the office(s) in charge of SDG implementation at the national level.

Beisheim noted that the thematic reviews lack guidelines, have difficult-to-follow preparatory processes, and lack actionable results.

Marianne Beisheim, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, characterized the HLPF as “the institutional home” of the SDGs, recalling that one of its roles is to follow up on and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. She said there are complementary components of the follow-up and review process, such as the thematic reviews, regional reviews, voluntary national reviews (VNRs), the SDG progress report issued by the UN Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). On issues with the thematic reviews, she noted, inter alia, the absence of guidelines, the difficulty to follow preparatory processes, and the lack of actionable results. On VNRs, she remarked that quality of national preparatory processes and reports vary, national reviews often lack analysis of good practices and challenges, and there is limited room for critical questions from MGOS. She underlined the limited time for in-depth discussions at the HLPF, and the need to secure actionable results for both the thematic reviews and the VNRs.

Among other suggestions, Beisheim called for guidelines and for including policy recommendations from thematic reviews and VNRs in HLPF outcome documents. She also proposed that designated custodian institutions publish a roadmap on preparatory and follow-up process for thematic reviews “in good time,” and that the HLPF makes more room for debates related to VNRs.

Rebecca Malay, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, GCAP, noted that most thematic reviews and VNRs do not frame the SDGs based on a human rights approach. She remarked that the SDG indicators are often “confined” to technocrats, without civil society involvement. She also observed that the many independent reports prepared by civil society organizations on SDG national implementation (“shadow reports”) are not available on the HLPF’s VNR website.

On lessons learned regarding the HLPF so far, Sachini Perera, International Women’s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW), RESURJ, said the review of the HLPF in 2019 should take into account the ongoing UN reform, and should examine how human rights can be incorporated in the Forum, adding that human rights processes are currently overlooked when assessing SDG progress.

Discussing stakeholder engagement in the HLPF and its review in 2019, Jan-Gustav Strandenaes, Stakeholder Forum, said paragraph 15 of resolution 67/290 defines civil society’s rights and privileges at the HLPF. This paragraph allows MGOS to: attend all official meetings of the forum; have access to all official information and documents; intervene in official meetings; submit documents and present written and oral contributions; make recommendations; and organize side events and round tables, in cooperation with UN Member States and the UN Secretariat. Compared to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that preceded the establishment of the HLPF, however, Strandenaes noted that some privileges have been lost, including the access and participation to all negotiations, access to all rooms and participation in all meetings, and access to all delegates on the floor. He also underscored the “enormous” mandate of the HLPF, as defined in resolution 67/290 and the 2030 Agenda, and identified elements that should be improved, including on emerging issues, the science-policy interface, stakeholder engagement, and on developing and negotiating the Ministerial Declaration.

It also approved the reorganization of the current Department of Management and Department of Field Support into the proposed new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and Department of Operational Support. Following agreement on these matters in the (UNGA) Fifth Committee (Budgetary and Administrative). Following agreement in the Fifth Committee on resolutions outlining these decisions, the UNGA met to adopt the text.



The Fifth Committee concluded the second part of its resumed session on 5 July 2018, in New York, US. The new departments on peacebuilding were considered in a text titled ‘Special subjects relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019.’ The other reorganization was outlined in a text titled, ‘Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations.’

In a meeting on 8 June on strengthening the accountability system of the UN under the new management paradigm, delegates called for continued refinement of policies and practices to improve accountability. Christian Saunders, introducing the Secretary‑General’s report on the matter, explained that the increased delegation of authority under that new management paradigm will be accompanied by a simplification and streamlining of the rules, policies and procedures. The increased delegation of authority will also be accompanied by the development and dissemination of administrative guidance along with training, support, monitoring and accountability mechanisms. By leveraging the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja, the proposed Business Transformation and Accountability Division would use business analytics to provide real‑time reporting on performance to senior managers, as well as other internal and external stakeholders.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), supported by the US, noted that future reports of the Secretary-General must expand on the implementation of the accountability system by providing more complete information on the overall status. The US recommended including benchmarks to substantiate the impact of accountability initiatives.

Switzerland, also for Liechtenstein, said roles and responsibilities must be clarified. She noted that greater authority should be given to managers entrusted to deliver on UN’s mandates, who in turn must be held accountable for their decisions, performance and conduct. She added that managers have the tools and ability to exercise such authority. China called for strengthening the supervision of accountability by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee.

Titled ‘Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017,’ the study finds that Antarctic ice loss has tripled since 2012, with 180 billion tonnes of melted ice entering the ocean annually, amidst rising global temperatures.

The study comes at a time when global temperatures for the first five months of 2018 have been the highest on record for a La Niña year, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition, May 2018 was the fourth warmest May on record, according to NASA, and the year 2018 saw record warmth across parts of North America, Europe and Asia, and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.

In addition, long-term warming due to record high concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and high-impact weather events are also continuing, with floods killing dozens in East Africa, tropical cyclones hitting Somalia, Djibouti, Yemen and Oman, sand and dust storms occurring in India, and Pakistan experiencing heatwaves. In addition, the Caribbean is preparing for another hurricane season while still recovering from the devastation caused by the 2017 hurricane season. [WMO Press Release on Above Average Temperatures] [UNFCCC Press Release on Continuing Extreme Weather]

Antarctica’s potential contribution to sea level rise from land-held ice is almost 7.5 times greater than all other sources in the world combined.

Climate change mitigation would lessen the impact of these events, and, as the report contends, is critical to ensure that the Antarctic ice sheets do not collapse. Such a collapse would lead to: disastrous consequences for low-lying cities and communities, contamination of freshwater sources, and interference with agriculture by stunting crop growth. The study, the most complete assessment to date of Antarctic ice mass changes based on the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-Comparison Exercise (IMBIE), found that the ice sheet is melting at a rate that will contribute at least six inches to sea level rise by 2100 based on 24 satellite surveys of Antarctica.

The research team, comprised of 80 scientists from 42 international organizations, looked at the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet from 1992-2017, finding that ice losses raised global sea levels by 0.3 inches, with a sharp increase in ice loss in recent years. The study attributes the increase to the rising rates of ice melt in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, and reduced growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet.

According to NASA, Antarctica’s potential contribution to sea level rise from land-held ice is almost 7.5 times greater than all other sources in the world combined, and the continent stores enough frozen water to raise sea levels by 190 feet if it all melted.

Japanese Governmental Efforts toward the SDGs and 'SDGs Future Cities'

In response to the United Nations' adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the Japanese government established a cabinet body, the SDGs Promotion Headquarters (below, ""the Headquarters"") in May 2016. Headed by the Prime Minister and composed of all of Japan's ministers of state, the Headquarters meets semiannually to ensure a whole-government approach to achieving the SDGs effectively.

In the SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles spelled out by the Headquarters, Japan's vision is to ""Become a leader toward a future where economic, social and environmental improvements are attained in an integrated, sustainable and resilient manner while leaving no one behind."" The Japanese government has identified eight priority areas out of the 17 SDGs.

Empowerment of all people Achievement of good health and longevity Creating growth markets, revitalizing rural areas, and promoting science, technology and innovation Sustainable and resilient land use, promoting quality infrastructure Energy conservation, renewable energy, climate change countermeasures, and sound material-cycle society Conservation of the environment, including biodiversity, forests and the oceans Achieving peaceful, safe and secure societies Strengthening the means and frameworks for the implementation of the SDGs

The SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles also indicate the following three directions of Japan's SDG models to transform companies, regional communities and society through promotion of the SDGs and thereby achieve economic growth and spread it further to the rest of the world.

Promotion of Society 5.0, which is interlocked with the SDGs Regional vitalization driven by the SDGs and creation of resilient, environmentally friendly, attractive communities Empowerment of future generations and women to bear responsibility for the SDGs

Japan faces many problems, including aging and depopulation, especially in rural areas, so regional revitalization has become a key word. In line with this, as a project for local government SDG promotion toward regional revitalization, the national government is inviting local governments to propose projects for achieving the SDGs. It is also selecting local governments that have proposed excellent projects as SDGs Future Cities, with strong support from a taskforce of ministries and agencies involved in local government SDG promotion.

On June 15, 2018, the Cabinet Office announced that 29 local governments had been selected as SDGs Future Cities.

https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/tiiki/kankyo/teian/pdf/result01.pdf (Japanese)

The following 29 local governments were selected as SDGs Future Cities.

Hokkaido Prefecture; Sapporo in Hokkaido; Niseko in Hokkaido; Shimokawa in Hokkaido; Higashi Matsushima in Miyagi; Semboku in Akita; Iide in Yamagata; Tsukuba in Ibaraki; Kanagawa Prefecture, Yokohama in Kanagawa; Kamakura in Kanagawa; Toyama City in Toyama; Suzu in Ishikawa; Hakusan in Ishikawa, Nagano Prefecture, Shizuoka City in Shizuoka; Hamamatsu in Shizuoka; Toyota in Aichi; Shima in Mie; Sakai in Osaka; Totsukawa in Nara; Okayama City in Okayama; Maniwa in Okayama; Hiroshima Prefecture; Ube in Yamaguchi; Kamikatsu in Tokushima; Kitakyushu in Fukuoka; Iki in Nagasaki; and Oguni in Kumamoto.

The national government is also selecting some projects proposed by the SDGs Future Cities as Local Government SDG Model Projects for funding. Ten projects proposed by the following ten local governments out of the 29 have been selected as Local Government SDGs Model Projects.

Niseko in Hokkaido; Shimokawa in Hokkaido; Kanagawa Prefecture; Yokohama in Kanagawa; Kamakura in Kanagawa; Toyama City in Toyama; Maniwa in Okayama; Kitakyushu in Fukuoka; Iki in Nagasaki; and Oguni in Kumamoto.

To commend companies and other organizations for their excellent efforts to contribute toward achieving the SDGs, the Headquarters established the Japan SDGs Awards. Shimokawa in Hokkaido handily won the Prime Minister Award at the 1st Japan SDGs Awards, announced in December 2017.

SDG-Based Community Building in Shimokawa

Shimokawa, Hokkaido, where I have been helping with community building since last year, is one of the leading SDGs local governments in Japan; it has not only won an SDGs Award but has also been selected as a SDGs Future City and a project proposed by the town has been selected as a Local Government SDGs Model Project.

The town of Shimokawa is located in the central northern part of Hokkaido, and has a population of about 3,300 in an area of 644.2 square kilometers -- almost same as the total area of Tokyo's 23 wards. With about 90 percent of it forested, the town's main industries are forestry and agriculture. Situated in a heavy snowfall area, where the temperature drops to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius in winter, Shimokawa has produced many ski jumpers, including the legendary Noriaki Kasai.

The town was selected as an Eco-Model City and a Future City (two environmental city programs run by the Japanese government) in the past and has been acclaimed for its continuous efforts in proactive town development. In recent years, an increasing number of people have relocated there from urban areas, putting a brake on depopulation, which would have worsened otherwise. Its path from the beginning, however, has not been that smooth.

After being settled in 1901, Shimokawa's population increased as agriculture, forestry and mining were developed and railway service started in the area. In 1949, the municipality's status changed from ""village"" to ""town."" Though its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1960, soon afterward it started to decrease due to declines in its main industries (agriculture, forestry and mining). Railway service was discontinued, further accelerating the town's depopulation (to about 3,300 currently).

""We cannot just let it happen!"" ""We should do something!"" The town residents, sharing a sense of crisis, began working hard to carry out various projects, drawing on their creativity. Thanks to their efforts, Shimokawa has become an exciting, energetic, attractive town that I always look forward to visiting.

Yet the town people still face a sense of crisis, saying, ""We have to keep moving forward; otherwise we will spiral into decline."" Out of this sense of crisis, the town is trying to pursue town development more proactively. Specifically, as of 2018, the town has been pushing forward with improved town development for the two years since 2017 by integrating the SDGs in the formulation process of its Comprehensive Plan, the town's highest level plan.

In September 2017, the ""SDGs Future City Task Force"" was established within the Shimokawa Town Comprehensive Plan Council. This task force, consisting of ten resident committee members and town officials, has served as a base organization for the process of creating a vision of Shimokawa in 2030 and formalizing that vision. I helped design and facilitate the process.

The specific process was as follows: First we used ""backcasting,"" an approach for considering ""how you want to be at a particular time in the future,"" setting aside current realities and all restrictions, to create a vision of the town in 2030. Next, we used ""system thinking,"" an approach for creating real transformations by understanding the links and interactions among various factors that can produce positive cycles to help the town realize its vision. Then, the task force went to work to come up with concrete measures and projects that would actually produce positive cycles. The task force met 13 times in total during the period from September 2017 to April 2018.

The process was made as open as possible, and this more than anything else came to characterize Shimokawa's vision creation work. In this type of work, the conventional approach would have been to involve only town officials and a few of the town's resident in creating the vision. Instead, the task force members, who are town residents themselves, organized a meeting to write public comments together with other residents after explaining the vision they had created. They later organized another meeting to present the vision they had finalized after incorporating the public comments.

In the course of this half-year process, each task force member was assigned individual ""homework."" They had to identify people who had not been present but were important for the future of this town, interview them to learn about their visions for the town, and consider the matter further based on the results gathered from other members. In addition, a morning ""girls meeting"" was organized to collect opinions about town development and current issues from mothers who were busy taking care of children and could not attend evening meetings. Study sessions for the town council members on the SDGs and community building were also held a full three times.

In this way, through a careful process of consideration, Shimokawa has set seven goals for what it wants to become:

(1) A town where citizens continue striving together -- embodying the town's own values, such as the fortitude to keep facing crisis and hardship, as well as broad-mindedness and tolerance for embracing diverse people and values

(2) A town where nobody is left behind -- enabling all of its citizens to continue to expand their possibilities, have a place where they belong, and play a role so as to live a healthy and meaningful life

(3) A town where humans, resources, and money are cycled in a sustainable manner -- becoming independent and autonomous by achieving the following: an enduring cycle and perpetuation of humans, natural resources (e.g., forests and water) and money; further growth of agriculture, forestry and other industries; and local production of food, wood, energy, etc. for local consumption

(4) A town where citizens can care for each other like a family -- enabling its citizens to continue to live safely with peace of mind by placing importance on developing human-to-human relationships, and caring for and supporting each other

(5) A town where culture and resources handed down from generation to generation are esteemed while new value is created -- preserving things that are old but valuable while creating new value -- a practice for which a new popular term was coined recently in Japan: Onkokishin

(6) A town regarded as a role model by other municipalities around the world -- contributing to the achievement of a decarbonized society (under Paris Agreement) and globally sustainable development (under the SDGs) by enhancing and deepening the town's past efforts

(7) A town bringing smiles to children and nurturing happiness for future generations -- caring about all future generations and nurturing them throughout the entire region, so that children can grow cheerfully and freely

In the materials presented for the award, logos indicating goals corresponding to each of the 17 SDGs were attached to each section of the town's goals. What is significant about the SDGs initiative, however, is not classifying players' efforts into one or another of the 17 goals as if they were 17 small boxes and attaching corresponding logos to them. I think what is really important is, first of all, for the local people to visualize a desirable town with a sense of reality and subjectivity, then to check for any missing aspects using the SDGs framework, and finally to perceive the 17 goals not as individualized goals but as goals mutually connected.

Since Shimokawa is an inland town, the local people there are usually not conscious of the ocean. For that reason, initially there were few opinions about Goal 14 (life below water) of the SDGs. Later, though, they began thinking about the links between the forest, their lives and the ocean, and expressing various opinions about them. In this way, providing awareness of ""links"" that people usually do not consider may be one way utilizing the SDGs framework can be effective.

As mentioned above, the town provides opportunities for considering how the SDGs relate to oneself not only to the task force members but also to people in a variety of positions, helping create broader perspectives. For instance, several members of the town council asked questions regarding the SDGs at a recent general inquiry session. Also, a routine test at the town's junior high school included questions on the SDGs. This is wonderful, isn't it!

The town identifies the following four aspects as advantages of incorporating the SDGs into its comprehensive town development plan, and intends to use them as a tool for its future development.

Discovering or being aware of new challenges by reconsidering the region in light the 17 goals Developing a high-quality approach for community building by looking at the current situation from the perspective of a desirable future, and considering and adopting measures to achieve such a desirable future Establishing a system to develop the town through collaboration with a wide variety of people Communicating the town's attractiveness and potentials within and outside Japan, using the SDGs framework, to boost public perception of the town and attract settlers, visitors, businesses, investment and other involvement in the town

In helping the town develop I came to realize the effectiveness of using the SDGs framework to help even small local towns consider their own community development from a global viewpoint and understand interrelatedness. In view of this, for future community building, backcasting, systems thinking, and the SDGs are certain to be the ""three sacred treasures""!

In some ways Ant-Man and the Wasp is the kind of movie I wanted Ant-Man to be: namely, a refreshing antidote to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It’s not just the light, breezy tone and the witty gags. Humor is nothing new to the MCU; on the contrary, obligatory Guardians-style whimsy has become a jarring and even cynical tonal anomaly in apocalypses like Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.

But there’s a lightness to Ant-Man and the Wasp that goes beyond the gags. No one even mentions Infinity Stones, and the fate of the universe, the planet, or even Asgard or Wakanda is not at stake.

There are no obligatory cameos by other heroes, like Falcon in the first Ant-Man (or Iron Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming, another relatively small-scale MCU excursion). After their mutual absence in Infinity War, I half expected Hawkeye to show up in Ant-Man’s new adventure, but he doesn’t, thank goodness.

There’s some talk about the epic airport battle in Germany from Captain America: Civil War, and Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, the neophyte Ant-Man, can’t help name-dropping “Cap.” In general, though, Ant-Man and the Wasp is less shackled to the rest of the MCU than any post-Avengers Marvel sequel — at least until the downbeat midcredits stinger.

There’s an antagonist called Ghost who is not out to exterminate or enslave, and in fact doesn’t particularly want to harm anyone (but is willing to). Laurence Fishburne shows up as an old partner-turned-rival of Michael Douglas’ Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, and turns out to be a more interesting character than you’d expect. A gang of petty thugs led by Walton Goggins supply modest levels of menace. It’s all extremely not extreme.

Even the target audience skews smaller — younger, I mean — than usual. The first Ant-Man had a couple of violent sci-fi deaths, some typical language and Michael Peña’s comic-relief motormouth Luis chattering about an early sexual experience. Ant-Man and the Wasp goes lighter in all these categories. It might be Marvel’s most kid-friendly movie. Imagine that.

I’m not ashamed to say that I most enjoyed Ant-Man when it felt like a sequel in spirit to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Ant-Man and the Wasp doubles down on that vibe and then some, not least because Scott’s defining relationship is not with Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne, now the Wasp, but with Scott’s adorable young daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who dotes on him as much as he on her.

That’s not to say the Wasp is a mere sidekick. On the contrary, you could say Ant-Man is her sidekick. Her character may be underwritten, but it’s her quest, not Scott’s, that propels the story, and he supports her rather than vice versa — not always willingly.

That the Wasp is a marquee co-star at all is a corrective of sorts, if a modest one. Marvel has knocked out 20 movies over the last 10 years, and until now every one has borne the name of a male solo hero or a male-dominated team.

The DC franchise has stumbled a lot trying to follow in Marvel’s footsteps, but they did beat Marvel to the punch in this respect with Wonder Woman. (Marvel’s first heroine-led film will be next year’s Captain Marvel, starring Brie Larson. After years of cold feet, it seems Marvel execs are even allowing a Black Widow solo movie.)

The first Ant-Man movie technically had two Ant-Men, with Michael Douglas’ Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, passing the baton to Scott. Yet it somehow managed to be between Wasps, with the original, Hank’s wife Janet, lost in the quantum realm, and their daughter Hope pointlessly sidelined and forced to watch Scott suit up without her.

Now, Hope is allowed to spread her wings, which she has, along with wrist blasters, which is the kind of tech that Wasps get but Ant-Men don’t. Like many comic-book conceits, the only way to deal with this is to incredulously cross-examine it and then move on, since the real reason (wasps fly and sting and ants generally don’t) would hardly work as a diegetic or in-universe explanation.

Meanwhile, the movie exploits the tactical and comic possibilities of its Alice in Wonderland size-changing to greater effect than previous movies. After Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and the Wasp is the only other recent Marvel movie with action set pieces that are visually unique and organically funny. (Some of the funnier gags involve technical glitches resulting in unpredictable size changes.)

For a movie about a divorced ex-con who is dodging parole-violation charges and whose ex-wife is remarried to a police officer, Ant-Man and the Wasp is remarkably genial. The former Mrs. Lang (Judy Greer) is nothing if not supportive of Scott, and her new husband (Bobby Cannavale) is almost unsettlingly amiable. With Cassie at the center, they’re almost one big happy family.

Scott’s parole officer (Randall Park) isn’t happy about the whole thing, but he’s not a jerk either. Even a sequence with Goggins and his thugs interrogating Luis is almost completely disarmed by Luis’ garrulous enthusiasm.

Marvel movies have often struggled to supply villains that matter. Ant-Man and the Wasp finds an unexpected solution: Perhaps villains that matter don’t matter as much as these movies think. I would say I’d like to see more superhero movies try something like this, but honestly, how likely is that?

Even non-economists can gather from this statement that creating an efficient market-based mechanism to determine a price on carbon is no easy task. While many emissions trading schemes (ETS) that have been implemented around the world over the last decade are proof that market-based pricing mechanisms can work, they have also revealed that concerns about their effectiveness in providing a long-term incentive to invest in climate mitigation were well founded.

One such concern is that an ETS may result in a price that is too low or too volatile to act as a meaningful incentive. The EU ETS has often been cited as an example of this problem with critics noting that the average price that resulted in past years is not meaningful to nudge large emitters into accelerated mitigation action. This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

Is a Minimum Price on Carbon Desirable?

To address concerns around the effectiveness of the EU ETS, some EU Member States are considering introducing additional measures, such as an EU-wide or national carbon pricing floors (CPFs) that would guarantee a minimum price on carbon emissions for all market participants.

Germany and France for example agreed, in a Joint Declaration on further cooperation in Europe, to develop an ‘EU Strategy 2050’ for the long-term transformation towards carbon neutrality. The countries propose a high-level ministerial working group on climate change to build a common view on the energy transition as well as tools for triggering sustainable finance and economic incentives, including carbon pricing issues. [German Government Press Release: Meseberg Declaration – Renewing Europe’s promises of security and prosperity]

CPFs that apply to an entire ETS have been implemented using various mechanisms, including:

an auction reserve price that creates a minimum price below which a government withholds a number of allowances from sale;

a top-up payment or carbon price that is designed either as a tax that makes up the difference between the CPF level and the ETS allowance price or as a fixed price which is added to it;

or a system of permit buybacks, where the market operator commits to buying back permits at the floor price.

A key question for regional markets, such as the EU ETS, is whether national and regional prices can coexist. Under a national carbon floor pricing mechanism, a country would be allowed to set a minimum price for emissions that may or may not be higher than the supra-national ETS market price. Several institutions have recently published opposing views on this question.

Yes, if the Conditions are Right.

A study by the Cambridge Energy Research Group entitled “When is carbon pricing desirable?” supports the introduction of an EU-wide power sector CPF. The paper recommends that such a CPF be designed as a carbon levy to “top up” the European Emission Allowances (EUA) price to €25–30/tCO2, rising at 3–5% annually above the rate of inflation, at least until 2030.

The authors argue that this approach would not only address the risk of a “too low” carbon price, but also provide longer-term prices and bring forward low-carbon investment by guaranteeing a minimum return to emissions reductions. They further suggest the delivery of climate benefits through a CPF would be enhanced by the new market stability reserve (MSR) of the EU ETS. The MSR, which will begin to operate in January 2019, will withhold from the market 24% of the calculated EUA oversupply each year from 2019-2023, and 12% of the surplus each year thereafter. From 2023, if the MSR volume exceeds the EUA volume auctioned in the previous year, this excess will be ‘invalidated’ or removed from the MSR. This cancellation mechanism is expected to remove a substantial number of EUAs.

The research group also recognizes that national CPFs are easier to implement than an EU-wide CPF, but notes they pose the risk of intra-EU trade distortions. In addition, a national CPF may need to be accompanied by an emissions performance standard to enhance durability. [Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group Paper “When is carbon pricing desirable?”]

No, because it Increases Costs and Risks of Carbon Leakage

Taking a contrasting view, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) called on EU Member States to refrain from introducing national CPFs or taxes. Focusing on several industry sectors in addition to the power sector, IETA cautions such measures would lead to competitive distortions, negatively impact industrial low carbon investment strategies and reduce the EU ETS’s efficiency. The authors emphasize the risk of carbon leakage from the country imposing the national mechanism and the risk of creating a barrier to linking with ETS in other jurisdictions. They suggest instead of introducing additional taxes, Member States should assess the potential to extend coverage of the EU ETS to additional sectors and gases.

If Member States do decide to introduce additional carbon price measures, IETA recommends such measures be temporary, arguing that the system absorbs accumulated surplus through the MSR. They advise member states: ensure a high degree of coordination to minimize market distortions and fragmentation; transparently quantify their impact in terms of emission reductions within the scope of the EU ETS; and voluntarily cancel an adequate amount of allowances from their auction volumes in order to mitigate the impact of the measure on the functioning of the EU ETS. [IETA Position Paper]

Healthy Discourse Contributes to Improvements of Carbon Markets

These diverging positions on CPFs show that fixing the shortcomings of current carbon market mechanisms won’t be easy. On the other hand, the debate is also proof that both sides share an interest in improving the effectiveness of the EU ETS. In medicine, treatments are reviewed for improvements, and where such are not observed other treatments, including in combination, are tried aiming at increasing effectiveness and success. In a similar way, policy debates around measures to address climate change often reveal diverging views and heterogeneous preferences of experts and governments. While coming to an agreement may take some time, the commitment to a healthy, evidence-based debate is an encouraging sign that carbon mechanisms are maturing into an effective tool that will ultimately overcome the barriers predicted by economists.","This policy brief reviews a recent debate on a tool to establish minimum prices on carbon emissions that emerged around proposals to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS.

149,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation’,"Reviewing the original Hotel Transylvania back in 2012, I remarked that, by the time Adam Sandler’s Dracula started rapping at the denouement, “I was dying for a Van Helsing to come in and clean house.”

That didn’t happen, of course, so in due course we got Hotel Transylvania 2, in which Dracula’s pixieish undead daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) married her bohemian human boyfriend Johnny (Andy Samberg) and gave birth to a half-undead son named Dennis (the improbably named Asher Blinkoff).

But now, at last, there’s a Van Helsing in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. Two, in fact.

Jim Gaffigan voices the obsessive monster-hunter Abraham Van Helsing, who, in a prologue starting on a train in 1897 and proceeding to a montage of crashing and burning, pursues his chosen vocation of would-be vampire slayer with all the tenacity — and all the success, if not the slapstick logic — of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner.

Then there’s Abraham’s great-granddaughter, Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn), who has more or less inherited the family trade and is out to succeed where her great-grandfather failed.

At this point, though, it’s clear that the Van Helsings are fighting a lost cause.

The original Hotel Transylvania took place in the shadow of centuries of alienation between monsters and humans, at least insofar as the latter were even aware of the existence of the former. Historically, it seems humans had persecuted monsters rather than the reverse; Drac, who never drinks human blood, lost his wife in an attack by an angry human mob and was bitterly anti-human as a result.

But Mavis’ open-minded curiosity about humans was clearly a harbinger of a more tolerant future — and in time, Drac realized that human society was evolving beyond its past prejudices.

In the first sequel, the monster community came out of the shadows and found the human world generally ready to welcome them. There were holdouts, of course, like Drac’s traditionally human-hating father, Vlad, voiced by Mel Brooks. In general, though, both sides were ready to let go of the hate.

Van Helsing is an old-school hater on the human side who will, of course, learn by the end to let go of the hate, too. This is such a foregone conclusion that as early as that 1897 prologue Drac is already mocking Van Helsing for his hopeless crusade and urging him to “let go of the hate,” which seems more progressive and less bitter than the Drac we met in the original movie. (Drac’s monster resort was founded a year later, in 1898. No, I have not seen any of these films more than once and don’t know the franchise that well. I’m looking at transcripts on the internet.)

Like Mavis in the first film, Ericka has been brought up to hate the other side, and, while she has been effectively brainwashed in a way Mavis never was, Ericka may not quite be the true believer grandfather is.

Somehow the Van Helsings lay a trap for Drac, whom Mavis believes is overworked and needs a vacation. The truth is that Drac is lonely after centuries of widowerhood and doesn’t believe he can connect with someone new, since the “Zing” — magical monster love at first sight — comes only once in a lifetime, or so we’ve been told since the first film.

Then Mavis books a monster cruise for them and all their family and friends, including Kevin James’ Frankenstein, David Spade’s Invisible Man and Keegan-Michael Key’s Mummy. The moment Drac lays eyes on the cruise ship’s female captain, he knows it’s possible to “zing” again. (“Zing” started out as a noun but was quickly verbified, as “Mavis and Johnny zinged.”)

The catch is that the captain is Ericka Van Helsing, and the ship belongs to her and her great-grandfather (or what’s left of him, after all that opening crashing and burning). See, this is the trap, though why the Van Helsings happen to own an ocean liner and then their archenemy goes on a cruise … sorry, I overthought that one.

Overthinking the plot, I’ll apologize for. Themes are another matter.

I found the first film’s “humans are the real monsters” theme tiresome, although in fairness the movie was really about overcoming mutual prejudice, and the premise was that neither humans nor monsters were truly the monsters the other side thought.

The monsters could be understood allegorically as a misunderstood invisible minority, although in that case the movie would seem to be saying that the minority needed to let go of their suspicions and recognize that the majority was ready to accept them, which I’m not sure is a message the filmmakers would have intended.

The target audience, of course, won’t be paying much attention to these themes of prejudice and tolerance. They’ll be laughing at gags like Drac trying to talk to a smartphone that mishears everything he says or little Dennis and his young werewolf gal pal Winnie (Sadie Sandler) trying to disguise Dennis’ elephant-sized puppy Tinkles with a trenchcoat and a tiny hat.

Adults may chuckle at a few gags, including a chupacabra joke and the weariness of Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon’s werewolf couple who are overwhelmed with their large litter.

Still, just because it’s a dumb kiddie film doesn’t mean the ideas don’t matter. Hotel Transylvania told us that the “Zing” comes once in a lifetime, and when it hits it’s for life (whatever “life” means for vampires and mummies and walking skeletons). This is the kind of “Someday my prince will come” romanticism for which Disney has been doing penance in updated fairy tales like Frozen and Moana.

I’m not thrilled about the lack of worthy romantic leading men in recent Hollywood animation, but I prefer the theme in Frozen, about needing to get to know someone before deciding to get married, to this series’ magical, inexorable “Zing” moment.

In Hotel Transylvania, Mavis worried that maybe the “Zing” between her and Jonathan was only on her side, not his. (Internet transcript, I promise.)

This threequel makes it clear that “zinging” is destiny, and even if it strikes one person before the other, it’s still meant to be. So if Drac “zinged” when he saw Ericka, but Ericka didn’t “zing” back, Drac must still pursue her, even if she told him in so many words that she could never be with a monster. In the real world this translates to harassment and stalking. (Are male vampires who love human women ever not stalkerish?)

All three Hotel Transylvania movies were directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, most celebrated for small-screen fare like Samurai Jack and Dexter’s Laboratory. His often frenetic style and one-dimensional characters work well in short bursts on the small screen, but pall at feature length. Drac remains a dull protagonist, too lacking in self-awareness or substance for his father-daughter relationship with Mavis to have the appeal it should.

The animation is energetic and character design remains a strength. A race of fish-men, including a cruise host named Stan (Chris Parnell), are so visually striking they look like they belong in another movie, such as Rango. (Disappointingly, Stan gives the final destination, Atlantis, such a buildup that it’s a disappointment to arrive at what is more like Atlantic City, complete with a crooner Kraken who looks like a cheap knockoff of Jermaine Clement’s magnificent giant crab Tamatoa in Moana.)

The best sequence is Drac and Ericka’s dance of death in an ancient Indiana Jones-style deathtrap temple, with Ericka flinging herself at one booby trap after another and Drac either whisking her out of harm’s way with split-second timing or using himself as an inhuman shield. If the whole film were this memorable, you would be reading the last sentence of a very different review.

150,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/why-nigeria-requires-5bn-water-sector-investments-to-meet-sdg-targets/,"Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Vanguard,Why Nigeria requires $5bn water sector investments to meet SDG targets,"Kindly Share This Story:

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

The Volta Region as unofficially partitioned by its indigenes into Northern, Central and Southern parts have over the years engaged predominantly in small-scale farming.



The land up north and central parts are considered much fertile, but in a rather sharp contrast, the porous sandy soil found in the southern parts are usually nourished with animal composts coupled with irrigation in order to attain fertility to grow crops.



Food crops produced up north and central of the region notably are tubers of yam, maize, pepper, cassava, tomato, cocoa etc.



The southern part produces shallots, tomato, carrots etc. Fishing is one of the main occupation of the people but has in recent times dwindled due to depleted fish stock in the sea.



After a successive annual celebration of national farmers day for the 33rd time, Volta happened to gain it for four (4) times.



In 1986, 1991, 2004 and 2013, farmers from the Central parts of the region (Akatsi, Juapong, Ho and Sogakope) respectively succeeded as the Best National farmers.



The Southern and Northern part are yet to attain this great achievement of national awards in spite of their tremendous effort in feeding the nation Ghana in their very own way. Most farmers have at least been acknowledged at the various Regional and District levels over the years.



Challenges affecting the people of the Southern part remains the battle for dry lands as urbanization increases and the tidal waves and erosion from the sea makes situations even worse.



They have been able to invest their energy in irrigating mechanically and manually, their crops almost every day.



For the 33rd time of awarding hard work and acknowledging efforts of farmers at the national level, farmers in the Volta Region have had their fair share as the statistics on the ministry of Agriculture website indicates. The region is at par with Western and Greater Accra regions with 4 winners of the prestigious annual awards. Northern and Upper-West regions are the least national awardees as 2 time winners each, while the Ashanti leads for the 5th time last year, 2017.



Engaging some farmers in the region, they decried among other things, land acquisition for large-scale farming as their major issues as custodians of land mounts pressure on them after some lease period of time. Some chiefs are unwilling to release their lands on favorable terms of conditions for commercial farming.



The second topmost agenda of the United Nations with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to; ""End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture — source;. – United Nations’ website.



To achieve these goals by 2030, farmers in the Volta Region must avail themselves to improve yields and manage post-harvest losses. This can be done in collaboration with government on its flagship programs of “Planting for Food and Jobs and 1District; 1Factory (1D1F), which needs total commitment and proper arrangements in allocating resources.



Volta Region been one of Ghana’s food hub has 20,570km2 (7,940sq ml) as its area coverage with a population of about 2,118,252 according to the 2010 population census with majority of the demographics been youth.



Over the years, the people of Agotime Ziope have petitioned government to come to their aid to salvage their postharvest losses of tomatoes. Their produce (tomato) have to be sold cheaply to recoup part of their yearly farming investments. They have asked successive governments to establish a tomato factory in the locality but this has not materialized.



“Our desire and attempt to produce tomato in large quantity will only be in futility when there is no factory to process it. Tomato is perishable and there must be a processing plant to turn it into paste. This we the youth currently unemployed and are not in school are willing to do for a living but until government come to build a factory, we would prefer riding motorbikes to make a living” a farmer said in an interview.



The people of Mafi Kumase in the Central Tongu District have complained bitterly about their produce been priced cheaply since there is no measuring scale for their gari. The only gari factory available on visit by Fred Duhoe was visibly covered in weeds and has become a place of convenience for locals around.



“From the planting stage, through harvesting and processing of cassava is quite tedious yet people come to take advantage of our gari and price it the way they like. We are certainly not making any profit out of cassava and gari but we have no option since that’s what puts food on our table” a local reveals in an interview with Fred Duhoe.



The people of Dambai and its environs due to bad roads have lost much of their yam produce before it reaches the cities.



The people of Dzodze produce palm fruits in large quantity while the people of Keta and its environs feed the nation with some amount of fish and salt alongside the vegetables. The people of Biakoye, Hohoe and Jasikan in their efforts feed the nation with maize, rice, mango etc.



The people of Kadjebi produce yam and groundnut in large quantity when a favorable average weather temperature of about 250C remains fairly stable throughout the season.



With the current technological trends in Agriculture, there is always a bumper harvest when there is fairly good weather conditions but most unfortunately, the food produced doesn’t last longer due to over-reliance of farmers on pesticides, weedicides and fertilizers.



In almost the past decade, Agriculture Science was a subject studied in the basic schools of Ghana while some schools have farms for practical.



Interacting with some idling youth of school going age in Ho, they revealed, “Farming is not attractive since they have no knowledge about the subject from school”.



The bottom line is, if this peasant farmers are given the requisite education on new trends of farming with its accompanied technological preservation methods, Ghana hope to be secured in terms of food security and prices of goods will remain relatively low.



The Adidome Farm Institute at Adidome in the Central Tongu District and the Ohawu Agric College at Abor in the Akatsi North District are among the specifically designated colleges for agriculture studies in the Volta Region which could help upgrade the knowledge of local farmers.","After a successive annual celebration of national farmers day for the 33rd time, Volta happened to gain it for four (4) times.

If applied in national surveys, the questions will produce data that are comparable across different countries, and will enable a harmonized approach to reporting against SDG targets for WASH.

Several SDG targets contain WASH commitments or rely on the availability of WASH facilities, including targets under SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation).

Reducing global maternal mortality and ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five depend on the availability of WASH facilities.

The recommended questions are linked to the relevant SDG indicators, and are contained in two separate reports, one focusing on WASH in schools and the other on WASH in health care facilities. The publications also provide definitions associated with the questions, for example, defining what is meant by “basic” WASH facilities. Answers can be classified in relation to “service ladders” that can be used to monitor progress. The aim is for national data collection to become increasingly harmonized over time as countries and organizations adopt the the core questions and indicators as survey instruments. The availability of data that is comparable among countries and, over a long time period, will also facilitate global reporting on the world’s progress toward achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Targets under SDG 3, such as reducing global maternal mortality (SDG target 3.1) and ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five (SDG target 3.2), depend greatly on the availability of WASH facilities. SDG 6 expresses commitment to water and sanitation for all (SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2), while indicators relating to SDG target 4.a on education facilities has associated indicators for the provision of WASH facilities in schools.

The core questions and indicators were developed by the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which is affiliated to UN-Water. The JMP was established in 1990 to provide regular global reports on drinking water and sanitation coverage, and to support countries in their own monitoring.

154,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-increasing-the-coherence-and-scale-of-public-and-private-contributions/,"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Increasing the Coherence and Scale of Public and Private Contributions,"In the wake of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), a number of reports and articles have continued to surface on how governments can finance and implement the SDGs in collaboration with the private sector. These include engaging businesses to align their operations and investments with the SDGs as well as using tools to ensure good governance and policy coherence, both in-country and through development cooperation.

A high-level meeting on the theme, ‘Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ is scheduled for 24 September 2018, where UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to unveil a new private investment strategy. As outlined by Global Policy Watch, the meeting format will include three “Davos-style” panels with CEOs from the private sector, heads of state and technological innovators. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted, during a 27 July briefing on the meeting, that the world is seeing a “waning commitment” to international trade, climate, economic and financial cooperation, and that we need to not only step up engagement with the private sector, but also take advantage of financial and technological innovations to bridge gaps.

On private sector action, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and UN Global Compact (UNGC) have released a publication titled, ‘A Practical Guide,’ which addresses integrating the SDGs into corporate reporting. The publication follows two previous guidance documents for enhancing businesses’ engagement with the SDGs, and outlines a three-step process to define priority SDG targets, measure and analyze objectives, and “report, integrate and implement change,” while also considering data users’ needs. The publication, developed in collaboration with Shift and PwC, warns against selecting SDGs that are easiest to report on, and instead encourages companies to focus on what is most important—or material—to their business. A more detailed write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub is forthcoming.

Also on business-SDG engagement, an edie article summarizes a webinar featuring experts from BT, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) and DNV GL. Held 26 July 2018, the discussion builds on recent reports that find that, although many businesses have made pledges on SDG uptake and implementation, few feature measurable targets related to—or that measure progress against—the Goals. Panelists recognized the need for transparency on businesses’ negative impacts and the importance of identifying them in order to tackle them first. They further noted that the SDGs present an opportunity to move beyond reactive or isolated sustainability actions, and that engaging external actors that are likely to apply pressure has become “business as usual” for them.

A blog on the UN Development Programme (UNDP) website describes how companies are beginning to move beyond a business-as-usual approach. The post describes a “fourth sector” of for-profit entities “whose main purpose is to solve social and environmental problems, but generate their income mainly through commercial activities.” The author, Heerad Sabeti, is CEO of the Fourth Sector Group, which was launched in collaboration with the World Economic Forum’s System Initiative on Shaping the Future of Economic Progress and UNDP, among other partners. Sabeti also highlights progress in South America, offering Natura as an example of a business that is contributing to “virtually every SDG in Brazil.”

On governance, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) released a report titled, ‘Governance for Integrated Solutions to Sustainable Development and Climate Change: From linking issues to aligning interests.’ The report’s chapters focus primarily on the Asia-Pacific region, looking at the co-benefits of an integrated approach derived from the alignment of disparate agencies and other stakeholders. The study develops a conceptual model to illustrate which actors should be involved, and looks at horizontal, vertical and multi-stakeholder coordination in the transportation and solid waste management sectors, as well as across the water-energy-food nexus. The authors conclude that in some cases, more engagement is not needed, as the necessary relationships may already exist. However, they note the increasingly important trend of “governance beyond governments,” signaling a need for flexibility in engagement strategies. IGES also recently launched a web tool that enables users to visualize SDG targets’ interactions with others, to help assess synergies and trade-offs and inform decision-making in both the public and private sectors.

Patrick Curran, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, underscores the importance of policy coherence, called for in SDG target 17.14. Curran notes that countries’ development pathways—particularly in sub-Saharan Africa—are highly dependent on the water-energy-food nexus, noting that policies in these sectors are not currently “joined-up.” He emphasizes that reliance on donor support can sometimes undermine coherent policy, as aid has the potential to look at sectors or issues in isolation. To mitigate a siloed approach, Curran calls for the review and update of national development plans, conducted with the support of inter-ministerial and multi-stakeholder committees.

Breaking out of a siloed approach means building multi-actor partnerships (MAPs), as outlined in a German Development Institute (DIE) discussion paper titled, ‘Incentivizing and Regulating Multi-actor Partnerships and Private Sector Engagement in Development Cooperation.’ Authored by Dorothea Wehrmann, the paper describes challenges to engaging private sector actors in development cooperation towards long-term agendas such as the SDGs. Wehrmann looks at the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) to examine how such networks and partnerships can enhance MAPs’ engagement and effectiveness. She finds that these arrangements must: 1) strengthen institutional oversight; 2) support case-specific incentivizing and regulating strategies; and 3) lend further credence to context-specificity, for example, in South-South cooperation. All types of engagement will be critical in the context of reduced UN funding, as highlighted by Devex.

A Brookings report on options for filling the financing void for the SDGs focuses on increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries by increasing engagement with development finance institutions and MDBs.

On development finance more broadly, the Brookings Institution’s George Ingram and Robert A. Mosbacher, Jr. examine ways to raise the US$2.4 trillion needed annually in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030. They outline four options for filling the void, focusing primarily on the fourth: 1) eliminating trade barriers; 2) increasing official development assistance (ODA); 3) mobilizing domestic resources by creating an enabling environment for private investment; and 4) increasing foreign and domestic investment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by increasing engagement with development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs). They compare DFIs in the US, Europe and Asia to offer recommendations that can mobilize additional private capital.

A significant portion of the finance needed is for infrastructure, as discussed in a DIE paper looking primarily at the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS Bank. The paper titled, ‘Mobilizing Capital for Sustainable Infrastructure: The cases of AIIB and NDB,’ reviews instruments to mobilize private capital, building in experiences of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and others to identify lessons for “low-cost” finance providers. Given the capital-intensive nature of infrastructure, the authors note the importance of these DFIs in the sector, especially in the context of long-term sustainable development, as the social and environmental impacts of infrastructure investments are “locked in” for the duration of the projects’ lifetimes. The paper notes a need to increase the attractiveness of more sustainable projects, including by boosting returns through blended finance, de-risking through co-finance or other guarantees, and through specialized instruments used by the EIB and International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Regardless of whether they focus on public or private sectors, the above papers cut across the 5 P’s of sustainable development: people, planet, prosperity, partnerships and peace. A blog post by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that, by articulating objectives in this manner, the SDGs “represent the basic requirements of human decency.” Recognizing the linkages between these principles and their work, the IMF piece identifies how their projects and initiatives map to each pillar.

Commentators note that the SDG Index, a global ranking, shows Australia is performing well on health, education and well-being, but is doing poorly on environmental goals, and ranks lowest in the world on climate action. Australia is currently holding a Senate inquiry into actions for promoting SDG implementation domestically and through its aid programme.

At the domestic launch of Australia’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) in Sydney on 15 June, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, highlighted SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) as being of particular importance to Australia. She drew attention to Australia’s contribution to establishing SDG 5 as a stand-alone goal in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, its role as custodian of the Great Barrier Reef, and its status as an island continent and part of the Pacific Ocean. She launched the Australian SDGs Website developed by the Global Compact Network Australia (GCNA), which showcases sustainable development initiatives by government and allows for stakeholders to upload case studies of their SDG-related work. [Launch speech by Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs] [Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Press Release]

The Australian Government maintains a reporting platform on the SDGs, which provides official government data on the SDG indicators. The data platform, the Australian SDGs website and the VNR report together make up the reporting package on Australia’s action on the SDGs.

The Australian SDGs Hub for Business suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

Besides the Australian SDGs website, the GCNA has also established an online Australian SDGs Hub for Business. This website explains the relevance of each of the 17 SDGs to business, and suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

In the lead-up to the presentation of Australia’s VNR to the HLPF, Monash University academics John Thwaites and Tahl Kestin published an article on the online portal The Conversation. Their 11 July article highlights data from the global SDG Index showing that Australia has done well on measures of health and well-being (SDG 3), and is providing good quality education (SDG 4); however, performance on the environmental goals, such as SDG 14 (life on land) is low in comparison to other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and ranks lowest in the world on climate action (SDG 13). They call for more deliberate action by Australia, such as developing a national implementation plan and allocating specific funds for SDG implementation.

The SDG Index lists Australia in 37th place overall, a fall from its 26th place the previous year. Thwaites and Kestin explain that Australia’s performance on climate is measured not only by its domestic emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but also by the emissions accounted for in the goods it consumes, its vulnerability to climate change, and its exports of fossil fuels. The SDG Index takes into account the “spillover” effect – the extent to which countries are promoting or impeding the ability of other countries to meet the SDGs. Based on its fossil fuel exports, Australia’s carbon emissions are estimated at 44 tonnes per person each year, more than those of Saudi Arabia (35.5 tonnes per person) or the US (710 kg per person). [Article on The Conversation]

The SDG Index is published by Bertelsmann Stiftung, a private German foundation, and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a network commissioned by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2012 to mobilize expertise from academia, civil society and the private sector.

157,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/political-challenges-in-monitoring-sdg-6/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Political Challenges in Monitoring SDG 6,"Last month, at the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York, US, a central part of the discussions on achieving and monitoring SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) was the importance of looking at water quality in a broader context. One example is looking at the quality of freshwater in the context of other sectors, in relationship to food security, or the impact on other resources such as soil. This topic will once again be high on the agenda at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden, later this month.

Seeing freshwater quality in a broader context is no doubt important, but what we often forget is that implementing this broader view comes along with significant measurement challenges. At the forefront of these challenges is the difficulty of identifying relevant data and information needs in view of multiple goals, meeting these data and information needs, and interpreting data and information. These challenges involve various interests and require negotiations. In other words, addressing them is a political matter. To meet such challenges, water quality measurement must move beyond being a technical issue addressed by natural scientists alone, and become a topic for inter- and transdisciplinary research teams.

Changing the Scope Means Redefining Measurements, Process, and Use

Let us first have a look at what has to be measured. If we consider multiple goals when measuring water quality, this complicates the process of identifying data and information needs. Before measurement programmes can be set up, the management goal needs to be clear, for example using water in agriculture for energy and/or food production. This is often not the case due to a lack of regulations specifying integrated measurement goals (such as for soil and water management). Developing such regulations requires negotiation processes laden with transaction costs for all relevant actors. Further, even if the goals are clarified, it often remains unclear what types of indicators, data and standards are best suited to efficiently monitor progress in achieving a goal (for instance standards for health-related water quality or lower standards). This leads to the question of whether existing indicators can be used or combined indicators are needed.

Let us assume now we know what has to be measured. The next question would be how we can obtain the relevant data and information. We see here a couple of challenges for meeting these needs. First, one needs many different types of data and information, such as data on the quality of waters, soils, agricultural yields, and human health. Second, such data needs are particularly challenging to meet from the technical point of view, given the high complexity of the social-ecological system. Take, for instance, the impact of fertilizers on the amount of nitrogen in groundwater. This impact depends on various factors such as weather conditions, the cultivated plants or soil characteristics. Such complexity can lead to unforeseen or delayed effects, which complicate measurement programmes even further. Third, even if data are available, information transfer has particularly high requirements, since data are typically dispersed across research groups (e.g. soil and water scientists) and public authorities (e.g. water and agricultural authorities). Sharing data between these entities can be challenging as there is often a lack of communication or trust, or asymmetric power and interests are involved. All this ultimately hinders the establishment of sufficient and inclusive databases.

Let us assume for a moment we can overcome these challenges and have our data at hand. A third challenge then regards their use for a truly integrated assessment of solutions. We assume here that it will be particularly challenging to interpret data and information given multiple baselines of partly conflicting goals. Take, for instance, measuring the amount of nitrogen in soils and water. High amounts of nitrogen can be interpreted in various ways. From a water quality perspective, high amounts are problematic since they lead to the eutrophication of waters; from an agricultural perspective, however, it may also indicate a high production level, leading to economic growth and food security. Understanding such relations requires thinking in new, broader systems that may go beyond traditional check lists of good practices.

Addressing New Challenges in Measurement

While seeing freshwater quality in a broader context seems to be good idea for achieving truly sustainable development, we have to be prepared for increased challenges in the measurement process. These challenges are not only technical, but also political, meaning that they involve political discourses among various stakeholders, reflecting various interests and power asymmetries. New tools based on rigorous research need to be developed to help practitioners overcome such political challenges.

At the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), we believe that measurement-related activities should be conducted in a participatory manner from the very start. First, an interdisciplinary research agenda on water quality measurement is the way forward. Measuring water quality has mainly been understood as a natural science endeavor. However, addressing the politics in defining targets, gathering data, and interpreting data calls for the involvement of social scientists. Take, for instance, the question of data sharing. Extensive and successful research conducted by political scientists on the conditions of information sharing in conflict-laden environments can help design water measurement programmes in the face of complex societal goals.

The second step is to deepen existing stakeholder engagement by opening the natural science-dominated field of measurement to the broad range of stakeholders in resource management. Practitioners can be involved here in setting the frame for measurement. (Natural) scientists have to refer to these societal needs when setting up measurement programmes within their research programmes. This can be done, for instance, by discussing measurement challenges together with stakeholders of different ministries in joint workshops.

In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

Humana’s ‘Healthy People’ pillar details its efforts to improve the health of its employees, its members and the communities it serves. The company has instituted the ‘Bold Goal,’ which aims to help communities become 20% healthier by 2020. In 2017, four communities in Texas and New Orleans demonstrated improved health due, in part, to strong relationships among physicians, patients and community groups.

The ‘Healthy Planet’ pillar addresses environmental sustainability, with the report explaining that, since 2014, Humana has reduced emissions by more than 6% and diverted 40% of waste that would have gone to landfills by using less and recycling more. As of 30 June 2018, Humana had achieved a 5% reduction in emissions as a result of investments in building efficiency improvements, optimization of building occupancy rates and new energy-efficient processes. The company aims to decrease emissions by 2.1% each year over a five-year period through 2022, and divert 60% of its waste from landfills by 2022.

‘Healthy Performance’ focuses on implementing best practices in the healthcare industry by promoting inclusion and diversity in Humana’s workforce, supporting employees’ professional development through training programmes, and holding suppliers to high standards. Eight employee-led network resource groups, including one for employees with disabilities, provide platforms for exchanging ideas, building community and driving measurable business outcomes. More than 25% of Humana’s employees participate in the groups.

162,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/global-status-report-shows-lack-of-data-on-industrial-wastewater/,"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Global Status Report Shows Lack of Data on Industrial Wastewater,"26 August 2018: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Habitat have launched a global status report on wastewater treatment, on behalf of UN-Water. The report is based on data from 79 countries, and finds that only 59% of domestic wastewater flow is collected and safely treated, and insufficient information is available for estimates of industrial wastewater treatment.



SDG target 6.3 sets out several objectives for improving water quality, including halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. An indicator for this target (6.3.1) measures “Proportion of wastewater safely treated,” through two sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater (SDG indicators 6.3.1a and 6.3.1b, respectively).

The report explains the methodology used to develop the global baseline on wastewater, and provides definitions of the terms used in the sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater. The authors caution that their findings probably represent the “upper limit” of current achievements, as the data come mostly from high-income and middle-income countries, and likely do not reflect the situation in many Asian and African countries.

The report draws attention to the contributions of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda.

The agencies highlight that many millions of people are at risk from contaminated water, and urge policy makers to regulate and enforce pollution control measures. They emphasize the need to better harmonize reporting on this issue through the application of common metrics.

The report also draws attention to the contribution of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, for example, in relation to drinking water, sanitation, and water-use efficiency (SDG targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, respectively), reduction of waterborne diseases (SDG target 3.3), water availability to boost food production (SDG target 2.4), nutrition (SDG target 2.2), and sustainable urbanization (SDG target 11.2).

The report recommends using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) codes to identify heavy polluters, pollution sources, and types of pollution as a basis for applying the “polluter pays” principle, especially with regard to industrial pollution. It also proposes an additional SDG indicator to capture the extent of wastewater reuse.

The wastewater baseline report was one of seven such studies launched by UN-Water at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

The report titled, ‘Finland and the 2030 Agenda: A follow-up report by CSOs,’ discusses the state of sustainable development in Finland, visions about the future, and recommendations for decision-makers at the global, national and local levels.

The report covers SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12 , 15 and 17. It explains that while the SDGs are linked, some can be at odds with each other, and recommends looking at decisions that are detrimental to sustainable development.

Regarding Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), the report notes interlinkages with, among others, SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), as investments in water and sanitation can lead to reduced health care costs. It also notes that: Finland’s investments in water sector projects have decreased by more than the cutbacks in development cooperation; water distribution networks are aging; and funding for research is lacking. (Read more on Finland’s aid decline here.) The report recommends that Finland, inter alia:

update its international strategy for the water sector;

promote private sector and local investments in the water sector;

increase international cooperation to strengthen know-how and increase the sector’s attractiveness;

ensure the sustainable use of existing water resources;

invest in more efficient water consumption, wastewater management, recycling and reuse technologies, and education and research; and

on the part of municipalities and regional governments, inform residents about water stewardship.

Regarding SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report notes that: Finland’s energy production is largely based on fossil fuels; the country’s fossil fuel consumption per person is more than European and global averages; and one in ten species in Finland is endangered. Globally, the report recommends that Finland: ensure an ecologically sustainable and fair energy system that functions without fossil fuels; join the Eradicating Ecocide initiative and, when necessary, criminalize conspicuous consumption; and from 2020, contribute annually to international climate funding by at least €200 million, particularly for least developed countries (LDCs).

Nationally, the report suggests that Finland set binding energy targets; harmonize licensing practices; and ban fossil energy production by 2030 and stop coal and peat use by 2025. Locally, the report calls on municipalities and provinces to: stop using coal and peat in energy produc­tion plants; begin using wood-based solutions; improve energy efficiency through economic incentives; and introduce demand-side man­agement in buildings owned by municipalities and provinces.

Regarding SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), the report recommends that, globally, Finland should: initiate a programme for “reciprocal sustainable urban development”; ensure that business activities in cities in developing countries support the well-being of residents and the environment; and encouraging less consumption, such as through a voluntary carbon tax.

Nationally, the report recommends that Finland use taxation reform to support and fund local circular and sharing economy through taxation reform. It also suggests considering expenses that future generations will have to bear when making public purchases. Local recommendations include restricting the construction sector’s ability to affect municipal decision-making.

Regarding SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report recommends that Finland: oblige companies to map and reduce negative impacts on human rights impacts; promote the international treaty on corporate human rights responsibilities; strengthen tax justice in Finland and the EU by requiring reporting from multinational corporations; and ensure development cooperation funds are in line with the Paris Agree­ment’s 1.5°C target.

The report explains that, by a 2017 law, public organizations can include labor rights, human rights and environmental conditions in their procurement criteria. Thus, it recommends: developing indicators that describe human well-being and the environment for monitoring state policies and budgets; making responsi­ble procurement decisions in public institutions; and halting the exploitation of child labor and forced labor from procurement chains.

Of relevance to SDG 15 (life on land), intensive forestry is threatening forest species in Finland; around 36% of threatened species live primarily in forest, and 70% of forest habitat types are threatened. However, only about 5.7% of actual forests, or productive forestland, is legally protected from logging, and the government aims to increase logging by 20%. In light of this, recommendations include:

protecting at least 17% of Finland’s forest area;

demanding corporate accountability to stop biodiversity loss;

advocating for a higher level of carbon emission targeting in the EU;

advancing activities that enhance ecosystems’ carbon sinks and storages;

halting support for peatland draining;

shifting municipal management of commercial forests to forestry without clear cutting; and

helping schools, daycare centers and educational institutions diversify learning environments and include environmental education.

Regarding SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), the report calls for: increasing funding of civil society actors to 15% of Finland’s development cooperation; strengthening the UN’s role in international tax-related cooperation, and ensuring all countries can participate in tax system renovation; increasing Finland’s international climate funding to €200 million a year by 2020; and reinvesting carbon trade income in international development and climate funding.

Nationally, the report recommends: using the SDGs as a basis for government programming and budgeting; improving data collection and monitoring to better determine progress regarding sustainable development; and exe­cuting the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to make aggressive tax planning illegal. Local-level recommendations include: organizing an application procedure for annual grants for environmental education and information; increasing financing of associations and citizens’ groups; and including guidance on sustainability and social responsibil­ity in procurement instructions.

The authors note that Finland’s Ministry of Finance has initiated a process to assess the national budget from a sustainable development perspective. However, Finland’s budget proposal for 2019 is expected to be estimated mainly from the climate change perspective, focusing on carbon neutrality and resource use, and they recommend widening the planning to cover other sectors.

The report recalls that Finland was one of the first countries to develop a national implementation plan (adopted in 2016 and approved by parliament in February 2017) and to define national indicators required to monitor progress on sustainable development. Finland presented a voluntary national review at the 2016 session of the HLPF, which highlighted its use of 39 national sustainable development indicators to monitor and review status and trends in sustainable development, which would be revised in line with the 2030 Agenda.. Providing an update on progress in 2017, Annika Lindblom, Secretary-General, Finland’s National Commission on Sustainable Development, noted that stakeholders from civil society, business, and the research community were involved in the definition of SDG indicators, and the follow-up and review system is anchored in the eight objectives of the ‘Society’s Commitment.’ The system is composed of ten indicator “baskets,” each of which contains four to five indicators to be updated once a year, based on inputs from authorities and the public. A monitoring platform will be made available on the sustainable development website of the Prime Minister’s office.

The 2018 SDG Index from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Bertelsmann Stiftung assessed Finland as one of the highest-ranking countries on the SDGs, but notes that even those face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs.

164,https://www.devex.com/news/challenges-facing-sdg-2030-deadline-for-safe-water-and-sanitation-93249,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Challenges facing SDG 2030 deadline for safe water and sanitation,"CANBERRA — Under goal six of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments are committed to targets for clean water and sanitation by 2030 — including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the lead up to a High-level Political Forum held at the United Nations in July, which discussed progress and challenges on a range of SDGs, including goal six, WaterAid Australia drew attention to the challenges of achieving the objective.

By analyzing the most recent data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which shows the percentage of the population in each nation with access to basic water and sanitation, WaterAid showed that the goal is unlikely to be achieved by 2030. The current rate of progress will see centuries before universal access to basic water and sanitation is achieved.

Further analysis of the source data, which shows progress achieved on a range of water and sanitation indicators between 2000 and 2015, suggests that only 21 countries are on target to achieve basic water and sanitation services for their entire population. Meanwhile, 68 countries have seen progress on targets decline since 2000.

The 'S word:' Is it time for the sanitation sector to reconsider subsidies? As donors and implementers grapple with how to deal with the world’s looming sanitation crisis, old debates over the use of subsidies are flaring up again. But experts told Devex of an emerging consensus that there is space for subsidies — if deployed in new and smarter ways.

Responding to environmental and political obstacles, as well as the challenges created in getting the last percentage of the population across the line for basic water and sanitation services, are barriers governments are being asked to urgently deal with, to ensure SDG 6 can be achieved.

Which countries are achieving targets?

Of the 21 countries that have achieved, or are on track to achieve, basic water and sanitation access for the entire population, only three countries classified as developed countries are expected to achieve both basic water and sanitation targets — Australia, Estonia, and Portugal.

There are also developing countries that have made major gains between 2000 and 2015, including Laos, Sri Lanka, Tokelau, and Vietnam. Based on the current rate of progress, these countries are expected to provide basic water and sanitation services for the entire population by 2030.

According to the data, Laos has been one of the biggest achievers. In 2000, less than half of the population had access to basic water and just over a quarter of the population had basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 80 percent of the population had access to basic water while almost three-quarters of the population had basic sanitation.

Based on its current rate of progress, Laos is projected to achieve national access to basic water and sanitation by 2024.

Vietnam is another success story according to the data. In 2000, almost a quarter of the population — most of them living in rural areas — were missing out on basic water access, with nearly half without basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 91 percent of the population had access to basic water, putting the country on track to achieve universal basic water access by 2025.

Now, just under 80 percent of the population has access to basic sanitation — with huge gains made in rural Vietnam. By 2028, the country is projected to achieve universal access based on current progress.

Which countries are in decline?

A concerning trend in the data is countries moving backward on access to basic water or sanitation for populations between 2000 and 2015. These include a wide range of nations: Bermuda, Jordan, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Slovenia, and Zimbabwe.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates.” — Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had enabled 36.7 percent of its population to access basic water and 18.7 percent basic sanitation. By 2015, this number had declined to 36.6 percent and 18.6 percent respectively — small declines by percentage but major barriers to achieving universal basic and water access by 2030.

Other countries started 2000 with a major percentage of their population having accessible water and sanitation, only to drop.

In 2000, Nieu, for example, was providing more than 99.2 percent of its population with access to basic water and 100 percent of its population with access to basic sanitation. Fifteen years later they had both declined — basic water coverage declined to 98.2 percent and basic sanitation to 97.8 percent.

In 2004, Nieu was hit by the worst cyclone on its record, Cyclone Heta, which is likely to have played a role in the decline of water and sanitation. This demonstrates the challenges of natural disasters, conflict, and more, in the ability to achieve the 2030 targets.

Where is progress slow?

For other countries, barriers come from two key challenges: Starting from a low base or slow progress in achieving the final percentage points.

Equatorial Guinea’s population coverage of basic water rose from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2015 — an average improvement of 0.05 percent each year. Based on this rate of progress, Equatorial Guinea will achieve national coverage for basic water by 3119.

The challenge for Equatorial Guinea is in rural areas. While water coverage for urban regions is dramatically improving — with total coverage expected to be reached by 2037 in urban areas — coverage is worsening in rural areas, dropping from 39.9 percent coverage in 2000 to 30.5 percent in 2015. For basic sanitation, the entire nation is moving backward.

Why you should care about 'systems' in WASH The focus in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector needs to shift from the number of pumps or latrines built to a more sustainable, systems-wide approach, according to many insiders. Enter Agenda for Change, a coalition of organizations that seek to demonstrate how this can be done through collective action.

Similarly, Eritrea has a long road ahead. Beginning in 2000, data shows just 16.8 percent of the nation had access to basic water and 7.5 percent access to basic sanitation. By 2015, these numbers had improved, increasing to 19.3 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. But this slow rate of improvement projects that basic water will be provided to the entire population by 2507 and basic sanitation by 2374.

For Vanuatu, the rate of progress on water will see the country just miss the 2030 deadline. Vanuatu is projected to achieve national coverage by 2031. Just over half the population had access to appropriate facilities for basic sanitation in 2015, but with an annual progress of 0.2 percent, the country is projected to achieve basic sanitation targets by 3468.

These three nations also face other challenges.

Equatorial Guinea faces political challenges under the dictatorship of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who seized control of the country in a 1979 military coup. Eritrea has faced conflict with neighboring countries, U.N. sanctions, and droughts. And Vanuatu faces the impact of natural disasters, with Cyclone Pam causing widespread devastation in 2015, as well as the high cost of delivering services to the Pacific region.

At the time the data was collected, Puerto Rico was struggling to provide basic services to the last 3 percent of its population, in both water and sanitation. In 2015, basic water coverage had increased from 97.1 percent to 97.1. Yet, because the annual rate of growth averaged 0.003 percent, Puerto Rico was predicted basic national water access by 2773, with basic sanitation predicted by 2443. The data does not take into account the impact of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, on basic water and sanitation availability.

Despite national basic water coverage, 1 percent of Germany’s population has no access to basic sanitation. The country’s slow rate of progress means universal coverage is projected by 3753.

Belgium too struggles with slow progress. While nearly the entire population has access to water now, national basic sanitation is projected to be achieved by 4817.

Addressing the challenges

Achieving universal basic water and sanitation services by 2030 are hampered by a range of local factors. Although projections show the challenging road ahead for water and sanitation, they do not factor in additional challenges — such as future natural disasters, conflicts, and economic crises — have in achieving universal access targets.

Top employers in water, sanitation, and hygiene: A primer 663 million people still don't have access to clean and safe water, and 1 in 3 people don't have a decent toilet. WASH sector NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, and private consultants are all crucial players in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6. Check out this Devex roundup of some of the biggest employers in WASH to find out if any are right for you.

With data at hand showing the gravity of the challenge, it is hoped that better practices might be developed, through planning and policy, to support universal access. By breaking the data down into in rural and urban coverage, it becomes evident where they exist: Commonly in rural areas.

At the conclusion of a High-level Political Forum, former President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council Marie Chatardová spoke on the challenges of water and sanitation coverage.

“We … held extensive discussions on the SDG 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on cities, 12 on sustainable consumption and production, 15 on life on land, and 17 on partnerships,” she said.

“We came up with many recommendations … Those include establishing a ‘blue fund’ to support design and implementation of transboundary water management for SDG 6.”

She highlighted the importance of partnering with the private sector and other new partners to achieve the goals. But whether the outcomes of the High-level Political Forum, including delivery of the proposed blue fund, will achieve significant changes in the projections is yet to be seen.

“For nations to be years off track in meeting the human right to water and sanitation is shocking,” said Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia, prior to the political forum.

“The meeting of ministers at HLPF must result in more than just words of encouragement because we have only 12 years left to keep the promise made to those living without clean water or a decent toilet. Governments must prioritise water, sanitation and hygiene — the basic building blocks of any stable and prosperous community — ensuring proper financing is put in place to build a more sustainable country today and for future generations,” he said.

WaterAid is calling on governments, donors, financial institutions, and the private sector to prioritize financing for water and sanitation and to integrate the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene into strategies for education, health, and nutrition programs globally.

Experts are calling for more investment into research and programs to tackle stigma and barriers surrounding issues of sanitation.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates,” Muller said.

With one child dying every two minutes from diarrhea caused by dirty water, poor sanitation, and bad hygiene, according to WaterAid, more than a quarter of million children will die each year basic water and sanitation targets are not met — a figure unacceptable to both Muller and the objectives of the SDGs.

The publication titled, ‘The SDGs and Cities: International Human Mobility,’ provides an overview of cities’ various strategies, initiatives and efforts. It includes a practical tool with 13 possible lines of action to be implemented by local governments to deal with international human mobility from a human rights perspective, and emphasizes social participation and the systematic production of information.

The 13-part practical tool focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations.

The tool aims to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by facilitating, promoting and replicating implementation of local public policies aimed at helping migrants and refugees. It focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations, and aims to enhance and promote the exchange of experiences and best practices regarding international human mobility in LAC cities.

According to the report, almost 80% of Latin American population lives in cities. The study notes that the proportion of the immigrant population is higher in cities as migrants tend to settle in large urban areas. This causes difficulties for local authorities to implement policies for integrating new inhabitants, related to the lack of resources, services and technical capacity.

The Handbook describes 13 actions, relevant implementation strategies, reasons such actions are needed, indicators and targets associated with SDGs 10 (reduced inequalities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), 4 (quality education), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 5 (gender equality) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The actions include:

Guarantee access of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees to public policy-making processes (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.7);

Create a specific institution for caring for, receiving and integrating them (SDG targets 10.7, 16.6 and 16.b);

Provide training for local governments, focusing on rights (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7 and 16.b);

Develop anti-discriminatory campaigns that underscore “interculturality” for human and sustainable development (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.b);

Implement programmes that grant local identification and improve access to housing, health and education (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7, 11.1 and 16.9);

Complement curricula in schools and teacher training colleges with intercultural and bilingual education (SDG targets 4.1 and 10.7);

Develop skills improvement programmes (SDG targets 8.7, 8.8 and 10.7);

Implement programmes to care for women migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees that are victims of gender violence, and design strategies to raise awareness about this problem (SDG targets 5.1, 5.2, 10.7 and 16.1); and

Provide cultural mediators and interpreters for health and healthcare services (SDG targets 3.8 and 10.7).

Between 2000 and 2015, the number of international migrants worldwide increased from 173 million to 244 million. Around nine million international migrants live in LAC countries. International and regional organizations are advancing an agenda to promote safe migration and respect for migrants’ rights through the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which will be adopted in December 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco.

The Handbook was prepared in response to the global phenomenon of human mobility in urban areas.

Leading Locally, Achieving Together","With the vision “to build a Resilient Navakavu – O Navakavu Qoi!” the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022 (NRS) was a timely development framework for the Yavusa vakaturaga o Navakavu, a traditional Fijian unit, which comprise of five villages – Muaivuso, Nabaka, Waiqanake, Namakala and Ucuinamono. It is a leading example of how local governance structures are helping to meet national and international development frameworks and priorities.

With the mission to revitalize, strengthen and position Navakavu to engage in opportunities for growth and prosperity for a transformed Fiji, the NRS is linked to the Fiji National Development Plan 2017-2021 (NDP) and the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 (SDGs). The NRS was officially launched by the Prime Minister of Fiji and President of UNFCCC COP 23 Honourable Josaia V Bainimarama on 6 June 2018, at the Novotel Conference Centre. In a statement supporting the NRS mission, he said:

“… [W]e recognize that there is immense opportunity in a growing Fijian economy, and we want to put the Yavusa o Navakavu in the best possible position to realize those opportunities… Today marks the beginning of your conference to launch the Navakavu Revitalization Plan from 2018-2022, a plan that builds upon the strategic blueprint laid out in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan….I applaud your community for coming together to determine how you can capitalize on all the great progress and all the new opportunity that has come to Fiji. Because a government alone can only do so much. It can create a favorable environment, but it is up to individuals to take advantage…]”

The five NRS Strategic Goals that link to the Fiji NDP and SDGs address, inter alia, employment, housing, education, health, land, and infrastructure. The NRS strategic goals show how national development plans (the NDP) as well as international development roadmaps (the SDGs) can be implemented at the local level in a way that reflects local needs and priorities.

The five NRS Strategic Goals address employment, housing, education, health, land and infrastructure.

The NRS launch coincided with the 21st Anniversary of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA), which is helping to meet the targets of the SDG on life below water (SDG 14), among others. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua o Navakavu with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In Navakavu, there is a local Committee comprised of family unit heads that has worked to increase awareness of the need for, and the implementation of, strategies for fisheries conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources in the area.

The paramount chief of Navakavu, the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni, and His Council have approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protection Area to platform its long-term plan of a Live Marine/Science Laboratory, which would serve as an initiative integrating conservation, education and tourism objectives. Community discussions are underway on this “Navakavu Reef to Ridge Initiative.” It covers an area of some 3.3 square km, which is equivalent to approximately 18% of the community fishing ground area of 18.5 square km.

Local efforts are also targeting youth to ensure longevity and the intergenerational reach of projects. On 29 June 2018, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the Chief Guest with the Navakavu Youth in commemorating the World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his Council joined the youth together with officials from the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry, FLMMA network and Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation (PIANGO).

The commemoration of the Navakavu Youth World Oceans Day is in line with the Goals under the Sustainable Development Goals, the Fiji National Development Plan, the Plan for the Yasana o Rewa, the Tikina o Suva and Goal 4 of the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022.

The children and youth replanted mangroves and native trees to celebrate the day and plans are in place to clean up rubbish from our land and our beaches and our ocean. The youth and children have taken leadership as custodians of our Ocean. They too feel this moral obligation, as we are all committed to this sacred responsibility.

Countries across the world vary tremendously in terms of their burden of disease, and performance in terms of doing what is required. Shortfall in performance can be attributed to several factors that these columns have emphasized: policy, infrastructure, medical staff, and front-line workers.

How we compare country-level performance, identify issues that cut across, and respond to them is the charter of what is called “global health"". Entering into the new millennium, there was a consensus that the world needed an agreed upon set of metrics that would translate into targets for countries and also enable cross-country comparisons. What are these metrics? How well has India done against them? What are we doing to improve our report card? This article touches on these issues.

The year 2000 saw the unprecedented coming together of 189 nation states along with multilateral agencies to reduce multi-dimensional poverty and ensure economic well-being and social development through global partnership. Therein was born the millennium development goals (MDGs) to run from 2000-2015. The MDGs were a set of eight broad metrics that ranged from eradicating extreme hunger (MDG 1) to ensuring environmental sustainability (MDG 7). The operative ones were reducing child mortality (MDG 4), improving maternal health (MDG 5) and combating HIV/AIDS and malaria (MDG 6).

India’s performance on the MDGs, especially on health and nutrition, improved but stayed sub-optimal. The ministry of statistics and programme implementation reports that India was only able to achieve the MDG target of halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS and incidences of malaria by 2015. Among the states, only Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved the MDG target of decline in infant death per thousand live births. Similarly, only Kerala and West Bengal managed to achieve the target of decline in maternal deaths per one lakh population.

By the end of the MDG era, there was a feeling that MDGs were too narrow in their scope as they did not touch upon the broader health and developmental issues confronting the world.

This led to the dawn of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to run from 2015 to 2030. The SDGs were signed in September 2015 by the leaders of 170 countries with the objective of finishing the unfinished business of the MDGs. The SDGs are wider in scope in that they covered social and environmental determinants of health such as gender, nutrition, sanitation, sustainable habitats and infrastructure.

Crucially, the SDGs have a formal mechanism of voluntary review by individual countries, by submission to the High-level Political Forum on on Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The SDGs also have a section on means of implementation, which spells out the resources required for its implementation.

So, how is India faring on the SDGs? In the global SDG index that assesses the performance of countries in meeting the SDGs, in 2017, India ranked at 116 out of 157 countries. By way of comparison, Brazil ranks at 56, Bangladesh at 111, Sri Lanka at 89 and China at 54. Specific to health, India ranks at 143 out of 188 countries.

If India wants to succeed on SDGs, political will is the key, and the good news is that there is strong intent. Programmes such as “Transformation of Aspirational Districts"" are a welcome approach by the government of India to localize the SDGs with a focus on health, nutrition, infrastructure, education and agriculture.

Similarly, programmes like Ayushman Bharat, National Nutrition Mission, and the Swachh Bharat Mission can potentially play a pivotal role in meeting the targets under different SDGs. The NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the task of coordinating the SDGs for India, to ensure monitoring at the highest level. That institution is coming up with a much-needed index to assess the performance of Indian states on the SDGs with the objective of spurring competition among them.

Given India’s size, clearly the world will only succeed if India meets the SDGs. We cannot afford to fail.

168,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-the-belt-and-road-initiative-and-chinas-investment-in-africa/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: The Belt and Road Initiative and China’s Investment in Africa,"With tensions high in the global community around trade policies and international relations, this week’s brief reviews some of the differences in countries’ approaches to investment abroad. Following recent headlines, it examines China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in tandem with cooperation in Africa, highlighting the implications for sustainable development on the continent.

Announced in 2013 with the promise of providing a “silk road for the 21st century,” the BRI consists primarily of state- and privately-financed infrastructure projects in developing countries. The Initiative has been met with both praise and skepticism.

In the Financial Times, Beijing Foreign Studies University’s Gu Bin says, the “spirit of the BRI reinforces the value of building a shared future,” highlighting key differences that distinguish it from the post-World War II Marshall Plan led by the US. However, Sean Kenji Starrs, City University of Hong Kong, responds by noting the BRI is “no selfless venture.” He cites debt, other aspects of neocolonialism and increasing homogeneity of Chinese academia as causes for concern (though these points are also contested).

The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development’s (ICTSD) July publication of Bridges Africa zooms in on China-Africa economic relations. The introductory article flags that some have questioned the “balance and quality” of the relationship from an African perspective, given China’s high and immediate demand for natural resources. It also notes recent data that show decreases since 2013-2014 in Chinese investment in Africa, China-Africa trade, and Chinese loans to Africa. However, Yunnan Chen identifies opportunities for promoting sustainable development, emphasizing not only renewable energy and transportation projects, but also the scope for technology transfer and diversification of sourcing.

The International Institute for Environment and Development’s (IIED) James Mayers examines the complex impact of Chinese investment in Africa, linking particularly to SDG 15 (life on land), in a “long read” titled, ‘Finding a Green Path for China and Africa?’. Some investments, Mayers says, “gobble up forest and woodland. Some bring huge benefits to African economies. Some do both.” The article offers an overview of the BRI and provides insight to a topic that often features perceptions that have been “assumed rather than really known.” Mayers identifies context-specific constraints to more sustainable timber production and processing, particularly in small-scale operations that “have traditionally worked under the radar of policy and legality.” A key gap, he notes, is connecting businesses to the remote areas and people where their investments often materialize, and breaking down stereotypes or prejudices across stakeholder groups.

IIED also produced a short film on the linkages between Chinese investment in Africa and the continent’s forests, which it emphasizes are increasingly being converted to agriculture or sent to China – the world’s “only reliable market” in the eyes of one interviewee. Darlindo Pechisso, National Directorate of Forests, Mozambique, notes that 90% of the country’s timber is exported to China. The article and film are part of a wider project supported by the UK on China-Africa Forest Governance.

Looking at trade more broadly through an agricultural lens, the fourth in a series of articles on Impakter asks whether achieving the SDGs is a “grassroots-up” or “global trade-down” endeavor. The article notes that at the local level, 45 million small farms in Africa produce the bulk of countries’ agricultural exports, and that trade links these smallholders to global food value chains. The authors, from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN (FAO), also highlight large agribusinesses and multinationals, which they indicate as having a leading role, but will have to “substantially change” their business to contribute to the SDGs and minimize the negative impacts of their operations. A Devex Q&A on support to African entrepreneurs also notes the potential for agriculture and trade in Africa.

Following the recent BRICS Summit in South Africa, China’s President Xi Jinping signed a number of cooperation documents on the continent. An opinion piece on China Global Television Network (CGTN) by China’s ambassador to Somalia, Qin Jian, calls the BRI “win-win cooperation,” noting that the BRI “reaffirms China’s commitment to building an open economy, ensures free and inclusive trade, opposes all forms of protectionism.” Qin also says the BRI stands for enhancing international cooperation through strategies that feature the SDGs and African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The Brookings Institution’s Yun Sun compares China’s state-led approach in Africa to that of the US, which is “more willing to let companies and the market” lead commercial development. She notes that while US-China cooperation around Africa’s development has been “scarce,” there is increasing collaboration between Chinese and American companies, the latter of which appear to be beneficiaries of the BRI. General Electric (GE), she highlights, has worked in partnership with the state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) on an expanded engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project model. Under such a model, partners work together on joint market development, fundraising and operation. However, the article closes by cautioning that BRI projects are “designed to absorb Chinese overcapacity,” noting that most foreign firms remain at a disadvantage in competing for them. Whether these projects are aligned with the ambitions of the SDGs is yet to be seen.

Implementing the SDGs requires financial flows to, at a minimum, remain consistent. The BRI represents a significant source of funding that can begin to bridge the well-documented finance gap. However, in the broader context of a trade war and retaliatory measures or increasing national self-interest, reductions in investment or the continuation of a business-as-usual approach risks leaving the environmental and social pillars of international development unaccounted for.

Transboundary water cooperation is critical for ensuring sustainable management of water resources and achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. Across the world, 153 countries share rivers, lakes and aquifers. Transboundary basins cover more than half of the Earth’s land surface, account for an estimated 60 per cent of global freshwater flow and are home to more than 40 per cent of the world’s population.

Transboundary water cooperation is a precondition for sustainable development, peace and stability. Transboundary waters create social, economic, environmental and political inter-dependencies. They not only sustain populations across borders but also connect economic sectors and ecosystems in the basins. Conflicting demands over shared waters can engender political conflicts and regional instability.

As the only target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development explicitly referring to transboundary cooperation, target 6.5 can play a catalytic role across multiple SDGs and targets. It can generate multiple benefits relating to the protection of human health, renewable energy provision, sustainable agriculture, climate adaptation, ecosystem protection, and peace and security.

Cooperation is shaped by the particular historical, legal and political context, and existing arrangements vary considerably in terms of scope and intensity of cooperation. They all reflect a tangible commitment by the countries involved to manage water resources at the transboundary level and are founded upon customary international law principles. Basin-specific arrangements are greatly supported by regional and global frameworks such as the Water Convention, the Watercourses Convention, the European Commission (EU) Water Framework Directive and the Revised Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Protocol.

In some regions and basins, significant progress has been made to further transboundary water cooperation through operational arrangements. Progress is particularly advanced in Europe and Northern America, and in most major river and lake basins in sub-Saharan Africa. Regional legal frameworks, such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Revised SADC Protocol, have proven to be important drivers of transboundary water cooperation.

However, results from the 6.5.2 indicator monitoring exercises show that arrangements for transboundary water cooperation are often absent. The first SDG indicator 6.5.2 monitoring exercise has demonstrated that for the 62 countries considered, only 59 per cent of their transboundary basin area is covered by operational arrangements, while only 17 countries have all their transboundary basins covered by operational arrangements. These results are consistent with those for SDG indicator 6.5.1.

Cooperation on transboundary aquifers represents a particular challenge and is lagging further behind. Despite the numerous services that groundwater provides for both humans and ecosystems, operational arrangements for transboundary aquifers are still rare around the world. Transboundary aquifers entered late on the scientific and political agendas, probably to a large extent on account of the hidden nature and the political unattractiveness of groundwater. Delineating transboundary aquifers and realizing commitments to coordinated or joint management of this invisible resource therefore pose particular challenges.

If target 6.5 is to be achieved by 2030, progress must be accelerated and all transboundary basins must be covered by an operational arrangement. At the current rate of progress, with on average three agreements entered into per year, we are not on track to achieve target 6.5.

To this end, we need to capitalize on the experience and outputs of the first SDG indicator 6.5.2 reporting exercise. For the first time, a country-based process provides a robust methodology for monitoring cooperation on the world’s transboundary basins. This can play an important role in advancing transboundary cooperation. It is important that countries and regions where reporting levels are currently low also engage in reporting exercises, and that synergies between reporting on 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 are exploited. Moreover, SDG indicator 6.5.2 reports should be used to set national and basin-specific targets related to transboundary water cooperation.

Cooperation can be strengthened by capitalizing on the momentum in support of the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (Watercourses Convention), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) and the Draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers, sharing knowledge and experience of the benefits of transboundary water cooperation, improving financing for transboundary water cooperation and increasing capacity-building initiatives.","Key MessagesTransboundary water cooperation is critical for ensuring sustainable management of water resources and achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.

Prior to 1991, the USSR and Iran shared control of the sea.

The five countries reached the deal, known as the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, on 12 August 2018 during the Caspian Sea Summit in Akta, Kazakhstan. One major point of contention leading up to the Summit was whether to define the Caspian Sea as a lake, meaning it would be divided equally between all five countries, or as a sea, which would then be governed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The agreement divides the seabed into territorial zones (as is the norm with a lake) and the surface as international water (as is the norm for an officially designated sea).

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the agreement will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

In a statement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the signing of the agreement, noting that it demonstrates the importance of regional cooperation and multilateralism for maintaining international peace and security. He highlighted the convention as a “significant step” towards easing regional tensions, and said it will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

The study is based on analysis of data from the 2015–2016 National Family Health Survey (NFHS).

The results of the study done by Jayanta Kumar Bora from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria, and Nandita Saikia from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), have been published in journal PLoS ONE.

The results indicate that on an average, estimated deaths of under 5 children is double the targeted figure (49.4 against targeted 25 deaths per 1000 live births) while estimated deaths of newborns is about 2.4 times greater than the targeted one (29.2 against targeted 12 deaths per 1,000 live births).

Of the 613 districts considered, 9% and 14% have already achieved the target for reducing the deaths in newborns and under 5-year-old children, respectively. But nearly half the districts (315) are unlikely to achieve the target by 2030. Most of the poorly performing districts are located in Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

About 67% of the districts are not likely to achieve the target for male newborns, whereas 46% are not likely to achieve the target for female newborns by 2030. Most of the districts unlikely to achieve the target to reduce deaths in female newborns are located in north-central and eastern belt of the country. For male newborns, north-central-west, north-east and south-east are unlikely to meet the target by 2030. This includes rich states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Telangana. In Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, 97% of districts are unlikely to meet the targets for both reducing deaths in newborns and in children under five irrespective of gender.

The reason for the disparities, according to the researchers, could be in the level of socio-economic development in terms of female literacy rate, urbanization and safe drinking water. Disparities in the decrease in deaths in newborns vis-à-vis under 5-year-old children could be related to implementation of interventions. “The state-level mortality rate does not reflect the inter-district variation in neonatal or under-five mortality rates. While some districts of a particular state may already have achieved the SDG3 target 15 years in advance, some districts will not achieve this even by the 2030 target time,” Bora pointed out while speaking to India Science Wire.

Another finding is that female newborn deaths are lower than male newborn deaths, a much-expected finding due to female’s biological advantage observed in other countries of the world. However, this advantage reduces in older children indicating potential discrimination against girl child.

India, presently, has the highest global share of deaths among the under-fives. Although the number of deaths in children below 5 years of age has gone done by almost 50% in over 23 years, it is not enough to meet the required targets set by UN which aims at ending preventable deaths of newborns and other children under 5 years of age, reducing deaths of newborns and in under-5 children , by 2030. This is in spite of efforts to improve the infrastructure in backward districts through the National Rural Health Mission, Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses, and other schemes.

“It is important to note that India experienced the highest reduction in mortality rate in the period 2005-2016. Therefore, to achieve the SDG-related mortality goals at the district level, it needs to intervene more rigorously than ever,” said Saikia.

174,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-operation-finale,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Operation Finale’,"Ben Kingsley and Oscar Isaac square off in a post-WWII historical drama, as the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann and one of the Israeli agents who captured him in 1960.

It was the experience of reporting in Jerusalem on the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for The New Yorker that led the philosopher Hannah Arendt to coin her famous phrase “the banality of evil.”

Eichmann — by some reckonings Hitler’s deadliest lieutenant and the architect of the Holocaust, decorated by the Nazi regime with high honors, including the War Merit Cross and the Iron Cross — turned out under inspection to be, not a psychopath, an evil genius or a monster of hate, but something more inconceivable. Unreflective, unoriginal, uninsightful and plain uninteresting, he was, simply, an insipid functionary, a dull little man.

Accounts of the daring 1960 Israeli covert operation into Argentina, where Eichmann was living in Buenos Aires under the pseudonym Ricardo Klement, to spirit him to Jerusalem for trial describe a pathetic, timid soul who hardly dared to move without his captors’ orders.

Eichmann’s need to be told what to do anticipated his insistence at his trial that everything he had done in the service of the Third Reich was only him following orders. In defiance of the conventions of fiction and cinema, he was a figure one could despise, but hardly dread or fear in himself.

While I’m certain the chameleonic Ben Kingsley could play a baffling mediocrity like this, I’ve never seen him do it. He tends to go larger than life, not smaller. Whether playing heroes, monsters, mentors or ambiguous men, Kingsley is nearly always among the most vibrant figures on the screen.

Only as Itzhak Stern, Oskar Schindler’s Jewish accountant in Schindler’s List, has he ever withdrawn into any role I’ve seen. Kingsley’s Stern was insightful and less passive than he seemed, but he was a small man, dwarfed by circumstances, in the shadow of the flamboyant Schindler.

Eichmann and Stern are obviously antithetical roles, but a similar restraint might have served Kingsley well in evoking a figure of such legendary mundaneness.

But Operation Finale is Hollywood, so we get Kingsley in larger-than-life mode: formidable, masterful, commanding, self-possessed, as a movie villain worth his salt should be.

Directed by Chris Weitz and written by first-time screenwriter Matthew Orton, Operation Finale offers an efficient, sometimes gripping, fictionalized account of the discovery, capture and extraction of Eichmann.

In the process, it brings some earnest thought to moral questions about justice and violence, starting with a wrenching prologue in which an effort to bring a Nazi war criminal to justice goes appallingly wrong. Later, when Eichmann is located over a decade after the end of the war, it’s not immediately obvious that capturing him is still a high priority for Israel amid more pressing concerns — and the argument that carries the day there is not a moral one.

We also see signs of resurgent anti-Semitic sentiment in Argentina — sentiments with contemporary resonances that the film has little interest in exploring. (A Catholic priest joining in condemning Jews at a neo-Nazi meeting is one of the few religious references. An elderly Jewish mother scolding her grown son about answering the phone on Shabbat offers a glimpse into devout Orthodox Jewish observance.)

How historically grounded is this telling? That’s a complicated question, since the facts of the operation are in dispute, even among the participants. At least three agents published somewhat conflicting accounts — each maximizing the author’s own contributions.

The most colorful and popular version, and the one that inspired Operation Finale, is that of the man who physically grabbed Eichmann on the street: Mossad agent Peter Malkin, played in the film by Oscar Isaac.

In his book, Eichmann in My Hands, Malkin wrote about developing a clandestine relationship with the prisoner over the 10 days or so that they spent in a safe house. Disregarding mission rules, Malkin removed Eichmann’s blindfold and chatted with him, plying him with cigarettes and wine and even grooming and shaving him, ultimately inducing him to sign a document stating his willingness to be brought to Jerusalem for trial — or so Malkin said.

That narrative was bitterly disputed by expert interrogator Zvi Aharoni, played in the film by Michael Aronov. Aharoni, who initially identified Ricardo Klement as Eichmann, insisted that Eichmann signed the document for him without resistance and denied that Malkin even spoke German. (Malkin claimed to have communicated with Eichmann in a blend of broken German and Yiddish.)

Team leader Rafi Eitan (Nick Kroll) never wrote an account, but he credited the least inaccurate version to spymaster Isser Harel (Llior Raz).

While I’m listing team members, Mélanie Laurent’s character, anesthesiologist Hanna Elian, is a composite of two real people: the real team’s lone female member, Yehudit Nesiahu, who helped to run the safe houses, and the male doctor, Yonah Eilan, whose task was to sedate Eichmann for transportation when necessary. Because Operation Finale is a Hollywood riff on Malkin’s account, Elian and Malkin have a romantic past.

The film accurately depicts Malkin as an amateur painter, passing time at the safe house creating works with Holocaust motifs. Perhaps he was a good storyteller, too. At any rate, it’s a good story.

Many details, including Eichmann grotesquely reciting the Shema — the affirmation of Jewish faith from Deuteronomy that is one of Judaism’s most important prayers — reflect Malkin’s account, though the context and meaning of these elements often shift in the retelling.

Yet where Malkin agreed with other accounts in depicting Eichmann as a feeble nonentity, Operation Finale makes the exchanges between the prisoner and his captors a powerhouse battle of wits, a cat-and-mouse game in which the identity of cat and mouse is an ever-shifting question.

In Malkin’s telling, Eichmann was so helpless that, after seating him on the toilet, his captors had to order him to relieve himself. In the film, when Eichmann asks permission to use toilet paper, it’s a passive-aggressive power move: He’s forcing his captors to take responsibility for his every action.

There’s more than an echo of The Silence of the Lambs in Isaac and Kingsley’s interactions. Eichmann is said to have, like Hannibal Lecter, intimidating powers of persuasion; his captors are warned that he convinced doomed prisoners to board Nazi death trains willingly. Like Lecter, Eichmann has a trick of drawing one in with seeming humanity before springing an appalling verbal assault wherever one is most vulnerable.

Though no untried trainee, Malkin has, like Clarice Starling, a secret trauma that Eichmann homes in on. The dynamic of quid pro quo versus not wanting Adolf Eichmann inside your head is very much the subtext of their exchanges.

This can make for compelling drama, especially when played with the intelligence and charisma that Isaac and Kingsley have in abundance. Yet in making Eichmann another darkly iconic Hollywood master of manipulation — alongside Lecter, De Niro’s Max Cady (Cape Fear), Russell Crowe’s Ben Wade (3:10 to Yuma) and Heath Ledger’s Joker — something of the moral truth of the Third Reich’s impersonal evil is lost.

Schindler’s List has been criticized for its depiction of Ralph Fiennes’ SS officer Amon Göth as a psychotic killer, which was far from typical of the Nazi machine. That portrayal at least has some basis in history.

Operation Finale isn’t a bad film, but it’s an unsatisfying one. It works on its own terms, but it lacks a sense of thematic resolution, a moment of truth. It tells a decent story well enough, but what does it want to say?

175,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-christopher-robin,"Fri, 03 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Christopher Robin’,"“It must be hard to imagine your father as a child,” Christopher’s wife, Evelyn (Hayley Atwell), says to their daughter, Madeline (Bronte Carmichael), in the most self-aware, ironic line of Marc Forster’s Christopher Robin.

For a Hollywood family film, something that seems even harder is imagining a father as an actual adult.

As played by Ewan McGregor in the latest exercise in Disney brand management, Christopher Robin is all grown up, but he’s not really an adult. (The name “Milne” isn’t mentioned; in this universe, “Robin” is his surname, not his middle name.)

I want to say Christopher is a family-film stereotype of a man who has grown up the wrong way, having lost all touch with what’s important in life, except he isn’t thought out clearly enough to be much of a character at all.

You know the type I mean: the man caught up in work and grown-up things who has no clue how to be there for his loved ones, until at last he learns a valuable lesson about play, imagination and/or family time.

In honor of the dad in Mary Poppins, we could call stories like this “Let’s Go Fly a Kite” movies, though Pooh fans will not be surprised that, instead of a kite, Christopher Robin has a balloon. (I thought about calling them “Cat’s in the Cradle” movies, but on a hunch, I Googled it. Sure enough, TV Tropes already thought of that, though the site’s preferred label is “When You Coming Home, Dad?”)

When such movies are done well, you get, say, The Incredibles or John Favreau’s Chef. When they aren’t, you get Jim Carrey in Mr. Popper’s Penguins or Steven Spielberg’s Hook — possibly the closest analogy for Christopher Robin, though Hook, for all its flaws, was clearly a personal film for Spielberg, whereas Christopher Robin feels cobbled together from bits and pieces of other movies without a cogent vision of its own.

At any rate, until Winnie the Pooh and the rest of Christopher Robin’s childhood friends show up to help him recover his childlike spirit, we’re stuck with a story in which, when Madeline asks for a bedtime story, Christopher Robin idiotically begins reading a dry British history text instead of something like Treasure Island, which is what Madeline really wants to hear.

Christopher also wants to send Madeline to the very best boarding school, which is not what Evelyn and Madeline want.

All the same, Madeline has absorbed some of her father’s work ethic; when Evelyn suggests that Madeline go out and play, Madeline embraces it as an assignment, and an opportunity to achieve, and is nonplused by her mother’s suggestion that she instead simply have fun. (She winds up pretending to play tennis with the balloon — and imagining herself winning Wimbledon.)

Most centrally, to Evelyn and Madeline’s crushing disappointment, Christopher has bailed on a promised family outing to his old countryside cottage in Sussex in order to work over the weekend on a big presentation for his London office on Monday. Notably, Christopher works at Winslow Luggage as an efficiency expert, an occupation that can function as Hollywood shorthand for a soulless corporate cog.

“If I work really hard now,” Christopher tries to explain, “in the future our lives will be ...”

“Impressive? Worse?” Evelyn interrupts. “We don’t care. We want you.”

In the midst of this too-familiar exchange, Christopher seems so caught up in the presumed plot tropes that he’s forgotten to mention a crucial fact: The callous boss (Mark Gatiss) who dropped this assignment on him earlier that day plans to fire a bunch of good people unless Christopher can figure out how to save their jobs by Monday.

“Your father promised these people good jobs after the war!” Christopher pleads, sounding not at all like a corporate cog without a soul. “They’d do anything for this company! I’d do anything for this company.”

So on the one hand Christopher Robin wants to be a movie about a London executive caught up in his work when he should be playing with his daughter in the country, reliving the magic of his childhood days; but on the other hand, it’s saddled him with a genuinely noble mission.

I’m reminded of a thoughtful line in P.J. Hogan’s flawed but interesting 2003 take on Peter Pan, in which the much ridiculed figure of Mr. Darling gets a remarkably sympathetic tribute from his wife.

Mary Darling tells her daughter Wendy that her father is a brave man. Since this version of George Darling is a rather milquetoast figure much put upon by his co-workers, this requires some explanation, so Mary continues:

“There are many different kinds of bravery. There’s the bravery of thinking of others before oneself. Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens. But he’s made many sacrifices for his family and put away many dreams.”

Continuing in a poignant, poetic mode that almost sounds like A.A. Milne, but much more like J.M. Barrie, Mrs. Darling adds that he put his dreams away “in a drawer. And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them. But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer. He does. And that is why he is brave.”

That is an actual idea, one with real poignancy, about adulthood and fatherhood and loss — something lacking in Christopher Robin. Actual ideas, I mean.

Like Forster’s own Peter Pan-themed movie, the J.M. Barrie biopic Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is handsomely appointed and mounted, with a lovely sepia-toned limited-animation prologue and flipping storybook pages with chapter heads like “In Which Christopher Robin Gets Some Sad News” moving the story through an opening montage from Christopher Robin’s last party in the Hundred-Acre Wood to boarding school, the death of his father, marriage, the war, and so on.

Also like Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is full of melancholy and a wan approximation of the whimsical spirit of its literary inspiration. (As a point of comparison, the 2011 reboot The Muppets, with Jason Siegel and Amy Adams, had a similar melancholy tone, but nailed the whimsy.)

Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are sufficiently themselves to arouse our affections for these beloved characters, whether we know and love them principally from the A.A. Milne stories or from the best Disney cartoons, including the classic anthology The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and the latter-day 2011 Winnie the Pooh.

I love them both, and I’m glad that Christopher Robin doesn’t entirely take its bearings from the cartoons.

For one thing, while Jim Cummings continues his dead-on impressions of Sterling Holloway’s Pooh and Paul Winchell’s Tigger, no great effort has been made to reproduce the other familiar voices. I also appreciate that Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are rendered not as computer-animated animals, like Paddington, but as well-worn stuffed animals. (Rabbit and Owl, on the other hand, are real creatures of the Hundred-Acre Wood.)

On the other hand, the characters often sound like they’re just reprising their greatest hits. Many lines are familiar, although the film’s mantra, “Doing Nothing often leads to the very best Something,” is a suitably Milne-esque epigram that seems original to the film.

The 2011 Winnie the Pooh included a chapter about dealing with a nonexistent Heffalump, and in Christopher Robin, there’s a digression about battling a nonexistent Woozle — though the film winds up tagging Christopher’s boss at Winslow Luggage as a real-life Woozle.

Here’s the thing: Christopher already knew his boss was (semantics aside) a Woozle. He was resisting him from the outset. Why isn’t that worthy, too? Because he wasn’t confident and goofy while he did it? Give me the bravery of the 2003 Peter Pan’s Mr. Darling any day.

When a movie like Christopher Robin works, you want to surrender to its magic. I sat down to Christopher Robin hoping to surrender. Fifteen minutes in, I wanted to stage an intervention with the characters, which is not what happens when a movie like this works.

Reviewing Paddington 2, I observed that not only was Hollywood unable to make such movies, no one there really wanted to. For details, see Christopher Robin.

Caveat Spectator: Fleeting war action; slapstick humor. Kids and up.","As played by Ewan McGregor in the latest exercise in Disney brand management, Christopher Robin is all grown up, but he’s not really an adult.
And that is why he is brave.”That is an actual idea, one with real poignancy, about adulthood and fatherhood and loss — something lacking in Christopher Robin.

Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures

Article content Everywhere from Windsor, to Cornwall, to Thunder Bay, voters will be marking their “X” next to the name of their preferred mayoral candidates and local representatives. But, there’s another, often overlooked elected office voters will have the opportunity to decide on. And, given the controversy surrounding school closures and sexual health education over the past year, the role of school board trustee may be getting more attention from voters come election day. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Rural candidates for trustees in SDG motivated over school closures Back to video Trustees represent the interests of their constituents on any of the four publicly funded school boards. They are not involved in the day-to-day aspect of running and managing a school, but do work heavily with the province, parents, educators, and students on many important matters that affect our communities. Voters in Cornwall won’t have much of a say in who their trustees are, for better or worse. All incumbents on the English public, English Catholic, French public, and French Catholic boards who represent Cornwall were acclaimed. In fact, all of the French-speaking trustees across Cornwall and SDG are acclaimed.

Article content However, in some rural communities, the race for trustee for the Upper Canada District School Board could be more high profile than most years. In Stormont and Glengarry, there will be an exciting three-way race. The incumbent will not be seeking re-election, leaving the job open. The Mayor of South Stormont, Jim Bancroft, who will be leaving the council table this fall, hopes to continuing serving with the school board. “I feel comfortable that it’s time to move on,” said Bancroft. “I hope the community will recognize that I care about the community, I believe our schools need to be represented as strong as we can.” He will be challenged by former student trustee Marshal Wilson. Wilson was involved with the board through the school closure process, which he credits as the main reason for why he became so intimately involved in the role. “The one thing that differentiates me, in my mind and with most people I talk to, is the type of experience I have,” said Wilson. “There’s no real learning curve for me. I’m already familiar with how the board works.” Also in the running in Stormont and Glengarry is John Danaher. Danaher is a retired principal, and has been familiar with the workings of the UCDSB for most of his life. He also has nine grandchildren currently in school. “Unfortunately education is very political,” said Danaher. “I think with the school closures, and I think with what’s coming forth with the change of [Provincial] government, if there are changes there, we have to be ready to work with them.”

Article content English public school voters in North Dundas and South Dundas will also have a choice to make come election day. Jeremy Armer, who could not be reached for comment at the time of publication, will be challenged by retired local principal Larry Berry. “I threw my name in because I’d like to be involved in education, I’m positive towards the board, I’m not axe-grinding. It’s a positive bid to become the trustee,” said Berry. Berry wanted to see someone become a staunch supporter of the smaller, rural schools in his district. He also wants to see boards support regular classroom teachers better, and encourage more physical activity among students, something he strongly supported during his time as an educator. Dundas voters (North and South) will also have the opportunity to elect a trustee to the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario, along with voters in Stormont who they share a district with. Incumbent Karen McAllister will be running against Donna Neilsen.

177,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

Mr Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, the Minister of Health, has warned that Ghana risked not achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Three, if access to Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Rights of People with Disabilities (PWDs), were overlooked.

Mr Agyeman-Manu, whose address was read on his behalf at a stakeholder’s forum on Improving Universal Access to SHR and Rights of PWDs, called for a conscious effort to target the numerous barriers that confronted these groups of persons in order to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.

He also called on Civil Society Organisations and all other health partners to intensify their advocacies for the review of the Disability Act, Act 715 of 2006, to clearly spell out the SRH and Rights for PWDs, and to compel service providers to recognize these groups as the beneficiaries of Rights to the services.

He mentioned that gaps and barriers, such as physical, educational, economical and communication continue to exist, affecting over 50 per cent of PWDs.

He said access to specific health services, including cancer screening and Family Planning were abysmal among this group of people, leading to increased morbidity and preventable deaths.

The forum, which was organised by the Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights (ARHR), in partnership with the French Embassy in Accra, was therefore to set the stage for a national dialogue, to come up with a comprehensive strategic policy guidelines for promoting the sexual Rights of PWDs.

Mr Agyeman-Manu explained that the SDG-3, had specific targets to ensure access to SRH care and UHC, stressing that, “Ghana will not realise its SDG-3 target if SRH needs of PWDs are not adequately addressed through a robust financial mechanism and an effective Primary Health Care System”.

He said such a move would facilitate the increased access covering the delivery of health care for these and other marginalized groups.

He also pointed out that although the country was a signatory to a number of International Conventions on Disability Rights, and had its own internal Constitutional and legal frameworks, as well as the Persons with Disability Act, 2006 Act 715, PWDs continue to be marginalised and abused by society.

Mr Agyeman-Manu said PWDs, continued to experience stigmatization and deprivation of their SRH and Rights, which prevented their effective progress in society and limit their full participation in mainstream activities on equal basis with others.

Studies, he said, had revealed that in Ghana, PWDs, particularly the hearing and visually impaired, as well as the physically challenged, were increasingly vulnerable to abuses such as rape, defilement, sexual harassment and assault, and also lacked access to SRH information services.

They were also often abused by health service providers and institutions of care, who failed to provide them with SRH information to enable them to make informed and independent decisions of their own, he said.

He said the government however recognised the critical role of the health system to achieving national development, hence its vision to ensure that the rights to good health for all Ghanaians would be guaranteed through a systemic health sector with sustainable capacity to deliver affordable, equitable and easily assessable service to all.

The Health Minister said to realise this, the government hoped to expand health promotion locally, scale up disease prevention strategies and improve access to curative and emergency services through vigorous human resource and health infrastructure development, and strengthening of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

These strategies would ensure that Primary Health Care (PHC) was available to all citizens, taking into consideration the findings from the Household and Facility Care study.

He also commended the efforts of the ARHRs, the French Embassy and other partners, for organizing the forum, and pledged the Ministry’s readiness to adopt the recommendations.

This would form relevant decision making in the health sector and contribute to the SRH needs of PWDs, and collectively strengthen its collaboration with all stakeholders to improve these needs.”

Ms Vicky Okine, the Executive Director, ARHR, said the forum was to explore effective ways to address the present gaps and remove the various barriers, including cultural, religious, attitudinal and infrastructural obstacles.

A study on stigma-related issues affecting PWDs in accessing SHR, revealed that it was a serious setback towards the interventions being made to improve the health rights and needs of these group.

It called for the strict enforcement of legislation to improve unfriendly facilities such as toilets, and also hospital environment, to aid their movements, ensure privacy and confidentiality of the private information of PWDs in order to boost their confidence in health service delivery.

It also requested for the development of a comprehensive public advocacy and education, improvement in the cost of SRH services to make them affordable to PWDs, and also that such information be made inclusive.

The participants called for the generation of desegregated data on PWD’s to facilitate targeted interventions and services.

181,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-presents-framework-for-ensuring-no-one-is-left-behind/,"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Presents Framework for Ensuring No One is Left Behind,"9 August 2018: A UN Development Programme (UNDP) discussion paper looks at what leaving no one behind means in practice. The authors note that ensuring that no one will be left behind entails “taking explicit action to end extreme poverty, curb inequalities, confront discrimination,” as well as fast-tracking progress for those who are most marginalized.

The UNDP paper titled, ‘What Does It Mean to Leave No One Behind?,’ aims to stimulate dialogue and help generate consensus on delivering the leave no one behind agenda. The authors distinguish absolute deprivation from relative disadvantage, but note that both hinder peoples’ choices and capabilities to participate in or benefit from human development. The paper asserts that the disadvantages people face can be understood through a framework of five factors:

the discrimination they face;

where they live (geography);

socio-economic status;

how they are governed; and

vulnerability to shocks.

The paper also highlights the importance of intersectionality, as multiple factors often lead to a combination of disadvantages. Given the complex, multi-dimensional nature of poverty, the paper makes the case for a “holistic response” that “considers the severity and overlaps between different types of deprivation.” The authors also assert that all countries – even while data sets may be incomplete – have “some degree of evidence” of each of the five types of disadvantages.

By looking at these factors and three “mutually reinforcing levers,” the paper outlines how UNDP can support countries to: examine why people are left behind; empower those people; and enact change through policies, reforms and other interventions. Given the urgency of SDG achievement and leaving no one behind, the authors call for acting simultaneously on all three levers of change.

Within these workstreams, UNDP is undertaking assessments to gather evidence and strengthen national capacities, expanding opportunities for civil society, and building local governance systems that reduce inequality and exclusion. The framework is intended to inform both UN Country Teams’ public-facing work and that of national partners, as well as “the manner in which UNDP designs, implements, monitors and evaluates” projects.

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner previewed some of the framework’s learnings during a side event at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including the notion that “averages hide a lot of very brutal truth.” Convened by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the event reviewed 86 countries’ readiness to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda. Steiner also underscored that “we are not starting from zero,” as the development community has years of understanding on the issue, which has informed related UNDP initiatives such as the agency’s Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) work, which supports partner countries in their efforts to implement the SDGs.

The HLPF also featured a set of eight Voluntary National Review (VNR) Labs convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), with Lab 2 focusing on leaving no one behind. Feeding into the Labs, the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) released publications related to the concept of leave no one behind.

182,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/taiwan-launches-2018-sdg-progress-report/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Taiwan Launches 2018 SDG Progress Report,"18 September 2018: Thomas Chan, Taiwan’s Deputy Minister of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), launched Taiwan’s 2018 Report on the SDG implementation during a workshop held in New York. The report responds to the main theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies – and reviews Taiwan’s implementation of the six SDGs reviewed by the HLPF in 2018.



Taiwan launched a Voluntary National Review on the SDGs on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, US, in September 2017. During the launch, EPA Minister Lee Ying-yuan said Taiwan will promote sustainable development, implement the SDGs in a timely manner, and share the results of global partnership with the international community. He also urged other countries to work with Taiwan in pursuit of sustainable development for the world and all humankind.

The 2018 Report on SDG Implementation addresses issues and concerns raised by the participants of seven public fora held in Taiwan by the National Council for Sustainable Development in 2017 and 2018, focusing on six issues identified as priorities: smart water resources management; sustainable energy transformation; clean air; sustainable materials management and the circular economy; ecological conservation and green networks; and international partnerships for the SDGs. The report’s analysis sets out Taiwan’s vision for these issues, exploring their current status and describing measures to be taken.

In addition, the report indicates that the National Council for Sustainable Development, which is chaired by the Premier, is formulating Taiwan’s own sustainable development goals, with the SDGs as its reference. To implement Taiwan’s SDGs, the report says the government will work with other countries to realize the official SDGs and will set down more ambitious targets for Taiwan’s sustainable development than those enshrined in the SDGs.

Taiwan’s SDGs comprise 18 goals, 143 targets, and 342 indicators. The 18 goals are:

Strengthen social care services and economic security for the disadvantaged

End hunger, ensure food safety, and promote sustainable agriculture

Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages

Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Ensure environmental quality and sustainable management of environmental resources

Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

Build an affordable, safe, environmentally friendly, resilient, and sustainable transportation structure

Reduce inequality within Taiwan, and between Taiwan and other countries

Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Improve adaptive actions to combat climate change and its impacts

Conserve and sustainably use the marine ecosystems, and prevent the degradation of marine environment

Conserve and sustainably use terrestrial ecosystems to ensure the persistence of biodiversity and prevent land degradation

Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable inclusive institutions

Establish diversified partnerships and work together to advance a sustainable vision

Build a nuclear-free homeland by 2025

During an interview on 18 September 2018, Chan highlighted Taiwan’s achievements against these goals, including the reduction of both household and industrial waste by 80% and biodiversity conservation, with eight of Taiwan’s species previously on the endangered list no longer endangered. He also noted Taiwan’s Electricity Act that states that, by 2025, nuclear power generation equipment should be completely shut down and the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix should reach 20%. [SDG Knowledge Hub sources]","18 September 2018: Thomas Chan, Taiwan’s Deputy Minister of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), launched Taiwan’s 2018 Report on the SDG implementation during a workshop held in New York.
The report responds to the main theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies – and reviews Taiwan’s implementation of the six SDGs reviewed by the HLPF in 2018.

183,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-2030-strategy-and-global-partnership-initiative-for-youth/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches 2030 Strategy and Global Partnership Initiative for Youth,"24 September: A day before the opening of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level General Debate, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres unveiled Youth 2030, a strategy reflecting the UN’s new commitment to working with and for young people. Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

The awards event took place at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, with the ceremony hosted by Loyiso Madinga, a South African comedian from The Daily Show. Madinga and other speakers emphasized the uniquely important role of young people in solving problems and bringing people together, and of reaching across generations.

Johar’s poem was featured in a film, ‘We the Goalkeepers,’ screened at the start of the awards night. The poem concludes, “Because when you’re too tired of waiting on others/ to save the day/ You stand tall, and show that saving the world/ is child’s play.”

Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Progress Award to Dysmus Kusilu, founder of Solar Freeze. Kusilu said that growing up in Kenya, he was taught that to work in agriculture is to be a failure. Gaining inspiration from his “sweet grandmother and her sacrifices,” he decided to turn failure into success by inventing a pay-as-you-go service using mobile phones to help smallholder farmers store their produce more efficiently and increase their yields.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the audience of the UN’s launch of two youth initiatives earlier in the day: the Youth 2030 strategy and Generation Unlimited. She said the initiatives will put youth at the forefront of the UN’s work “in a more earnest way” than ever before. Among the areas of leadership shown by young people recently, she said the march towards gender equality and ending sexual harassment is “one of the loudest cries I’ve heard.”

Mohammed presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Changemaker Award to Nadia Murad, an advocate for the Yazidi community and genocide survivors. Murad said that following the 2014 attacks by ISIS to “ethnically cleanse” Iraq of Yazidis – during which Murad was abducted and enslaved – the majority of Yazidi people remain in IDP camps “in the same tents given to them in 2014.” Having lost her six brothers in the genocide and seen countless fellow Yazidi girls and women kidnapped, bought and sold, and disappeared, Murad said her survival “came with purpose, responsibility and hope.” However, hope “has an expiration date; it requires action to survive.” She said working together is the only way to heal after a genocidal campaign.

Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said the Generation Unlimited initiative aims to ensure that by 2030 every young person is in school or age-appropriate training. She presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Campaign Award to Amika George, a student who founded the #FreePeriods campaign and has built support for the idea of period poverty.

When George accepted the award, she told the audience that girls around the world her age and younger miss up to 20% of their school curriculum each year because they cannot afford menstrual products, and she campaigns to provide the products for free. She urged, “enough with the shame” and euphemisms that belittle menstruation, and cause social isolation and educational lags for girls in poverty.

Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, noted that the average age of the leaders, innovators and activists featured during the ceremony was 24 years old. He welcomed Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, praising her dedication to action for SDG 4 (quality education). Solberg spoke in her capacity as the co-chair of the UN Advocates for the SDGs to stress that “we need business with us” to reach the Goals.

The evening event also featured performances by Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter from the UK who performed against a backdrop of footage of himself and other Goalkeepers as babies and children, and Fatoumata Diawara, a singer-songwriter from Mali who was joined by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.

Among other activities, participants celebrated the winners of the Stockholm Water Prize and the Stockholm Junior Water Prize.

World Water Week attracted a record number of 3,700 participants. It opened with calls for nature-based solutions, such as “green infrastructure” in cities, to protect and restore water resources. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, in her opening address, highlighted ways to spread the risk from water-related disasters in a more equitable manner, and urged all concerned to be involved in actions for addressing the world’s water crisis.

Torgny Homgren, SIWI Executive Director, declared that water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world. Other speakers referred to examples where water scarcity has contributed to poverty, conflict, and the spread of waterborne diseases, as well as hindering access to education for women and girls.

The UNFCCC, in a press release, noted the pressures exerted by climate change on food security and health around the world, adding that water scarcity also calls into question the future of water-intensive energy production.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 launched a set of global baseline reports during World Water Week, bringing together work undertaken through the World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

On the proportion of wastewater that is safely treated (SDG indicator 6.3.1), the WHO and UN Habitat report that, based on data from 79 countries, only 59% of domestic wastewater is collected and safely treated, while insufficient information is available to estimate the level of industrial wastewater treatment.

Water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world, said SIWI Executive Director, Torgny Homgren.

On ambient water quality (SDG indicator 6.3.2), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) finds that, based on 52 submissions, more than half the water bodies assessed are of good quality. However, the authors propose mapping of trends in water quality to indicate whether water bodies are improving, stable or degrading, noting that it is not practical to set universal parameters of water quality.

Regarding progress on water-use efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) notes that average water-use efficiency currently stands at around US$15/m3 worldwide, though there are significant differences among countries and regions.

On the level of water stress (SDG indicator 6.4.2), FAO reports that water stress increased between 1996 and 2016 for most countries in the world, and has more than doubled in 26 countries, 15 of which are in Africa.

On the degree of integrated water resource management (IWRM) implementation (SDG indicator 6.5.1), UN Environment reports that 80% of countries have laid the foundations to establish IWRM, but that 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve the target of implementing IWRM at all levels by 2030 (SDG target 6.5). Hence, the report notes, multi-level coordination and collective, multi-stakeholder measures will be critical.

On the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement for water cooperation (SDG indicator 6.5.2), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) find insufficient progress, and propose undertaking joint projects that alleviate poverty and conflict, in tandem with water-related objectives.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG indicator 6.6.1), a report published by UN Environment on behalf of UN-Water notes that, while severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 is slow. The report calls for “significantly upscaling” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

World Water Week celebrated innovations in the field of water treatment. Stockholm Water Prize laureates Bruce Rittmann and Mark van Loosdrecht were recognized for their work in biotechnology-based processes to treat drinking water and waste water, while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment. A ceremony highlighted the contribution of the two scientists to better understanding how microorganisms can transform organic pollutants in water. Kartik Chandran, World Water Prize Committee, noted in a blog post the potential of environmental biotechnology not only for improving drinking water and recycling or purifying wastewater, but also in interacting with complex biological systems to enable the achievement of goals in energy, food, and human health.

Also honored during World Water Week were the winners of the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, Caleb Liow Jia Le and Johnny Xiao Hong Yu from Singapore. The two teenagers have developed a way to produce reduced grapheme oxide, which can purify water, using locally available durian rind and sugarcane fiber.

186,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iucn-launches-alliance-for-freshwater/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IUCN Launches Alliance for Freshwater,"6 September 2018: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has launched a global network aimed at halting and reversing the ongoing freshwater biodiversity loss crisis. Its core focus is to develop a global community of practice for freshwater biodiversity conservation in order to foster collaborations for the design and implementation of large‐scale conservation actions.

The ‘Alliance for Freshwater Life’ was launched by the IUCN Freshwater Biodiversity Unit during the World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden. The initiative is an interdisciplinary network of scientists, conservation professionals, educators, policy experts, creative practitioners, and citizens working to improve the conservation and sustainable use of freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity.

The Alliance published a paper titled, ‘A Global Call to Unite Efforts for Freshwater Biodiversity Science and Conservation,’ as a manifesto for positive action for freshwater biodiversity conservation and policy. The paper outlines the Alliance’s vision of a global collaboration between national and international organizations as well as individuals.

The publication notes that freshwater vertebrate populations have declined by more than 80% over the past 50 years, a rate of decline twice that recorded for either marine or terrestrial systems. According to the article, approximately one third of the 28,000 freshwater species assessed for the IUCN Red List are threatened with extinction, while an estimated three quarters of the world’s inland natural wetlands were lost during the 20th century.

The sacrifice of freshwater life as “collateral damage” in global development can result in the destruction of the very ecosystems required to support the development objectives.

The paper highlights that the SDGs include targets: to protect and restore water‐related ecosystems (Target 6.1); to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, and their services (Target 15.1); and to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species (Target 15.5). The targets are for delivery in 2030 (6.1) and, “alarmingly,” as early as 2020 (15.1 and 15.5).

The authors identify two key drivers of the ongoing crisis of freshwater biodiversity loss: the significant growth in global demand for water resources over the last century, which led to widespread freshwater habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and over-abstractions; and the fact that existing environmental policies do not adequately protect freshwater biodiversity and ecosystems.

Noting that global demands for drinking water, hydropower, and agriculture will increase significantly in coming decades, the publication cautions that the “human valuation and usefulness” of freshwaters are often foregrounded in environmental policy, at the detriment of non-human life. The authors explain that this often leads to the sacrifice of freshwater life as “collateral damage” in global development, which can result in the destruction of the very ecosystems required to support the development objectives.

The paper outlines five key areas of work to be undertaken by the Alliance to raise the public and political profile of freshwater issues: research, data, conservation, education and outreach, and policy. Where policies are already in place, the authors note, such as the SDGs or the water‐related Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Alliance will help to make available the relevant scientific knowledge and highlight the importance of functioning freshwater ecosystems for fulfilling other related SDGs, such as poverty alleviation (SDG 1).

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

The publication titled, ‘Progress on Water-related Ecosystems: Piloting the Monitoring Methodology and Initial Findings for SDG Indicator 6.6.1,’ finds that, over the past 100 years, the world is estimated to have lost half its natural wetlands and with this a significant number of freshwater species.

The report emphasizes the value of monitoring and reporting progress on SDG target 6.6, which aims to, “by 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes” through indicator 6.6.1 (tracking changes in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time), while considering the current state and trends of the world’s water-related ecosystems. The publication presents the first collection of country results that were gathered during the pilot testing of the indicator 6.6.1 methodology, including the use of globally available data from Earth observations. It also outlines how the methodology has evolved through its piloting phase, documenting the lessons learned from country outreach activities into an Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs (IAEG-SDG) Tier II indicator methodology.

The publication finds that severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people. The loss in natural wetlands is estimated at 42% in Africa, 32% in Asia, 35% in Europe, 59% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 17% in North America, and 12% in Oceania.

Countries should “significantly upscale” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

According to the report, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 data is slow. It explains that the piloting phase for indicator 6.6.1 revealed significant capacity challenges in monitoring and reporting the changes within water-related ecosystems. It highlights that satellite-based data have an important role to play in filling data gaps, and thus can support decision making in advancing national progress towards achieving target 6.6. The publication underscores that countries should “significantly upscale” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

The report is one of a series of seven reports launched during World Water Week that track progress towards the various targets of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

The articles cover topics that do not always feature prominently when discussing SDG implementation, such as disarmament and sexual violence. Pramila Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, highlights gender-based violence, which she describes as the “missing dimension” of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Patten links sexual violence to a human rights-based approach and the “leave no one behind” principle. She notes that “when war erupts, and the threat of rape at gunpoint becomes a pervasive terror,” women are unable to access fields, marketplaces and water points, and that girls are unable to attend school. Patten further highlights the disproportionate economic and health impacts of war on women, connecting to the majority of the SDGs. She also flags the importance of time: whereas men can invest hours in work, education or civic engagement, women—especially in developing countries—are often burdened with unpaid labor such as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Patten closes by calling on countries to legislate gender equality not only as a moral and social justice imperative, but also a smart economic choice.

Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, discusses the nexus between disarmament, arms control and development, outlining the linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and noting that the issue and its connection to development are not new. She references Article 26 of the UN Charter and points readers to the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament launched on 24 May 2018, which aims to take the issue out of its “narrow, isolated security lens.” Nakamitsu stresses the importance of disarmament to achieving SDG targets 16.1 (reduce all forms of violence and related death rates) and 16.a (develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions), and flags that disarmament is explicitly recognized in SDG target 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows). She also draws linkages to Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), (5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed follows by arguing that success on the SDGs will be “measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind.” Doing so, she notes, entails providing a voice and platform for meaningful participation and engagement, particularly by the most marginalized and vulnerable. To make this a reality, Mohammed calls for six elements to be put in place, including: making the SDGs better known in society; investing in more transparent and accountable institutions; creating appropriate spaces for young people and fostering their ideas and leadership potential; and connecting overlapping agendas.

Additional articles cover sexual health and reproductive rights, rule of law and sustainable human settlements, among other topics. The authors are:

The event took place on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting focused on three priorities for scaling up financing for the SDGs: aligning global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda; enhancing sustainable financing strategies; and seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

Opening the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that while efforts to achieve peace require a surge in diplomacy, efforts to achieve the SDGs require a surge in financing and investments. He stressed the need for women to have equal access, be equally represented in decision making, and be equally considered in how investments are made. The Secretary-General proposed focusing on the following objectives:

All developed countries must meet the commitments they made in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development;

We must continue to support developing countries in creating conditions for mobilizing domestic resources, including tax reform and other good governance measures; and

We need to step up efforts in developing innovative financing and in mobilizing private investment.

Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, announced that the IMF has done analytical work to see what it will take for low-income developing countries to meet the SDGs, looking at five areas that are critical for sustainable and inclusive growth: education, health, water and sanitation, roads, and electricity. She said countries investing in these sectors will address deficits in human capital and physical infrastructure, which represent a drag on their income and future prosperity. Lagarde cautioned that debt burdens are rising, with 40% of low-income developing countries being now at high risk of debt distress or in debt distress. She also emphasized that foreign aid remains crucial, and preferably takes the form of grants. She said advanced economies can do more, and can better target their aid budgets to support countries most in need. She highlighted that while budget conditions are tight in many advanced economies, returns on well-targeted aid—in terms of poverty reduction, job creation, and improving security and stability—are very high.

Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, underscored that investments should focus on the best return in the long term, rather than the best return in the short term. He called for securing more solid flows of capital to the most vulnerable countries and sectors, such as infrastructure, which will bring key long-term returns.

Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, said small island developing States (SIDS) should be at the frontline of fighting climate change instead of being the victims of climate change, but they do not have the resources. She called for a hospitable and equitable international environment, supportive of SIDS’ needs and priorities. Jusuf Kalla, Vice President of Indonesia, invited a focus on enhancing the performance of national economy.

Laurence D. Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted that 35% of today’s workforce is comprised of millennials, who have made it clear that they want to work for purpose-driven companies, and the SDGs provide the companies with an opportunity to respond to that demand. Emphasizing the need for better data on sustainability, Fink said that as more companies report on sustainability, data will improve and more capital will flow into sustainability.

Robin Shanahan, CEO of PIMCO, said the SDGs provide capital markets with the objectives they need to align themselves with sustainable development. She emphasized the importance of sustainable development bonds.

Mark Wilson, CEO of Aviva Group, underscored the need for transparent, consistent, free, and simple benchmarks that actually measure the SDGs. He highlighted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance to that end. The World Benchmarking Alliance was launched on the evening of 25 September 2018. It is funded by Aviva, the Index Initiative, and the UN Foundation.

Philippe Le Houérou, International Finance Corporation (IFC) CEO, called for being more proactive in approaching investors rather than waiting to be approached by investors. He recommended using ODA to leverage private investment and strengthen domestic markets to attract investors, explaining that if we “don’t create but destroy markets,” we will not go from billions to trillions but from billions to millions, and fail in SDG implementation.

Bill Gates, Founder, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, emphasized that the financial system needs to evolve to support developing countries, with foreign aid being a fundamental pillar. While they are not a substitute for public investment, he said private sector and foundations can help as well. He explained that philanthropic foundation can: use challenge grants to seek innovate approaches to deep-seated challenges; de-risk investments; partner with others (such as development banks) to scale up successful projects; and increase the impact of innovative collaborations, an example of which is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Financial inclusion for women is imperative, as women choose to invest in exactly the issues the SDGs are about.

Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank Group, said the Bank is working on the launch of a youth bond to connect financial markets with the purpose embedded in the SDGs. Mary Ellen Iskenderian, CEO of Women’s World Banking, emphasized that financial inclusion for women is imperative, as studies show that women choose to invest exactly in the issues the SDGs are about.

Ashish Thakkar, Founder, Mara Group, noted that digitalization will be key to formalizing the informal sector. He also highlighted the need to give access to finance to women and youth entrepreneurs, to that end. He announced that the Mara Group will produce the first quality, affordable, African-made smart phones to enable this.

In the ensuing discussion, participants raised issues related to: the need for regional integration, especially in Africa; strengthening governance institutions to improve the business environment; the potential of pension funds to provide needed investments in the SDGs; the need to support fragile states; the need for a global corporate tax reform that makes companies pay their fair contributions; the increase of public risks from private investments; and the need to invest in women.

Closing the meeting, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), underlined that investment in sustainable development reduces volatility. He said while the UN cannot invest, it provides a vehicle for promoting the momentum to invest in the SDGs and is committed to providing impartial support to Member States. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed noted three key messages from the meeting: domestic resources are important; the return of investments in the 2030 Agenda “go a very long way”; and reaching everyone requires that we be innovative.

The report highlights that the positive effects of secondary school education for girls include near-elimination of child marriage.

The publication titled, ‘Missed Opportunities: The High Cost of Not Educating Girls,’ reports that fewer than two-thirds of girls in low-income countries complete primary school, and only one in three girls completes lower secondary school. SDG target 4.1 calls for ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030.

On average, the report notes, women who have a secondary education are more likely to work and they earn almost twice as much as those with no education. Secondary school education for girls also brings the near elimination of child marriage, lowers fertility rates by one-third in countries with high population growth, and reduces child mortality and malnutrition. In addition, the report highlights that women with secondary education are less likely to experience intimate partner violence, report higher levels of psychological well-being, and have healthier children who are more likely to go to school and learn.

Over the past 20 years, many countries have reached universal primary education, with girls’ enrollment at the primary level in developing countries rivaling that of boys. However, the report notes, larger benefits of education would come from completing secondary school.

In order to reap the full benefits of education, the publication recommends that countries improve both access to and quality of education for girls, and implement policies to support healthy economic growth that will generate jobs for an expanding educated workforce. It underlines that investments in the education system are especially crucial in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 40% of girls complete lower secondary school.

192,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-gender-equality-strategy-addresses-structural-barriers-to-sdg-5/,"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Gender Equality Strategy Addresses Structural Barriers to SDG 5,"6 September 2018: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) announced its Third Gender Equality Strategy, which is aligned with the 2030 Agenda and covers the period 2018-2021. The strategy outlines how UNDP will “elevate and integrate” gender equality across all of its work.

UNDP’s Third Gender Equality Strategy outlines four priorities to address structural barriers to gender equality. The priorities are:

removing structural barriers to women’s economic empowerment, including women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid work;

preventing and responding to gender-based violence;

promoting women’s participation and leadership in all forms of decision-making; and

strengthening gender-responsive strategies in conflict and disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery.

Improving women’s access to productive resources could reduce the number of hungry people by 12-17% globally.

The four-year strategy provides evidence on how gender equality accelerates development. For instance, when women participate in peace agreements as negotiators, mediators, signatories or witnesses, peace agreements are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years. In another example, if women have the same access to productive resources as men, women would increase their farm yields by 20-30%, which would then increase the total agricultural output for developing countries by 2.5-4% annually and reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17%.

The strategy includes an annex on lessons learned from implementation of UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017. The key lessons – which the 2018-2021 aims to address – include the importance of addressing structural barriers to gender equality, ranging from legal and institutional to attitudinal and societal barriers, and tackling structural challenges, including care responsibilities that prevent women from equally participating in the economy. Other lessons learned include the need to mainstream gender equality in climate action and crisis resilience, an area in which UNDP intends to focus more attention in its new strategy. The strategy calls for integrating gender equality and women’s participation at the earliest stages possible and for creating opportunities for women to contribute to and participate in sustainable livelihoods in ways that improve outcomes for them and their families. UNDP will launch guidance for country offices on how to improve their work on fragility and recovery from a gender lens.

The 2018-2021 strategy calls for working more closely with civil society and the private sector, including by creating space and opportunities for women’s organizations and networks. The strategy recognizes the role of the private sector in creating a decent work environment for women and changing behaviors, values and norms. To advance this work, the strategy identifies two initiatives: the Private Sector Seal, a certification program for companies; and the Inclusion and Equitable Development Programme, which will work to unlock public and private investments in gender sensitive projects at the local level in least developed countries (LDCs).

Introducing the Third Strategy to the UNDP Executive Board, Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UNDP, emphasized the central role of gender equality in the 2030 Agenda. In addition to SDG 5, he said gender equality is reflected in 36 SDG targets and 54 SDG indicators across the Global Goals. Dieye stressed that gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential in ensuring that no one is left behind, and said UNDP will work to ensure gender equality is part of all its development efforts. As part of this effort, the UNDP Administrator plans to sign on as an International Gender Champion, while senior managers throughout UNDP are expected to champion gender equality in meetings and speeches and ensure gender balance in panels and missions.

UNDP notes that the strategy is consistent with the Common Chapter of the strategic plans of UNDP, UN Women, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), as well as with direction received from the UN’s Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR).

UNDP and UN Women have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on strengthened collaboration. Key areas of cooperation in the MOU include: policy and legal reforms to advance gender equality; economic empowerment; mobilizing the private sector to advance gender equality; women’s political leadership; gender based-violence; and crises/post-crises response and early recovery.

Children are most at risk in their first year, with the highest risk being among newborns in their first month of life. Based on current trends, the authors anticipate that about half the countries in the world will not achieve SDG targets on child mortality by 2030, but only after 2050.



The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Population Division of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the World Bank collaborated on the child mortality report, which shows uneven progress, although child survival has improved among all age groups since the year 2000. Children in the poorest households are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from the richest. Rural children are more at risk than urban children, and the children of mothers without any education are 2.6 times more likely to die before reaching the age of five, compared to the children of mothers with high school or tertiary-level education.

Environmental factors also influence child mortality. For example, exposure to air pollution is a factor in higher mortality levels among children under the age of one, the Group reports.

The agencies note that child mortality has declined in recent years, especially in children between one and four years old, where it declined by 60% between the years 2000 and 2017. Deaths of children under one year declined by 51% during the same period, while the rate for children aged 5-14 declined by 37%. However, in many places improvements are insufficient for meeting the 2030 deadline.

The report contains charts detailing progress by region and subregion, and calls for concerted efforts, investments and innovative approaches to accelerate progress, particularly in countries and communities that are falling behind.

The step-by-step guide titled, ‘Strengthening the Business Case for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: How to Measure Value for Your Business,’ enables companies to calculate the business value of WASH interventions and estimate their financial return on investment (ROI).

Launching the guide, WaterAid cited estimates that every US$1 invested in sanitation returns US$5.5 in increased productivity, and every US$1 invested in drinking water supply returns US$2.

The non-governmental organization (NGO) stated that progressive companies now view WASH as a “core business” priority, rather than considering it a part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or philanthropic action. For example, ensuring better WASH services results in fewer worker sick days and greater efficiency of operations. The guide seeks to meet the need of companies to provide robust evidence of the financial value of investing in WASH.

WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, and greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains.

Previous research conducted by WaterAid showed that, while many multi-national companies did have WASH policies in the workplace, there was typically less attention given to WASH in the supply chain and in workers’ homes.

The guide proposes six steps for measuring the business value of WASH interventions: 1) understanding the “impact pathway” in terms of the anticipated outcomes and impacts for people, communities and businesses; 2) identifying what to measure and how; 3) establishing a baseline; 4) implementing and monitoring WASH interventions; 5) analyzing data and measuring benefits; and 6) communicating the results.

The agency notes that WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains, and better stakeholder relationships for companies.

The guide was created and published in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Many other companies and international organizations contributed to developing the guide, including Diageo, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Sainsbury’s, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and CARE International, among others.

The survey is the “only global report” that assesses e-government development status of all UN Member States, according to the authors. It measures e-government effectiveness in the delivery of public services, and aims to enable countries to learn from each other, identify areas of strength and challenges in e-government and shape their policies and strategies in this area.

The 2018 edition of the survey titled, ‘Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies,’ seeks to provide analysis and evidence to “further utilize the potential of e-government” to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The survey examines: the preconditions and the enabling environment for mobilizing e-government to build resilient societies; e-resilience and building the resilience of e-government; global trends in e-government; regional development and country groupings performance; improving cities resilience and sustainability through e-government assessment; and fast-evolving technologies in e-government.

Among its conclusions, the survey notes that since 2014, all 193 UN Member States have been delivering some form of online presence. According to the 2018 E-Government Development Index (EGDI) − a composite index which assesses e-government development at the national level, including the provision of online services, telecommunication connectivity and human capacity − Denmark, Australia and the Republic of Korea lead the world in providing government services and information through the internet, followed by the UK, Sweden, Finland, Singapore, New Zealand, France and Japan. The survey also presents the findings of a pilot study on applying e-governance to local governments in 40 municipalities around the world. It lists as the top cities: Moscow, Russian Federation; Cape Town, South Africa; Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; Paris, France; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Seoul, Republic of Korea; Rome, Italy; and Warsaw, Poland. The EGDI is presented bi-annually by DESA.

Per the survey, since 2012, there is a “steady increase” in the number of country websites with information about specific programmes benefiting women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous people, and people living in poverty. The report indicates that a growing number of countries provides targeted online services to vulnerable groups: 86% in the Americas; 79% in Asia; 57% in Africa; and 15% in Oceania. However, despite some development gains and major investments in several countries, e-government and digital divides persist, it says. For instance, 14 countries in the Low EGDI group are African and belong to the least developed countries (LDCs). The survey also finds that insufficient training and accessibility and “e-illiteracy” are the most common barriers to e-government resilience.

The publication stresses that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are recognized as an enabler of all phases of disaster risk management, from prevention, reduction, and preparedness to respond and recover, and emphasizes the need to protect critical ICT infrastructure from disaster impacts. In addition, it states that inter-regional and global data sharing and coordination among concerned countries and regions are crucial, considering that some disasters such as floods, cyclones and typhoons, and droughts are transboundary in nature.

The survey was produced by the DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) in collaboration with UN regional commissions, UN agencies, and several international experts, researchers and related organizations. The E-Government Survey was first issued in 2001, and further editions were released in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

In the world of social enterprise and impact investing, perhaps the most universally accepted guide is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Introduced in 2015, the 17 inter-connected goals now form an organizing principle for many entrepreneurs, as well as investors.

At the same time, achieving those goals is going to cost trillions, literally, and won’t happen without heavy participation by the private sector. And to monitor and track how successful all that activity is, you also need consistent benchmarks for measuring and comparing just how all those companies are doing.

That’s where the World Benchmarking Alliance comes in. Recently announced at the United Nations General Assembly, it will develop free, publicly available benchmarks which will rank companies on their contributions to achieving the SDGs. With that in hand, everyone from consumers and investors to governments will have a comprehensive tool for deciding where to spend their money, allocate their investments or direct their policy and advocacy efforts.

Ultimately, the goal is to clarify what society expects from business and how best companies can meet those expectations. “Benchmark methodologies translate societal expectations into metrics, providing companies with a clear path forward,” says Mark Wilson, group chief executive of Aviva, a multinational insurance company and one of the members of the Alliance. Others include the nonprofit Index Initiative and the United Nations Foundation. Funding is also coming from the governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Denmark.

Plus, the ranking could inspire a healthy competition among businesses and create a market that rewards corporate leadership. “CEOS, especially in the U.S., are a competitive bunch of people,” says Wilson. “You want to appeal to that competitive spirit, so they and their shareholders take sustainability seriously.”

Of course, pinpointing all the important factors that need to be taken into account involves a lengthy process—consulting with people in government, academia, sustainability and business. The announcement was preceded by a year of consultations with more than 10,000 experts.

Some examples of factors in various benchmarks: For the SDG category of food and agriculture, they would include whether companies are producing food in an environmentally friendly way and ensuring acceptable livelihoods for farmers. For climate and energy, they would show to what extent companies in high carbon-emitting industries are contributing to the Paris Agreement.

The aim is to develop all the benchmarks by 2023 to assess the world’s largest 2,000 companies. The first crop, due to be published in 2020, will address food and agriculture, climate and energy digital inclusion and gender equality and empowerment.

Regulators are also important in this equation, says Wilson. That’s because their prevalent short-term thinking means they don’t generally take into account long-term risks. Thus they might introduce, say, prohibitively high capital charges that penalize investments in wind farms and, as a result, discourage sustainability efforts. So there also will be benchmarks for regulators globally. “To move the needle on a lot of problems in society, we also need to rate the regulators,” says Wilson.

This isn’t the only relevant measurement methodology out there. But, the goal is for the WBA to be all-encompassing, accurate and independent. Says a press release, “The WBA is also expected to play a role in helping to leverage and harmonize the incoming wave of SDG-related monitoring initiatives that are currently being developed.”","And to monitor and track how successful all that activity is, you also need consistent benchmarks for measuring and comparing just how all those companies are doing.
Recently announced at the United Nations General Assembly, it will develop free, publicly available benchmarks which will rank companies on their contributions to achieving the SDGs.
Ultimately, the goal is to clarify what society expects from business and how best companies can meet those expectations.
For climate and energy, they would show to what extent companies in high carbon-emitting industries are contributing to the Paris Agreement.

According to the Ocean Cleanup organization, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to measure 1.6 million square kilometers and contain 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic marine debris. The garbage patch is located halfway between Hawaii and the coast of California. The Pacific patch is the largest of five garbage patches around the world.

The marine litter collection system consists of a 600 meter long floater that is carried on ocean waves and currents, and collects plastic debris passively along the way. According to Ocean Cleanup’s research, a scaled-up fleet of 60 of these types of systems could clean up to 50 percent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch over the next five years.

The projects were based on the Global Compact’s Tenth Principle (anti-corruption) and on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), with a focus on SDG target 16.5 to “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.”Through the projects, which were supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative Second Funding Round, businesses, governments and civil society worked to increase compliance standards across Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria.

In Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria, the project connected various stakeholders to discuss challenges and opportunities, as well as to identify collective efforts to combat corruption, increase transparency, and create an enabling environment for businesses and flourishing societies. The UNGC’s four Local Networks organized workshops that engaged 900 participants, helping them develop resources to improve anti-corruption compliance among business participants and establish a strategy to ensure ongoing commitment towards anti-corruption.

In Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Junior Business Association, UNGC created the Integrity Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder, business-led group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) committed to tackling corruption. SMEs that joined the Initiative signed a ten-step Integrity Pledge and were trained on various aspects of anti-corruption compliance. The project trained personnel from over 400 SMEs and developed guidance materials for SMEs on topics including transparency in customs, public procurement, code of conduct, and internal controls, along with an online support desk.

To mark the completion of the projects, UNGC released the second edition of its publication titled, ‘Promoting Anti-Corruption Collective Action through Global Compact Local Networks.’

Also to increase government transparency, improve accountability, and strengthen citizen engagement as well as government responsiveness, on 19 July 2018 the World Bank and development partners launched the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The US$12 million Fund was created with Agence Française de Développement, the Department for International Development UK, and Global Affairs Canada.

In countries and sub-nationals that participate in the OGP, the MDTF will support implementation of open government reforms, an inclusive and participatory dialogue and decision-making process, and build an evidence base on the impact of open government reforms.

The Pacific-EU Marine Partnership Programme (PEUMP) will assist the regional organizations in supporting national and regional activities throughout the Pacific.

The signing follows agreement between the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development and the Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) on the partnership programme. The two agreed to develop the programme at the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, which took place in Malta.

The five-year PEUMP has a holistic, multi-sector approach to marine resources and aims to contribute to the region’s environmental, economic and social development. The programme will focus on four key areas. First, the PEUMP will support sound coastal and ocean governance with a focus on biodiversity protection and sustainable fisheries and marine resource use. Second, the programme will use a rights-based approach to encourage participation of men, women and youth in decision making, and mainstream gender equality and human rights. Third, PEUMP will mainstream climate change and environmental issues. Finally, the programme will strengthen regional, national, sub-national and local capacity to deliver sustainable fisheries management and sound ocean governance through education, training and research.

Health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.

SPC Director General, Colin Tukuitonga stressed that the “health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.” He said the programme aligns with Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ vision of a ‘Blue Pacific’ and will help to ensure that Pacific communities can sustainably manage and conserve their ocean resources. Jean-Louis Ville, Head of Unit for East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific at the European Commission Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development, recognized the essential role of oceans in “ensuring food, livelihoods, biodiversity and climate resilience” but noted that the world’s oceans face increasing threats from unsustainable management practices and the negative effects of climate change. He said the EU-Pacific partnership will address such threats and support sustainable management of the Pacific’s marine resources.

The paper uses examples from Bangladesh, Chile, Ecuador and Nepal.

The report titled, ‘Challenges and Opportunities in Assessing Sustainable Mountain Development Using the UN Sustainable Development Goals,’ aims to help contextualize and highlight the specific needs and challenges for mountain communities and ecosystems in addressing SMD. The study notes that countries often apply their own definition of mountain areas, which can make it challenging to compare results across countries. To address this challenge, the report suggests decentralizing efforts to monitor the SDGs at the regional level using a jointly agreed approach.

For over half of the SDG indicators relevant for SMD, no internationally established methodology or standards are available for data collection or data are not regularly produced.

Although three SDG targets specifically refer to mountains (target 6.6, target 15.1 and target 15.4), the report emphasizes that all SDGs should be considered for SMD. At the same time, given calls for developing subsets of indicators that can assess local progress, the report identifies a subset of SDG indicators relevant for monitoring and reporting on SMD, and discusses challenges and opportunities for reporting on these indicators. For example, for over half of the SDG indicators relevant for SMD, no internationally established methodology or standards are available for data collection or data are not regularly produced, which means that proxy data are required. The report suggests collaboration with local organizations to fill gaps in SDG data because such actors frequently have good knowledge of location conditions and sources of data. The report recommends that such indicators be relevant to SMD, applicable to different mountain regions worldwide and practical to use.

SDG target 6.6 aims to, by 2020, “protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.” Target 15.1 aims to, by 2020, “ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements and target 15.4.” Target 15.4 seeks to, by 2030, “ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.”

The aquadrone aims to stop plastic pollution at the source, eliminating floating debris before it drifts into the world’s oceans.

Preventing and reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, is the aim of SDG target 14.1. SDG 14 (life below water) focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

The aquadrone does not harm fish or birds and is visible to shipping traffic.

RanMarine Technology modeled the WasteShark after the whale shark, a filter feeder that consumes plankton and small crustaceans by sucking them through its long, flat mouth. The WasteShark has “an enormous mouth” that is designed to skim the water and track down trash, operating based on the same principles as the whale shark. The aquadron is best suited to collect trash in areas known as “waste chokeholds” such as canals, harbors, ponds and rivers.

The WasteShark can swim for up to 16 hours and collect up to 200 liters of trash in one trip. It is capable of sending information back to a central command, including data on pH levels, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, chloride, nitrate and other water quality parameters. The aquadron is steered through a plotted iPad map or manually, using a remote control.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will convene the meeting on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 73rd general debate.

The synopsis document outlines the Strategy’s background, objectives and way forward. According to the synopsis, the Strategy focuses on leveraging the convening power of the UN to bring together the relevant actors to accelerate mobilization of finance for the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy is built on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and on the Paris Agreement on climate change. It also draws on the work of the UN’s Inter-Agency Task Force on FFD, as well as ongoing work on financing within the UN and with its key partners.

The Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021.

The Strategy aims to accelerate progress in key areas where the leadership of the Secretary-General can galvanize action from the global to the local arena. Guterres sets out the key elements of the role that the UN can play in supporting the mobilization of finance for sustainable development, as well as actions that the UN will take to help accelerate and deepen the transformation of financial systems to provide development finance efficiently. The three key areas – or objectives – are:

Aligning global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda;

Enhancing sustainable financing strategies and investments at the regional and country levels; and

Exploiting the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

As for the way forward, the Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021, building on current and future activities of key stakeholders, to mobilize investments and support for funding the 2030 Agenda. The UN Deputy Secretary-General will lead its implementation.

The high-level meeting on 24 September 2018 will serve to: launch the Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda; take stock of and accelerate eﬀorts by diﬀerent stakeholders to operationalize the AAAA; and build momentum around key actions and initiatives by national governments, business and the international community that have high potential to accelerate implementation of the AAAA and the 2030 Agenda, and call on actors to report back on progress at the 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. Following the meeting, a Secretary-General’s summary will highlight key action points, as a guide to follow-up discussions on sustainable financing at relevant fora over the next three years.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

The Recovery Units of Degraded Areas and Reduction of Climate Vulnerability (URAD) initiative was established in 2016 with the objective of financing actions to address the main drivers of land degradation in the Caatinga biome. With a minimum mandate of ten years, backed by a commitment of US$100 million dollars mobilized from domestic environmental fines, the project was tasked with reversing negative trends associated with land degradation. To kick-start the first two years of implementation, an additional USD$1 million was provided by Brazil’s Climate Fund, and US$9 million came from the international community.

While it is too early to measure the targeted long-term transformational change, the article points out that what has been achieved so far at the municipal level is contributing to “noticeable attitude and behavior changes in the population.” For example, community-level interventions were initially expected to take nine months but, according to the project, “all initiatives in progress have taken just four months to complete.” This is attributed to the project’s innovative approach, which simultaneously targets environmental, social and economic challenges associated with land degradation.

Communities that were initially suspicious of government projects “are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

Examples of social initiatives that promote all three sustainable development pillars include the use of fuel-efficient stoves to reduce wood consumption and improving sanitation to reduce water and soil pollution. Economic activities promoted by the project include beekeeping and integrated crop-livestock-forest systems. However, the blog notes that this last category is the most challenging because to succeed such interventions “must match the economic potentials of the community, the land and the capacity of the rural producers.”

Citing Valdemar Rodrigues, Director of Sustainable Rural Development of Brazil’s Ministry of Environment, the article adds that while local populations were suspicious of government projects in the past, the results obtained from the implementation of URAD have not only changed this view, but “communities are starting to regain the value and respect they had in their environment.”

The URAD project is an example of transformative projects promoted by the UNCCD with the aim of contributing to the LDN target. So far, 118 out of the 196 signatories to the Convention have embarked on voluntary national LDN target-setting processes, with some countries proceeding to develop and implement a first set of LDN projects.

206,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/convention-on-biological-diversity-overcoming-research-impediments/,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Convention on Biological Diversity: Overcoming Research Impediments,"Success of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) depends on our understanding of biodiversity. Hence, CBD and the subsequent Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (NP) urge signatory nations to promote and encourage research on biodiversity. However, imposition of sovereign rights of nations on their biological resources and the emphasis on the CBD third objective of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources (GR) through access and benefit-sharing (ABS) are coming in the way of achieving the primary objectives of the CBD relating to conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use.

In the meantime, examples of financially significant ABS agreements are scarce even after a quarter century of existence of the CBD. A survey of megadiverse countries having functional ABS legislation showed that very few commercial ABS agreements (2.05 per year per country) have been concluded, suggesting a lack of demand for GR by potential users. Instead, the regulations to harness perceived benefits by individual countries have made much needed biodiversity exploration and research difficult and in some cases even impossible. The global research community has been complaining about the challenges they face in accessing and exchanging biological material for research as well as international collaborations that are crucial for the global food security and conservation of biodiversity.

No Substitute for Sharing of Biological Resources

Biological resources being truly renewable, their use promotes further improvement and ex situ conservation as in the case of crop plants. Use of any biological resource in a given area does not limit its use elsewhere. However, throughout the negotiations in the run up to the CBD and NP, biological resources were treated akin to non-renewable resources such as oil and coal.

The principles underlying the CBD and NP are laudable, and both underscore that access to GR should also address the issues of equity. However, with the third CBD objective of ABS making a slip, it is becoming evident that the CBD and NP may not be able to address the issues of equity raised by developing countries at the Earth Summit in 1992, which ultimately culminated in nationalization of genetic resources. As governments began to enact national legislation to regulate access to biological resources within their borders for benefit-sharing from the derived products, consequences of such actions on biodiversity research and food security are being overlooked. The principal victim of these legislative actions is biodiversity research that includes inventories and international collaborations as its core. Such restrictions, apart from curtailing research and development, run counter to the objectives of the CBD. Enormous amounts of biological data, including Digital Sequence Information (DSI), are increasingly being published via the database portals of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). The unlimited and open access DSI encourages collaboration among researchers besides enabling conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. As access to DSI is coming to the center stage of negotiations in the forthcoming 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, the global research community is increasingly concerned about the free flow of information, which is essential for the advancement of science.

New Treaty for Non-profit Research and Development

Not-for-profit research, such as inventories and taxonomic studies, intended for the public domain, should be differentiated from commercial research leading to proprietary rights. On the one hand, access has to be open when the benefits are in the public domain, and the providers of the biological resource are free to make use of the benefits just as anybody else. On the other hand, if the benefits are confined to the private realm through intellectual property rights, the provider may secure a share bilaterally.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), popularly known as the “Seed Treaty,” provides a promising model for international collaboration on biodiversity research. The treaty ensures worldwide public accessibility to GR of essential food and fodder crops. While the CBD and NP necessitate access to GR on a bilateral basis through case-by-case negotiations, the Seed Treaty adopts a multilateral system for ABS (MLS) through a Standard Material Transfer Agreement, averting the need for bilateral negotiations. The MLS established under the Seed Treaty has been viewed as a very successful model in terms of volume of material exchanged (8,500 transfers every week) in contrast to the very limited performance of the bilateral system of the CBD and NP. Exchange of genetic material under the Seed Treaty is exempted from the NP requirements, and the benefit sharing requirement arises only when access for further research and breeding is restricted through intellectual property rights. One possible course of action for the CBD COP might be to add a legally binding treaty to promote and facilitate biodiversity research, conservation and international collaboration. Such a treaty could address legal uncertainties in the governance of global research commons such as microbial culture collections held by the World Federation of Culture Collections as well as DSI published through the portals of INSDC or taxonomic type materials held in various museums all over the world.

Intrinsically, GR is a public resource – truly renewable, non-rivalrous and non-exclusive – much similar to the knowledge resources. Its dissemination across national boundaries further enriches their diversity, value and conservation. For example, cultivation of a crop variety in a region does not limit its use elsewhere. Thus, it is imperative that GR are retained as common heritage. Man, as a biological species, depends more or less on the same GR for survival, irrespective of the national boundaries. Open access to GR addresses the issues of equity by ensuring access to biological resources for all. This advocates the universal freedom to study, distribute, modify and utilize GR by any one and for any purpose. As in the case of open source software licenses, many forms of free and open access licenses can be conceived for GR too. The open access model offers people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of GR with stipulation that the same rights should be preserved in derivative works in the future.

Biodiversity forms the basis of global food and livelihood security, and the nations of the world are linked in a complex web of genetic interdependence that ensures global food security. Countries have gained much more than their individual contributions through the exchange and sharing of a myriad kinds of crops and domestic animals from all over the world. Similarly, international collaboration is inevitable for understanding life on earth, its conservation and sustainable use. The objectives of the CBD are interlinked with the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and three SDGs in particular: SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). It is time that the forthcoming CBD COP take stock of the impacts of parochial restrictions on open access and free exchange of biological resources due to the NP and national ABS regimes, and adopt the necessary course correction to help achieve sustainable development for all.

207,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-apparition-a-curious-exploration-of-doubt-and-faith,"Fri, 07 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Apparition’: A Curious Exploration of Doubt and Faith,"Has the Virgin Mary really spoken to a young girl in rural France? A French-language film offers an earnest look at how the hierarchy and the faithful respond to a purported visionary.

Xavier Giannoli’s The Apparition joins Jessica Hausner’s 2009 Lourdes and Dietrich Brüggemann’s Stations of the Cross on a short list of 21st-century European films turning a curious eye on devout Catholic piety in an increasingly secular world.

Like Stations of the Cross, The Apparition focuses on a deeply devout young girl, a mystic who may be a victim soul, chosen by God to suffer for the benefit of others. Like Lourdes, the protagonist is a skeptic caught up in a popular Marian phenomenon, wondering if miracles really happen.

Vincent Lindon plays Jacques Mayano, a renowned investigative journalist who receives an unexpected call from the Vatican.

An official at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wants Jacques to take part in a canonical investigation into a purported Marian apparition and the devotion that has grown around the visionary, a young novice named Anna (Galatéa Bellugi).

As practically every important word in that last sentence must be explained to him, Jacques may seem an unusual choice. But he is a man in need of direction — he’s reeling from the loss of his best friend and photographer in a violent incident on assignment in the Middle East — and takes the job.

Lourdes touched on the question of authenticating miracles, but The Apparition focuses on the Church’s investigative process to a greater degree than any film I’ve seen. (The film to which it most begs comparison or contrast might be Agnieszka Holland’s 1999 film The Third Miracle, starring Ed Harris, unseen by me.)

Jacques’ fellow investigators include a genial theologian, Stéphane Mornay (Gérard Dessalles), who makes no secret of his skepticism of the Medjugorje visionaries as well as Anna’s purported visions, and a psychiatrist, Dr. de Villeneuve (Elina Löwensohn), whose function is to assess Anna’s psychological well-being but who clearly wants to believe in Anna’s miracle.

De Villeneuve isn’t the only one. Anna’s spiritual guide and mentor, a Franciscan priest named Father Borrodine (Patrick d’Assumçao), is so devoted to his young charge and her calling that he has gone off the reservation against the local bishop, despite the suspension of his faculties to say Mass.

There’s also an ingratiatingly earnest Catholic media figure named Anton Meyer (Anatole Taubman) whose celebration of Anna is at once exploitative and utterly sincere. And, of course, there are the throngs of pilgrims flocking to glimpse the visionary and the sight of the apparition, and also, of course, to buy religious trinkets: rosaries, crucifixes, statues of Mary, even votive candles with stickers of Anna’s face.

Anna herself appears to have no wish for celebrity. She has a transparent, self-possessed quality that suggests genuineness and candor. Her message from the Blessed Virgin is simple: Mary hears the cries of the world and wants people to learn to give to one another, to help the poor and suffering. She also wants Anna to have a house of prayer built for her Son, presumably at the site of the apparition.

As a novice, Anna works with the sisters making feather bedding to support the convent, and when necessary, she offers simple, sincere words to the crowds who come to see her. After her interview with the investigative team, in a moment witnessed neither by Jacques nor any other human being, she kneels in composed prayer on a restroom floor: a token of the authenticity of her faith.

Later, after a televised interview with Meyer, we see Anna kneeling again in solitary prayer, this time on a chapel floor — but her very different posture suggests a sense of desperate pleading. One of Meyer’s questions for Anna was how she felt about Christians from all over the world coming to see her. At times Anna’s celebrity may feel like a life sentence with no hope of parole.

There are suggestions of something possibly hinky about Anna’s story. One of the most notable is a purported relic of Jesus — a bloodstained shroud that Anna is said to have received directly from the Blessed Virgin.

Stéphane, the theologian, calls this “a total contradiction with the tradition of apparitions,” since, he says, Mary “has always been an image of love, kindness and understanding. She can’t be associated with violence.”

Stéphane’s reasoning is simultaneously understated and wrong. On the one hand, Mary is certainly associated with her Son’s passion and death. (Beyond that, sacred art is full of images of the Blessed Virgin crushing the serpent’s head and even beating up the devil.)

On the other hand, what Stéphane should have said is that Marian apparitions do not traditionally dispense physical relics. St. Juan Diego’s tilma was miraculously marked with the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, but the tilma itself was made of Mexican hemp like any number of tilmas worn by Juan Diego’s contemporaries.

Resisting Stéphane’s skepticism, de Villeneuve suggests that the cloth may be “a new symbol.” The theological implications of this suggestion aren’t explored; more glaringly, no one asks just how many bloodstained shrouds of Jesus there can be.

Scientific tests suggest a connection, of a sort, to the Shroud of Turin and the Shroud of Oviedo (or Sudarium), as well as the Holy Tunic of Argenteuil. Those three relics aren’t in competition — the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium are considered complementary relics that covered the same person — but it’s hard to see how Anna’s shroud could be added to the mix.

All of this is greatly complicated by Jacques’ investigation into Anna’s complex back story: the foster families she lived with, a friend named Meriem (Alicia Hava), whom Anna knew from her foster care days, a grisly murder, a man in prison, and more.

These subplots take up too much time for too little payoff. By the time Jacques comes face-to-face with a person who has, in a way, the most crucial story to tell, neither the film nor its protagonist have the time or interest to really explore that story or that character.

The resolution is clever, giving both secular and religious viewers something to hold onto, but unsatisfying in giving short shrift to the final piece of its complicated puzzle.

The story is also, to an extent, about Jacques’s working through his grief and depression from the killing of his friend. The opening shots of a close hotel room with heavy room-darkening curtains drawn against the Middle-Eastern sun suggest the isolation and oppressive narrowness of depression. The final image, a wide outdoor shot with the protagonist standing in an immense Middle-Eastern landscape, conveys liberation and open possibilities.

Along the way, there’s a suggestion that perhaps Mary takes an interest in Jacques’s healing and sends him an enigmatic message of hope. Does the Blessed Mother see, or is she blind? The Apparition answers many questions, but remains agnostic on that one.

208,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-unbroken-path-to-redemption,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Unbroken: Path to Redemption’,"Picking up where Angelina Jolie’s film left off, this faith-based production from Pure Flix tells an overly familiar story of life struggles ending in an altar call.

Unbroken is the main title of Laura Hillenbrand’s best-selling biography about Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete and World War II prisoner-of-war hero who responded to an altar call at a Billy Graham crusade and became an evangelist himself, even returning to Japan and visiting prison guards from his time as a POW.

Unbroken is also now the name of two films about Zamperini based on the book: Angelina Jolie’s 2014 war movie, based on the first half of Hillenbrand’s book, and now this faith-based unofficial companion piece from God’s Not Dead director Harold Cronk, which covers the rest. (Matthew Baer was a producer on both films, and Vincenzo Amato and Maddalena Ischiale reprise their roles as, respectively, Louis’ brother Anthony and mother Louise. The two productions are otherwise unconnected.)

Jolie’s film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Richard LaGravenese (The Horse Whisperer) and William Nicholson (Shadowlands). Unbroken: Path to Redemption is written by Richard Friedenberg (A River Runs Through It) and Ken Hixon (City by the Sea).

Talented writers have labored to bring a compelling life to the screen. Both films are well acted, and cinematography and sound design are strengths in both films.

Why doesn’t either film work?

Unbroken is largely a secular via crucis, an examination of Zamperini’s suffering as a POW under a sadistic camp guard — Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed “the Bird” — but ultimately has nothing to say about Zamperini’s suffering or his determination to endure. You can see why someone would want to tell this story, but it wasn’t told in an illuminating way.

The shadow of the Bird — and, really, the shadow of the whole earlier film — looms over Unbroken: Path to Redemption, which follows Louis (Samuel Hunt) through his post-POW stint as a celebrity war hero hawking war bonds, his marriage to a good woman named Cynthia Applewhite (Merritt Patterson), and his struggles with PTSD. These include flashbacks, anxiety, heavy drinking and Louis’ obsession with the Bird (David Sakurai), who continues to torment his former prisoner, albeit in hallucinations and nightmares.

Unbroken relegated Zamperini’s religious conversion and life of faith to closing titles, which I found unsatisfying. At the time I felt that perhaps Louis’ later religious conversion and faith might have held a key to illuminating the character and his story. I still think it’s possible a film about Zamperini overcoming his demons through faith and the support of his wife and other believers might be a story worth telling.

But Path to Redemption builds to the same climax as Hillenbrand’s book: Zamperini’s conversion at a Billy Graham crusade. Everything after that is denouement: Triumph over alcoholism consists of Louis pouring his liquor down the drain. In Tokyo he briefly shakes hands with a few prison guards, but no conversations or scenes show the human reality of how he has changed.

Reviewing a Billy Graham production in the 1980s for Christianity Today, Harry Cheney perceptively proposed, “An encounter with Christ should propel the action, not end it.” Worthwhile religious movies explore the implications and the lived experience of faith or perhaps illuminate the reality of life without it. Regrettably, Path to Redemption has no interest in the first and isn’t up to the second.

What that leaves is a rather trite tale of a hard-drinking protagonist spiraling downward while a long-suffering woman looks on and tries to help. Louis hides flasks of liquor from Cynthia, who pretends not to notice until it can’t be ignored. As a veteran and college dropout, Louis struggles to find work until — well, actually, I guess accepting Christ at that altar call really did solve that problem, since it led to his career as an evangelist under Billy’s own mentorship.

Hunt makes for a sympathetic lead and has a winning smile that works both when Louis means it and when he’s using it as a crutch. Patterson is buoyant, supportive and finally concerned in a role that doesn’t give her much more to do.

Like the The Case for Christ — another Pure Flix film about the spiritual struggles of a male protagonist and his concerned wife — there’s a wise black woman of faith (Vanessa Bell Calloway) to dispense words of insight to the wife, encouraging her on the road to winning her man for Jesus.

There’s no getting around the fact that Jolie is an accomplished director, while Cronk is at best an adequate one. For a man whose work consists largely of scenes of people having conversations, he shows little interest in finding visually interesting ways of presenting them. He likes to keep his camera at or just below the actors’ eye lines, and he never tires of shot/countershot back-and-forth.

More effective are the flashback and nightmare sequences, as Cronk blends reality with perception, allowing the traumatic images and fears in Louis’ subconscious to bleed into his actual surroundings. A couch on which Louis lies in a darkened room after a bad night out suddenly heaves as if moved by a poltergeist; moments later, Louis is on his life raft in the Pacific being strafed by Japanese fighter pilots and menaced by a shark. An elevator splinters under a hail of gunfire like the fuselage of Louis’ B-24.

Some of the better effects are smaller ones. A bowl of rice at a restaurant appears to be crawling with worms, and Louis explodes at the hapless waiter about no one having ordered rice. (I can’t help thinking that this effect would have been even better had it been subtler: tiny maggots instead of large worms.)

Likewise, an early nightmare in which Louis is strangling a figure that is initially the Bird but then morphs into Cynthia ends with Louis abruptly waking up with Cynthia sleeping soundly beside him. (In Hillenbrand’s account, Zamperini actually woke up strangling his wife, but the film version is more compelling to me, even if Louis’ nightmare lingers longer than he thinks.)

On the other hand, the film overly modulates some of the darker paths Zamperini went down, such as a morbid fantasy about flying to Japan to find the Bird and murder him. Perhaps the filmmakers were concerned about making Louis too unsympathetic, or perhaps this was just too dark for a Pure Flix film.

Either way, the effect is to make Louis less a deeply disturbed, damaged soul than an increasingly grumpy drunk who’s less convincing than he should be when he talks about being mad at God. (When his old family priest tells Louis not to discount God’s role in his journey, Louis cracks, “Don’t worry, Padre, I give him all the blame.”) Undercutting the darkness of Louis’ descent undercuts the power of his redemption.

Will Graham, the grandson of the late, great Baptist evangelist and a preacher in his own right, bears a family resemblance to his grandfather, but lacks Billy’s fiery zeal and authoritative presence. At one point, Graham speaks directly into the camera; perhaps the intention was to evoke the legendary evangelist’s ability to create a sense of personal connection with individual audience members, but the effect is to make the scene all about Louis rather than placing Louis on the frontier of something greater than himself.

In a brief coda, Louis reconciles with his brother Anthony, who is presumably happy to see Louis no longer drinking. How does Louis’ Catholic family feel about his new come-to-Jesus evangelical faith, not to mention his apparent wedding to a Protestant woman in a Protestant church? That’s the kind of messy human question that never comes up in a film like Path to Redemption.

The SDG12 award was handed over to AIF representatives by Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES) at an event held on September 4, in Swiss capital Geneva.

One of the targets of SDG12 is support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production

AIF presented the most convincing concept on SDG 12 indicating a practical cooperation venture between the government of Rwanda, consortium of various banks, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in this area.

AIF Rwanda is a leading manufacturer of high quality and nutritious complementary foods in Rwanda, and a joint-venture between government and a consortium of Royal DSM, Dutch development bank (FMO), DFID Impact Acceleration Facility managed by CDC Group plc and International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group.

“We are very honored and proud to have received the SDG Award of the Swiss Green Economy Symposium (SGES) for the first time ever,” AIF Rwanda said in a twitter statement.

Along with the award, AIF Rwanda also received prize money of 4,000 Swiss francs from which Amar Ali, CEO of AIF donated 4,000 Swiss Francs to orphans living in Mbuye Sector, Ruhango district, Kizibere village.

“We were impressed by the way in which Africa Improved Foods combines its social commitment with the successful networking of public and private players,” says Dr. Anne le Duc, CEO of SGES, upon announcing the first award winner.

On May 31, 2017, AIF opened its state-of-the-art facility in the city of Kigali, where it produces an annual output of 45,000 tonnes of fortified blended foods, employing over 300 staff.

The company offers 24,000 Rwandan farmers sustainable income for a proportion of their harvest.

Its first two products are porridge flours with added milk powder, vitamins, and minerals.

The factory recently celebrated its first anniversary and will soon have the capacity to feed two million people and be able to reduce stunting in Rwanda from 38% to 32% by 2020 – a 6% reduction – bringing hope to tens of thousands of children.

AIF Rwanda was this April named among the finalists of the 2018 World Changing Ideas Awards (WCIA), in the food category among the 12 companies awarded in areas of health, technology, consumer products, energy, transport and education.

The publication describes the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs, and showcases examples of WIPO’s contributions to the SDGs.



SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) explicitly recognizes the link between economic and social progress and innovation. In the publication’s introduction, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry elaborates on the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs. He states that intellectual property as a policy “exists to create an enabling environment for – and to stimulate investment in – innovation,” and to create a framework for sharing and trading new technologies around the world. He further explains that the “economic imperative at the heart of innovation is fundamental to the process of societal transformation that the SDGs aim to achieve.

A WIPO-led partnership seeks to ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations are not neglected.

The publication titled, ‘WIPO and the Sustainable Development Goals: Innovation Driving Human Progress,’ highlights the role of innovation in achieving the SDGs, including SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action). On SDG 3, the report explains how intellectual property systems support health care innovation by encouraging investment in new drugs and technologies while reassuring companies of a secure return on their investment. To ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations or that affect comparatively few people are not neglected, WIPO leads a public-private partnership (PPP) to tackle neglected tropical diseases, malaria and tuberculosis.

On SDG 4 (quality education), WIPO works with its member States to support equal access to education, such as by implementing treaty-based adjustments to the intellectual property systems, so that books for visually-impaired people can be more easily shared across national borders. The WIPO-led ‘Accessible Books Consortium’ works to harness technologies to produce books for visually impaired people globally. This PPP established international standards for inclusive publishing. and facilitates inter-library loans across borders.

On SDG 13, WIPO highlights its efforts to promote an efficient global market for environmentally friendly technologies, building the international intellectual property system. WIPO GREEN aims to stimulate the uptake of green tech by bringing innovators, investors and potential users together. The network facilitates connections between companies looking to access, commercialize or license a green technology with the innovators who create such a technology.

The publication showcases a new water technology called CloudFisher that provides clean water to communities in arid but foggy coastal or mountainous regions that face water shortages. WIPO GREEN facilitated a connection between the technology’s developer and the company that commercialized it.

In addition to WIPO’s direct impacts on several SDGs, the report argues that the role of innovation in policy setting can assist in achieving SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 8, SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land), among others.

The portal tracks 51 African countries’ progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and displays the data in either an index or a dashboard format.



The index provides an aggregate measure of a country’s progress across all 17 SDGs. Progress towards an indicator is standardized on a scale of 0 (poor progress) and 100 (strong progress), relative to the objective of that indicator. For example, SDG indicator 4.1.1 measures proficiency in school subjects. The closer a country’s students are to achieving proficiency in these subjects, the closer their index ranking is to 100. Each standardized indicator score is then aggregated to determine a single value between 0 (poor) and 100 (strong) to a country.

Only seven countries in Africa have scores over 60 out of 100: Egypt, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Algeria, Mauritius, Tunisia and Morocco.

Of the 51 Africa countries that had substantial data to develop an index score, only seven countries had scores over 60; Egypt (60.70), Ghana (62.45), Cabo Verde (63.36), Algeria (63.95), Mauritius (64.04), Tunisia (65.88) and Morocco, who had the highest score with 66.08. Conversely, 16 countries had scores below 50, with the two lowest scores recorded for Somalia (36.15) and the Central African Republic (35.70).

Aside from displaying data in an index format, users can also view countries’ progress towards each SDG in an interactive dashboard. In the dashboard, users can view countries index scores on an SDG-by-SDG basis, or view a countries’ overall progress towards the SDGs in a trend-based dashboard.

The trend-based dashboard presents countries’ progress by using red, orange, yellow or green arrows to represent decreasing, stagnating, moderately increasing or on track trends, respectively. For countries with no available data on an SDG, white is used. Users can decide to view all 52 countries data, or filter searches based on five geographic areas: North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and or West Africa.

According to the portal, progress towards the SDGs varies widely by country and region. In North Africa, four out of five countries with data are on track to achieving SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and half of the countries in Eastern Africa are on track to achieving SDG 15 (life on land). In Central, Southern and Western Africa, 30 of 35 countries with data are on track to meeting SDG 13 (climate action). Although progress towards the SDGs is being made throughout Africa, no country is on track to meet SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) or 14 (life below water).

The Africa SDG Index and Dashboard is built on the Global SDG Index and Dashboard, which SDSN launched in 2016.

216,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iom-provides-guidance-on-integrating-migration-into-sdg-planning/,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IOM Provides Guidance on Integrating Migration into SDG Planning,"9 October 2018: The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has issued a guide to help policymakers integrate the migration aspects of the SDGs into local and national planning processes. The guide titled, ‘Migration and the 2030 Agenda: A Guide for Practitioners,’ discusses the interlinkages between migration and the SDGs and suggests a process for integrating migration and the SDGs into legislation, policies, programmes, projects and other initiatives.



The publication was developed with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). It notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development marks the first time that “migration is integrated explicitly into the global development agenda.” Within the 2030 Agenda, the central reference to migration is made in SDG target 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people). Other targets are also related to migration.

The guide highlights the SDGs’ direct references to “migration-related issues,” as well as cross-cutting connections where SDG areas “may affect or be affected by migration.” On the SDG targets that directly reference migration (direct connections), the guide identifies: student mobility (SDG target 4.b); human trafficking and exploitation (targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2); labor migration and employment (targets 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8); migration governance (target 10.7); remittances (target 10.c); and migration data (target 17.18).

The publication identifies cross-cutting connections between migration and the following areas and targets:

Poverty and growth (SDG targets 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 10.1);

Social protection (SDG targets 1.3, 5.4 and 10.4);

Health (SDG targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 5.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7 and 10.c);

Education (SDG targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 10.7 and 10.c);

Gender (SDG targets 5.2; 5.3, 5.4, 5.a and 5.c);

Children (SDG targets 1.2, 4.2, 4.5, 4.a, 5.1, 5.2, 8.7, 10.7, 16.2 and 16.3);

Cities (SDG targets 11.1, 11.3, 11.b and 11.c);

Climate change (SDG targets 1.5, 10.7, 11.5, 13.1 and 13.3);

Citizenship, rule of law and inclusion (SDG targets 10.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.7, 16.9 and 16.b); and

Diaspora and partnerships for development (SDG targets 8.9, 9.2, 12.b, 17.3, 17.5, 17.13, 17.16, 17.17 and 17.18).

The authors note that the implementation of migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda should be integrated with other sustainable development initiatives, and should engage all levels of government and across sectors. It encourages users to adapt the process to fit their unique context, and outlines four steps of implementation, namely: kick-off; prioritization; implementation; and monitoring and reporting. The guide also highlights: tools designed to help organize and inform actors as they work through the implementation process; suggestions for stakeholder participation; and relevant case study examples.

Among the case studies, the publication documents the experience of Armenia, which initiated a process of nationalizing migration-related SDGs. The process involved: examining migration and development issues in the context of the SDGs; prioritizing relevant targets; and developing a set of proxy indicators. It also comprised efforts on data, including an exercise to map migration data, and the improvement of national migration data collection and usage.

Another example discussed in the guide concerns the implementation of an IOM project in Ghana to support the government in mainstreaming migration into national development policies and achieving policy coherence, in line with the SDGs.

In December 2018, governments will gather in Marrakech, Morocco, to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Compact is the first intergovernmentally negotiated agreement prepared under the auspices of the UN aiming to address all dimensions of migration in a comprehensive manner.

The Strategy underscores the UN’s critical role in supporting and accelerating the mobilization of finance and focuses on three objectives to accelerate progress from global to local levels, linked to areas where the Secretary-General’s leadership can galvanize action.Titled, ‘The Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2018-2021),’ the Strategy was released on the occasion of a UN High-level Meeting on the same topic on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. A synopsis was released on 17 September 2018 as part of the webpage for the meeting.

The Strategy’s first objective is to align global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy argues that, when public policies are “firmly and consistently formulated to achieve sustainable development,” such policies can realign incentives and alter market perceptions of risk. At the same time, despite growing private interest in impact and sustainable investing, there are not yet globally agreed definitions of concepts and existing sustainability principles have not led to standards to guide sustainable finance, including sustainability bonds, SDG bonds or green bonds.

To deepen markets for sustainable finance, the UN is framing discussions on definitions, principles, guidelines and standards.

To address these challenges, the UN is working with global policymakers and regulators to increase understanding on the role of public policy in developing a sustainable financial system, including through framing discussions on definitions, principles and guidelines and developing standards to facilitate the deepening of markets for sustainable finance. In addition, private financial institutions are working with the UN to understand the relevance of environmental, social and governance challenges to finance, such as considering how to address sustainably in private enterprise and finance business models.

The Strategy’s second objective aims to enhance sustainable financing strategies and investments at country and regional levels. To achieve this objective, the UN will support the development of sustainable financing strategies at the country and regional levels, including by providing advice and support for creating investible projects, building enabling environments and developing financing strategies. UN country offices and regional teams will also provide capacity building support for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to support countries to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of their tax systems to provide government funding for the SDGs, including by addressing illicit financial flows, base erosion, tax evasion and tax transparency.

The third objective focuses on seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance. The Strategy identifies access to finance as a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable development, noting that the digitalization of finance has facilitated “major progress in financial inclusion” in recent years. Despite this progress, large gaps remain, particularly for women, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and people in the poorest countries. To close these gaps, the UN will bring together policymakers, financial regulators and innovators in the space of digital finance and fintech to exchange experiences and best practices on innovative financial instruments, including on the implication of new financial technologies for regulatory frameworks and the development of global norms.

To execute the Strategy, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives. The roadmap will build on key stakeholders’ current and future activities to mobilize investments and support for financing the 2030 Agenda.

The Deputy Secretary-General will lead the Strategy’s implementation on behalf of the Secretary-General, in coordination with heads of entities within the UN system.

This is the second SDG issuance from an HSBC entity globally, following HSBC Group’s USD1.0 billion SDG Bond in 2017 and is in line with the Group’s commitment to provide USD100 billion in sustainable financing and investment by 2025. The goal is one of five new commitments that HSBC has made to tackle climate change and support sustainable growth in the communities where the organisation serves.



“This sukuk is the world’s first ever benchmark sustainable sukuk issuance by a financial institution referencing the UN SDGs as use of proceeds. As such, it is a landmark in the MYR and global sukuk market,” said Stuart Milne, Group General Manager and Chief Executive Officer HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad. “HSBC has always been at the forefront of innovation in Islamic financing, having structured and lead managed numerous award winning landmark sukuk transactions on behalf of our clients. This issuance by HSBC Amanah demonstrates our continued commitment to the Government of Malaysia’s efforts to promote Malaysia as an Islamic finance hub and is a strong testament to HSBC’s leadership in sustainable financing.”



“This landmark issuance is in line with the newly developed Value-based Intermediation (“VBI”) initiative championed by Bank Negara Malaysia which seeks to shift the focus of the Islamic Finance industry to integrate environmental and social tenets into banking activities,” added Arsalaan Ahmed, Chief Executive Officer, HSBC Amanah. “We are pleased with this issuance that is aimed at starting a conversation in Islamic banking around SDGs and thus supporting VBI. This successful issuance also demonstrates our continued leadership in sukuk and contribution to the development of Shariah compliant Debt Capital Markets.”



“UNDP welcomes HSBC’s commitment to using funds raised in the capital market to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). “A world first, HSBC’s pioneering ‘SDG sukuk’ is a prime example of how to create innovative financing for the Goals, and marks a milestone in aligning Islamic finance with the SDGs. UNDP is growing its work in this exciting area, working both with the private sector and government stakeholders.”

SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses to contribute to the SDGs, including by providing country-level data and SDG investment roadmaps.

The initiative invites investors and companies of all sizes to: 1) adapt and transform their core business strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and 2) to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.

The event titled, ‘How the Private Sector Can Align to the SDGs,’ took place on 25 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, served as the “soft launch” of SDG Impact, and was organized by UNDP and the governments of Turkey and Norway. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses with the clarity, insights, and tools required to support and authenticate their contributions to achieving the SDGs. It will have three offerings, beginning with “impact management,” which encompasses the principles, frameworks, and standards to help investors channel capital toward SDG achievement. UNDP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Impact Management Project (IMP), which is a collaborative effort of over 1000 organizations, housed by Bridges Fund Management, that works with investors on delivering impact through financial investment.

Steiner said UNDP expects to establish SDG impact management standards, working in partnership with IMP and a network including the International Finance Corporation, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative, and the UN Global Compact. The newly developed standards will be the basis for an SDG Impact Seal and Certification programme, he noted.

The second offering of SDG Impact, Steiner said, is “impact intelligence,” to provide investors with insight into local industries, entrepreneurs and projects that advance the SDGs. Finally, “impact facilitation” involves leveraging UNDP’s in-country presence for network development, and matchmaking between investors and enterprises working to achieve the SDGs. This component entails a forum called ‘SDG Impact Investor Convenings’ to build cross-sector connections and identify investment opportunities. An SDG Accelerator initiative of UNDP, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Republic of Turkey is currently in a testing phase, and will launch in Turkey to help enterprises and start-ups align their businesses with the SDGs.

Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, explained that by utilizing the convening power of UNDP, the Accelerator Program aims to catalyze market-based solutions for challenges of displaced people and residents of the least developed countries (LDCs). Upon the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, UNDP is running a feasibility study for the SDG Impact Accelerator. The initial project partners estimate that the design of the Accelerator and its feasibility plan will be completed by the beginning of 2019.

Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary, Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed that “it is a big problem if we educate our youth into unemployment,” thus vocational education is needed to respond to the demands of the labor market. He said Norway has launched a knowledge bank that serves as one-stop shop for expertise, ranging from fisheries and renewable energy to petroleum and taxation, and Norway will focus on investments in vocational training. He added that the lack of relevant skills also presents a major problem for the private sector.

Tilak Marapana, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said his government has started several social impact funds, from private equity to debt, including a US$5 million fund to provide support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). He mentioned that the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Sri Lanka is vibrant with many ideas, but needs access to financing and private sector support. To that end, the government has supported the creation of a binary impact investment network.

Stefano Manservisi, Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), said the Commission currently focuses on EU countries’ meeting their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as “we need to move from billions to trillions, but we need first the billions.” Two other EC priorities that he identified included fostering investing and working with countries to leverage domestic resource mobilization (DRM), especially through taxation. As sectors of particular importance for the Commission, he mentioned agribusiness, energy, creation of MSMEs, cities and digitalization. He called for a mix of ODA, public policies and private investment, he announced that the EC will invest €24 million over the next four years in the Horn of Africa.

Goalkeepers 2018 took place as part of the annual Global Goals Week on the sidelines of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s high-level debate.

Goalkeepers participants gathered on 26 September 2018 at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, following an evening ceremony on 25 September to present awards to three young advocates.

The Heads of State of France and Sierra Leone participated in interactive sessions with participants, as did experts in technology, data journalism and humanitarian relief. Performances by artists from around the world highlighted urgent issues, and activists, advocates and community leaders emphasized that “change starts young” and discussed ways to make more progress towards the Global Goals.

France will increase its development aid from US$10 to US$50 billion by 2022, announced President Emmanuel Macron, beginning the day’s programme. He said France’s G7 presidency will focus on inequalities, and that the three root challenges of climate, education and health must be at the core of the Group’s agenda. He called for shifting one-third of global financial assets from “day-to-day business to climate business,” and said France’s development aid will be Paris-compliant. Highlighting the importance of education for young girls in Africa, he emphasized the need for “chosen fertility.” On health, Macron noted that France will organize the 2019 global replenishment for the Global Fund. Finally, he said youth should be able to dream of being an African of the 21st century, rather than a European of the 1980s.

David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s first-ever Chief Innovation Officer, spoke with Julius Maada Bio, President of Sierra Leone, and Bill Gates to address whether poverty is inevitable. Gates shared the findings of the 2018 Goalkeepers Data Report highlighting that while the global population has peaked, its geographical concentration is changing, with more babies being born in the poorest, most difficult circumstances. This means that, at least at the beginning of their lives, they and their families will spend their time seeking out food for survival, therefore unable to invest in education, health or building assets. Gates said the next wave of poverty reduction can come through investments in young innovators and other human capital.

Sengeh said Sierra Leone can be the blueprint for growth through technology and environmental resilience. To realize this, President Bio said the priority is free, quality and competitive education for “the last boy or girl in the village.” He noted the need for technology infrastructure to make this possible. Gates added that innovation can drive progress when it focuses on a big gap.

Stephen Fry, actor and director, and Richard Curtis, director, screenwriter and campaigner, who founded Project Everyone, recounted what made the MDG era “15 of the greatest years in human history:” they showed that “when the world focused on alleviating poverty and suffering, it worked;” and they encouraged a shift from addressing poverty as charity to seeing poverty as political. However, they said, there is no point in going only half way, and the SDGs serve as the MDGs’ sequel. They noted that many countries have taken concrete action to implement the Goals, businesses have identified a US$12 trillion opportunity, and 250,000 charity organizations have aligned themselves with the SDGs. But the momentum of the first few years of the 2030 Agenda can falter “without new energy,” they said, and they called on campaigners to push governments further in 2019. Moreover, in 2020, the world must “work out the big sea changes and the big funding solutions” to support the remaining ten years of SDG implementation.

Steve Waygood, Aviva, highlighted the World Benchmarking Alliance launched on 24 September. He said the WBA will rank the world’s largest 2,000 companies by their impact on the SDGs, in an effort to “reconnect people to their money” and its impacts in the world. Waygood said large-scale change will come not from regulation but from people with money ensuring that their assets are invested with integrity. Curtis added that Aviva aims to become plastic-free, has been carbon neutral since 2004, and invests heavily in renewable energy sources; by changing its own behavior, Aviva has gained the credibility to call on others to change.

Graca Machel urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

As part of a tribute to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, Graca Machel, advocate and member of The Elders, said the lessons of the past show the need to build movements and broad coalitions: transformation is “not going to happen in small groups.” She noted that “there is apartheid” in each of the 17 SDGs. Machel said Nelson Mandela had been “an ordinary young man who simply embraced one cause.” She urged young leaders to communicate in ways that allow everyone to feel connected with them.

David Miliband, International Rescue Committee (IRC) President, echoed the reflections on getting “half way there” on extreme poverty. He said that new tools are needed for the second half of that journey, in order to fight poverty in places in conflict. He also said the current humanitarian system is “building future generations of poverty” by not directing enough resources towards education.

A panel of young experts, advocates and community leaders moderated by Melinda Gates highlighted that young people must be enlisted as “true partners” in delivering on the SDGs. Joannie Bewa, a physician in Benin, said young people are not just needy, but bring talent and innovation, and need to be involved in designing and implementing solutions.

Trisha Shetty, founder of SheSays, suggested tapping into leaders’ interest in public opinion, and shared her success in involving comedians in a social media campaign to get finance ministers to drop taxes on sanitary napkins. Shetty also highlighted the complicity of people who remain silent in the face of sexual abuse of young people. Addressing those in older generations who have not faced accountability, she said, “give up your seat. We will leave you behind, because we don’t want to leave others behind.”

Another conversation focused on protecting and supporting girls, featuring Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and child rights activist, and Jaha Dukureh, founder and CEO of Safe Hands for Girls. Satyarthi discussed the need for “child-friendly” education, and said social taboos block the provision of appropriate sex education. Dukureh encouraged the use of technology and media, noting that her Change.org petition to then-president Barack Obama led to an investigation on FGM in the US. Her work also contributed to the banning of FGM in Gambia.

Mona Chalabi, data journalist and illustrator, said she aims to “create joy” while providing data in her work for major newspapers. She stressed that readers should feel something while looking at data, since it can communicate injustice. She also uses her illustrations to disaggregate findings, showing the rates that apply to specific readers rather than broad generalizations.

The Goalkeepers event launched three “accelerators” to direct resources and make progress on specific issues. The 2018 accelerators are focused on: early literacy in Africa and Asia (managed by Room to Read); supporting youth to use data to hold leaders accountable (managed by CIVICUS); and community-based solutions for ending child marriage (managed by Girls Not Brides). Accelerator Stations were situated around the event to enable participants to invest in the initiatives.

Jayathma Wickramanayake, UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, elaborated on the data accelerator, which is called the Goalkeepers Youth Action Fund. She said data provide incentives to achieve the SDGs by clarifying the problems we face, and she said the data that exists must be clear. She encouraged young leaders to apply online for support for initiatives focused on SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The Goalkeepers day also featured performances from: Kenyan rapper King Kaka, who is also a UNICEF Advocate and highlighted his work to bring menstrual hygiene products to poor communities and to destigmatize menstruation; Broadway actor Nicolette Robinson, who sang over film footage of young girls’ weddings and child brides with their babies; and ten-year-old ‘DJ Switch’ from Ghana, making her first appearance outside her country.

The UN agency estimates that, based on current trends, 90 countries are unlikely to achieve SDG target 6.2 on sanitation for all by 2030.

The publication offers guidance for national and local authorities on establishing safe sanitation systems, including principles for toilet design and the storage, transport, treatment and disposal of fecal sludge and wastewater, and principles for interventions to promote behavior change.

The guidelines outline four main recommendations: ensuring that communities have access to toilets that safely contain excreta; assessing health risks to protect people from exposure to excreta, such as through leaky storage; integrating sanitation into local government planning and service provision; and encouraging the health sector to invest more and coordinate sanitation planning to protect public health.

Every dollar invested in sanitation will bring a six-fold return in lower health costs, increased productivity and fewer premature deaths.

SDG target 6.2 seeks to “achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.” WHO estimates that every dollar that countries invest in sanitation will bring a six-fold return in lower health costs, increased productivity and fewer premature deaths.

WHO commended some countries on their actions on sanitation, including India for its launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission, or Clean India Programme, to coordinate action for sanitation access, and Senegal for its work with the private sector to ensure pit latrines and septic tanks are emptied and treated.

An accompanying symposium offered countries the opportunity to share national progress on statistics for implementing the SDGs and Agenda 2063 and to discuss regional indicators for the two agendas.



Heads of national statistics offices (NSOs) from 51 African countries, representatives from international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, academia and research institutions and the private sector attended StatCom-Africa VI, which took place on the theme, ‘Enhancing the Capacity of National Statistical Systems to support policies for Africa’s economic diversification and industrialization.’ Participants identified the importance of national ownership, adequate resources and adequate resources for the region to support statistical transformation initiatives. They called for States to support the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the 2020 round of housing and population censuses.

In a keynote address, Vincent Hendricks, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reflected that scientists do not typically like to sell themselves or their products, believing that their value is “self-evident,” but he said “it doesn’t work that way” in reality. He urged statisticians to realize that they “are the experts and not the politicians” and they should use their data “for the good of their communities.” He called for taking ownership of their data and using it to change their communities, advance democracy and help African governments promote evidence-based policymaking.

The meeting also reflected on key challenges faced by NSOs, including enhancing the capacity of statistical systems and aligning statistics with global, regional and national development agendas. Participants underscored the role of creative and innovative approaches to overcome challenges, and called for all stakeholders to collaborate to meet the growing demand for data to inform and implement development agendas. Participants also supported disaggregating indicators for monitoring basic human rights as a way to address inequalities, and investing in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system.

The Director of the African Centre for Statistics (ACS), Oliver Chinganya, presented the ACS’ proposed strategic framework for the 2018-2019 biennium. The framework aims to “improve the production, dissemination and use of quality data and statistics” within the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. He said the Centre is working to support the design of national strategies on statistics, dissemination of information and best practices and production of harmonized statistics.

Participants took note of the statistical programme and urged UNECA to continue supporting States in building their statistical capacity in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ABCF).

Also within the StatCom-Africa VI meeting, the 13th session of the African Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 3-4 October 2018. The symposium focused on the theme, ‘Application of economic statistics and national accounts in support of sustainable development.’ Countries shared progress and challenges in statistical development in line with the SDGs, with some reporting on how their countries have aligned national development plans with the SDGs.

Others highlighted a lack of data to support SDG indicators. A representative for South Africa said that his country lacks data to compile economic indicators to support monitoring of targets under SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

Officials from governments, international organizations, and philanthropic organizations discussed aligning country visions and donor commitments to deliver SDG 2 and grow enough food to feed the world. The event served as the launch of the ’50 X 2030′ initiative to make data from farming households widely available and address the needs of the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers.

The event titled, ‘Data to End Hunger,’ took place on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the 73rd UN General Assembly (UNGA) high-level week in New York, US, organized by the governments of Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A performance from The Moth’s Global Community Program showcased the importance of data through storytelling, as three storytellers from Africa shared stories from their childhoods.

The project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia and ten in Latin America, by 2030.

Opening the meeting, Claire Melamed, CEO of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, stressed that the SDG targets and indicators are only as good as the data available to monitor them. Rodger Voorhies of the Gates Foundation announced a US$12 million contribution to the 50 X 2030 Initiative. Still under development, the project aims to conduct regular surveys of farming households in 50 low and lower-middle income countries by 2030, and then make the data, combined with other information sources, widely available. The 50 countries will likely include 30 in sub-Saharan Africa, ten in Asia, and ten in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Key partners on the initiative include the Gates Foundation, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Government of Germany’s Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the World Bank, FAO, the Global Donor Platform for Rural Development, and the governments of Ghana, Sierra Leone and Kenya.

Laura Tuck, World Bank, said the initiative will put the countries in the drivers’ seat, being country-demand driven. She added that where there is demand, the World Bank will help countries bridge funding needs to close the data gap through the International Development Association (IDA).

Jose Graziano da Silva, FAO Director-General, highlighted that there are currently 821 million people hungry in the world, and most countries lack the capacity to monitor the SDGs. Gilbert Houngbo, President of IFAD, underscored the need for disaggregated data to ensure no one is left behind in the efforts to end hunger. He called for making technology accessible and available to small holders to enable credible data. He emphasized that we cannot end hunger, ensure improved food security and nutrition, or demonstrate that agriculture is sustainable unless we can measure accurately what we have achieved.

A video presentation highlighted that there are currently 500 million farmers struggling in the world. The next decade will be essential, it said, as with better data they can find ways to double their yields and defeat hunger.

Following the video, delivering remarks on behalf of the President of Kenya, Peter Munya, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives, Kenya, noted that his country represents an exciting market for data, with mobile penetration having reached 90%, and 70% of the population having access to financial services. Observing that 25% of African start-ups are in Kenya, he emphasized the country’s need for a skilled population, a vibrant technological ecosystem, and a private sector that continues to lead. He further highlighted the need for: new data sources, including Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT); multi-stakeholder collaborations, especially with academia and the private sector; and using data for better decision making and building resilience.

Gyan Baffour, Minister for Planning, Ghana, on behalf of Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said the SDGs have put pressure on countries to immediately pay attention to data. He noted that data is an expensive endeavor, and governments are in the position of choosing between investing in data or in the issues that the people they govern see as priorities. Observing that SDG implementation has come at a time of data revolution, he emphasized that countries need significant support and input to learn how to interpret, manage, and use the data obtained from new sources. He said the 50 X 2030 initiative is a critical opportunity to that end.

The Agreement, which was signed by 14 countries on 27 September, is the first to feature specific, binding provisions for the protection of human rights defenders in environmental matters.

Convened by the Governments of Costa Rica and Chile and the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and hosted at Open Society Foundations, the event was co-sponsored by The Access Initiative, Amnesty International, CIVICUS, Derecho, Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (DAR), Namati and World Resources Institute (WRI). It aimed to enable dialogue and inspire countries to sign and ratify the Agreement. As noted in the event materials, the Agreement is the only treaty stemming from the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and the first regional environmental treaty concluded under the auspices of UN ECLAC.

In their welcome remarks, opening speakers noted that it was refreshing to celebrate a positive event in an otherwise “dark and depressing era,” as noted by Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, CIVICUS. Carole Excell, WRI and The Access Initiative, outlined the history of the Agreement, from idea to declaration to roadmap to vision to negotiation to legally binding agreement to adoption, emphasizing the leading role of women throughout the process. Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International, pointed to the fact that the LAC region has the largest number of environmental and human rights defenders that have been assassinated, recognizing rural communities that are “in the line of fire.”

Rounding out the welcome panel, Stacey Cram, Namati and Aída Gamboa, DAR, flagged that the problems addressed by the Escazú Agreement are not limited to LAC countries, and that the agreement is not just a landmark for the region, but for the world. Noting that ratification is just the first step, Cram cautioned that good laws can still be poorly implemented, but expressed hope that the Agreement can trigger a wider discussion on how governments can broaden access to justice beyond the environmental realm.

Chaired by Andrew Steer, President and CEO, WRI, a panel on the importance of the Agreement for the region and environmental defenders highlighted the increased likelihood of transparency around decision-making. Peruvian indigenous activist and environmental defender Lizardo Cauper emphasized that there is now a new legal mechanism to rely on when demanding that technical documents such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs) be made accessible to non-expert audiences, and in languages other than just Spanish or English.

The following panel, led by Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Climate and Energy Leader, Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), discussed how to move from ratification to implementation. He noted the Agreement features that are already present in some countries’ constitutions, and said key questions must now be addressed on implementation mechanisms. Panelists agreed that ratification is not necessarily a prerequisite to implementation, which can begin right away. Andrea Sanhueza, a civil society representative, noted that there is no legal change needed to assess current practices on information, participation and justice to identify where the gaps lie. Describing what is needed, panelists acknowledged the importance of trust among actors, noting that engaging members of the public in government decision making increases the legitimacy of those decisions.

Panelists noted that engaging members of the public in government decision making increases the legitimacy of those decisions.

Viviana Krsticevic, Centro por la Justicia y el Derecho International (CEJIL), flagged that the Agreement’s text strikes the right tone on creating an enabling environment for the protection of rights, for example around not allowing intimidation of community members. Such aspects of the Agreement, she noted, are critical to the issue of “breaking cycles of impunity,” where those with power continue to disregard international norms, human rights and the environment.

Concluding remarks by Epsy Campbell Barr, Vice President and Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship, Costa Rica, José Antônio Marcondes de Carvalho, Undersecretary General for the Environment, Energy and Science and Technology, Brazil, Alicia Bárcena, Executive Secretary, UN ECLAC, and Patrick Gaspard, President, Open Society Foundations, recognized the hard work and leadership by civil society organizations, called for ownership of the Agreement by citizens, reiterated the need for countries to take the next step and ratify the Agreement, and noted that multilateralism in the LAC region remains strong in the face of cynicism and retreats from cross-border cooperation elsewhere.

225,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/experts-provide-guidance-on-data-interoperability-for-sdgs/,"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Experts Provide Guidance on Data Interoperability for SDGs,"22 October 2018: During the second UN World Data Forum, experts launched a guide on data interoperability for development to help improve the integration and reusability of data and data systems. The guide highlights that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires using the best data and information available from multiple sources to design, implement and monitor evidence-based policies, and interpreting and sharing data and information “in a way that is logical and makes sense.”

Authored by Luis Gerardo González Morales, UN Statistics Division (UNSD), and Tom Orrell, Founder, DataReady Limited, on behalf of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), the guide defines interoperability as the ability to join up data without losing meaning. It clarifies that data are interoperable when they can be easily re-used and processed in different applications, allowing different information systems to work together.

The guide titled, ‘Data Interoperability: A Practitioner’s Guide to Joining up Data in the Development Sector,’ proposes a roadmap that can be used as an assessment framework by data managers in development organizations and governments to assess the degree to which their systems are interoperable. It brings together examples of good practices from across the development sector, and notes that new sections, examples and guidance will be used to update the guide.

Chapter 1 on data management, governance and interoperability discusses institutional frameworks and interoperability, oversight and accountability models, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks. It stresses the importance of “effectively governed” data, as data need to be controlled with oversight and accountability as they move within and between organizations during its lifecycle. It also notes that data issues need to be considered cross-cutting, in the same way that gender, human rights and partnership issues are considered in the development field, and calls for more cogent management, funding, oversight and coordination.

Chapter 2 on data and metadata models makes specific recommendations to overcome structural obstacles to data interoperability. It also provides guidance and examples for modelling multi-dimensional data in the development sector.

Chapter 3 explores the role of standard classifications and vocabularies in data interoperability, and highlights examples of commonly used classifications and vocabularies in the development sector. It stresses the need to adopt standard vocabularies and classifications early in order to expose data without ambiguities.

Chapter 4 on open data formats and standard interfaces provides an overview of various approaches that exist to make data “discoverable,” and discusses data formats, application programming interfaces and user interfaces to support interoperability. Chapter 5 on linked open data outlines guidance on the dissemination of data and statistics on the web.

The production of the guide was supported by an Advisory Group drawn from the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability membership. The Collaborative is convened by UNSD and GPSDD, and comprises over 90 individuals, ranging from official statistics representatives to local civil society groups.

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

The trust fund aims to support a healthy and productive ocean, in line with SDG 14 (life below water).



The World Bank designed the trust fund named, ‘PROBLUE,’ to tackle challenges facing the ocean, including marine pollution, overfishing and coastal erosion. PROBLUE aims to address these challenges, promote a healthy ocean and sustainable blue economy and contribute to the World Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing the income and welfare of the poor in a sustainable manner. The initiative is part of the World Bank’s Blue Economy program, which works to ensure the protection and sustainable use of marine resources. Other active projects in the Blue Economy portfolio include activities to tackle marine pollution and implement large regional fisheries programs in Africa and the Pacific.

The World Bank’s Blue Economy program works to ensure the protection and sustainable use of marine resources.

PROBLUE will focus on four key themes: fisheries and aquaculture management; marine pollution, including plastics and marine litter; sustainable development of ocean sectors, including tourism, offshore renewable energy and maritime transport; and government capacity to manage marine and coastal resources in an integrated way.

To date, donors have contributed approximately US$75 million to PROBLUE. Norway provided the initial pledge to the Fund, with US$15 million as part of a planned multi-year contribution. Canada announced it will contribute US$50 million to PROBLUE. Germany, Sweden, Iceland and the European Commission (EC) have also provided financial contributions. Denmark and France are anticipated to make contributions to the Fund.

An official signing ceremony for the trust fund will take place at the Our Ocean Conference in Bali, Indonesia, in October 2018.

228,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-finds-poor-outlook-for-pacific-coral-reefs/,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Report Finds Poor Outlook for Pacific Coral Reefs,"27 September 2018: The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) launched a report titled, ‘Status and Trends of Coral Reefs for the Pacific,’ which highlights the role of the region’s coral reefs in the life and culture of eight million Pacific islanders. The report will contribute to reporting for the SDGs and is a response to the priorities identified in the SAMOA Pathway and Pacific Oceanscape Framework.

The report is the culmination of a two-year process initiated at the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) Pacific Workshop, which took place in 2016. The preparation of regional periodic coral reef assessments is the main substantive activity of the GCRMN. UNEP and SPREP developed the report in partnership with the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) and the Centre for Island Research and Environmental Observatory (CRIOBE), with financial support from the Governments of France, Sweden and the US. The report is also expected to inform the mid-term review of the SAMOA Pathway and development of the Pacific Coral Reef Action Plan 2020-2030, which SPREP coordinates.

The report analyzes long-term trends in coral reef health using primary data, including 20,000 surveys collected for 129 islands that cover nearly three decades. Although overall coral cover in the Pacific is relatively stable in comparison with other world regions, the report finds a statistically significant decline in coral cover across the Pacific reefs. In addition, coral reefs in the Pacific remain “less stressed” compared to reefs elsewhere, with strong potential for coral, fish and invertebrate populations to recover following damaging events. However, the report concludes that while many Pacific reefs appear healthy and resilient now, “the outlook is poor” over the longer term as a result of increasing human-induced threats and global climate change.

Key drivers impacting the region’s coral reefs range from overfishing and sedimentation from poor land use to unsustainable tourism.

According to the report, herbivorous fish have declined, particularly in inhabited islands, which has contributed to a shift towards more dominant coral species and a highly variable microalga cover because of the role of these fish in maintaining balance in coral ecosystems and controlling algae growth.

The main drivers of change in coral cover at large scales are coral bleaching driven by climate change, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns seastars and natural stresses from cyclones and storms. At more local scales, key drivers impacting the region’s coral reefs include overfishing and destructive fishing, sedimentation from poor land use, pollution from farming and domestic waste, coral and sand mining, coastal and inland development and unsustainable tourism. Additional threats include improper waste management and introduction of invasive species.

Traditional management practices, such as temporary or permanent closure of fisheries areas or bans on some species, remain “particularly strong in the Pacific” and play a key role in coral reef conservation. The report notes that many countries and territories have sound legislation to manage coral reefs but lack the capacity, logistic resources and occasionally the political will for enforcement.

Recommendations focus on strengthening and adapting local-scale management actions to support healthy reef communities and associated ecosystems, including for human livelihoods. The report recommends, inter alia: reducing overfishing and habitat degradation to maximize coral reef resilience; developing more marine protected areas (MPAs) and strengthening their enforcement and linkages with other MPAs; supporting community-based management efforts; improving catchment management to control damaging coastal development and reduce downstream pollution; and addressing unsustainable resource use and excess population growth. On climate change, the report calls for urgently combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and developing national adaptation strategies.

The report includes the following countries and territories: American Samoa; the Northern Mariana Islands; Cook Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM); Fiji; French Polynesia; Guam; Hawaii; Kiribati; the Marshall Islands; New Caledonia; North Western Hawaiian Islands; Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument; Palau; Papua New Guinea (PNG); Pitcairn Islands; New Caledonia; Samoa; Tonga; Vanuatu; and Wallis and Futuna. Five Pacific island States were not included in the report due to data limitations.

The digital platform will help safeguard business viability in the face of climate change and enable companies to engage with peers to benefit the communities in which they operate. The announcement was made at the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS).

Participating companies commit to the development of shared tools that will enable them to embed climate resilience throughout their value chains. The tools include investigative methods for examining physical climate risk, as well as means of enhancing resilience through initiatives such as Science Based Targets.

According to CDP data, 76% of suppliers reported climate risk as having the potential to significantly alter their business.

David Wei, BSR’s Climate Director, noted that participating companies understand the importance of coming together around “a common, science-based approach to value chain resilience… to mitigate climate change-related impacts.” The platform will be used for companies to share data – an increasing trend, even among competitors, as common commodities and services are put at risk by issues such as water scarcity and extreme weather events.

Coca-Cola and Mars Incorporated were among the first companies to join. Barry Parkin, Chief Sustainability and Procurement Officer, Mars, emphasized the need to “shift long-term models for corporate buying” so that they are based on principles of reliability, resilience and risk management. Data from CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) cited in BSR’s press release highlight that 76% of suppliers reported climate risk as having the power to significantly alter their business.

The project seeks to serve as communication and educational tool to engage the global public in the SDGs.



The Good Life Goals is a joint initiative, and the 10-YFP Sustainable Lifestyles and Education programme, co-led by the governments of Sweden and Japan, is represented in the project by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES). Launching the goals at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, Solitaire Townsend, Co-founder of Futerra, remarked that sharing a set of clear Good Life Goals and meaningful actions for each SDG can help build confidence that everyone is important, needed, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

For each SDG, the Good Life Goals propose five actions that people can take to have tangible impact on the SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the project outlines the five following actions to “help end poverty”: i) learn the causes of poverty at home and abroad; ii) share and donate what you can; iii) buy from companies that pay people fairly; iv) save, borrow and invest responsibly; and v) demand decent wages and opportunities for all.

On SDG 13 (climate action), the project suggests to “act on climate” by: i) learning about climate solutions; ii) calling “for more renewable energy in your country;” iii) eating more plants and cutting down on meat; iv) walking and cycling rather than driving; and v) demanding leaders to take bold action “today.” A video on the Good Life Goals provides an overview of the actions that can be taken for each of the SDGs.

A WBCSD press release notes that, from a business perspective, the Good Life Goals can provide companies with valuable insight into the ways the SDGs link to the actions, activities and lifestyles of their customers, and this understanding can help brands more effectively engage with people around the behaviors that are connected to their products and services. WBCSD also remarks that exploring the linkages between people’s day-to-day lives and the SDGs can help businesses identify innovation opportunities capable of offering better and more sustainable lifestyles. Finally, the Good Life Goals can be used by brands, NGOs and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing sustainable development, and can provide companies with a simple tool that they can use to enhance awareness of the SDGs among their own staff and promote a corporate culture that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, WBCSD says.

DESA aims to launch the network in April 2019.



Providing opening remarks, DESA head Liu Zhenmin highlighted projected investment needs to meet the ambition of the SDGs, estimated at US$5-7 trillion per year. He cautioned that “the bulk of the required investment will need to be long-term,” and therefore the challenge is to engage actors that can provide such finance at scale, such as pension funds.

DESA envisions replicating the Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development (SISD) network at global level. The global network would align with the UN Secretary-General’s Financing Strategy, which was released in September 2019. It is intended to complement the SDG Investment Fair, which also was launched recently, and the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum).

The report titled, ‘Progress on Transboundary Water Cooperation under the Water Convention,’ is based on self-assessments submitted by 38 of the 40 countries that were Parties at the time of the reporting exercise in 2017.

In her introduction to the report, Olga Algayerova, UNECE Executive Secretary, hailed the report as a major “milestone,” highlighting that it also contributes to understanding the status of action on SDG target 6.5 on integrated water resources management (IWRM) and transboundary cooperation.

Countries that are not Parties to the Convention could use the reporting template to gain insight into what they would need to do to implement the treaty.

The self-reporting exercise was the first of its kind to be undertaken through the UNECE Water Convention, known in full as the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. Using a common template, countries reported on the existence of agreements, joint bodies, strategies and activities for cooperation. The exercise showed that most transboundary waters shared by signatories to the Convention already have agreements and arrangements in place; however, at least 15 transboundary river and lake basins do not have an agreement or arrangement in place for the whole basin, and at least 29 do not have agreements or arrangements covering transboundary aquifers. The report highlights several challenges for Parties to the Convention, including the need to harmonize governance systems, better engage with stakeholders, address climate variability, meet financing needs, and build technical capacity in the countries.

UNECE and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are co-custodians of SDG target 6.5. UNECE suggests that even countries that are not Parties to the Convention could benefit from using the reporting template, as it will give insight into what they would need to do to implement the Convention, and can also help them report progress against SDG indicator 6.5.2 on the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation.

The report was released in the lead-up the eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Water Convention (MOP-8), which takes place in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 10-12 October 2018. Parties to the Convention meet every three years.

Originally a European agreement, the Convention opened for global signature in 2016 and now has 41 Parties, with Chad acceding to the Convention in February 2018, and Senegal in September 2018.

Participants underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063, and recognized the importance of collaborative efforts between the UN and the AU to strengthen multilateralism.



The ADS was launched by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA), and took place from 17-18 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, alongside the UNGA’s debate on the development of Africa, on 19 October. The two-day series replaces the UN’s annual Africa Week, which had taken place since 2010.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored inclusive, sustainable development in Africa as both “a goal unto itself” and “also a leading tool to prevent conflict and crises.” He observed the region’s progress towards improved governance, stability and resilience. At the same time, Guterres recognized that parts of Africa remain fragile, and expressed concern about high levels of debt in some countries, volatile financial markets and looming trade conflicts. He noted that climate change impacts will “create additional strains” in the future.

Speakers also underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda and the AU’s Agenda 2063. Guterres observed that the approaches and policies of the UN and the AU “are more closely aligned than ever before” and both call for a prosperous, peaceful and secure continent based on good governance, human rights and the rule of law and aim to leave no one behind.

On gender equality, participants welcomed Ethiopia’s new government cabinet, which has achieved full gender parity among its ministers. The UN Secretary-General identified the AU as a crucial partner in the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to end violence against women and girls by 2030.

On climate change, the UN Secretary-General called for a “huge leap in investment” to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change in Africa, and called on developed countries to deliver on both finance and technology commitments.

On SDG follow-up and review, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Inga Rhonda King said the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will focus on the SDGs related to climate change (Goal 13), education (Goal 4), inequality (Goal 10), justice (Goal 16), jobs (Goal 8) and partnerships (Goal 17). She called on African countries to share their lessons learned to ensure progress on the 2030 Agenda.

Speakers underscored linkages between peace, security and development, with several recognizing Africa’s contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. The UN Special Adviser on Africa, Bience Gawanas, said the region seeks to “achieve peace, prosperity and socio-economic transformation,” and urged all actors to respond to Africa’s challenges in a coherent, coordinated manner. UN Security Council President Sacha Sergio Llorenty (Bolivia) highlighted the role of young people and women in peace and development efforts in Africa. He called for high-level political support to ensure their meaningful participation.

Speakers also welcomed the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and recognized the importance of financing for Africa to achieve the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 and the Paris Agreement. The dialogue also reflected on reform processes within both the UN and the AU.

The initiative will focus strategically on the intrinsically interconnected areas of biodiversity and climate change.

The 21 million Euro Joint Pacific Initiative for Biodiversity, Climate Change and Resilience was launched during the One Planet Summit in New York, US, one year after it was announced by French President Emmanual Macron at the 2017 edition of the Summit. The EU and France are contributing 10 million Euros each, with an additional one million Euros coming from New Zealand and Australia. The initiative also welcomes contributions from other donors.

The initiative aims to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding for climate action and biodiversity protection.

The joint communique by the four partners mentions that the initiative translates into concrete action their commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, complemented by the new European Consensus on Development, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Noting that these international agreements set global climate efforts on a new course, providing the international community “with an unprecedented opportunity for progress,” the communique links the initiative with SDGs 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land), 3 (good health and well-being), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The communique further explains that the project embraces “the twin goals” of climate action and biodiversity protection, with the initiative seeking to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding in these areas. By pooling resources and coordinating actions, it aims to help the Pacific region adapt to the effects of climate change, protect biodiversity, and increase resilience.

More specifically, the initiative will finance projects in areas such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, ocean governance (including sustainable fisheries and aquaculture), and the environment (including waste management, biodiversity and eco-tourism).

The initiative is linked to the Pacific-EU Marine Partnership (PEUMP) programme launched by the EU, Sweden, and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) at the Our Ocean Conference in Malta, in October 2017.

236,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/new-metrics/addressing-sdg4-3-steps-to-a-sustainable-ocean-supply-chain,"Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 14: 3 Steps to a Sustainable Ocean Supply Chain,"Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface and are home to 80 percent of life on earth. Fish, which provide 20 percent of daily protein intake to about 3.1 billion people, is among the most widely traded food commodities — at a value of US$145 billion annually.

The demand for fishing poses a key problem. Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013. As a response, aquaculture and fish farming have increased in popularity, but the unmanaged expansion has caused pollution and habitat degradation, leading to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn, contributes to ocean acidification.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), implemented to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), include SDG 14 — Life Below Water, which aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources” of the world.

The challenge today is for corporations to fully embrace the concept that the oceans are an essential resource that need to be carefully managed to support a sustainable future. The question that remains is, how can the global community source fish in such a way that contributes to economic and business growth, without endangering the environment?

Three steps can promote sustainable fishing throughout company supply chains within the guidance of SDG 14:

Step 1: Map the supply chain to identify sources of risks

Operating a supply chain in line with SDG 14 offers businesses many benefits. The Goal aims to preserve the world’s oceans, ensure resources can be exploited sustainably, and fight poverty in the regions where fisheries and aquaculture are most common. Managing the supply chain in this way allows companies to reduce risks, secure resources and increase the positive impact of their activities. A supply chain risk assessment aligned with SDG 14 allows companies to know exactly where to focus efforts, making actions more effective.

SDG 14 identifies the environmental and social aspects affecting oceans, and is an excellent starting point for structuring an action plan. Companies can endorse external initiatives that promote sustainability and the protection of oceans, such as the FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the Global Aquaculture Alliance or the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation.

Protecting the oceans is a task that requires actions in several different areas. For example, promoting environmental best practices for aquaculture and fish farm suppliers is vital to ensure success at an environmental and business level. Research has shown that better environmental performance of farms can improve yield and economic results, which also translates into better living conditions and progress for local communities. If the supply chain relies on catching fish in open waters, then special attention must be paid to reduce the amount of by-catch, minimizing the impact on the natural environment and allowing oceans to maintain their natural balance.

Step 3: Get certified

Finally, making the company’s commitment known is important for all stakeholders, especially for customers. Being certified is one way for companies to show they are taking full responsibility for sustainability. There are different schemes that verify and attest for responsible sourcing, such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Chain of Custody Standard certification or the ASMI Chain of Custody. Companies can also aim at obtaining eco-labels, such as France’s Label Rouge. Obtaining these certifications requires constant auditing, which helps companies ensure that the supply chain is well managed and sustainable, working towards the achievement of SDG 14.

Ocean plastic pollution has become a topic of great concern; it was even the theme of this year’s Earth Day. There is still hope that our ocean will finally get the attention it deserves — but only if companies, governments and citizens begin to act now to protect and improve the health of our seas and coastal areas through sustainable use of marine resources.","Almost one-third of marine fish stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2013, leading to a decline of stock from 90 percent in 1974 to 68.6 percent in 2013.

237,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-environment-announces-global-plastics-platform-highlights-countries-commitments/,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UN Environment Announces Global Plastics Platform, Highlights Countries’ Commitments","25 September 2018: The EU and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) held a high-level event on the theme, ‘Fighting Plastic Pollution: A Global Race to the Top,’ featuring countries’ latest plans for addressing plastic pollution. The side event served as the launch of UNEP’s Global Plastics Platform, which will encourage and support commitments to reduce plastic pollution.

Frans Timmermans, European Commission, opened the event held at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018. He said plastic pollution has gained widespread attention, but regulation is still needed. Referring to the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, adopted in early 2018, he said the EU plans to make plastics more circular and to ban them where there are feasible consumer alternatives.

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle urged participants to “rethink the whole problem of single-use, throwaway goods,” as recycling “only marks the start of another problem.”

Erik Solheim, UN Environment Executive Director, said the economic threat of plastic pollution can become an opportunity. He said UN Environment has established a Global Plastics Platform, which will support countries and cities in establishing policies to reduce plastic pollution. UN Environment notes that in 2018, a number of countries announced plans to ban single-use plastics: India said it will ban all single-use plastic by 2022; Botswana, Chile and Peru announced plastic bag bans; Nigeria revealed plans to establish recycling plants across the country; and Brazil announced a national plan on plastics.

In addition to policy support, the Platform will explore ways to change the design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, in line with a transition to a more circular economy. UN Environment reports that such efforts will include identifying opportunities to reduce economic and industrial waste. The Platform will build on and advance the World Economic Forum-hosted Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, the work of the Regional Seas Conventions, and other existing initiatives and partnerships.

UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

Susan Goldberg, National Geographic, moderated a panel with heads of state and ministers from Aruba, Canada, Colombia, Iceland, Norway and Rwanda, as well as business leaders in retail and waste management. Officials from other countries spoke from the floor. Speakers highlighted several commitments, policies and initiatives, including on single-use plastics:

Aruba will ban all single-use plastics by 2020, following its 2016 ban on single-use plastic bags;

Spain will ban plastic bags in 2021;

Rwanda has drafted a law banning single-use plastics, following its 2008 ban on plastic bags;

Norway is considering a ban on single-use plastics in coordination with the EU;

Kenya is working with the East African Community to extend its plastic bag ban to other countries;

Sweden and Costa Rica are working to reduce single-use plastics at the UN and in its missions, including through sustainable procurement practices;

Costa Rica has a national strategy to replace single-use plastics with renewable and combustible alternatives; and

Iceland places a recycling fee on plastic goods.

Canada banned the sale of microbeads in 2018, and Iceland is developing a policy on microplastics. Norway is establishing a producer responsibility scheme for discarded fishing gear. In Iceland, discarded fishing gear can be traced to its owner.

Colombia is implementing a strategy for packaging and packaging waste. The country expects to make use of 30% of its waste by 2030, and is managing waste through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The world’s fourth largest retailer, the Schwarz Group, is developing a strategy to reduce and recycle all of its packaging. Spain is finalizing a circular economy strategy called España Circular 2030, which will include plastic pollution measures.

In addition, Norway launched a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy on 24 September 2018, which will report in 2020. Norway also provided the initial pledge to the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund to support healthy and productive oceans, including by tackling marine pollution.

Almost all speakers underlined the need to engage the public and key stakeholders in order for the policies to succeed. Aruba’s Prime Minister noted that people resisted the 2016 ban on plastic bags, because the government had not worked to raise awareness before the policy change. She said that in preparation for the 2020 ban, officials have involved stakeholders to ensure that “people are begging for the decision.” Norway’s climate and environment minister said the government must involve the fishing industry in order to better control illegal discarding of fishing gear and waste at sea. Canada’s environment minister said that once the public learned about microbeads in everyday products, they agreed that it was a problem.

Suez, a leading waste and water management company, said 93% of plastic products use virgin materials, and encouraged increasing the amount of recycled plastic. France also called for businesses to include recycled plastics in their products, and said France will build on Canada’s work on plastics pollution as the Group of 7 (G7) president. In June 2018, the Ocean Plastics Charter was endorsed at the Canada-hosted G7 Summit by the EU, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

Canada noted that even with Canada being “good at recycling,” the rate is only 11%, so the chemicals industry has a role to play in finding “leapfrog solutions.” The UK noted the launch in partnership with Canada of a PPP, the Global Plastics Action Partnership. She called on companies such as Suez to make it easier to recycle plastic waste.

Sweden said it is spending US$10 million per year until 2020 to cover municipalities’ costs for cleanup, promote innovation to combat microplastic pollution, and reduce discarded fishing gear. Sweden also established a government inquiry on possible measures to “go beyond EU legislation” on marine pollution. She highlighted the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Ad Hoc Open Ended Expert Group to identify options for combating marine litter for consideration by UNEA-4, noting the need for stronger global and regional architecture on the issue. The Union for the Mediterranean said it is working to identify marine litter hotspots in the Mediterranean region.

Turning to the local level, the mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, highlighted the health consequences of uncollected waste. She said Freetown’s approach will include: getting collection systems working, which needs investment; starting a recycling system and encouraging more businesses to join the sector; innovation and competition for clearing waste and fighting plastic; and joining the move to ban single-use plastic.

The Office of UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said the UNGA President will launch a global campaign and call to action to address plastic waste “once and for all.” She observed that the UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

238,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/kew-report-showcases-potential-of-fungi-to-tackle-plastic-pollution/,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Kew Report Showcases Potential of Fungi to Tackle Plastic Pollution,"1 October 2018: The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew has released a report that describes how a plastic-eating fungus could help to tackle the world’s growing plastic waste problem. The report underscores the “fundamental importance” in understanding the contribution of fungi to biodiversity and its ecological functions.

The first-ever ‘State of the World’s Fungi’ report describes the world’s fungi, and presents positive interactions and insights on fungi, including positive plant-fungal interactions and useful fungi. Fungi, which are closer to animals than plants, provide carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, and can even prevent desertification in drought-prone regions of the world. In addition, fungi support processes that humans rely on for everyday life, from medical applications to cleaning up the environment through bioremediation and synthesis of biofuels. As an illustration, Penicillium plays a role in cheese production, antibiotics and the synthesis of third-generation contraceptive pills. The report estimates that the global market for edible mushrooms is worth US$42 billion annually.

The report shares the findings from a study on the potential of fungi to break down plastic waste. When fungi “eat,” they secrete enzymes and absorb dissolved organic matter back into their cells. In Islamabad, Pakistan, researchers isolated the Aspergillus tubingensis fungus, in a waste site in the soil. They found that fungus was able to biodegrade polyester polyurethane (PU), a plastic, into smaller pieces. PU is used in products like synthetic leather and fridge insulation. This study suggests fungi could be developed into “one of the tools desperately needed to address the growing environmental problem of plastic waste.”

The Aspergillus tubingensis fungus has been found to be able to biodegrade polyester polyurethane into smaller pieces.

In addition, fungi, such as Rhodotorula taiwanensis, are starting to be used to clean up sites contaminated by radioactive waste. Scientists are sequencing its genome to understand how this fungus survives and how it can be developed to clean up soils contaminated by radioactive waste.

The report states that 2,189 new species of fungi were described during 2017. An additional two million species of fungi have not yet been described, a task that the report identifies as of “fundamental importance” to the understanding of biodiversity and its ecological functions. In the report’s introduction, Kew Director of Science, Katherine Willis, emphasizes that fungi “should be viewed on a par with the plant and animal kingdoms,” explaining that the world has just begun to “scratch the surface of knowledge” of this group of organisms.

Fungi also provide benefits to agriculture. The report explains that endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi have the potential to reduce the need for fertilizers and pesticides, increasing the sustainability and environmental impacts of agriculture. Fungi also enhance crops’ nutrient uptake and increase their resilience to environmental stresses. The report underscores the applications of fungi to agriculture as a potentially significant resource for future development.

The report also presents challenges, observing that some species of fungi “can wreak havoc” on ecosystems and crops. For instance, fungal pathogens can devastate wild plant communities and crops, a challenge, the report observes, that is increasing with climate change. Examples include fungi that cause lethal diseases to trees, such as dogwood anthracnose, which affects native dogwoods, beech bark disease and white pine blister rust. The report considers a number of integrated approaches to minimize these threats and reduce the impact of fungal disease and calls for increased attention to understanding the impact of climate change on the fungal kingdom.

More than 100 scientists from 18 countries contributed to the report, which is the part of Kew’s ‘State of the World’s’ series.

We focus particularly on knowledge offerings relating to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 10 (reduced inequalities).

Technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems, according to WDR 2019.

The World Development Report (WDR) 2019, released during the meetings by the World Bank Group, focuses on “the changing nature of work,” particularly in the face of technological advances and fears that automation will replace employees with machines. The publication asserts that such fears are unfounded, noting that technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems. It considers issues raised by automation and digitization vis-à-vis businesses, and reviews how these impacts can be harnessed to promote social protection and inclusion, describing the idea of a new social contract. A summary blog on the report is also available. The report also presents the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which was formally launched in Bali. A World Bank press release notes that “jobs of the future require more investment in people.”

However, Sophie Edwards reports on Devex that civil society responses to the WDR have been less than positive, due to “a strong deregulatory thrust” and “attacks on many basic work rights” in a world where “technology is pushing down the value of labor in the economy.” Edwards notes that in a side session during the annual meetings, World Bank staff painted an optimistic scenario where new opportunities are created, but flagged that the poorest citizens and informal workers may not be able access those new jobs without increases in social protections from governments.

Also exploring fears of negative impacts on employment, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive Development released a report titled, ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth: From paralysis to preparation.’ The report examines the impact of technological innovation on growth, jobs and livelihoods, recognizing that “technologies are radically transforming peoples’ lives.” It explores whether frontier technologies such as machine learning will indeed benefit the world’s poorest. The Commission finds that estimates of job losses due to automation—which range from 9-80%—are misleading because the methodologies behind them tend to “ignore the upsides of technological progress” that often result in new opportunities. The report identifies five pathways that developing counties can pursue to ensure inclusive growth: 1) raising value from agriculture; 2) new global value chains in manufacturing; 3) global trade in services; 4) linking the informal sector to the formal economy; and 5) diverse, connected domestic economies that reduce costs and increase innovation. Across these pathways, the Commission underscores the need to create “a digital-ready country” that guides markets towards innovation through broad support for entrepreneurs and maximizes inclusiveness by ensuring a level playing field. The Commission is hosted by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.

Shanta Devarajan, Acting Chief Economist of the World Bank, compares the two publications above – ‘The Changing Nature of Work’ and ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth’ – in a post on The Brookings Institution’s blog titled, ‘the future of inclusive growth.’ Devarajan notes that both paint “an optimistic picture of the impact of technology on developing countries” and “provide a robust platform for harnessing the power of technology for inclusive growth.” Each report, he explains, addresses the impacts of technology on inequality, noting that efficiency gains outlined in the Pathways report can benefit poorer segments of society. He writes that farmers, who tend to have comparatively low incomes, could benefit from improved crop yields driven by data analytics and biotechnology. However, he cautions that the WDR articulates a blurring of firms’ boundaries, changing production patterns and employment trajectories.

Turning to SDG 10, Development Finance International (DFI) and Oxfam launched the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2018. The index, which assesses governments by their initiatives to bridge the gap between rich and poor, focuses on efforts in three policy areas: social spending, progressive taxation, and higher wages and stronger labor rights for workers (particularly women). This second edition builds on the 2017’s “beta version,” adding new sub-indicators in the tax and labor categories. Top overall performers include Denmark, Germany and Finland, while laggards are Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Haiti. However, the findings stress that all of the 157 countries it covers “could do more, even those near the top.”

IBON International published a paper, titled, ‘Implementing the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): Reinforcing Corporate Capture of the Global South.’ The piece looks into the implementation of the MFD model in Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, and articulates a need to move beyond this approach. The authors argue that the systematization of private actors in the model poses risks to peoples’ right to participate in development. They cite a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report that finds “differences in private and social returns” of “bankable” projects under the MFD approach, and call for national development strategies to “be owned and led by the people… whose rights to land, social services and to development are at stake.”

On financing poverty eradication more broadly, Development Initiatives launched ‘Investments to End Poverty 2018’ during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The report explores ways of strengthening aid amidst a “rapidly changing development finance landscape,” the mobilization of all resources to leave no one behind, and moving from data to impact through increased transparency. The executive summary emphasizes that business as usual leaves people behind, and that urgent action is needed to change trajectories on meeting aid commitments and identifying the synergies between difference resources. It highlights growing global inequality, lamenting that that the world’s poorest are “falling further and further behind,” that information provision has not kept pace with the need for disaggregated data, and that investments must be made to ensure both wellbeing and economic potential, such as social protection, health and education.

Finally, as noted above, the World Bank launched its Human Capital Index, one pillar of the Human Capital Project, which aims to raise awareness on lack of investments in “human capital,” which encompasses peoples’ skills, health, knowledge, and resilience. Investing in these areas can enable increased productivity, flexibility and innovation, and can act as “a central driver of sustainable growth and poverty reduction,” the authors argue. The Index reviews five indicators on health and education that can be linked to productivity as an adult, in order to arrive at an aggregate score between 0 and 1. As noted by Devex, Singapore tops the list with a score of 0.88. The Human Capital Summit was held on 11 October 2018, in the margins of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

A report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, ‘Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them,’ examines why some emerging economies have grown faster and more consistently than others. The report examines 71 developing economies and identifies two factors that help explain their “outperformance”: a policy agenda that promotes growth, and the role of large companies. Among other findings, the authors highlight changes in the global landscape on demographics, trade patterns and the digital revolution, which they note provide new opportunities in both manufacturing and services.

240,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ramsar-global-outlook-wetlands-under-far-greater-threat-than-forests/,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Ramsar Global Outlook: “Wetlands Under Far Greater Threat Than Forests”,"1 October 2018: Wetlands, which comprise the world’s most economically valuable ecosystems and essential regulators of the global climate, are disappearing three times faster than forests. This is one of the key findings of the first-ever Global Wetland Outlook (GWO) published by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

Titled, ‘Global Wetland Outlook: The Importance of Global Wetlands to Sustainable Development,’ the report provides an overview of the status of global wetlands, including their extent, trends, drivers of change and the responses needed to reverse the historical decline in wetland area and quality. It also highlights measures being taken by Parties to the Ramsar Convention to reverse wetland decline. The GWO was published ahead of the 13th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 13) to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which takes place from 21-29 October 2018 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Among key findings, the GWO concludes that: approximately 35% of the world’s wetlands were lost between 1970-2015, with annual rates of loss accelerating from 2000; the economic value of services provided by wetlands “far exceeds” those of terrestrial ecosystems, with inland wetlands, for example, valued at five times more than tropical forests, the most valuable terrestrial habitat; and wetlands contribute to 75 SDG indicators. The report estimates that up to 40% of the world’s species live and breed in wetlands, and more than 25% of all wetland plants and animals are currently at risk of extinction.

The GWO also highlights the role of wetlands in providing, directly or indirectly, “almost all of the world’s consumption of freshwater,” and supporting the livelihoods of more than one billion people.

The report attributes wetland losses to “megatrends” such as climate change, population increase, urbanization, particularly of coastal zones and river deltas, and changing consumption patterns, noting that these trends have fueled changes to land and water use. The report finds, inter alia, that wetland-dependent species have been in serious decline since 1970, with 81% of inland wetland species populations and 36% of coastal and marine species affected.

Perverse incentives for farmers and business such as subsidies for agriculture that encourage wetland conversion or pollution should be ended.

Introducing the report, Martha Rojas Urrego, Ramsar Convention Secretary General, describes the findings as a “wake-up call,” not only on the steep rate of loss of the world’s wetlands but also on the critical services they provide. “Without them, the global agenda on sustainable development will not be achieved,” she emphasizes.

According to the GWO, wetlands currently cover more than 12.1 million square kilometers, an area greater than Greenland. Between 13% and 18% (2,300 sites) are on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance. The report however expresses concern that wetlands remain “dangerously undervalued” by policy and decision makers in national plans, terming it an “inexplicable omission,” given the pivotal role wetlands play in delivering global commitments on climate change, sustainable development, biodiversity and disaster risk reduction (DRR).

Cautioning that it is not enough to merely designate new wetland sites for protection, the GWO emphasizes the necessity of developing effective wetland management plans and integrating wetlands into the planning and implementation of national plans on sustainable development, climate change and other key global commitments.

The report also stresses the role of good governance and effective institutions at local, national, and regional levels as a crucial factor in preventing, ending, and reversing trends in wetland loss and degradation. It calls for more accurate data on wetland extent and wetland inventories to help countries identify priority sites for restoration, highlighting indigenous and local knowledge, as well as citizen science, as invaluable resources on the state of wetlands that should be better used.

Drawing on successful examples across the world, the report recommends using existing funding mechanisms to apply economic and financial incentives for communities and business to protect wetlands through tax benefits. Perverse incentives for farmers and business such as subsidies for agriculture that encourage wetland conversion or pollution should be ended.

The GWO builds on a number of complementary global assessments and initiatives, including: the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment); the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB); the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); the Global Land Outlook (GLO) by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD); the Thematic Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES); and input from other biodiversity- and water-related multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs).

An open letter signed by the International Organization Partners of the Ramsar Convention, issued in conjunction with the publication of the GWO, raises concern that the world is off-track to achieve SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). The co-signatories, including BirdLife International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Wetlands International, Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), describe the GWO as “a clear wake-up call that we are not collectively doing enough,” and calls on COP 13 to show the leadership and ambition needed to protect all wetlands, from rivers to coral reefs. The letter highlights the role of Ramsar Advisory Missions in providing an essential service to Parties to the Ramsar Convention by enabling countries to mobilize and apply expertise to help them tackle existing and future threats.

The GWO emerged from Ramsar Resolution XII.5, which called upon the Convention’s Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP) to update and expand upon Ramsar Briefing Note 7 titled, ‘State of the World’s Wetlands and Their Services to People: A Compilation of Recent Analyses.’ The Standing Committee subsequently identified this task as among the STRP’s highest priorities. 170 countries have ratified the Ramsar Convention, which seeks to protect wetlands and promote their wise use.

241,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/addressing-sdg-5-5-steps-to-promote-gender-equality-in-the-supply-chain,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 5: 5 Steps to Promote Gender Equality in the Supply Chain,"In 2015, the world got one step closer to a better future when 193 countries committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a framework for addressing the global community’s most critical economic, social and environmental challenges. These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Specifically, SDG 5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and should be a critical consideration for global supply chains, as there’s tremendous opportunity to make an impact. Women hold 60 to 90 percent of global supply chain jobs, particularly in the apparel and agricultural sectors, and represent the majority of workers in low-wage jobs in the lower tiers of the value chain. Despite their prevalent role, women lack access to social protection measures, especially maternity protection, and face limited career opportunities.

There are five steps companies in all industries and sizes can take to reap the benefits of gender equality in the supply chain.

1. Increase transparency with better metrics and reporting.

Setting up meaningful and accurate metrics and goals, appropriate to the size and sector of the organization, is key for quality reporting, which in the end means more transparency into sustainable progress. When teams have the right metrics for evaluating where the company and its suppliers stand on gender equality, it’s easier to set targets, measure success and benchmark performance against competition.

Start with the most basic key performance indicators (KPIs), such as gender ratio across various roles and the corresponding level of remuneration. GRI G4 standards provide robust reporting frameworks for gender equality and diversity.

2. Prioritize robust policies and programs.

If policies and programs to tackle gender inequality don’t exist in your supply chain, it is high time to design and implement them. When gender equality is weaved into the management system and this foundation for progress is in place, the next step is to prioritize gender-related programs. For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth. The cosmetics giant has put forward a sustainable sourcing program that specifically addresses the vulnerability of women when it comes to climate change. The cumulative effects of poverty, cultural and social barriers, exacerbated by climate change, put the health, wellbeing and livelihood of women at great risk. L’Oréal is addressing this critical issue through research and regional programs that empower women and help them diversify their income, and by supporting external initiatives such as Women4Climate, designed to create sustainable and inclusive communities.

A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality. One key step is to support female entrepreneurs or companies with a mission to fight gender inequality. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that in 2018 there are 30 percent more male entrepreneurs in the world and that women make up only 40 percent of the new entrepreneurs in the U.S. This makes it even more imperative to support the existing 200 million female business owners worldwide and encourage growth of female entrepreneurship across the globe. A company can send a strong message by selecting suppliers with effective gender-specific policies and programs in place. This is especially relevant for the retail and agricultural sectors, where low-tier workers are predominantly women.

4. Benefit from global expertise.

Demonstrate commitment to global goals and gender parity by partnering with leading organizations and joining key initiatives. As robust as gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs may be, there’s a lot to be gained by formally endorsing worldwide initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and HeForShe’s IMPACT 10x10x10 framework, or joining other national or local initiatives. Participating in well-established initiatives offers the chance to dip into a network of global experts on critical subjects and access best practices and tools that that can break through barriers to gender equality in your own operations and throughout your global supply chain.

5. Educate and train suppliers.

Forced and child labor is firmly on the agenda of most large corporations. However, few acknowledge the vulnerability of girls and women to modern slavery: Females constitute 99 percent of victims in the commercial industry and 58 percent in other sectors. By eliminating forced and child labor in your supply chain, you strongly contribute to achieving SDG 5. Engaging suppliers is key here — selecting only pre-qualified suppliers, continuous monitoring and training of existing suppliers, and engaging them in the conversation about gender parity and your vision of a fair and equal workplace are the most fundamental steps to have in place.

The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues. However, gender is an inalienable component of every other global goal. Educating girls and preventing child marriage helps eliminate global poverty, and full and equal participation of girls and women in global politics will definitely bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which the SDGs support.","These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Five UN entities shared their expertise on illicit trafficking in wildlife and strengthening wildlife legislation.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) organized the Symposium, which convened in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, from 11-12 September 2018. Participants representing criminal justice authorities and national wildlife management authorities came from over 19 francophone and lusophone African countries to attend the event.

In advance of the Symposium, a survey found that countries in Central and West Africa apply more lax penalties for wildlife crime compared to East Africa and Asia, which apply tougher penalties, both in terms of prison time and monetarily. In Central and West Africa, the average prison time for wildlife crime is two months, with an average maximum prison time of five years. Participants from Central and West Africa acknowledged the need for tougher penalties in the region, saying they will work to increase penalties for wildlife crime in Central and West Africa.

UNEP presented analysis it had conducted for an upcoming report on the status and gaps in combating illegal trade in wildlife and forest products. UNEP identified a lack of legal provisions for dealing with organized crime and corporations as a key gap. UNDP described the challenges of addressing wildlife crime in the context of country and regional instability, including in countries like Angola and Mali. UNDP highlighted opportunities for countries to implement conservation programmes and improve their legal frameworks with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

African governments will redouble their efforts to prevent, detect and penalize wildlife crimes.

DESA presented the UN Forest Instrument and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests. These instruments address the illegal harvest and trade of forest and wildlife products, the role of sustainable natural resource management in preventing and combating illegal harvest and trade, and collaboration among governments and local communities to tackle illegal harvest and trade.

The UNDOC introduced a forthcoming guide on drafting legislation to combat wildlife crime. The guide will be launched during the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, on 17 October.

The CITES Secretariat explained that CITES is the only international legally binding instrument with an agreed definition of illegal trade in wild fauna and flora, and described the Convention’s minimum requirements for national legal frameworks for controlling trade in fauna and flora, emphasizing that effective legislation should also take into account the needs of rural communities that live alongside wildlife. She said that 15 of the 19 countries participating in the Symposium still need to put in place additional measures to effectively implement and enforce CITES.

According to CITES and UNEP, governments across Africa have committed to “redouble their efforts to prevent, detect and penalize” wildlife crimes. Governments will strengthen their legal frameworks, increase regional and national cooperation, collaborate with local communities to prevent and address the illegal harvest and trade in wildlife and forest products, and raise awareness on the drivers and impacts of wildlife crime. Participants also suggested raising awareness among national parliamentarians on the need to control trade and combat illegal trade to enable them to develop and support strengthened legal frameworks.

Guatemala will stop plastics from entering the ocean by installing bio-fences in its rivers to recover plastic debris.

Guatemala’s Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Alfonso Alonzo announced his government’s commitment at the 21st Meeting of the Forum of Ministers of Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), which took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 9-12 October 2018. He said Guatemala is “actively fighting plastic pollution through innovation and community participation” as part of an effort to preserve healthy oceans for future generations.

Guatemala pledged to increase waste collection in its rivers through deploying artisanal bio-fences that are made from recovered plastic debris and installed in rivers across the country to trap and collect plastic waste. The fence nets catch the plastic waste, making it easier for communities to recycle or dispose of it properly. The El Quetzalito community, located near the mouth of Guatemala’s Motagua river, which flows to the Caribbean Sea, was a pioneer in using bio-fences. Through the deployment of bio-fences, community residents have generated additional income through recycling and upcycling.

LAC countries’ bold legislative initiatives and innovative technologies help curb the use of single-use plastics.

Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Panama also have adopted the Guatemalan bio-fences to capture plastic pollution in their rivers before it reaches the region’s oceans and seas. Although the bio-fences are helping the region respond to pollution, countries have also stressed the importance of tackling plastic pollution at the source, by increasing wastewater treatment facilities and reducing individual consumption of plastics through awareness raising and education.

More than 50 countries around the world have signed up to the Clean Seas campaign. Guatemala’s announcement brings the number of countries in the LAC region participating in the campaign to 16. UN Environment Regional Director for LAC, Leo Heileman, praised the region’s countries for promoting “bold legislative initiatives and innovative technologies to curb the use of single-use plastics.”

According to UNEP’s ‘Waste Management Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean,’ every day 17,000 tonnes of plastic waste ends up in the environment or informal dumps in the region.

UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey urged other countries to designate 30 percent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (MPAs) to address challenges posed by climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Target 11 and SDG target 14.5 aim to protect at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The UK is advocating for increasing this target to 30 percent by 2030. Currently, only seven percent of oceans are formally protected. Further, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), more effective governance and management of these protected areas is critical to ensure that these MPAs are not “paper parks.”

Coffey is expected to encourage other countries to support increased coastal and marine ocean protection during the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) high-level General Debate. The Government of the UK has also announced it will encourage adoption of the 30 percent target at the 14th meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties in November 2018.

Marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.

In a statement in New York, US, UK Environment Secretary, Michael Grove, also emphasized the importance of global action to protect the world’s oceans. He said the UK has already protected marine habitats,“but we must go further.” He called for working together to ensure the health of the world’s oceans for future generations. The UK has classified more than 200,000 square miles of coastal waters as MPAs and has pledged to protect four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim welcomed the UK’s call to enhance global marine protection. He stressed that “marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.” UNEP Patron of Oceans, Lewis Pugh, described the Government of the UK’s action as a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation. He stressed, however, the importance of focusing “not only on the number but the nature of the protection,” explaining that fully protected MPAs are necessary for the ocean to recover. If other countries join the UK and follow through on their commitment, he said, such a decision will be “the most important moment for ocean conservation in history.” [UNEP Press Release] [CBD Aichi Targets] [Lewis Pugh Website on Ocean Protection Press Release] [Climate Action Press Release]","25 September 2018: The Government of the UK has called for protecting 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.

The Declaration, which cuts across industries, is dedicated to “harnessing the power of emerging technologies” to reduce carbon emissions.

Companies behind the declaration commit to activate their supply chains, advocate for strengthened political and regulatory mechanisms, and push each other forward as “peers, partners and competitors” with the overarching goal of catalyzing progress on the rapid reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across every sector of society.

The ICT sector can catalyze carbon reduction throughout all sectors of the economy.

The Declaration includes individual commitments made by the 21 signatory companies: Akamai Technologies, Arm, Autodesk, Bloomberg, BT, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lyft, Nokia, Salesforce, Supermicro, Symantec, Tech Mahindra, Uber, Vigilent, VMware, WeWork, Workday and Zoox. Examples include:

Arm adopting science-based targets and aiming to reduce emissions by 50% by 2025;

BT committing to buy 100% renewable electricity by 2020, and cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 87% by 2030;

Salesforce aiming to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2022; and

The funding will support countries in Africa and Asia to prevent wildlife poaching and illegal wildlife trade and help countries to reduce consumer demand for species and their products.

According to the GEF, there is an urgent need to tackle wildlife crime. Leopards are extinct in 23 out of the 89 African and Asian countries where they originally lived, and only four percent of tigers remain in the wild. In Africa, the numbers of African elephant and black rhino are “plummeting.” Birds, pangolins, primates, sharks, turtles and other species are all facing severe pressure from wildlife trade.

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the “most lucrative illegal businesses in the world,” generating between US$7 billion to 23 billion per year. This crime contributes to corruption and conflicts and deprives local communities of natural capital and opportunities to benefit from nature-based tourism. The GEF estimates that crimes affecting natural resources “cost societies more than US$70 billion a year.”

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the most lucrative illegal businesses in the world.

The GEF is working to tackle wildlife crime through its Global Wildlife Programme (GWP), which works in 19 African and Asian countries. The partnership focuses on wildlife conservation and crime prevention for sustainable development and is funded by the GEF and led by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). The increased funding will broaden the partnership’s reach and impact and help countries to take their own measures to tackle illegal wildlife trade.

The GEF has allocated a total of US$168 million to combat wildlife trafficking during its GEF-7 funding cycle, which runs from 2018-2022. The GEF announced this increased funding in advance of the ‘Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference,’ an event hosted by the Government of the UK.

Signed during the 36th regular meeting of the Agricultural Council of the Southern Cone, which placed food security and crop conservation at the center of discussions, the Ministerial Declaration highlights the need to strengthen the Treaty, in view of its objective regarding conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from their use.

A Working Group has been mandated to address challenges concerning the ability of the ITPGRFA Multilateral System of access and benefit-sharing to generate and share monetary benefits.

“Every nation can and should benefit from the multilateral mechanisms of the International Treaty that facilitate the exchange of seeds and participation in the distribution of benefits,” said ITPGRFA Secretary Kent Nnadozie in his comments. “We welcome this Ministerial Declaration, and hope that it will encourage those Latin American countries that have not yet joined our global community to do so.”

The ITPGRFA is critical for the achievement of several SDG targets, including targets 2.3 on agricultural productivity, 2.4 on sustainable food production systems, 2.5 on genetic diversity of seeds, and 15.6 on fair and equitable benefit-sharing. Its core is the Multilateral System of access and benefit-sharing, which facilitates access to, and exchange of, a specified list of crops considered vital for food security and agricultural research.

Convened by the Governments of New Zealand and Marshall Islands, the event welcomed new members, highlighted the Coalition’s goals and described countries’ initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Coalition members aim to “achieve a triple win:” reaping the socioeconomic benefits of the transition to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; building climate-resilient economies; and accelerating global climate action at the necessary speed and scale.

Moderating the discussion, Christiana Figueres emphasized the need co-create a carbon-neutral world by 2050. Her words were echoed by participants who underscored the importance of building solidarity and a collective narrative that allows leaders to point to other countries’ initiatives as a means of building political will among constituencies at home.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called for “a strong wind of change,” saying that we are pushing forward on an agenda “that should not be voluntary.” She underscored the value of creating a club that can share examples and advocate together for stronger climate policies and actions. Describing New Zealand’s actions, Ardern reiterated that climate change recognizes neither borders nor wealth.

Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine outlined her country’s policies and actions on climate change. She called on all to increase the ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change by 2020 to deliver a carbon-neutral world by 2050.

While the Coalition may be distinguished, it is not exclusive.

Vice President of Costa Rica Epsy Campbell Barr outlined how decarbonization can take place in tandem with economic growth, highlighting that her country was run on renewable energy for 334 days last year. Her remarks were followed by statements from Iceland, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Finland, Norway and Mexico, as well as new members: the UK, Denmark, Spain and Canada.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa urged members to lead work that cuts across all actors and sectors of society. She recognized the difficulties of moving “from negotiations to reality,” but noted the relevance of the Coalition in increasing the awareness and relevance of carbon neutrality in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 Climate Summit.

Sweden’s State Secretary Eva Svedling summarized the Carbon Neutrality Coalition’s Plan of Action, which focuses on four areas:

demonstrating and showcasing the benefits of long-term, low-emissions, climate-resilient development strategies;

providing leadership through the exchange of experiences, information, tools and case studies towards carbon neutrality;

advocating for increased global ambition on mitigation; and

encouraging further membership from countries and the alignment of subnational and non-state actors with the objectives of the Coalition.

Figueres closed by reviewing the key themes raised by participants: equal responsibility and equal duty of care; the importance of carbon neutrality in guiding both policy and investment; making economies modern, inclusive and green; and triggering a race to the top. Emission reductions, she highlighted, are the basis for – and not a threat to – economic growth and prosperity. She noted that, while the Coalition may be distinguished, it is not exclusive.

The Carbon Neutrality Coalition’s current members include Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK, as well as 32 cities.

The initiative intends to strengthen cooperation on renewable energy, accelerate energy transformation in SIDS, strengthen climate resilience, and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.

Initially launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative was created to support SIDS in their process of scaling up renewable energy through partnerships across public institutions, the private sector, and inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations. Through coordination with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Lighthouses Initiative has led to a rapid growth in renewable energy for its members. For example, from 2014 to 2017 more than 250 MW of solar photovoltaic and over 50 MW of wind energy came online as an outcome of the Initiative resulting also in significant cost reductions.

The SIDS Lighthouses Initiative met its 2020 targets for installed capacity in renewable energy and funding three years ahead of schedule.

IRENA Director-General Adnan Amin commended SIDS governments for demonstrating, “tremendous leadership in harnessing their renewable energy potential and their strong political will to act.” In addition, the initial Lighthouses Initiative met its targets for 2020 three years ahead of schedule in terms of installed capacity and mobilizing funding. These are great successes for SIDS as they are more vulnerable to climate change effects when compared to other countries, he underlined.

Participants at the event discussed priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0 with many underlining that investments and access to finance remain a major challenge. Renewables only account for 10% of total installed capacity in SIDS. Participants suggested that taking the energy transformation to the next level with renewable energy at the center would lead to sustainable job creation, fostering economic growth, and ensuring food and water security.

IRENA identified four priority areas for the Lighthouses Initiative 2.0: supporting SIDS in implementation and review of their nationally determined contributions; expanding the focus to include geothermal energy and energy from the ocean, as well as accelerating renewables in the transport sector; enhancing support for development of bankable projects; and reinforcing work on the nexus between energy, agriculture, food, health, and water.

Hilda Heine, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, discussed the urgent need for action and their accomplishments made possible through the Lighthouses Initiative. Recently, the Marshall Islands has begun a new solar project in their second largest community and are hoping to bring similar projects to life. Currently their other island communities are 100% renewable energy and are seeking support from UAE to help bring three of their major sub-centers to at least 95% renewable energy by 2020. Heine urged that the energy transition process be inclusive taking into account gender and human rights.

Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, spoke on limitations and progress. While three hydroelectricity plants in his country are being improved for efficiency and solar renewables are expanding, the major initiative focuses on geothermal energy. He noted that there is a two-year delay for the goal of 80% geothermal energy, but that his country is actively working with other organizations to meet this goal.

Aruba, the UAE, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) also participated in the Roundtable, speaking on issues ranging from project design, renewable targets, collapsible turbines, financial limitations, grant funding, and batteries.

250,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unep-report-urges-lac-to-improve-waste-management/,"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNEP Report Urges LAC to Improve Waste Management,"9 October 2018: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) has released a report that finds one-third of all waste generated in cities in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is not properly disposed of or managed, threatening the health of the region’s population and polluting its air, soil and water. The report observes that open dumpsites generate greenhouse gases (GHG) that can negatively impact the region’s agriculture, biodiversity and tourism.

The report titled, ‘Waste Management Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean,’ finds that the region inadequately disposes of 145,000 tons of waste every day. Although LAC has improved its waste collection coverage, the uncollected waste affects more than 40 million people, particularly those living in impoverished or rural communities.

The report further highlights challenges posed by LAC’s management of organic waste. This type of waste represents approximately 50 percent of all waste produced in the region but is the least managed. As a result, the region’s unmanaged organic waste contributes to generation of GHGs, including methane, and degrades the quality of other recyclable materials in the garbage.

Waste management is a key step in strengthening climate action and protecting human health.

LAC’s linear economy system, which is based on a “throwaway scheme,” poses another challenge to sustainable waste management. Only ten percent of the region’s waste is recycled, reused or recovered, underscoring its limited progress in transitioning towards a circular economy. By 2050, the report predicts that 671,000 tons of urban waste will be generated daily by 2050.

The report identifies improved organic waste management and movement towards a circular economy as potential opportunities for the region to transition to more sustainable waste management. UNEP also recommends that countries close open dumps to minimize effects on human health and the environment. Additional recommendations focus on developing laws and policies on waste management, promoting public and private investments and raising awareness on sustainable waste management and the circular economy.

Such actions are in line with global commitments under both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change. SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) includes targets focused on environmentally sound management of all waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (targets 12.4 and 12.5). Under the Paris Agreement, countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) can include action on waste management as part of efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

UNEP launched the report during the XXI Forum of Ministers of Environment of the region, taking place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 9-12 October. UNEP’s Regional Director for LAC, Leo Heileman, urged LAC countries to “consider waste management a top political priority” and a key step in strengthening climate action and protecting human health.

Organized by the permanent missions of Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste and the g7+ Secretariat, the event focused on ways for g7+ member countries to exchange with non-members on lessons in building resilience.

Moderated by journalist Prue Clark, panelists outlined how peaceful economies have transitioned in post-conflict environments. Nabeela F. Tunis, Sierra Leone, highlighted the importance of maintaining resolve in sustaining a peace agenda, particularly in the face of adversity. She outlined Sierra Leone’s struggles with the Ebola outbreak and crash in iron ore prices, which left the economy “shattered overnight.” To overcome such challenges, she noted the role of strong institutions and context-specific interventions that can bolster state-led partnerships in line with national development plans.

Milena Pirez, Timor-Leste, emphasized that economic resilience is at the core of achieving sustained peace. Pirez noted that in her country, stability undermined by crisis in 2006 was restored through social inclusion and addressing inequalities, as well as through strengthening institutions. Looking ahead to 2030, Timor-Leste has harmonized its strategic development plan with the SDGs and is taking measures to diversify its economy away from the oil industry. As a least developed country (LDC), Pirez pointed to finance as crucial, noting that proceeds from the country’s petroleum fund are invested in infrastructure and used to attract foreign investment.

Delivering remarks behalf of the UN Secretary-General, Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, cautioned that countries remain fragile even after conflicts are resolved. In these situations, he noted, a balance must be struck between achieving quick gains, restoring the state, and spurring sustainable development. Harris also outlined challenges such as low national budgets, narrow fiscal space, low revenue mobilization capacity and extensive debt, all of which can lead to a “heavily constrained” decision-making space.

Additional constraints to development, noted by Pierre Somse, Central African Republic, include destroyed road networks and poor security, which he lamented make it difficult to provide health services in the country, and contribute to the country featuring among the highest child and maternal mortality rates in the world. Somse cited Gavi as a successful health initiative, noting the broader importance of co-investing.

A significant portion of the world’s inadequate SDG progress lies in fragile states, and resources are not being directed there.

Mi-kyung Lee, Republic of Korea, described the country’s investment strategy as built upon three pillars: people, peace and prosperity. She said the country’s successful development was due to these investments in human and social capital and democracy, backed by a predictable policy framework.

Marie-Claude Bibeau, Canada, described aid’s catalytic role in fostering economic resilience. She cited the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States that was endorsed at the 4th High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, in Busan, Republic of Korea, in 2011. This New Deal, she stressed, provides a framework for donors to sustain peace through job creation and women’s economic empowerment. Bibeau flagged that gender is a key issue in post-conflict nations, where 40% of households are headed by women.

Alex Thier, Overseas Development Institute (ODI), raised a stern alarm from the floor, describing the week as “a wake-up call for the broader community on whether we’re making progress on the SDGs.” He said a significant portion of the world’s inadequate progress lies in fragile states, and resources are not being directed to the areas that need them most. Thier called for a renewed commitment to the New Deal to refresh political momentum, alongside joined-up support and innovative and risk-taking finance.

Floor interventions by Portugal and Sweden flagged that fragility can have spillover effects, and highlighted linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On finance, Sweden also noted challenges around taxation in fragile states.

Established in 2010, the g7+ is a voluntary intergovernmental organization of 20 countries that have been affected by conflict and fragility.

253,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-first-man-ryan-gosling-and-damien-chazelle-shoot-for-the-moon,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘First Man’: Ryan Gosling and Damien Chazelle Shoot for the Moon,"The La La Land filmmakers reunite to explore the private life of Neil Armstrong and the triumphs and tragedies of the space race.

Editor's Note: This review was originally posted on Oct. 10, 2018.

No matter what, somebody was going to go down in the history books as the first man to set foot on the moon. If it hadn’t been Neil Armstrong, it might have been Jim Lovell; if it hadn’t been an American, it would have been a Russian.

First Man makes the case that the man who actually went down in the history books was a man, if not the man, who cared more about the endeavor for its own sake than about who would go down in the history books.

But it also suggests that, no matter who wound up taking that first step on an alien world, that giant leap for mankind would also be one small step for a man no bigger on the inside than any of us.

Armstrong certainly had the right stuff, including the ability to stay cool in the face of an unfolding crisis that could have fatal consequences in seconds and figure out the right thing to do.

In one way that first footstep in the dust on the lunar surface represents all of humanity, and the U.S. flag planted by Armstrong (seen in a number of shots, belying the controversy over the omission of its actual planting) represents the nation that won this climatic chapter in the space race.

But it was not a paradigm or archetype who took that step or planted that flag. It was a fallible, wounded individual with personal baggage he couldn’t leave behind, even on a trip to the moon.

First Man is Damien Chazelle’s third film in a row about special individuals whose quest to achieve great things is linked to emotional isolation from others.

Chazelle won the Best Director Academy Award in 2017 for La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as creative souls and lovers who ultimately achieve their dreams only after breaking up. His prior film, Whiplash, was about a young drummer who breaks up with his girlfriend in order to focus on his passion and an abusive teacher, played by J.K. Simmons (who won the supporting actor Oscar for the role), who terrorizes his students in order to push the truly talented to greatness.

In this telling of the life of Neil Armstrong, which reunites Chazelle with Gosling in the lead role, the filmmaker has an iconic American incarnation of his favorite theme.

Following James R. Hansen’s official biography First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, on which it is based, Chazelle’s film finds a key turning point in Armstrong’s life in the devastating loss of his 2-year-old daughter, Karen, to an inoperable brain tumor.

The loss of a child can have an alienating effect on a husband and wife who process trauma and grief differently. Following a theory about presidents who lost children, Hansen suggests that Karen’s death may have helped to spur Armstrong to dedicate himself to an arena far from home and hearth.

For Chazelle, Armstrong’s quest may be for transcendence, or at least transformation. A harrowing opening sequence begins in medias res with Armstrong piloting an X-15 so close to the edge of space that he has trouble returning to Earth.

Still, he recalls that experience with wonder, even reverence, when being interviewed for the astronaut program and asked about the value of making the journey to the moon. On Earth, he says, the atmosphere that surrounds us seems vast, but from the edge of space, the Earth’s blanket of air seems thin and insubstantial.

From this perspective, the point of going to the moon is not what we learn about the moon, but what we learn about our place in the universe.

As an actor, Gosling has charisma to burn — a quality he has to submerge to play the reserved, understated Armstrong. Yet unlike his muted last role, playing a docile replicant in Blade Runner 2049, here Gosling bristles with intelligence and purpose, not to mention an occasional glint of humor.

His Armstrong isn’t one to suffer fools or to give people what they want. How did it feel to be selected to command the Apollo 11 mission? “I was pleased,” Armstrong tells the press, and rewording the question elicits no more quotation-working response.

Fortunately for the press, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (Corey Stoll) is more than willing to play to the cameras. Aldrin comes off as a bit of a brute; after one callous remark, he adds defensively, “I’m just saying what you’re thinking.” Armstrong’s laconic retort: “Well, maybe you shouldn’t!”

Claire Foy (The Crown) is well-matched with Gosling as Armstrong’s wife, Janet, who married him in the hope of finding stability and remains supportive of him to the end, but can stand up to him — or his NASA superiors — when necessary. The emotional connection between them is potent even when it is strained.

First Man effectively evokes the urgency of the space race, from the demoralizing frustration at every new milestone the Soviets reached before the United States to the thrill of victory when the U.S. crossed a line first.

We also feel acutely the vulnerability of the astronauts strapping themselves into claustrophobically confined spaces of immensely powerful engines that could easily kill them, and do kill some.

Janet’s angry remark about NASA being “a bunch of boys making models out of balsa wood” rings true because we see — and feel — how treacherous the technology can be.

Following one particularly devastating loss, Armstrong doggedly tells Bob Gilruth, the first director of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center, “We’ve got to fail down here so we don’t fail up there.” At what cost? Gilruth asks. “It’s a little bit late for that question, isn’t it, sir?” is Armstrong’s angry reply.

The possibility of failure looms so large that we see the White House has prepared a statement for the public in the event that the Apollo 11 crew don’t make the return trip. The air of foreboding Chazelle creates at the start of the mission almost makes us feel we’re watching the astronauts go to their deaths.

Not all of Chazelle’s choices work so well. Just as he undermined the big musical sequences in La La Land with his insistence on shooting them in showy single takes, here he relies so much on shaky handheld camerawork and extreme close-ups, even in ordinary quiet moments, that it becomes tiresome.

Yet the climactic sequence on the moon is heart-stopping in its stillness and austere splendor, elevating the film from excellence to near greatness. I’m not sure the words “magnificent desolation” have ever been more evocatively put to film than here. Everything else seems to recede — for a time.

That includes, for me, the flag-planting kerfuffle. There is a crucial moment on the moon, the culmination of one of the film’s central themes, that would arguably have been undermined by a flag-planting scene. Aldrin, in that news conference, jokes about his wife slipping him jewelry that she hopes he will bring to the moon and leave there. “What man wouldn’t want to give his wife bragging rights?” he asks rhetorically. When it comes to the point, though, more than bragging rights are in play.

First Man is ultimately more about the “man” than the “first.” It’s the story of a dedicated engineer and a gifted pilot who knew and accepted that his commitment to the program and the goal might cost him his life. Above all, though, it’s the story of a fragile human being who was never the same after a defining tragedy — who loved his daughter to the moon and back.

He is a permanent deacon in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey.

Including representatives from more than 20 developing countries, this meeting saw a major shift in focus of GAML–from development and refinement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) indicators toward implementation.

Esther Care Former Brookings Expert R Ramya Vivekanandan Senior Education Specialist, Learning Assessment Systems - GPE Secretariat

UIS plays a critical role in the Education 2030 Agenda by producing cross-nationally comparable education data and works with partners to develop new indicators, methodologies, statistical approaches, and monitoring tools to better assess progress toward international education targets. It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

A primer on the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML)

GAML was convened by the UIS in early 2016 to provide concrete solutions to develop new indicators on learning needed to achieve SDG 4 and set standards for good practices on learning assessments by bringing together technical experts from around the world. Counting more than 250 members representing a wide range of stakeholders from UN Member States, academia, international organizations, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector, GAML is developing the standards and methodologies needed to measure learning globally while helping countries to produce and use the information to achieve SDG 4.

During the meeting, about 20 countries provided their perspectives to inform decision-making across the learning and skills-related indicators. In addition, four countries—Cambodia, Chad, The Gambia, and Tanzania—explained the data they would likely draw on to inform these indicators, as well as the challenges and needs that confront them. Inclusion of a large country contingent and a new decision-making approach differentiated the fifth GAML meeting from previous ones.

Aligning national and international measures of proficiency in math and reading

Day one of the meeting focused on procedural papers that would enable countries to align their learning outcomes data against content in the reading and mathematics areas, and to establish procedures that would enable the verification of appropriate standards of data collection tools. Of interest was the proposal that both statistical and non-statistical methods be used in these processes.

This was a welcome approach for countries that do not engage in international or regional large-scale assessment programs (LSAs), or that use data from national assessments, citizen-led assessments, or early grade reading/mathematics assessments.

Questions raised by countries included how to manage differences in identification of grade versus years of schooling for reporting—for example on Indicator 4.1.1 for Grades 2/3, end of primary, and end of lower secondary, and whether the proposed frameworks for reading and mathematics would provide sufficient guidance to countries in their local comparisons with their national assessment data.

Working out the details of several learning indicators and respective roles in GAML

During the second day, the Task Force working on indicator 4.4 presented extensive research on how to approach digital literacy and ICT indicators, with a subsequent proposal for adoption of a Global Framework on Digital Literacy Skills. The definition proposed for discussion was: “The ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate, and create information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, information literacy, and media literacy.”

Target 4.6 calls on countries to ‟ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy” by 2030. Task Force 4.6 described its methodological work, and the potential identification of different minimum proficiency levels according to country economic levels. Member States did not view establishing different minimum proficiency levels positively, especially given that that many countries vary significantly in their adult literacy proficiencies. However, reporting more than one proficiency level appeared sound, which would enable countries to make visible progress over time in a manner that setting just one level might not.

Task Force 4.7 presented extensive research to inform the global frameworks of education for sustainability and global citizenship. Addressing Indicator 4.7.5 in particular which relates to the “percentage of 15-year-old students showing proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience,” the Task Force discussed a proposal for use of Trends in International Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) Grade 8 assessment of biology and earth science. TIMSS biology includes the topics of ecosystems and human health, while earth science includes the topics of earth’s resources, their use, and conservation.

Recognizing the role of UNICEF rather than UIS as the custodian agency for Indicator 4.2.1 (proportion of children under five years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning, and psychosocial well-being, by sex), it was proposed that Task Force 4.2 dissolve and transfer its materials and research to UNICEF as the latter finalizes reporting approaches and methods.

Similarly illustrating GAML’s dynamic and responsive nature, there was a proposal that the Assessment Implementation Task Force, a cross-cutting group, re-form as the Capacity Development Task Force to focus on implications of the decisions made by the Task Forces, on country implementation, and on the needs that such decisions will stimulate within countries. Brookings and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) proposed to jointly lead this new task force.

As Day 2 drew to a close, countries presented a microcosm of the concerns that had been raised throughout the two days and the challenges they faced. Their questions included:

• What are the continuing gaps in data collection and how might these be addressed?

• What are the issues related to consolidation of data sets across agencies and how to resolve them?

• How to develop simple monitoring tools that could be used at decentralized level to capture learning outcomes?

Remaining challenges in SDG 4 monitoring

Beyond these immediate concerns, reporting against the learning and skills-related indicators of the SDGs raised significant philosophical issues for countries. At the national level, some countries noted a move away from reporting the percentage of students reaching particular levels of proficiency, in favor of more meaningful reporting that indicates actual student proficiencies. Although the positive potential implications of SDG reporting can help countries prioritize education, the apparent inconsistency between global reporting needs and constructive use of assessment nationally may need to be reconciled.

Similarly, where national curricula are not well aligned with the curricula that may increasingly be implied by the frameworks for reporting against the SDGs, will national education systems shift their own learning goals accordingly? When this does not happen, how indicative will data cherry-picked from national resources be of real learning outcomes?

Beyond technical questions and capacity needs, participants raised concerns around identification of stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities within countries. This highlighted the need for coordination across agencies (e.g. assessment units/agencies, EMIS units, and national statistics offices), and clear communication about not only the indicators, but also what data collection tools and data would meet required levels of quality for global reporting standards.

What’s the verdict?

While it may have been daunting for country representatives who were new to this platform to constructively engage in discussion during the packed two-day agenda, it was a successful start thanks to the excellent leadership and coordination of UIS.

Now it’s time for diverse stakeholders within countries to have access to similar information, pull it apart, and consider the best options for their own countries to identify data resources and use their reporting as levers for change.","It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

The knowledge pieces focus on data and indicators to monitor and measure SDG progress, partnerships to accelerate implementation, and linkages to the business world, where corporate metrics can offer additional insights.

Investing in data is relatively inexpensive, argues a series of case studies launched by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD). The case studies were developed by the GPSDD and SDSN’s Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistics (TReNDS) to explore improvements in data and their return on investment. A blog on financing the data revolution by Jenna Slotin, GPSDD, and Jessica Espey, Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), points out that in addition to its low cost, “investing in data systems, capacities, technologies and processes” can stimulate long-term cost efficiencies alongside sustained social impacts and development outcomes.

The six case studies currently available cover:

A blog by SDSN’s Jay Neuner summarizes the case studies launched to date and previews upcoming releases.

Focusing on three cities in the US, SDSN also launched a working paper that examines efforts to localize the 2030 Agenda. The paper titled, ‘The USA Sustainable Cities Initiative: Lessons for City-Level SDG Action,’ synthesizes lessons learned in the pilot cities of New York, San José and Baltimore, through their experiences in integrating the SDGs with strategy development, partnerships and data. The paper offers step-by-step guidance for other cities developing their own strategies, particularly in the face of constrained public resources, and an ‘SDG Mapping Worksheet’ to help cities apply the lessons.

At the country level, a Devex Q&A with Marjo Bruun, Director-General of Statistics Finland, outlines how time use survey data can tackle inequality, with a focus on gender. Bruun notes that such surveys can fill gaps around employment statistics by enabling more accurate measurement of the amount and duration of paid employment, while also giving information on volunteer and informal work. She emphasizes that in developing country contexts, donors and data users need to be involved from the start in order for time use surveys to affect policymaking, and flags the need to raise finance from several sources, given the associated cost of collecting data from such surveys.

On indicators, the Global Partnership for Education highlights new ways of measuring progress towards SDG 4 (quality education), following a meeting of the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) convened by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics (UIS). The post recognizes UNESCO’s role as the lead agency in developing indicators, methodologies and statistical approaches towards monitoring SDG 4, offers a primer on the GAML’s work, and summarizes key discussion points from the GAML meeting. The blog also reviews the status of specific indicators under Goal 4, and identifies lingering questions on data gaps, the consolidation of datasets and the development of simple monitoring tools that can be used in a decentralized manner to capture learning outcomes.

On the overall SDG indicator framework, the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden. The meeting reviewed: tier reclassification of 15 indicators; data flows, disaggregation and global data reporting; and the use of proxy indicators for indicators currently classified as Tier III (lacking a methodology or data). The latest tier classification is available here.

Barbara Adams and Karen Judd authored a discussion piece on Global Policy Watch that acknowledges progress made by the IAEG-SDGs, but notes a growing need to integrate new sources of data into official statistics. They lament that at least 40 indicators are still “stuck in Tier III.” The paper highlights the potential of competition for scarce resources among data providers and others in the statistics community, and emphasizes “with concern” that the outsourcing or privatization of statistics can detract from National Statistical Organizations’ (NSOs) authority or ability to manage official statistics.

Further exploring the use of unofficial statistics to track SDG indicators, a guest working paper on Global Policy Watch by experts from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) elaborates on a proposal to incorporate unofficial statistics and outlines the context against which a mechanism is needed “to certify unofficial statistical indicators as official.” Authors Steve MacFeely and Bojan Nastav—self-described “staunch defenders of the need for impartial, independent official statistics”—explore such a need “somewhat reluctantly” and with hesitancy, in light of the risk that incorporating unofficial statistics into the SDG indicators framework could reduce funding to NSOs.

The paper acknowledges that unofficial data already serve as inputs to official statistics, but distinguishes between “data” and “statistics,” noting that the two terms are often—incorrectly—used interchangeably. Data, the authors clarify, are “basic elements or single pieces of information” whereas statistics “are numerical data that have been organized through mathematical operations.” The paper notes that, in “the post-truth era” and increasingly fragmented world of data, a risk management strategy is needed to maintain quality control and sound methodologies in the compilation of official statistics while avoiding delays, duplication and excessive expenditures. It proposes an agreed recognized body, mandated by the UN Statistical Commission, to review unofficial statistics to determine whether they are ‘fit for purpose’ to populate the global indicator framework.

Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

Among these actors are private companies that are taking corporate sustainability reporting more seriously and investors with an eye on delivering sustainable development.



This brief starts with recent news on private sector actions, and ends with snapshots of blended finance and entrepreneurship in least developed countries (LDCs).

An article by Tony Wines on Eco-Business argues that investors and businesses—which “have the ability to act faster and more efficiently than public institutions”—may have the best chance of averting climate change. Wines emphasizes the rapid uptake of environmental, social and governance (ESG) integration in investors’ strategies, noting that such issues can affect companies’ performance and reputation. However, he acknowledges that there is “little evidence of integrated reporting targeted at investor audiences,” and thus highlights the need for businesses’ alignment with global frameworks such as the SDGs, which offer a more standardized language for stakeholders across the climate, development and financial spaces.

Further on business alignment with the SDGs, Trucost, part of S&P Global, has developed an SDG Evaluation Tool, which helps businesses identify “SDG-aligned business revenue,” increase transparency, inform sustainable growth strategies and guard against risk. According to a publication by Trucost, the tool works by mapping SDG exposure (risk) across a company’s value chain, evaluating the company’s efforts to manage and mitigate its exposure, and assessing the positive impacts created by the company through its products, services, charitable activities, and other societal contributions in line with the SDGs. In its inaugural application, the methodology was applied to 13 company participants and 21 peers from the technology, financial services, utilities and manufacturing sectors. Findings show that nearly 87% of companies’ revenues have the potential to be SDG-aligned. The report was launched at an event held on 5 November 2018 and accompanied by a news release.

Participants at the 2018 Global Corporate Sustainability Forum discussed how SDG achievement can help sustain competitiveness, shared best practices in implementing SDGs vis-à-vis corporate responsibility initiatives, and discussed linking international initiatives to local actions. The Forum took place from 22-23 November 2018, in Taipei, Taiwan. Taiwan has “entered an era of socially responsible investment” according to Yung-Shuen Shen, Secretary General of the Taiwan Academy of Corporate Sustainability, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) encourages Taiwanese companies to adopt Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as a step towards enhancing sustainability, notes Rebecca Chen of the TWSE.

Such steps are representative of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific region, where corporate sustainability and ESG reporting is rapidly increasing, thereby improving transparency and shining a light on companies’ contributions to or detractions from climate action and sustainable development. An article on Sustainable Brands notes the overarching importance of disclosure—particularly on climate change—to investors, who want to know how companies are managing their exposure to climate risks. It offers the example of Ørsted, an energy company headquartered in Denmark, to guide how climate-related financial disclosure can both increase resilience and examine new opportunities.

To further increase alignment in the corporate reporting landscape, GRI is undertaking a joint project to address “reporting fatigue” caused by multiple or overlapping directives, harmonize definitions and terminology, and simplify corporate reporting such that it becomes more useful and effective. As noted in a GRI press release, the project will be conducted in the context of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue, and was launched during the Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summit in London, UK, as well as in Sydney, Australia during the World Congress of Accountants 2018.

Only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged today is from private sector investors.

Also looking at actors that can leverage private sector investment to the SDGs and the needed climate transitions, Convergence released a data brief that calculates the leverage ratios for a sample of blended finance funds. While leverage ratios must be differentiated according to the conditions of the transaction—including the target sector, country, and impact outcomes—on average, blended finance funds leverage US$4 of commercial capital for every dollar of concessional capital. However, the brief notes that only a small percentage of commercial capital leveraged is from private sector investors, with the majority coming from development finance institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs).

For those new to the term, ‘blended finance,’ Convergence explains it as the use of capital from public or philanthropic sources to increase private sector investment towards sustainable development, particularly in developing countries. Blended finance can take shape through a variety of transactions, including those with concessional development funding, impact bonds, or grant funding to support projects’ early stages or technical assistance facilities, among others. Convergence released ‘The State of Blended Finance 2018’ report in September of this year.

The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) released report titled, ‘Blended Finance in the Least Development Countries,’ which responds to limited evidence on where, how, why, and in which sectors blended approaches are being deployed in LDCs; the opportunities and challenges with blended finance strategies; and the conditions under which blended finance is most effective. The report comprises four sections: 1) applying blended finance in LDCs, which analyzes the latest financial data, notes barriers and discusses issues of development effectiveness; 2) country case studies from Africa and Asia; 3) guest pieces on a variety of SDG-relevant topics; and 4) the action agenda moving forward, which identifies five areas where action is needed form all stakeholders. The report was developed in collaboration with Convergence, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Southern Voice and UN Foundation.

A blog post relating to the report’s findings by Convergence’s Justice Johnston highlights that LDCs rely heavily on concessional financing, which comprises upwards of 60% of total external finance. It notes that weak enabling environments in LDCs act as deterrents to private investment and serve to increase the risk premiums. Additional project-specific barriers include limited credit histories and lack of market data, which lead investors to seek greater returns to offset increased risks. Thus, blended finance in LDCs may require greater proportions of concessional finance to attract commercial investment or demonstrate viability. Key sectors where blended finance holds promise in LDCs include energy, financial services and infrastructure, though Johnston underscores that in some cases, pure public financing remains the most suitable option. A UNCDF news release on the report is also available.

For those seeking to learn more on blended and private finance strategies, the OECD is hosting Private Finance for Sustainable Development (PF4SD) Week from 15-18 January 2019 at their Boulogne Conference Center in Paris, France. The week will kick off with the launch of a report titled, ‘The Impact Imperative for Financing Sustainable Development.’

On LDCs, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released ‘The Least Developed Countries Report 2018: Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation – Beyond Business as Usual.’ The report appraises the entrepreneurial landscape in the 47 LDCs, examines conditions for creating high-impact businesses, and identifies common structural features of LDCs’ economies that can hinder entrepreneurship. These include: lack of (or weak) institutions, insufficient infrastructure, limited finances and high registration costs, and elevated risks, as noted by the above Convergence blog. The report notes that self-employment constitutes the vast majority of entrepreneurship in LDCs, but laments that there is little capacity to innovate or grow, and thus calls for policies towards a renewed “developmental state” that brings in the private sector to “chart a clear path for development” through “mission-oriented investments.”

An UNCTAD press release consolidates the report’s key facts and figures on the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs, local entrepreneurship in global production systems, constraints to firms’ growth in LDCs, and current policy frameworks. Separately, comprehensive economic and social statistics on LDCs, compiled by UNCTAD are also available.

263,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paris21-reports-on-international-support-to-statistics/,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,PARIS21 Reports on International Support to Statistics,"24 October 2018: The financing for the data agenda has gained visibility over the past five years, but only 56 of the 102 countries with statistical plans have secured adequate financing to implement them, according to a report prepared by PARIS21. In addition, it finds that available information on domestic support for statistics remains a challenge in many developing countries.



The 2018 edition of the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), issued annually by the Secretariat of the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21), aims to provide a full picture of international support to statistics. It identifies factors that are important in constructing well-financed national statistical systems, including: a high level of national political interest; donor alignment with government strategies; legal autonomy or giving legal status to national statistical offices (NSOs); the alignment of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs) with country development plans; and coordination between statistical stakeholders through regular inter-agency meetings. The report mainly provides information until 2016, and is based on “newly available data” from an annual donor survey, and the 2016 Creditor Reporting System (CRS) – the official source of information on aid commitments from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, and some multilateral organizations.

According to the report, support to statistics amounted to US$623 million in 2016, marking a 5% increase from 2015, and the share of official development assistance (ODA) focused on data and statistics was 0.33%. However, the overall amount of funding for data and statistics remains low, and support remains concentrated on certain countries, with the top 25 recipients receiving nearly half of the support dedicated to 165 countries. The top-ten support recipients for 2006-2016 were Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Vietnam.

The report indicates that a large share of global support to statistics continues to come from a very small number of providers. The top five providers of development cooperation in statistics are the World Bank, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Eurostat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which contributed 69% of total commitments in 2016. Also, based on a survey on Global Private Philanthropy for Development presented by the OECD in 2018, private philanthropy organizations are getting more involved in statistical development, the report says. Private foundations provided US$23.9 billion from 2013 to 2015, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the most significant of the foundations surveyed, providing 49% of total resources.

Only two of nine SIDS have their national strategy for statistical development fully funded and under implementation.

On areas benefiting the most from statistical support, the report outlines demographic and social statistics (28% of total commitments in 2016), adding that environmental and multi-sectoral statistics “reached a record level” with the adoption of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On gender, it notes that statistics are not prioritized in data collection, resources devoted to them remain “grossly inadequate,” and the three areas where statistical investments are more focused are: sexual and reproductive health and rights, eliminating violence against women, and women’s economic empowerment.

On regional allocations, the report indicates that: Africa received the largest share of statistical support with 56% in 2014-2016; the share of total statistical support committed to Latin America and the Caribbean increased from 5% to 8%, driven by several commitments to national censuses in the region; and the share of commitments received by Asia and Pacific fell by half, due to the fact that some large projects committed in 2013 were no longer included for the 2014-2016 period.

On small island developing States (SIDS), the report notes that commitments to SIDS remain low. It adds that most SIDS are lagging behind in terms of building statistical infrastructure and developing statistical planning, and only two out of nine SIDS have their national strategy for development of statistics fully funded and under implementation.

On fragile states, the report mentions that statistical systems have made progress in strengthening their statistical capacities, but a lack of resources and technical skills has persisted. The authors call for more commitments and long-term investment for strengthening systems and capacity development in contexts experiencing fragility to implement and monitor National Development Plans (NDPs), and the SDGs, and to fill sector-specific gaps in areas such as environmental and economic statistics.

In terms of international initiatives on supporting data and statistics, the report states that a new PARIS21 study is currently exploring the feasibility of setting up a Global Fund for Development Data, that could feed into the reflection regarding a funding framework to underpin the implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan. The report points to the creation of a Data for Development group within the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), to discuss data strategies for development and identify good data for development practices in areas such as financing, partnerships with donors and evaluating data interventions. It also mentions a collaboration on a gender statistics programme between PARIS21 and UN Women, within the framework of the Making Every Woman and Girl Count global flagship initiative.

PARIS21 is a global network of statisticians, policymakers, analysts, and development practitioners which facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision making, and coordinates donor support to statistics with the main objective to achieve national and international development goals and reduce poverty in low and middle-income countries. It was established by the UN, the European Commission, the OECD, the IMF, and the World Bank. Its Secretariat is hosted within the OECD’s Statistics and Data Directorate.

264,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-finds-investing-in-healthy-coral-reefs-could-generate-billions/,"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Report Finds Investing in Healthy Coral Reefs Could Generate Billions,"6 November 2018: The Prince of Wales’ International Sustainability Unit (ISU), with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) and Trucost, released a report that finds a shift to improved coral reef health could unlock an additional US$35 billion in Mesoamerica and an additional US$37 billion in Indonesia through coastal development, commercial fisheries and tourism. If the world does not implement recommended policies and investments, the report cautions coral reefs could decline 90 percent within the next 30 years.

The study titled, ‘The Coral Reef Economy,’ compares the economic outcomes between a healthy reef scenario and a degraded reef scenario in the Coral Triangle and the Mesoamerican Reef. The healthy reef scenario assumes that increased investment in protection and preservation will return reefs to a healthy state. In a degraded reef scenario, coral reef health would continue to decline from current levels. The study finds there is a “strong business case” for both the private and public sectors to increase investments in the protection, preservation and enhancement of coral reefs.

According to the report, the world has already lost at least one-fifth of the world’s coral reefs. Climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and destructive fishing and various land-based activities all threaten coral reef health. The report finds that if coral reefs continue to decline in line with historical trends, the value of coral reefs to key sectors could decrease by US$3.1 billion in Mesoamerica and US$2.2 billion in Indonesia by 2030. These losses could have additional effects on local livelihoods and government revenues in the region, resulting in further losses to reef-dependent communities.

If coral reefs continue to decline in line with historical trends, the value of coral reefs to key sectors could decrease.

The two scenarios also estimate potential changes in live coral cover, which is considered an indicator of coral reef health. The healthy reef scenario anticipates a 36.4 percent increase in live coral cover in the Coral Triangle by 2030 and a 14.1 percent increase in live coral cover in Mesoamerica by 2030. The degraded reef scenario predicts a decline from 16.6 percent live coral cover in 2017 to 11 percent live coral cover by 2030 in the Coral Triangle and a decline from an average of 3.7 percent live coral cover in 2017 to 1.6 percent in 2030 in Mesoamerica.

The report warns that funding to protect and manage coral reef ecosystems is “insufficient to maintain reef health and meet internationally adopted targets.” Within this context, the report presents a range of interventions and policies that could produce a financial net benefit and positive return on investment for stakeholders. The study analyzes four strategic interventions: no-take marine protected areas (MPAs); afforestation for erosion management; constructed wetlands to enhance wastewater management; and vegetative filter strips to reduce erosion on cropland. All four of these interventions would also support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water) as well as contribute to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 15 (life on land).

The report argues that a shift towards coral reef health can be achieved through strategic interventions using already available tools and methods. As an illustration, the expansion of no-take MPAs in Mesoamerica could generate a 44 to 1 return on investment. The report also underscores the environmental and social benefits of restoring coral reef ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and cultural reasons.

The report focuses on Goals 2 (zero hunger), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land).

The report was produced in response to a request from the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), and discussed at the 33rd Session of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts held from 30 October to 2 November 2018, in Tunis, Tunisia.

The report highlights efforts in the four countries to date, noting that Mauritania has included the SDGs in its Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Shared Prosperity (SCAPP) for the period 2016-2030. In Tunisia, a press release notes, a “rapid, integrated evaluation” conducted by the government of its five-year development plan (2016-2020) shows alignment with the SDGs. Overall, however, the publication emphasizes that the process of national ownership and mainstreaming varies by country, and is “still too slow.”

The report identifies Maghreb countries’ needs around:

Accelerating implementation and integration of the SDGs into planning frameworks;

Finalizing mechanisms to coordinate national efforts to implement the SDGs, as well as stakeholder efforts; and

Strengthening the coordination of national and regional statistical systems to improve data availability and coherence, which remains “a considerable challenge for all countries.”

Looking forward, the report recommends that additional efforts be made to align national priorities with the SDGs, increase cross-sectoral partnerships across stakeholder groups, and take the SDGs into account in national budgeting processes. It adds that although regional priorities are reasonably well defined for implementing the 2030 Agenda, few strategic frameworks are available to steer action by Maghreb countries, and target figures at the Maghreb level are lacking. The authors call on the AMU to direct efforts towards: capacity building and knowledge sharing efforts, a Maghreb-wide sustainable development strategy; and implementation of sub-regional programs that support African Union-sponsored initiatives.

266,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/who-report-highlights-impacts-of-air-pollution-on-children/,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WHO Report Highlights Impacts of Air Pollution on Children,"29 October 2018: A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) summarizes the latest research on linkages between air pollution and child health. Noting that air pollution affects children “in uniquely damaging ways,” the report finds that 93% of children under 15 around the world breathe toxic air daily.

The report titled, ‘Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air,’ distinguishes between ambient air pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) and their sources, noting that the two have contributed to respiratory tract infections which ultimately killed approximately 543,000 children under 5 years old in 2016. The paper underscores that more than one in every four deaths of children under 5 is related to environmental risks. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus drove the issue home in a press release issued for the report’s launch. “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives,” he stated. “This is inexcusable.”

According to the report, children are at particular risk due to their rapid breathing compared to adults, smaller size, the fact that they live and breathe closer to the ground where pollutants may concentrate, and proximity to polluting fuels used for cooking and heating. They can be exposed to air pollution in utero, through inhalation or through ingestion.

Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives.

WHO stresses that although air pollution is a global issue, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) which contributes to health impacts and deaths is a burden most acutely felt by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – especially those in regions that use polluting fuels for cooking, heating and lighting. Whereas 98% of children under 5 in LMICs are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality guidelines, the figure for high-income countries (HICs) stands at 52%.

The report highlights the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an opportunity to recognize the interlinkages between air pollution and cities (SDG 11), energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13) and health (SDG 3). Towards achieving SDG 7, it cites prior WHO guidance for indoor air quality on household fuel combustion, which discourage the use of kerosene and unprocessed coal due to their health hazards in favor of cleaner biomass and other sources of energy.

Additional findings cover air pollution’s effects on cognitive abilities; negative impacts on mental, motor and lung development; and note that pregnant women who are exposed to air pollution are at increased risk of giving birth prematurely, to underweight children. Recommendations to health professionals emphasize the importance of being informed on air pollution as a risk factor; recognizing exposure; “prescribing” solutions such as switching to clean cooking fuels; and playing an advocacy role when sharing knowledge with policymakers.

The report was released prior to the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health, held from 30 October to 1 November 2018 at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Roadmap seeks to protect key jaguar corridors while also contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

The jaguar ranges across 18 countries in Latin America. As a result of habitat loss and fragmentation, human-jaguar conflict and illegal poaching, 50 percent of the jaguar’s original range has been lost, and the jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), successful jaguar conservation requires landscape planning and management in development and economic sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and infrastructure, to maintain biodiversity and connectivity. By conserving jaguars, conservation initiatives also maintain biodiversity, forests, carbon, watersheds and cultural and national heritage, and support achievement of the SDGs, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap for the Americas aims to strengthen the Jaguar Corridor, which ranges from Argentina to Mexico, by securing 30 priority jaguar conservation landscapes by 2030. The regional initiative will strengthen international cooperation and raise awareness on jaguar protection initiatives, such as connecting and promoting jaguar habitats, mitigating human-jaguar conflict and promoting sustainable development opportunities that support the well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities. The initiative also seeks to raise awareness on the jaguar’s role as a keystone species whose presence is indicative of a healthy ecosystem. The Roadmap outlines four strategic conservation pathways: coordinating at a range level to support protection and connectivity; developing and implementing range countries’ strategies and improving contributions to transboundary efforts; scaling up conservation-compatible sustainable development models in jaguar corridors; and enhancing the financial sustainability of systems and actions to conserve jaguars and their ecosystems.

UNDP Head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Midori Paxton, said the Jaguar Conservation Roadmap “represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs” and will help protect key jaguar corridors in ways that strengthen sustainable livelihoods for local communities and open up business opportunities for sustainable agriculture and ecotourism.

Also in support of jaguar conservation, the UNDP, Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and government representatives announced the creation of the first-ever Jaguar Day to raise awareness about threats facing the jaguar and conservation efforts in support of the species. The Day will be celebrated annually on 29 November.

The Roadmap’s release comes after a UN high-level forum that resulted in the launch of the ‘Jaguar 2030 New York Statement’ by 14 jaguar range countries and international conservation organizations.

268,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/wwf-report-reveals-devastating-human-impact-on-planetary-health/,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WWF Report Reveals “Devastating” Human Impact on Planetary Health,"30 October 2018: Human activity is pushing the planet’s natural systems that support life on Earth to the brink, according to a report published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which presents a “sobering picture” of the impact of human activity on the world’s wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers and climate.

The ‘Living Planet Report 2018: Aiming Higher’ presents a comprehensive overview of the state of the natural world, through multiple indicators, including the Living Planet Index (LPI), which examines trends in global wildlife by tracking 16,704 populations of 4,005 vertebrate species, and shows that global populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians declined by 60% between 1970 and 2014.

The report analyzed data from six measurement tools, all of which show a decline, with extinction risks for five taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads). The report outlines changes in species distribution, extinction risk and changes in community composition, which all show declines or changes. The findings reveal that humans have already pushed four of six of the Earth’s processes beyond a safe limit, namely: climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows and land-system change.

The report suggests 2030 as an end date for the biodiversity-related SDG targets, given the difficulty of abruptly halting current trends.

The report, which contends that biodiversity and the overall health of the planet are declining but that global commitment can still reverse the trend, provides a roadmap for action on nature for 2020 and beyond, which calls for the convergence of the environment and human development agendas to build a sustainable future. It highlights opportunities leading up to 2020, when progress made on the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be reviewed.

The report discusses SDGs specifically directed at the natural world, namely SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land), including SDG target 15.5 on reducing natural habitat degradation, halting biodiversity loss, and protecting and preventing threatened species extinction. While noting that some biodiversity-related SDG targets have 2020 as an end date, the report suggests 2030 as an end date for the biodiversity-related SDG targets, given the difficulty of abruptly halting current trends.

The report argues that measuring progress towards biodiversity targets is more complicated than tracking progress under the Paris Agreement on emission reductions, given that biodiversity assessment requires multiple measures at different spatial scales and across different ecological dimensions.

Other report findings include:

overexploitation and agriculture, both linked to increasing human consumption, are the biggest drivers of biodiversity loss;

the Earth has lost an estimated half of its shallow water corals in the past 30 years and 20% of the Amazon in 50 years;

nature provides about US$125 trillion worth of services per year;

species population declines are especially pronounced in the tropics, with South and Central America suffering an 89% loss compared to 1970; and

the Freshwater Index shows an 83% decline since 1970.

The publication titled, ‘The State of Biodiversity in the Caribbean Community: A Review of Progress Towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets,’ was launched in advance of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in Egypt from 17-29 November 2018. The authors note that the document is “of particular value” given CARICOM countries’ dependence on natural resources for livelihoods and well-being and exposure to disruption and environmental disasters.

The report notes that CARICOM citizens, comprising a very diverse population of 20 million people living in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, are “seriously threatened” by the effects of habitat destruction, pollution, invasive alien species, and climate variability. According to the assessment, “it is clear” that the Caribbean region faces an “unprecedented challenge” in rebuilding and restoring large parts of its infrastructure and ecosystems after many devastating weather events. At the same time, the document notes, it has also become clear that reducing the risk of future disasters and building resilience against such impacts can only be achieved through ecosystem-based solutions.

Reducing the risk of future disasters and building resilience can only be achieved through ecosystem-based solutions.

At the time of publication of the fourth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-4) in 2014, the majority of CARICOM countries had not yet completed their fifth national reports (5NRs). The assessment therefore allows for inclusion on information from reports completed and submitted since the preparation of GBO-4.

The publication highlights trends, patterns and commonalities in biodiversity status, along with pressures and impacts across CARICOM. It also reflects the range of responses taken at the national and regional levels to help the countries of CARICOM achieve the shared vision and goals of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020.

Finally, the report recommends actions to address the threats and pressures identified and to enhance the Community’s progress towards the Aichi Targets. The recommendations include:

Improve availability, quality and use of data, including spatial data, especially for critical ecosystems and endangered species;

Strengthen environmental regulatory and institutional frameworks, including mechanisms for compliance and enforcement;

Increase resources available for biodiversity;

Improve coordination and collaboration among government agencies;

Enhance engagement and collaboration between governmental and non-governmental partners;

Mainstream biodiversity across economic sectors and business;

Strengthen capacity, including through intra-regional collaboration and South-South cooperation; and

Adopt ecosystem-based adaptation approaches.

271,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-nutcracker-and-the-four-realms,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Nutcracker and the Four Realms’,"Disney’s second stab at Fantasia-themed fantasy-adventure steals from the best — and from some of the rest — but the theft never pays off.

When Disney’s fantasy-adventure The Sorcerer’s Apprentice debuted eight years ago, I was mildly appreciative that it didn’t come with a franchise-y extended moniker like (actual examples I made up at the time) The Sorcerer’s Apprentice: Oath of the Dragon Ring or The Sorcerer’s Apprentice: Nesting Dolls of Doom.

Now, for Disney’s second dip into Fantasia-themed brand management and cannibalization of its own legacy, there is The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. Oh well.

Like The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms takes a theme from a Fantasia sequence — in this case Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite, along with the ballet and the story that goes with it — and grafts it to an obligatory “Hero’s Journey” story arc constructed largely of standard-issue tropes and prefabricated parts.

Also there are Nesting Dolls of Doom in both movies, sort of, which is a connection I did not expect. Will this become a running theme? In another eight years will we be treated to a Dance of the Hours adventure in which the alligators pop out of ominous giant matryoshkas? How will they work nesting dolls into the plot for Toccata and Fugue?

I kid, of course, but there’s something genuinely depressing about seeing one of the most audacious experiments in animation history used not for actual inspiration, but as a kind of scrap heap for spare parts.

If you thought the Fantasia connection was just a coincidence and the filmmakers picked this subject just because they love ballet, think again: There’s actually a sequence where a silhouetted conductor climbs onto a dais and the orchestra is glimpsed in rows of colorful shadows.

Yet the filmmakers show no sensitivity to the historic associations of imagery and music that are now Disney canon. In one scene characters run through a forest past brightly-colored mushrooms, and you’re meant to smile with recognition, although the mushrooms never dance and don’t matter in any way. Worse, the bit of the Nutcracker Suite playing at that moment is not the Chinese Dance, but the Arab Dance, which should make you think not of dancing mushrooms but of coy harem-girl fish.

The Four Realms opens with Clara (Mackenzie Foy) triggering a Rube Goldberg mousetrap that begins with a hot air balloon and ends with a basket dropping on a conveniently placed mouse. This sequence offers a fitting metaphor for the film: a complicated mechanical assemblage over which Disney hopes audiences will beat a path to theater doors.

What tropes and prefab bits? So help me, it starts with a “Dead Mother/Wife” plot. This is not due to source material; Clara’s mother is alive and well in E.T.A. Hoffman’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which the libretto for Tchaikovsky’s ballet is based. Apparently Disney just feels compelled to kill off the mother or else they don’t know how to function.

Of course with the Dead Mother/Wife comes Disapproving Dad (Matthew Macfadyen). Dad is sad and stern and expects Clara to keep up Christmas family traditions and socialize rather than spending all her time in the attic with her Rube Goldberg devices, because it’s what’s expected.

When Clara protests that she doesn’t care about family traditions, her father retorts, “Well, you should!” This is at least potentially the most interesting exchange in the film. You could make a thoughtful family film about this question. Naturally, the filmmakers give it no more thought.

There’s also a Surprise Villain, an increasingly hackneyed Disney/Pixar device that used to be actually surprising back in the days of Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. It was no longer surprising in Toy Story 3 and Wreck-It Ralph, but the last straw for me was Hans in Frozen, who wasn’t even meant to be the villain until they decided that Let It Go was too catchy for the Snow Queen to be the villain.

These days it’s everywhere: Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Coco. It’s gotten to the point where the villain not being a surprise is a surprise.

What other tropes are there? Well, there’s Morgan Freeman, who has become a wise, mentorly trope unto himself. There is actually some excuse for this one, as Drosselmeyer, Clara’s godfather and a clockmaker and magician, does serve as a kind of gatekeeper to the magical goings-on.

In this version Drosselmeyer is also a proxy for Clara’s dead mother, whom he knew from a little girl, and who made the Fabergé-style jeweled egg that is Clara’s mother’s final Christmas present to her daughter.

The quest to unlock the egg leads Clara to the visually magical world of the Four Realms, which her mother sort of discovered and sort of created, and don’t try to make sense of it.

Each of the realms is governed by a regent: Keira Knightley’s Sugar Plum Fairy rules the Land of Sweets; Richard E. Grant’s Shiver is lord of the Land of Snowflakes; and Eugenio Derbez’s Hawthorne governs the Land of Flowers.

Then there’s the ominous Fourth Realm, where Helen Mirren’s intimidating Mother Ginger holds court. The Fourth Realm sequences include imagery far too creepy for younger kids: menacing tumbler clowns popping out of one another’s bodies; a giant mechanical doppelganger of Mother Ginger.

The Nutcracker borrows or outright plagiarizes from a variety of sources, from The Wizard of Oz and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to March of the Wooden Soldiers, Coraline and especially Alice in Wonderland — the Tim Burton version, alas, itself a mishmash of parts welded to a Hero’s Journey arc.

There’s nothing wrong with artistic borrowing, but the filmmakers just throw all of these borrowed ingredients into a heap without fashioning them into something with a character of its own.

At the center of the film’s lack of inspiration is Clara, an utterly generic heroine with no discernible personality traits, no flaws, and perforce no character arc.

We’re told that she has a unique way of looking at the world, which seems to refer to her fondness of physics and machinery. Other than some tinkering and occasional lines about the laws of physics, though, this unique way of looking at the world is never actually shown. Being interested in STEM may be an attractive quality in a protagonist, especially a heroine, but it’s not really a personality trait, is it?

I can’t believe I’m citing The Sorcerer’s Apprentice as a positive point of contrast, but this is what it’s come to: At least Jay Baruchel’s underdog hero — who also had a thing for STEM, come to think of it — had relatable anxieties and things in his life he cared about that mattered in the movie, including the girl he had liked since the third grade.

Clara cares about her dead mother, of course, but since the mother isn’t a character in this film, Clara doesn’t have a single human relationship in the movie that matters much, except her bond with her godfather Drosselmeyer, who’s only in the framing story.

Clara’s staunchest ally in the world of the Four Realms is the Nutcracker soldier, also known as Captain Philip, played by Jayden Fowora-Knight. Captain Philip is loyal and obedient to a fault, but, as he has no quest or need of his own, he’s about as engaging as Dorothy’s three companions would be if they didn’t care about brains or heart or nerve.

Perhaps the movie might have contrived to bring Clara’s father and two siblings into the Four Realms, and the movie could have become a real family adventure. Perhaps Clara could have learned that she needs her family after all — or perhaps her special way of seeing would have been highlighted.

The Four Realms is one of those movies that makes less sense the more of its secrets are revealed (vague spoilers follow). Why is the Fourth Realm the way it is? What happened to the regiment of soldiers that followed Clara into the Fourth Realm and vanished? Whose fault is that?

Did Drosselmeyer know that Clara would face potentially lethal perils in the land of the Four Realms? Was he at all concerned that she would be killed? Is Clara’s mother an inventor or a sorceress? Why does Clara think going home early would have solved anything?

In the end, going for a heartwarming denouement, Drosselmeyer smilingly tells Clara that when her mother was asked which of her creations was her greatest, she named Clara. What kind of thing is that for a mother of three to say?

The document was signed by more than 120 scientists, and represents the most complete survey on the theme ever carried out in Brazil.

The press release notes that the Summary for Policymakers of the ‘First Brazilian Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Assessment’ was launched on 8 November 2018, nine days before the start of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in Egypt from 17-29 November, and two months before the new Brazilian president and State governors take office. The press release emphasizes that the launch marks “a moment as critical as appropriate for the sustainable development agenda in the international and domestic conjuncture,” given that Brazil is the holder of the greatest biodiversity on the planet and the country’s decline of biological wealth has a large impact beyond its borders.

The Summary for Policymakers aims to support decision making in the public and private spheres by outlining the main results consolidated in the First Assessment prepared by a group of more than 120 researchers gathered in the Brazilian Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BPBES).

The document mentions that the Brazilian territory hosts about 42,000 plant species and 9,000 vertebrate species, including high rates of endemism, and almost 130,000 invertebrate species known to science. Of these, 1,173 animal species and more than 2,118 plant species are endangered. According to the assessment, the country is home to 305 indigenous peoples, totaling almost 900,000 people speaking 274 languages. Five million Brazilians belong to traditional knowledge communities that occupy one fourth of the national territory. “Family agriculture” produces 70% of the food consumed by the Brazilian population, and 85 out of 141 economically important cultivated species depend on pollinators.

Contrary to the principles established in the Aichi Targets, Paris Agreement and SDGs, Brazil is systematically dismantling its environmental policy.

According to the authors of the ‘Diagnosis’ of the Assessment, governance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Brazil is “bipolar”: on the one hand, the country has strong and capable institutions; on the other, there are problems of infrastructure, slow processes, legal, social and ecological conflicts and inefficiency in actions. With regard to international agreements, the authors highlight that Brazil is a “protagonist abroad,” as was the case in Nagoya, when the Aichi Biodiversity Targets were agreed, and in the negotiations of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the SDGs. However, they stress, internally the country does exactly the contrary to the principles established in those agreements by “systematically dismantling its environmental policy.”

The Summary for Policymakers points out that the window of opportunity to consolidate the basis for a sustainable future in Brazil is limited. The text explains that this would require placing biodiversity and ecosystem services immediately at the center of the economic discussions, in a cross-cutting way, together with a discussion on how to mitigate the threatening drivers.

The Assessment comprises five chapters: introduction of the assessment, its conceptual framework and definitions; nature and quality of life; trends and impacts of drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem services degradation and restoration; current and future interactions between nature and society; and governance and decision-making options across scales and sectors. The assessment was developed in close consultations with representatives of the federal government, civil society, the private sector, and indigenous peoples.

Inspired by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), BPBES was created in 2015. It comprises an independent group of about 120 authors, including university professors, researchers, environmental managers, and decision makers. BPBES aims to produce periodic syntheses of the best available knowledge, generated by academic science and traditional knowledge, on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their relationship with human welfare. In doing so, the Platform is considering six continental biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, Campos Sulinos), as well as coastal and marine areas.

The compendium is a result of a UNGA high-level meeting on financing the SDGs, organized by then-President Miroslav Lajcak in June 2018.



The event titled, ‘Financing for SDGs – Breaking the Bottlenecks of Investment, from Policy to Impact,’ brought together representatives of UN Member States, the private sector, UN entities, and other international organizations to explore how the UN can better align itself with the world of international finance in support of the 2030 Agenda. Participants took stock of recommendations, initiatives, and best practices for investing in SDG sectors in developing countries. The information shared at the event was then collected in the toolbox, which includes both existing and future global public and private initiatives.

In his letter announcing the toolbox’s launch to UN Member States in September 2018, Lajcak notes that it addresses both increasing private investment in SDG-related sectors, as well as improving the sustainability and inclusivity of private investments. The toolbox identifies four keys to boost financing for the SDGs:

Provide leadership, by setting guiding principles, galvanizing action, and ensuring policy coherence; Mobilize investment, by raising finance and reorienting financial markets towards investment in SDG sectors; Channel investment, by promoting and facilitating investment into SDG sectors; and Maximize investment impact, by increasing the sustainable development benefits and minimizing the risks of investment in SDG sectors.

The toolbox’s website was launched during the World Investment Forum held from 22-26 October 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. It will be managed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and continuously updated.

The landing page of the website also outlines job openings in the three areas of reform.



The UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda aims to enhance the UN’s contribution to sustainable development, ensure more effective capacities to tackle conflict and sustain peace, and improve the UN’s internal management and ability to deliver. As noted in the SDG Knowledge Hub’s Annotated Guide to the UN Secretary-General’s Reform Proposals, the three reform tracks address the fragmentation and bureaucratization of the UN system, which cause gaps, duplication of work, and resource drainage.

On development reform, the ‘United to Reform’ website notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require bold changes to the UN development system for the emergence of a new generation of country teams, centered on a strategic UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and led by an impartial, independent and empowered resident coordinator (RC). The website includes information on the RC’s role, and on the transition team that has been created to provide strategic leadership and oversight to all aspects of the repositioning of the UN development system. The site also features frequently asked questions (FAQs), as well as a backgrounder and key messages on UN development system repositioning.

On management, the website says the reform process seeks to empower managers and staff in the UN and its Secretariat, simplify processes, increase transparency and accountability, and improve on the delivery of UN mandates. It explains that the reorganization of the existing UN Department of Field Support and the UN Department of Management into two new departments (the UN Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the UN Department of Operational Support) seeks to ensure that UN management structures better support all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.

The ‘Management reform’ section of the website also outlines priority areas for improvement, including: improving the speed and responsiveness of service delivery; establishing greater coherence in management structures; strengthening performance management culture; ensuring effective management of resources for mandate implementation; enhancing transparency and accountability; and increasing trust between UN Member States and the UN Secretariat.

Per the website, the peace and security reform process comprises five elements: 1) creating a UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a UN Department of Peace Operations; 2) creating a single political-operational structure with regional responsibilities under the UN Assistant Secretaries-General; 3) establishing a Standing Principals’ Group of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Under-Secretaries-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations; 4) enhancing certain priority areas to ensure coherence and coordination across the peace and security pillar; and 5) introducing several non-structural changes “in the way the peace and security pillar works.”

The website also notes that the peace and security reform aims at, inter alia, prioritizing prevention and sustaining peace, enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of peacekeeping operations and special political missions, and ensuring a closer alignment between peace and security, UN development and human rights pillars.

Commitments focus on the Conference’s six themes: marine protected areas (MPAs); sustainable fisheries; marine pollution; climate change; sustainable blue economy; and maritime security. The US$10.7 billion in pledges represent commitments from a wide range of actors, with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the corporate sector announcing the majority of the commitments.

The Conference convened from 29-30 October in Bali, Indonesia, and focused on the theme, ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy,’ with participants reflecting on choices and actions to maintain the sustainability of ocean resources and to preserve ocean health, as heritage presented for our children and grandchildren. The 2018 Conference also featured the third ‘Our Ocean, Our Legacy Youth Leadership Summit.’

Indonesia announced 23 commitments, amounting to over US$80 million. In addition, President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, said the government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target date of 2020. Indonesia’s commitments focus on improving management effectiveness of existing MPAs, designating additional MPAs and protecting sensitive marine ecosystems, among other actions.

The EU made 23 new commitments across the six themes of the Our Ocean Conference, representing approximately 300 million Euros. On the blue economy, the EU announced, inter alia: joint action with China on marine data; a research and innovation agenda for the Black Sea basin; promotion of ‘Blue Labs’ in the EU to research and develop products or services in support of the blue economy; four regional projects under its satellite monitoring programme, bringing together 18 African countries and the African Union (AU) to develop services related to fisheries and aquaculture, coastal vulnerability and risk management, coastal ecosystems monitoring, ship trafficking and development of regional ocean forecast centers in Africa and the Indian Ocean; and support for the sustainable development of Seychelles’ fisheries sector. The EU will also enhance cooperation with South Africa and Brazil towards an All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance that will assess ecosystems, map the seafloor and develop innovative ecosystem-based aquaculture systems with the aim of having over 1,000 research teams working from Antarctica to the Arctic by 2020.

On marine protection, the EU announced, inter alia: projects to protect marine ecosystems and promote exchange of knowledge on effective management of MPAs between the Atlantic and Southeast Asia; a regional support programme for the sustainable management of natural resources in Pacific Overseas Countries and Territories; and a new version of the ‘Digital Observatory for Protected Areas’ (DOPA), an online database and information system on terrestrial, marine and coastal protected areas.

The Indonesian Government has met its commitment of conserving 20 million hectares of its sea, two years earlier than its target data of 2020.

On marine pollution, the EU announced, inter alia: a project to reduce plastic waste and marine litter in South East Asia, with the aim of supporting a transition to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) of plastic and reduction of marine litter; the upgrade of its ‘Floating Macro Litter Monitoring Application’ to make information on marine pollution from rivers accessible to the general public; and support for a waste management programme for the Pacific countries to address marine litter, biodiversity conservation and health and well-being. As part of its new plastics strategy, the EU announced it has initiated new rules on packaging to improve plastic recycling and increase demand for recycled plastic; measures to curb plastic waste and littering; and development of harmonized rules for defining and labeling biodegradable and compostable plastics, among other actions.

On climate change, the EU committed to start designing new ocean forecasting models to support the further development of the its satellite monitoring programme. Improved forecasting is expected to help the EU plan ahead and support decision making to tackle climate change impacts and build resilience to climate risks, including coastal erosion, floods and storm surges.

The US made 15 commitments, including two five-year programmes in Madagascar to improve community-based management of marine and coastal resources and support improvements in the enabling environment for community-based biodiversity conservation and sustainable development approaches and the ‘Fish Right Program’ in the Philippines to increase fish stocks by improving fisheries management and building the resilience of fishing communities. In Central America, the US will support biodiversity conservation in targeted coastal marine areas and upland ecosystems in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Additional commitments will provide support to, inter alia: the Tropical Pacific Observing Systems (TPOS) 2020 Project to improve understanding of the ocean’s role in climate and weather and of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ocean Acidification International Coordination Center (OA-ICC); efforts to tackle illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, piracy and human trafficking; efforts to promote sustainable waste management systems to prevent marine debris from entering the ocean; and research initiatives on coastal wetland ecosystems.

On marine pollution, many countries committed to reduce waste and improve waste management to reduce marine plastic pollution in the oceans, including Chile, the EU, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands and Thailand. Norway will assist developing countries to combat marine litter and microplastics through the World Bank’s fund PROBLUE. The World Bank committed over US$1 billion over the next seven years to advance sustainable oceans and the blue economy, including US$250 million to address marine litter and pollution.

Several companies announced plans to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in their materials, in line with a global commitment to eliminate plastic waste, launched by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). Danone-Aqua committed to increase the proportion of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50 percent by 2025 and to ensure all plastic packaging is 100 percent recyclable. Nestle will make its packaging 100 percent recyclable or reusable by 2025. The Coca-Cola Company will contribute to a circular economy by making its packaging 100 percent recyclable by 2025 and including 50 percent recycled content across the company’s primary packaging globally by 2030. Unilever will ensure 100 percent of its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, and increase recycled plastic content in its packaging to at least 35 percent by 2025.

Numerous countries and other stakeholders announced MPA commitments, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Panama, Peru, Poland and Sweden. New Caledonia will protect its seamounts by the end of 2019. Papua New Guinea (PNG) announced plans to triple its MPA coverage and to designate national marine sanctuaries in ten percent of its offshore waters by 2025, and to establish MPAs in ten percent of its territorial waters and coastline by 2025. The UK will triple its current targets to ensure that 30 percent of the ocean is designated as an MPA by 2030. The UK will also publish a cross-Government International Ocean Strategy by the end of 2018 that sets out the country’s contribution to achieving SDG 14 (life below water) through global governance and international cooperation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) committed US$50 million to create, expand and improve the effectiveness of over eight million hectares of MPAs as part of its new cycle of funding.

On sustainable fisheries, Chile committed to protect 98 percent of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from bottom trawling. The Netherlands announced additional support for the development and publication of the Seafood Stewardship Index, explaining that this commitment will contribute to SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 14 and 15 (life on land). Norway will support science for better management of ecosystems and fisheries, including through a three-month research cruise in Antarctica. Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Ireland, Japan, Peru and Thailand also announced commitments.

Our Ocean Conference 2018 continued a tradition of tracking past commitments and encouraging new commitments and partnerships to deliver multiple objectives. In addition, the Conference introduced the Our Ocean Commitment Registry, to facilitate tracking and review of past and new commitments.

According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day. But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.

Business has a vital role to play in ramping up action against poverty. From creating the jobs and opportunities that lead to sustainable incomes, to lobbying governments to introduce effective poverty-fighting economic policies, firms can make a real difference towards making poverty history, for good. ""Without the private sector, the global goals will not be realised,"" Lisa Kingo, CEO and executive director of the UN Global Compact, told attendees at the SDG Business Forum in New York earlier this year.

But with such a broad, ambitious goal, it is hard for companies to know where to start. BusinessGreen spoke to some of the world's leading experts on how businesses should practically address SDG1 through their own operations - here are their key recommendations.

1. Do no harm

It may be a guiding principle for medical professionals around the world, but the mantra 'do no harm' is also central to any successful business approach to the SDGs. To make sure that firms looking to tackle SDG1 don't roll back on progress in other areas - for example, by clearing rainforest to bring agricultural jobs to a region, at the expense of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions that could lead to worsening poverty down the line - businesses should start their SDG efforts by applying the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UNGC.

""If all companies subscribed to the 10 principles of the UN global compact we would already go a long way to delivering on the global goals,"" she says.

The 10 principles are effectively a checklist for running a good business. They include support and protection for human rights, effective abolition of child labour, a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, and a promise to work against corruption in any form. Adhering to these principles is the first step to ensuring all subsequent actions on the SDGs act as a positive force for sustainable development, rather than an inadvertent impediment to their aims.

2. Understand the problem - and find out which solutions work

Any number of factors conspire to lock people in poverty, from government corruption and conflict, to poor education and extreme weather. The first step to tackling poverty effectively is working out which of those factors are related to your business operations and how exactly you can address it, says Marika McCauley Sine, vice president for global human rights at Mars.

""Poverty is a manifestation of a lack of respect for rights, lack of the ability to manage environmental challenges and threats like climate change, low income and a range of other drivers,"" she says. ""The first step is understanding the barriers that people face to rising up out of poverty and reflecting on one's ability to impact those barriers.""

Mars started this process in its own operations in 2016, by taking a long look at its supply chain to work out where the pressure points are. Its Farmer Income Lab, which launched last year, then set about identifying proven strategies for alleviating poverty among smallholder farmers. ""That's been our brief and our focus for this first year of the Lab - what does work to enable farmers to increase their income?"" says McCauley Sine. ""It's been fascinating to begin to review the evidence base, to take a look at the landscape of what is actually out there in terms of evidence and begin to see what really does work, what people think works but actually may not, and to begin to identify some of the common factors that most successful programs out there share.""

Solving the poverty problem is often not as simple as bumping up the pay for those at the bottom of the ladder, she warns, and firms may need to prepare themselves for more radical change in how their business operates. ""Perhaps historically the business sector has approached the issue of poverty from a livelihood lens,"" she says. ""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains. I think Mars' view is that it is not enough. What we need to do is reflect deeply on the current realities that people face who are in poverty, who are touched in some way by the reach of our global value chains, and consider what real transformation looks like. And where there is poverty, challenging ourselves to go beyond incremental improvements to deliver real transformation"".

3. Don't plump for the obvious goal

If you're a renewable energy company, your first instinct on looking at the SDGs might be to think 'great, we are contributing to SDG 7 - clean and affordable energy - and that's our role in the SDGs sorted'.

Not so fast, says James Gomme, director of SDGs at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). ""You need a robust analysis of all of the goals as your starting point, and not passing over anything in that initial scan,"" he says. ""You need to do that initial analysis and have that conversation internally, and perhaps with peers and stakeholders as well, around what SDGs can you really drive direct impact on through your operations and through your supply chain.""

You should only start to narrow down on the goals you want to focus on once that analysis is complete, he adds.

Companies assuming that SDG1 doesn't apply to them is one of the major reasons why it is ranked as a low-priority goal for the business community. But by doing a first broad sweep of all 17 Goals - and understanding how each one touches your business operations - SDG1 may not be so often neglected by the business community.

And don't be fooled into thinking SDG1 is one for governments rather than business because of the way it's written. WBCSD's Gomme advises firms to look past the ""developmental"" language - because there is a clear role for business in tackling poverty.

""All the text is written for governments, and it's written in UN language, and it's a case of understanding how that interacts with your business, and understanding what you can do on that agenda,"" he stresses. ""And the companies that understand that best and put time into interpreting that agenda for their business will be the companies that are ultimately able to leverage the opportunities that the SDGs represent.""

4. Work backwards

Mike Tuffrey, co-founder of sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship, says many corporates are making the mistake of assessing how their activities are already contributing to an SDG, rather than working out what is needed to help hit SDG1's specific ambitions.

Firms should look more closely at the gap between what is happening on the ground today, and where the SDG or its sub-target say we should be in 2030, he says. ""They are not working back on an individual goal from what's required to say 'what do we need to do?'""

It is worth remembering that although the headline SDGs are broad, the 169 sub-targets offer explicit detail on what's expected. SDG1, for example, has five sub-targets:

By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.

By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

To make a real impact on a goal, firms should understand the sub-targets and work backwards, to get a clear idea of the ambition gap that needs filling, Tuffrey concludes.

5. Harness your lobbying power

Tackling SDG1 doesn't necessarily mean flying in armies of volunteers to run resource-intensive projects on the ground - companies should not disregard their influence to change government and social policy, argues Oxfam's Matthew Spencer.

He points to the example of Myanmar, where in 2015 the government was proposing to create a minimum wage of US$2.60 per day for workers. Garment manufacturers in the country were proposing an opt-out for their industry, but after 30 European companies including Tesco and M&S wrote to the Myanmar government opposing the suggestion on the grounds that it would deter them from investing in the country, the government forced through the new base wage.

""That [letter] helped give the government confidence that they could go through with that sensible social protection, anti-poverty measure, and as a result 30,000 garment workers have benefited,"" Spencer says. ""So that's an example of business working to improve the conditions of the poorest in their supply chain.""

6. And if in doubt, start with the UN's four top actions

The UN Global Compact has helpfully identified for top business actions for SDG1, for firms still struggling to determine how best to play their part.

Karbassi explains: ""In the case of SDG1 we have four actions that we identify as business leading actions. The first one is the creation of secure and decent jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations.

""The second one is the empowerment of disadvantaged groups, particularly in terms of economic empowerment.

""Then we have the engagement of companies around their supply chain, and the ability to provide decent working conditions for employees around the supply chain"".

Finally the fourth action is around developing goods and services ""that would target vulnerable groups"" and grow the green economy. ""There's a whole market around that which is not fully taken advantage of,"" she says - pointing to products such as mobile banking applications, microloans, and home solar systems.","As things currently stand, the world is on track to miss the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which targets the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
According to the World Poverty Clock, which tracks in real time the number of people escaping extreme poverty around the world, every second 1.1 people are escaping extreme poverty, defined by the UN as those living on under $1.25 per day.
But to hit SDG1's targets of eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the next decade, that rate needs to tick up to 1.6 people per second.
""It's been focused on enhancing livelihoods, on making people better off who contribute to the success of global business supply chains.

278,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/looking-to-nature-mobilizing-constructed-wetlands-for-resource-recovery/,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Looking to Nature: Mobilizing Constructed Wetlands for Resource Recovery,"With 80% of wastewater being released untreated into the environment and 892 million people still practicing open defecation, our communities and environment are at risk. Thus, it is no surprise that clean water and sanitation are prioritized in the UN SDGs. Committed to safeguarding a sustainable future, the SDGs aim to address global challenges by 2030. Linked to social and economic development, wastewater management is a vital component in achieving SDG 6, most notably in developing countries (Target 6A).

Annually, the lives of 361,000 children under the age of 5 are lost due to diarrhea; public health is threatened by poor sanitation and contaminated water. Untreated wastewater increases the risk of the transmission of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid. In our pursuit of vitality and sustainability, the provision of functioning sanitation systems not only offsets these consequences, it could also act as a channel to convert our waste into resources – a procedure otherwise known as resource recovery.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that three quarters of those practicing open defecation are concentrated in five countries: India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Pakistan. While municipal treatment plants are an established, effective solution to waste management, they are costly and often complex, and demand large amounts of energy and trained personnel (Avellán and Gremillion 2018). The prerequisites to support such an infrastructure can be a burden for developing countries. Adaptable, pragmatic solutions that are cheaper exist, and should be used.

Hiding in Plain Sight

A study by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) explores how constructed wetlands address these challenges through the Nexus Approach. Constructed wetlands are a prime example of a low-tech, cost-effective solution whose value has yet to be fully realized. As the collecting point for wastewater, this biologically diverse ecosystem unlocks its potential by recycling the waste component into resources. Additionally, the low-cost and low-tech features of constructed wetlands make them highly adaptable to various contexts such as rural and peri-urban areas in both developed and developing countries.

World Toilet Day is observed on 19 November, and the UN is committed to implementing sanitation solutions that are embedded in our environment. This year’s theme, centering on Nature-based Solutions (NbS), promotes actions that protect, manage, and restore ecosystems while simultaneously addressing societal challenges. Mending the environmental costs of open defecation and providing ecosystem services such as aesthetic value and biodiversity, wetlands are a leading example of NbS. By installing toilets and subsequent locally suitable sanitation systems, wastewater is treated and can then be repurposed for irrigation, with the remaining nutrients being used as fertilizer (see infographic). With the capacity to provide effluent for irrigation and create biomass, constructed wetlands can, in addition to the ability to offset irrigation needs, provide a sustainable bioenergy source.

Securing energy needs through using renewables made of land crops does not go without compromise. Water resources are used to nurture these crops, and instead of being used for food, they are used as a substitute for unsustainable fuel sources. This puts both energy and food security at risk. However, the return of energy supplied by wetland biomass has the capacity to provide a part of the energy needed in small communities or neighborhoods. Furthermore, if mixed with household and livestock organic waste, wetland biomass can generate biogas. The result is a rise in the yield of biofuel used for household cooking – an attractive alternative to energy conversion.

It Takes a Village

With the ability to supply energy to communities both large and small, it is necessary to filter wastewater through constructed wetlands. Calling upon community efforts to achieve sustainable water management is hence an ideal approach, particularly in developing countries (Target 6B). Favorably, toilets mitigate the impact of open defecation and support wastewater treatment. Combined, these effects can lead to the increased availability of water, nutrient, and energy resources.

Looking forward, an emphasis on educating people on good sanitation and the collective effort of communities are necessary to implement these measures. The low-tech, cost-effective features of constructed wetlands and their potential for revenue generation are great incentives. We must, hence, continuously advocate to advance constructed wetlands as a sustainable solution that secures food and energy production without compromising our limited resources.

The Second Committee’s sustainable development debate began on 15 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) presented seven reports. The first report concerned mainstreaming economic, social, and environmental impacts throughout the UN System. The second report highlighted unfinished business for Agenda 21, indicating that environmental and developmental progress has been mixed and uneven. The third report identified mandates in order to ensure monitoring of SIDS’ and their mainstreaming of the SAMOA Pathway into national development frameworks. These mandates concern resource gaps and research, policy development, and technical analysis. The fourth report addressed remaining challenges with mainstreaming the SAMOA Pathway, enhancing coherence of issues facing SIDS, and matching mandates to resources. The fifth report focused on biodiversity and economic growth in the Caribbean Sea. The sixth report emphasized harmony with nature. The report analyzed implementation trends of law, policy, education, and public engagement. The report also addressed sustainable consumption and production patterns. The seventh report focused on affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

The UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) provided updates on responses to address impacts of the El Niño phenomenon. UNISDR said that the clear effects of climate change, which undermine progress made in sustainable and inclusive development, are taking a larger human and economic toll. UNISDR’s report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters,’ found that “20 years have seen a dramatic rise of 151% in direct economic losses from climate change related disasters…1.3 million people lost their lives…4.4 billion people were injured, displaced, or in need of emergency assistance due to disasters.” According to the report, earthquakes and tsunamis accounted for 56% of total deaths due to natural disaster. UNISDR recalled that only two years remain to achieve target (e) of the Sendai Framework, “to substantially increase the number of states with national and local disaster risk reduction targets by 2020.” UNISDR urged States to go beyond establishing targets by gathering data for disaster risk reduction, disaster risk assessments, and the disclosure of disaster risks. UNISDR noted that gaps of the Sendai Framework require attention as States begin their data uploads.

The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) secretariat discussed efforts related to land degradation neutrality (LDN). UNCCD highlighted the creation of the LDN Fund, and noted that more than 120 States have established LDN targets. UNCCD highlighted that LDN efforts offer a way to accelerate progress in addressing forced migration, poverty, conflict from instability and loss of biodiversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) secretariat noted the role of biodiversity in infrastructure provision for human development and life on the planet. CBD announced that 107 of its 196 member States have ratified the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, and 171 of its member States have ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. She also drew attention to the preparations for the 14th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the CBD, and to the need to increase action to achieve biodiversity targets by 2020 as well as to look beyond that deadline.

The UN Environment Programme (UN Environment) discussed its global campaign to beat plastic pollution, and highlighted the need for a focus on sound management of chemicals and waste, marine litter and microplastics, exposure to lead paint, and mainstreaming of biodiversity. He also noted the role for regional strategies and agreements.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) discussed the importance of entrepreneurship for sustainable development by creating jobs and spurring economic growth. UNCTAD stressed the need for long term and cross-sectorial strategies for sustainable development. UNCTAD presented six pillars of entrepreneurship for sustainable development: national entrepreneurship strategies, optimizing the regulatory framework, enhancing skills and education development, improving access to finance, facilitating technology innovation and exchange, promoting awareness and networking.

In the Committee’s debate on sustainable development, delegates touched on finance, disasters, gaps, partnerships, and the importance of a sustainable environment. Maldives speaking on behalf for SIDS, presented struggles they currently face due to lack of access to finance. El Salvador called for public, private, domestic, and international mobilization of finances in the pursuit of 2030 Agenda. Bangladesh announced investments to make its agriculture sector resilient to climate change. Cuba expressed concern about large financial resources allocated to arms or speculation while unsustainable consumption and production practices rise. Qatar reported that it is making significant investments in educational programs. Afghanistan stressed technical and financial assistance specifically in reliable and sustainable energy. Jamaica said that risk-informed investments are key to action in DRR. Ethiopia said financial provisions are imperative for energy infrastructure development in LDCs. Mauritius stated that lack of access to concessional financing prevents resilience in its state. Sierra Leone urged the provision of financial resources to enable environmental energy investment. The Maldives and Nauru said financing can provide the answer for filling gaps in required resource allocation. Syria discussed the challenges it faces in implementing the SDGs, including terrorism and economic sanctions.

Malawi, Maldives, India, Singapore, Qatar, Nepal, the Republic of Moldova, and Armenia highlighted the vital role of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. India discussed its partnership with France and other countries to create an international solar alliance, in which 70 states already participate. The Maldives said partnerships have been instrumental for its lighthouse initiative.

Speaking on disasters, Malawi expressed how easily natural disasters can reduce progress made by LDCs. Armenia highlighted the role of information sharing in climate change disaster risk reduction. Mozambique discussed its master plan for disaster risk reduction that began in 2017 and ends in 2030. Mexico, Egypt, Malawi, Syria, Nepal, Brazil, Namibia, and Sierra Leone discussed environmental sustainability through biodiversity and renewable energy.

The agenda aims to support achievement of the CBD’s Vision of Living in Harmony with Nature by 2050.

Egypt, as the President of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, and China, as the future host of COP 15, launched, on 15 November, the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’ in collaboration with the CBD at the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is convening from 14-29 November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

The action agenda has three main objectives: to raise public awareness about the urgent need to stem biodiversity loss and restore biodiversity health for both humanity and the global ecosystem; to inspire and implement nature-based solutions to meet key global challenges; and to catalyze cooperative initiatives in support of global biodiversity goals. The action agenda will be hosted on an online platform that will receive and showcase commitments and contributions to biodiversity from stakeholders across all sectors in advance of COP 15, which will convene in Beijing, China, in 2020. This platform will enable the mapping of global biodiversity efforts, and help to identify key gaps and estimate impact.

The action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.

In explaining the rationale for the action agenda, the CBD states that humans have modified 77 percent of land on Earth, excluding Antarctica, an increase from 15 percent a century ago. Vertebrate populations have declined by 60 percent from 1970 levels, and the oceans have absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought, posing additional challenges to efforts to limit global warming. The CBD states that “we are rapidly destroying nature” but stresses that society has the knowledge and skills to change the current path and trajectory. Within this context, the action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship “from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.”

The action agenda will place special emphasis on the nature-climate-oceans-water-land nexus and action areas related to the SDGs. The initiative welcomes the announcements of additional initiatives to raise ambition in conservation, sustainable use and access and benefit sharing (ABS) and in mainstreaming conservation measures and biodiversity solutions across all sectors.

The Global Conference on Primary Health Care took place from 25-26 October 2018, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Kazakhstan. A high-level session on the first day adopted the Declaration of Astana and discussed a whole-of-government approach to improving primary health care. Yelzhan Birtanov, Minister of Health, Kazakhstan, anticipated that the adoption of the Declaration of Astana will set “new directions” for developing primary health care as the basis of health care systems.

The Declaration commits to strengthening national health care systems and making health for all a reality, 40 years after the first commitment to primary health care was made in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. SDG target 3.8 calls for achieving UHC, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

UNICEF calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single-disease interventions.

UNICEF notes that progress since 1978 has been uneven, with at least half the world’s population lacking access to essential health services, and almost six million children dying from preventable causes before reaching the age of five. The agency calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single disease interventions.

The Declaration acknowledges that, despite “remarkable progress” over the past 40 years, many people around the world still have unmet health care needs. It calls for action to counter the growing costs of health care, medicines and vaccines, and avoid waste and inefficiency in health care spending, acknowledging the impact of disproportionate out-of-pocket spending by patients and their families in causing poverty.

Other issues highlighted in the Declaration include the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, the burden of lifestyle-related and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the impact of environmental factors, such as extreme climate events, that affect people’s health. The Declaration commits to applying both scientific and traditional knowledge in primary health care, providing decent work and appropriate compensation for health professionals, and investing in education and training of the primary health care workforce.

Branca F Childhood stunting: a global perspective. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era witnessed an unprecedented drop in mortality among children younger than 5 years and in undernutrition across all regions. However, the poorest children remain 1·9 times more likely than others to die before reaching the age of 5 years.If these child mortality trends persist, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) child mortality targets (reducing neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 livebirths and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 livebirths in all countries by 2030) will not be met in 47 countries, 34 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, undernutrition is prevalent in some regions, with an estimated 151 million children affected by stunting worldwide.This situation is further complicated by burgeoning overnutrition together with vitamin and mineral deficiency in early childhood and their links to adult non-communicable diseases. Reversing current trajectories requires not only applying lessons learned from the MDG era but also addressing all the determinants of child health and wellbeing that will impact whether today's children achieve their maximum potential in every situation. Indeed, evidence shows that about 50% of the reduction in child mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 1990 and 2010 was due to indirect influences beyond the health sector.The focus on the health of children must expand beyond mortality to include healthy growth, development, and wellbeing.

et al. Early childhood development coming of age: science through the life course. 7 WHO

Inheriting a sustainable world: atlas on children's health and the environment. A multisectoral approach that addresses all the determinants (social, economic, cultural, political, environmental, and commercial) of child health and wellbeing resonates with the SDGs' promotion of an integrated approach to global social and economic development.There is increasing recognition, for example, of the importance of early life determinants (stimulation, socialisation, and a stable, clean environment) on child social and economic potential over the life course. The 2016 Lancet early child development Series reported that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in LMICs are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential,with widespread consequent impacts. Further, WHO estimates that 27% of all child deaths now arise from environmental causesand almost 90% of the world's children do not breathe clean air. Clean water and sanitation remain beyond the reach of billions of people, and conflict and insecurity affect the domestic stability of and access to health care, good nutrition, and early child education for many children globally. Coordinated action across multiple sectors is required for all children to be able to develop their maximum potential in every country and community. All nations aspire to see their children develop and flourish as a human right and as the basis for a strong economy. In this context, there is a need for guidance and agreement on maximising child health and wellbeing in the SDG era.

On bathwater, babies, and designing programs for impact: evaluations of the Integrated Community Case Management Strategy in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Malawi. In response to this need, and after reviews of several global child health approaches and policies,WHO and UNICEF have initiated a Lancet Commission on Child Health and Wellbeing, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Commission's findings will be published as a report in The Lancet, expected in 2019. The Commissioners are drawn from every geographical region and from disciplines including maternal and child health, nursing, nutrition, epidemiology, human rights, education, environmental and political science, economics, anthropology, and social science.

The Commissioners met in Dakar, Senegal, in February, 2018, to reflect on the state of the world's children and agreed on a process of elaborating a cross-sectoral agenda on child wellbeing that reflects realities in the SDG era. Consensus emerged around the need to address influences during the first two decades of life, with “child” denoting those aged 0–18 years. Five working groups have been established with experts from many disciplines and global regions to collectively address the following areas.

A group on leadership and governance will address how to secure commitment and accountability at all levels of government, as well as among donors, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations, and corporations. A second group will use a systems lens for multisectoral action, and examine how to bring together diverse systems across different sectors to maximise the health and wellbeing outcomes for children in the first 18 years of life, and how to increase accountability for enabling child health and wellbeing across all platforms and levels. A group on financing and economics will consider challenges around microeconomic modelling for financing and focus on identifying the new partnerships, investment policies, and priorities that will increase the chances of more children thriving by 2030. Equity focused data and information for action and accountability that build capacities for accountability and agency will be addressed by a fourth group. Finally, a fifth group will explore family, household, and community approaches to health and wellbeing, and will identify priorities for governments and districts in different settings and how to support the most marginalised communities to build resilience and tackle the drivers of their disadvantage.

This Commission will take a whole of government approach, addressing health and development beyond mortality, and will encapsulate children's perspectives and visions. Of course, context is key. The problems facing Nigeria, Nicaragua, and the Netherlands are different. But there are commonalities. The Commission will focus on the “how to” as opposed to the “what”, the process rather than content. This approach will go beyond a focus on national and ministry decision making. Districts and communities are where multisectoral approaches work best. And community engagement is critical to success; we intend to capture the views, hopes, and dreams of children and young people. At the same time, country ownership and political leadership are necessary. Our Commission will be mindful to align with country level planning processes that address realities on the ground. The methods and findings of the Commission will be inclusive, participatory, and incorporate the perspectives of adolescents and other constituencies, as appropriate.

The Commission's report will not only examine the successes and lessons learned from previous efforts but will also strive to balance optimism with acknowledged harsh realities. Solutions for child health and wellbeing will be viewed through the lens of protection, promotion, prevention, and treatment. We want to build the case for a coordinated response from government, business, and civil society that acknowledges the interdependent nature of the challenge to sustainably improve children's lives in different settings. And we shall suggest monitoring indicators that nations can use to assess progress between now and 2030.

Investment in our children is the first step towards cultivating a healthy, productive society, and should be central to any government's policy and in line with the statutes of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We are confident that the experience and passion of our Commissioners for this topic can benefit generations of children to come.

We are one-fifth of our way towards 2030, but miles behind on achieving the lofty goals to reduce poverty, increase prosperity, protect the planet and advance peace.

There are worrying signs that the number of extremely poor people in the world – which has long been dropping – may stop falling and might even start rising. And after years of decline, hunger is increasing – with observers linking this to regional conflicts and climate change. Of most concern: the world’s development agenda, based around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is not fit for purpose.

The development agenda is flawed because it is the inevitable result of trying to be all things to all people. The highly successful Millennium Development Goals which preceded SDGs were short and sharp – and made a huge difference to global progress – yet were criticised for having been non-inclusive.

In response, the UN laudably invited a long list of players to create SDGs – but then failed to prioritise the Agenda to make it manageable and implementable.

Thus, vitally important targets – such as the eradication of all forms of malnutrition, and getting more boys and girls into school – are devalued by being placed on an equal footing with targets as peripheral and vague as promoting “sustainable tourism”, ensuring that people are informed about how to have “lifestyles in harmony with nature”, and creating more green spaces for “women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities”.

Faced with the impossibly long list, in three years only two countries – India and Germany – have made even a partial assessment of how much investment is required for the goals. The Agenda is woefully underfunded – one estimate shows $2.5 trillion more needed each year. Even if we spent all of the world’s development funding it would only get us 5% of the way. We really have to prioritise what we want first.

This was clear even when SDGs were being created. My thinktank, Copenhagen Consensus Center, analysed SDG targets in real time as they were drafted, and enlisted a panel of Nobel laureate economists to identify the most and least effective. Their findings make it clear what needs to be done. If we want to get out in front of increasing hunger, then we need to tackle the problem effectively.

Climate and peacekeeping policies are expensive and complex, and at best do very little to solve problems like hunger, even in relatively long time frames. Yet, cheap investments can be made in fixing micronutrient deficiencies in children, helping immensely and right now.

Investing an extra $8 billion annually in agricultural R&D would increase yields globally, generating more food at lower cost. It could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent 5 million cases of child malnourishment, with each dollar producing $35 of social benefits.

This has the added effect of helping the world’s poorest: the World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth from other sectors.

Poverty has a simple solution: As in China, free trade can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Although Trump makes it harder, we have been dithering for much longer. We must revive the WTO’s Doha Round, which would lift 145 million people out of poverty by 2030. It could make the average person in the developing world $1,000 better off every year – allowing them to not only better feed themselves and their children, but also afford better health care, more education and lead more prosperous lives.

Improved agricultural yields and freer trade are two of 19 concrete, specific development targets that the Nobels identified to do the most, for every dollar invested, to help the world’s poorest, protect the environment, and improve billions of lives. Others include achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs. Focussing on these top 19 targets would achieve about four times more benefits than just thinly spreading funds among all 169 targets.

Because the UN didn’t prioritise when it created the SDGs, nations are making those choices themselves. The biggest risk is that their selection will not be based on which targets could do the most good, but on far more capricious measures such as which targets have more media-friendly images or the most NGO attention. There are some worrying signs.

A preliminary analysis by the OECD shows that rich nations are closest to reaching targets related to ‘Planet and Partnership’ – in other words, issues like climate, biodiversity and oceans. These are issues that fill a lot of column inches in newspapers, and are focussed on by the chattering classes. But global polls consistently show that people care much more about the areas where these countries are lagging behind: the economy, jobs and education, and peace. Three years into the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda, it is clear that we are trying to do too much – and failing to do enough that matters.

UNECE and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) jointly convened the regional review conference from 1-2 October 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland, ahead of the ICPD anniversary in 2019. UNECE governments reaffirmed their support for commitments made through the ICPD process, including action to promote sexual and reproductive health, reduce inequalities, and respond to the challenges of demographic change. They also welcomed a regional review report, which draws on data from countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of achievements toward the 2030 Agenda, among other sources. Participants highlighted the need for increasing investments in realizing reproductive rights and gender equality.

European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with a “triple burden” falling on middle-aged women.

The regional report presented by UNECE and UNFPA titled, ‘Fulfilling the Potential of Present and Future Generations,’ presents an overview of regional population trends, and highlights areas of stress requiring policy responses. For example, the authors note that European societies increasingly rely on informal care to meet the needs of populations that are living longer, with the largest portion of care falling on middle-aged women who often undertake a “triple burden” as they care for younger and older generations, while still remaining engaged in the labor force.

Other issues include low fertility, youth unemployment and complex migration movements, with negative net migration a feature of eastern Europe, while western countries experienced positive net migrant inflows. Unemployment, poverty and insufficient social protection are still issues for some UNECE Member States.

Speakers at the conference drew attention to gender inequalities in workforce participation, earnings, and access to leadership positions. They called for investing in human capital and creating enabling environments for stability, wellbeing and prosperity.

The Initiative is a collaboration between the two global treaties with a mandate to conserve endangered species: the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).

According to CMS, the range States identify habitat loss, fragmentation and conversion, increasing trade in lion specimens and live cheetah, prey depletion and retaliatory killing of carnivores by livestock owners as contributing to the “rapid decline” of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions across most of Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Assessments found that leopards inhabit 51 percent of their historic range, lions occupy 17 percent of their historic range, cheetahs occupy nine percent and African wild dogs inhabit only six percent of their historic range.

In response to these trends and related concerns, range States of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions met in Bonn, Germany, from 5-8 November to establish the African Carnivore Initiative. Range States agreed on several priority measures: developing and implementing conservation strategies for each of the four species; creating and maintaining a network of healthy ecosystems to address fragmented habitats; and finding solutions to human-wildlife conflicts and facilitating coexistence. The Initiative will also work to increase sustainable livelihoods benefits to communities, reduce the costs to communities of living alongside wildlife and increase awareness on the plight of African carnivores to ensure long-term success of conservation action.

African wild dogs inhabit only six percent of their historic range.

The African Carnivore Initiative will also close knowledge gaps, and develop and promote monitoring protocols for large carnivore populations, including to increase the availability of relevant information to support informed decision making. The Initiative will provide support to range States to monitor the populations of African wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards and lions.

In a communique, the range States invite the Conferences of Parties (COP) to CITES at its 18th meeting and the COP of CMS at its 13th meeting to instruct the development of a Joint Programme of Work for the Initiative, in line with the identified priority measures. The States also call for a national coordination structure based on the ‘Range Wide Conservation Programme for Cheetah and Wild Dog’ to provide technical support and training to coordinators and a platform for regular meetings.

The collaboration between CITES and CMS will enable the Initiative to tackle carnivore conservation from two different angles. CITES regulates international trade, and aims to end illegal trade in wildlife. CMS focuses on broad conservation measures, like establishment of ecological corridors, habitat protection and mitigation of human-wildlife conflict.

The range States that participated in the meeting are Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The report notes the importance of economic structural transformation for poverty eradication and long-term development in LDCs.

Titled ‘Entrepreneurship for Structural Transformation: Beyond Business as Usual,’ the report defines structural transformation as the transfer of production factors, such as land, labor and capital, from activities and sectors with low productivity and value added to those with higher productivity and value added, which are different “in location and organization, as well as technologically.” The publication discusses: sustainable development, structural transformation and entrepreneurship; the entrepreneurial landscape in LDCs; the local entrepreneurship dimension of global production systems; major constraints and current policy frameworks to entrepreneurship in LDCs; and policies for transformational entrepreneurship.

On the LDC entrepreneurial “landscape” the report finds, among other observations, that: self-employment in LDCs is at 70% of total employment compared with 50% across other developing countries, and is declining only slowly; innovation is limited, with an average of 15% of early entrepreneurs reporting the introduction of a new product or service, compared with 24% in other developing countries; and only 12% of early entrepreneurs have a post-secondary education compared with 36% in other developing countries, which shows a low level of educational attainment.

The report states that several structural features of LDC economies, including limited financial development, insufficient infrastructure, lack of institutional development, elevated risk levels and the disempowerment of women, tend to weaken entrepreneurship and enterprise development. It adds that limited urbanization and the disproportionate role of agriculture also have an impact on the nature of enterprises in LDCs.

In order to harness entrepreneurship for structural transformation, the report calls for: entrepreneurship policies to foster linkages between firms of different sizes, stages of maturity and sectors by means of business clusters, networking and alliances; introducing entrepreneurship education and skills development in both mainstream and specialized education programmes; and creating clusters of learning, innovation and creativity involving universities, schools, research, vocational institutes and experimental laboratories to “sustain a flow of new ideas” into firms throughout their life cycle.

LDCs are countries characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The LDC category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures were needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries.

The 47 current LDCs are Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia. Vanuatu and Angola are scheduled to graduate from the LDC category in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

The Summit was the first intergovernmental Summit to take place entirely online.

Over 40 government leaders participated in the virtual Summit, with many urging increased action on climate change. Summit Chair and President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said the virtual Summit shows that “more can be done with tools and means on hand than we might think.” The Marshall Islands announced a new, enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC) during the Summit, stressing vulnerable countries’ commitment “to move from words to action.” President of France Emmanuel Macron also called for countries to present new, more ambitions NDCs and “increase the pace of their implementation.”

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commended the Marshall Islands and the co-chairs for using new technologies to deliver a high-level carbon-free summit. He underscored the need for more creativity along these and other lines to limit global warming to as close to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels as possible, and called on all nations to ensure that the Katowice Climate Change Conference is a success. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet described strengthening mitigation commitments and NDCs as “a human rights obligation.”

Strengthening NDCs is a human rights obligation.

In the Jumemmej Declaration, over 40 government leaders commit to strengthen the level of their national climate efforts by 2020 in order to “trigger increased national contributions from all nations by 2020 to keep the 1.5°C warming limit within reach” as well as safeguard human rights, people everywhere, fragile ecosystems and the planet’s natural wealth. They urge the Katowice Climate Change Conference to act on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) and send a strong signal for all nations and non-State actors to contribute to generation of new ambition and enhancement of all NDCs by 2020. Leaders further call for, inter alia, urgent, further action to enable greater flows of international climate finance to be delivered more rapidly and effectively to facilitate enhanced climate ambition among capacity-constrained developing countries, particularly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). ‘Jumemmej’ is Marshallese for “a call to action of vigilance, keeping watch against threats.”

In a Communique, leaders elaborate that the “entirely online format” of the Summit demonstrates their determination to reduce emissions through the creative application of readily available means and to increase inclusivity and transparency while conserving scarce resources. The Communique also states the Forum’s five-point vision of surviving and thriving in a world, where, by 2030 to 2050 at the latest: 1) climate change dangers are kept to an absolute minimum; 2) maximum advantage is taken of the benefits of climate action; 3) maximum resilience is achieved for people, indigenous groups, livelihoods, infrastructure, cultures and ecosystems; 4) the SDGs and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) targets are achieved and, where possible, exceeded or accomplished ahead of schedule; and 5) LDCs and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) emerge as wealthy nations through strong economic growth.

Ms. Durant used her opening remarks to make a pitch of her own to the 12 entrepreneur finalists, who were readying to present their SDG-orientated business ideas to a panel of impact investors.

“You are the generation which can change your countries, the economy, and development strategy,” she said.

“We have to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. For that we need you. We need your energy and your creativity Business for businesses’ sake is not the message of the SDGs.”

“Meaningful and fair businesses, which are close to the people and planet, are the businesses we need – and that is what you will start.”

“You have already captured the essence of the SDGs by incorporating climate and the environment, social and economic factors into your business models.”

“Global Entrepreneurs Week is a wonderful tool to mobilize not only you but one million people from 100 countries on six continents. UNCTAD is proud of have been at the roots of this initiative.”

An energetic connection

The winning scale-up was born with a meeting between indigenous Guayusa leaf producers in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and Mr. Santander and his business partner Juan David Gomez, who wanted to harness the energy properties of the leaf, but with community involvement.

Now, 150 small-scale Amazonian growers are making the first natural, organic energy tea, Waykana, from ancestral Guayusa leaves.

The project generates income and boosts development in the community.

Mr. Santander said he would share his prize money with the growers to help them establish a grower’s association and protect them as Waykana expands.

“It feels amazing to have won. We have been working on the project at a crazy speed, non-stop for three years. We can feel how it is now taking off,” he said.

“The grant means the world, not only to our company, and Ecuador, but to our growers and the Guayusa tea industry. With the support of the international community we aim to make Guayusa famous all over the world.”

“We plan to allocate this money wisely into better organizing and strengthening the relationship with the small-scale growers.”

The study, published in Nature, suggests that these findings may mean that emitted greenhouse (GHG) gases have generated far more heat than scientists originally predicted, meaning that the Earth is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than scientists thought.

The study titled, ‘Quantification of Ocean Heath Uptake from Changes in Atmospheric Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Composition’, assesses ocean warmth using “a whole-ocean thermometer” to measure carbon dioxide and atmospheric oxygen, both of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases. In other words, the researchers measured the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen lost by the oceans, and then calculated the amount of warming needed to explain that change in gases. Previous studies have estimated ocean temperature using hydrographic temperature measurements and data, which the authors argue is an “imperfect ocean dataset.”

The findings suggest that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is even harder than previously thought.

The study estimates that the world’s oceans absorbed 60 percent more heat energy between 1991 and 2016 than previous estimates have suggested. Further, the study suggests, GHG emissions generate more heat than scientists originally predicted, which, the authors argue, may make it harder for the world to limit the global average temperature increases to the targets set in the Paris Agreement on climate change. In addition, the findings indicate that extra heat will go into the world’s oceans, resulting in implications for marine ecosystems.

Laure Resplandy, the Princeton University researcher who led the study, said the study finds that the planet warmed more than researchers had previously thought. “It was just hidden from us because we didn’t sample it right,” she explained. Resplandy elaborated that the study suggests that achieving the Paris Agreement targets is “even harder because we close the window for those lower pathways” outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15).

From funding female entrepreneurs in Ethiopia to providing more than two million households in Bangladesh with rooftop solar, the IDA is at the coalface of sustainable development around the world.

But after decades of funding its development work solely through its donors, its 173 member countries, 2016 marked a turning point.

ADVERTISEMENT

Every three years member governments gather at IDA to agree the replenishment rates and consider the institution's priorities for the coming years. The first meeting of IDA18, held just a few months after the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed at the UN, and just weeks after the Paris Agreement on climate change was struck, presented IDA stakeholders with a ""paradigm shift"" in the role of international development. Suddenly climate risk, poverty reduction, and sustainable development were in the global spotlight like never before.

Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is expected to cost between $5tr and $7tr. But in 2016 total official development assistance peaked at just $142.6bn. Looking at the scale of the challenge ahead back in early 2016, IDA made a momentous decision: to seek extra cash from the capital markets for the first time. ""Recognising that more than public money can achieve needs to be done and financed in order to achieve the ambitious SDGs, there was a discussion around bringing in this additional group of stakeholders, the private investors, so that the IDA can do more,"" recalls Heike Reichelt, head of investor relations and new product development at the World Bank.

It was a bold step, but IDA was confident its offer would attract considerable interest, Reichelt tells BusinessGreen. ""One of the reasons why the SDGs have been so warmly embraced by pretty much everyone is because there is this realisation that it's not just governments, it's not just government agencies,"" she explains. ""The private sector has a huge role to play, and the private sector wants to play a role. So it was a very opportune time to look again at IDA's financing model and think about how it can tap private capital.""

Tackling SDG 1 in particular - the target for eradicating poverty - is a key focus for IDA and was a major motivator behind its decision to launch an issuance. ""The SDGs are great and I really like them… but no poverty is in all of them,"" points out Reichelt. ""No hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation - they all move towards no poverty."" She explains IDA's twin goals since its inception are to eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity around the world: ""So if you look at SDG1 - no poverty - that's basically everything we do.""

So with the decision made to reach out to the capital markets to boost IDA's ability to help the world's poorest, Reichelt and her team set off on a 'roadshow' around the world's financial capitals to gauge market interest. The ground had already been prepared by the rise of green and climate bonds, with private investors becoming rapidly more comfortable with impact investing as a mainstream 'liquid' investment opportunity, the term for an investment that can be readily traded and converted into cash.

Reichelt explains: ""There are investors who are focused on impact, focused on the purpose of their investments, and until green bonds impact investing [the market] was all very small, not liquid, type projects. But through green bonds investors have realised that they can have impact by purchasing liquid products.""

This has attracted more risk-averse investors into the market, says Reichelt. ""If you think about impact investing, often times it was investors investing in a particular project in a particular country,"" she explains. ""So those investors are taking the risk that [one project] won't succeed and they won't get repaid... But in the case of bonds, you issue bonds in the capital markets and it's a liquid, tradeable product, a bit like stocks, you can buy and sell them.""

This fitted more neatly with the kind of investors the World Bank traditionally engages with, she says. ""It is investors that are looking for high quality, so in the Triple A rating [category], which is the best credit rating you can get,"" she explains. ""Those are investors that look for safety - so central banks, but also pension funds, asset managers and others.""

Meanwhile, interest in ESG investments is on the rise as the risks of inaction on issues like climate risk become ever starker, and governments around the world push green finance as a growth industry. Investors aren't immune to the reputational bump a well-timed investment in sustainable development can offer either.

So with more larger, cautious players entering the impact investing market, IDA was in a prime position to tout its role as a safe investment bet for doing good. Its 60-year history of loans helped it secure a Triple A rating from the ratings agencies, and its bumper $160bn capital reserve also helped to reassure investors the financials of the issuance were sound.

""[IDA] had a super strong credit, had a good financial product, and then its purpose, its mission, was good,"" recalls Reichelt. ""So it was a very compelling story when we went to see investors.""

""Compelling"" translates into an inaugural bond issue that raised $1.5bn for IDA's lending programme and was heavily over-subscribed. ""We had initially intended to only do $1bn but it was so hard to cut the allocations because it was 4.5 times oversubscribed,"" reveals Reichelt. ""So it was a really tough session, we were talking to investors and some of them really wanted the bonds, so we really had to either cut entirely or give a lot less in bonds to them than they expected.""

Unsuprisingly then, IDA is already planning another bond issuance before its financial year ends in June, eyeing a further capital raise of $1.5bn through a mix of benchmark bonds and private placements. From there Reichelt predicts it will grow steadily, to around $10bn within a decade.

The success of IDA's inaugural issuance represents not just a step change in its strategy, but speaks volumes about the latent demand from the private markets to invest in ways which promote sustainable development. The growing international pressure to eliminate poverty and build a greener, more prosperous society, together with the increasing acceptance of impact investment as a mainstream liquid investment opportunity, have cultivated fertile ground for ethical investments.

Delivering the SDGs will involve billions - perhaps trillions - of investment dollars. But when presented with the right opportunity, it seems private investors are ready and willing to help the world get there.","The International Development Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank Group, has almost 60 years of experience in providing finance to some of the world's poorest countries.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

Do the Tinsels

Of Tinsel-town

Like Christmas Day?

From my lair

On Mount Critic …

It’s tricky to say.

They Tinsel up holiday movies each year

But I don’t see much joy or holiday cheer.

For years now, they’ve built up a gloomulous glut

Of glum Christmas flicks. They’ve been stuck in a rut —

From R-rated dregs to Tim Allen-ish dreck

And the Jim Carrey Grinch, which is awful as heck.

The Tinsels don’t Seuss well. Their efforts fall flat,

From the unspooky Lorax to Mike in the Hat.

Only Horton was done right, kind and angelic

And Blue Sky’s Who-ville was drolly Geisel-ic.

But Ron Howard’s Who-ville was ugly and vile:

A hell in the ’burbs in true Tinsel-town style.

Shallow, promiscuous, cruel through and through.

If I’d been born there, I would be a Grinch, too.

Now we’re back in Who-ville for the Grinch’s return

With the Lorax and Minions crew — cause for concern.

While they’ve mastered the “secrets” of box-office glory

Their “despicable” debut was their last decent story.

It’s easy to see how this thing could go wrong

With Lorax-ish satire that doesn’t belong

In this tale of kind Whos who welcome a crank,

Enlarging his heart and forgiving his prank.

So I’m happy to state, though my praise may be faint-ish,

My critical heart is more pleased than complaint-ish.

The Tinsels have managed to Seuss out this one

And it’s decent, good-hearted, forgettable fun.

It’s visually playful, with gadgetry Gru-vy

Repurposed in new ways both Grinchy and Who-vy.

Especially the heist — a logistical dream

As much as a mean anti-holiday scheme.

Replacing Karloff-ian malice and spite

Cumberbatch-ian grousing makes this one Grinch-lite.

It’s a kinder and gentler tale than we’ve seen —

Of course he’s not nice, but this Grinch is less mean.

(I knew that he wasn’t as mean as he said

When he caved to his pets and let them in his bed.

And one is a reindeer as big as a moose!

This pushover’s not the guy scripted by Seuss!)

But he does still hate Christmas! The whole thing is bosh!

Except … gingerbread might be worth a nosh

And scenes of togetherness of kith and kin…

He sneers, but it’s clear he’s conflicted within.

And, you know, I’m okay with this sour-sweet sinner:

Clinging to mean … tempted by Christmas dinner.

The Whos are quite decent, I’m happy to say,

In an innocent, cheerful, Ned Flanders-ish way.

They may go a bit far with the whole Christmas thing,

But they sing for-real carols about Christ the King.

Then there’s Cindy-Lou Who, bouncy and sprightly —

A bit like young Ellie from Up, very slightly —

Determined to make contact with Santa Claus,

But her mother’s well-being is her only cause.

(Mom is single, a nurse, and works hard to get by.

It’s the third Dad-less Seuss film with no reason why.)

There are bits that don’t work, to tell you the truth,

Like glimpses of Grinchy’s unfortunate youth.

There’s hit-and-miss slapstick, and weak gags are made,

And added narration doesn’t quite make the grade.

(Pharrell Williams’ delivery falls a bit short;

Anapestic tetrameter isn’t his forte.)

But the group-hug finale sells it with feeling,

And Who-ville, though silly, is warmly appealing.

All are accepted, whatever the hue,

Or the shade, or the size, or the shape of the Who.

Even nasty outsiders, green-furred and alone

Find kindness and mercy to such as them shown.

The classic tale takes this too much as a given.

Seuss’ Grinch is converted — but is he forgiven?

When he brings the Whos’ things back down from Mount Crumpit,

Announcing himself with a literal trumpet,

Does he apologize — repent in the least?

Or merely presume of his place at the feast?

Grace is a gift, not a matter of course.

And that’s one way this movie improves on its source.

School children in parts of the Bolgatanga Municipal are now able to visit community libraries whenever they wish to read or do their home work, thanks to the Community Library Project.

The intervention, no doubt is making significant contribution towards improving academic performance - engaging the pupils in a more profitable way than before when it was only play and idleness after school or at the weekends.

Experts say the library is the backbone of all education institutions. It provides wide range of information resources that empowers them to produce resourceful individuals to influence the progress of society.

Its role in providing accurate and relevant information to improve the knowledge and broaden the outlook of students and pupils cannot be underestimated.

The development of the culture of reading is vital to strong academic performance.

Neil Gaiman, an English author defines library 'as a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it.

That includes health information and mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world'.

For the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Four by 2030 something that entails inclusive and equitable quality education there is the need to develop libraries in the communities - to make it easier for pupils and students to access relevant and current learning materials.

Everybody should have access to information which is relevant, current and timely to succeed in their respective fields. Students and pupils are no exception when they want to succeed in their academic work, to become useful to themselves and the society.

With the rapid improvement in technology, information can now be obtained from various sources especially with the aid of the internet where all kinds of information are put out for public consumption.

But the question one may ask is: are all the different types of information out there on the internet accurate and credible enough to serve the society to advance well? The answer is a big no. Not all information put out there is accurate and reliable.

Community Library and its importance

A Community library is a centre or learning space created within a community and stocked with books and other learning materials and this is mostly owned and managed by the community or community-based organizations.

Access to the library is mostly at a minimal cost or no cost at all and this offers the less privileged children the opportunity to have access to relevant information to improve their classroom performance.

It is sad to note that despite the significant role of libraries particularly the community ones, thy are being masked by fast-paced developments in information technology.

It should be noted that libraries, especially a community library, is not just about the wide range of books it has on its shelves but a place where individuals gather to explore, interact and share ideas that strengthen neighbourhoods and enhances sustainable community development.

As said by Willian Pollard, an English Quaker writer, 'Information is a source of learning. But unless it is organized, processed, and available to the right people in a format for decision making, it is a burden, not a benefit'.

Notwithstanding the impact the library has on the quality of education, community and national development, an investigation conducted by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) revealed that there were few libraries (both public and private) in the country, particularly in the Upper East Region. Even with the few public libraries these cannot boast of quality books and enabling environment to promote patronage.

The Centre for Sustainable Rural Development (CESRUD) Library Initiative

The pressure on government to meet the numerous development needs of the people makes it difficult for it to provide the libraries, stocked with the desired books at every corner of the country especially in the rural areas.

This therefore demands actions from individuals, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and philanthropists - to contribute their bit to developing the educational sector by making books available to children.

One of the NGOs in the Upper East Region that has been working hard over the years to complement government's efforts of delivering quality education is the Centre for Sustainable Rural Development (CESRUD). CESRUD has over the years been working to promote quality education at the basic level at Sumbrungu in the Bolgatanga Municipality through several educational projects including the establishment of community libraries.

The organization, in collaboration with Friends of African Village Libraries (FAVL), an American Charity Organization has established three community libraries at Sumbrungu and Sherigu in the Bolgatanga Municipality and Gowrie-Kunkua in the Bongo District, to encourage reading. They have been supplying books and other learning materials to all the 20 basic schools in the Bolgatanga West 'B' Circuit - to make books available to children.

Aside the community libraries and the promotion of quality basic education in the area, CESRUD as a community based non-profit organization, has provided economic empowerment to about 80 rural women groups to undertake income generating activities such as petty trading, basket weaving and pito brewing to improve livelihoods.

According to Mr Rex Asanga, the Executive Director of Centre, they had also partnered Biblionef Ghana and Lions Club International to refurbish and turn the Sumbrungu Community library into a modern one stocked with books, mattress for pupils' rest, games, computers and established mini-libraries in all the basic schools in the area.

He explained to GNA that reading was a window to the world and one could only acquire that knowledge when he or she has the required materials to learn and that libraries were mechanisms that would make children cultivate the habit of reading.

He added that free vacation classes, reading competitions and games, was often organized at the libraries for pupils, to encourage them to develop the culture of reading.

Mr Asanga said CESRUD had established a Teachers' Resources Centre, where refresher courses are organized yearly for teachers to equip them with modern techniques of teaching and class management to raise the standard of education. At every training workshop about 230 teachers are usually trained.

The Executive Director said although the intervention had yielded some positive results much still needed to be done to improve the quality of education in the area.

'The performance of the schools at the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) each year before was very poor such that no school in the area has better position than 90th in the region. But with the intervention, the schools are now improving with a school recording position within the 20s best performing schools.'

Conclusion and Recommendations

It is an undeniable fact that library and access to books continue to play critical roles in the promotion of quality of education. A visit to some of the CESRUD libraries showed that the pupils have been visiting the libraries even at night. Some children visit the library not to only read story books and interact with each other, but to also get necessary assistance to do their assignments.

The libraries are also patronized by some Senior High School students, who are at home for holidays and looking for conducive place to learn. They are going to be useful to students of the double track system.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to which Ghana is a signatory, particularly goal four, that targets inclusive, equitable and quality education by 2030 can only be realized when every Ghanaian child has access to education and quality learning materials.

Considering the importance of achieving this goal, it is imperative for government through the Municipal and District Assemblies to rehabilitate and to restock all libraries, especially those in the deprived communities, to make books available to children to learn to enrich their knowledge.

As we applaud CESRUD for this novelty, it is important for other NGOs, the corporate world, philanthropists and individuals to complement government's efforts towards attaining the SDGs - the goal four, in particular.

300,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-indicator-group-sets-methodologies-for-all-but-44-indicators/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,SDG Indicator Group Sets Methodologies for All but 44 Indicators,"27 November 2018: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) reached agreement on measurement methodologies on several indicators. This agreement will allow for fuller measurement of several aspects of SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), as well as targets on sustainable food production, food waste, access to medicine, free primary and secondary education, market regulation, migration, sustainable urbanization, marine acidity, and organized crime, among others.

IAEG-SDGs 8 convened from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden, with one of the four days held in a closed format for IAEG members, and the other three days open to observers.

The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The framework was agreed on by the UN Statistical Commission and adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2017. The framework contains 232 indicators for measuring the 169 SDG targets.

Many of the indicators are still under development, and they are classified into three “tiers” to show their status: Tier I denotes that an indicator is both conceptually clear and available data exists for its measurement. A Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. If an indicator is classified as Tier III, it requires methodological development. Tier III indicators are not reflected in the annual SDG reports presented to the HLPF.

By the end of November 2018, following the meeting in Stockholm and subsequent discussions, the Group had agreed to reclassify the following indicators from Tier III to Tier II, reflecting agreement on the methodology for their measurement:

SDG 2 (zero hunger): Indicator 2.4.1 – Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (for Target 2.4 – Sustainable Food Production and Resilient Agricultural Practices) (target abbreviations per the Global Goals project);

SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing): Indicator 3.b.3 – Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (for Target 3.b – Support Research, Development and Universal Access to Affordable Vaccines and Medicines);

SDG 4 (quality education): Indicator 4.1.1 (a) – Proportion of children and young people in grades 2/3 (for Target 4.1 – Free Primary and Secondary Education);

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): Indicator 10.2.1 – Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 10.2 -Promote Universal Social, Economic and Political Inclusion); Indicator 10.5.1 – Financial Soundness Indicators (for Target 10.5 – Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions); Indicator 10.7.1 – Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination (for Target 10.7 – Responsible and Well-Managed Migration Policies); and Indicator 10.7.2 – Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (also for Target 10.7)

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): Indicator 11.3.2 – Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically (for Target 11.3 – Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization); and Indicator 11.7.1 – Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 11.7 – Provide Access to Safe and Inclusive Green and Public Spaces)

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): Indicator 12.3.1 (a) – Food loss index (for Target 12.3 – Halve Global Per Capita Food Waste)

SDG 14 (life below water): Indicator 14.3.1 – Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling station (for Target 14.3 – Reduce Ocean Acidification) (see SDG Knowledge Hub story on this indicator reclassification);

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): Indicator 16.4.2 – Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments (for Target 16.4 – Combat Organized Crime and Illicit Financial and Arms Flows); and Indicator 16.7.1 (a) Proportions of positions in national and local public institutions, including the legislature (for Target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making)



In addition, the Group reclassified six indicators from Tier II to Tier I, due to regular data production for these indicators. They correspond to SDG targets 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases); 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage) (2 indicators); 3.b (Support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines); 6.5 (Implement integrated water resources management) and 6.6 (Protect and restore water-related ecosystems).

For SDGs 12, 13 and 14, several indicators remain in Tier III. But for SDG 10, the reclassifications mean that only one indicator is Tier III.

As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:

Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);

Tier II: 82 indicators; and

Tier III: 44 indicators.

Six other indicators have components in different tiers.

Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III. Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;

SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; and

SDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III.

Among the remaining Tier III indicators, the following correspond to targets with a 2020 deadline:

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): Indicator 8.b.1 – Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy (for Target 8.b – By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization)

SDG 12: Indicator 12.2.1 – Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP (for Target 12.2 – By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources) Indicator 12.4.2 – Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment (for Target 12.4 – By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

SDG 13: Indicator 13.a.1 – Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment (for Target 13.a – Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible)

SDG 14: Indicator 14.2.1 – Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches (for Target 14.2 – By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans) Indicator 14.7.1 – Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries (for Target 14.7 – By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism)

SDG 15 (life on land): Indicator 15.9.1 – Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (for Target 15.9 – By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts)

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): Indicator 17.18.1 – Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (for Target 17.18 – By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts)



The Group plans to continue to reclassify indicators as requirements are met, considering them during semi-annual in-person meetings and bi-monthly teleconference meetings in between. The next tier reclassification web meetings will take place on 17 January and in early February 2019.

The next in-person IAEG meeting (March or April 2019) is expected to include the final progress review of Tier III indicators to determine whether any should be deleted. These will be included in a “preliminary list of possible deletions, replacements, adjustments and additions” for open consultation between May and July 2019 as part of the first “comprehensive review” of the global indicator framework. A list of 37 indicators under consideration for addition has been prepared.

The consultation results will be reviewed by September 2019, and a final proposal will be prepared for consideration by the UN Statistical Commission at its 51st meeting in March 2020. More details on the timeline of the comprehensive review are available here.

IAEG members stressed during the Stockholm meeting that the review should not lead to an additional burden on national statistical work, nor undermine the investments already made in national statistical systems.

The meeting also discussed: a minimum level of data disaggregation for each target and indicator; two proposed proxy indicators (for 11.a.1 and 12.b.1); and the draft guidelines on data flows and global data reporting.

301,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

302,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

303,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/to-leave-no-one-behind-brief-calls-for-considering-idps-in-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"To Leave No One Behind, Brief Calls for Considering IDPs in SDG Implementation","29 November 2018: Marking 20 years of existence of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the International Peace Institute (IPI) released an issue brief on internally displaced persons (IDPs). The brief recommends that States with high levels of internal displacement address the needs of IDPs in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that countries include information on IDPs in their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

Authored by Alice Debarre, Archibald Henry and Masooma Rahmaty, IPI, the brief explores links between internal displacement and the SDGs, highlights ongoing efforts to address the longer-term needs of IDPs, looks at the specific cases of Nigeria and Iraq, and provides recommendations for ways forward. The brief titled, ‘Reaching Internally Displaced Persons to Achieve the 2030 Agenda,’ notes the need to understand international displacement as a long-term challenge that requires coordinated and complementary approaches by humanitarian and development actors.

The authors define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence… and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border,” in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 1998 by the UN Special Representative on IDPs and represent an international framework that “authoritatively restates the rights” of IDPs, as enshrined in international human rights and humanitarian law. The 30 principles cover IDPs’ needs during displacement, return, resettlement and reintegration, and have gained broad international acceptance and authority, although they were never officially adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The brief recalls that the 2030 Agenda pledges to “leave no one behind” and highlights IDPs as a vulnerable group that must be empowered through efforts to implement the SDGs. While there are no SDG targets or indicators specifically related to internal displacement, the brief notes, the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity to build on existing efforts and ensure that the plight of IDPs is addressed in both the short and long terms. It states that many of the SDGs are directly related to IDPs, and including IDPs in policies to implement the SDGs could help reduce the occurrence and impact of displacement and ensure that IDPs contribute to local economies and economic growth. In this regard, the authors report that Nigeria has included IDPs in its VNR, and linked the issue particularly with SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

The authors also remark that neither the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration nor the Global Compact for Refugees address the issue of internal displacement. They explain that some States perceive international attention to IDP issues as an infringement on their sovereignty and have therefore been reluctant to address it in multilateral fora.

The brief reports that, as of May 2018, there are over 40 million IDPs due to conflict and violence in the world, which is nearly twice the number of refugees worldwide. Also, since they are displaced within national borders, IDPs do not benefit from the legal status of refugees and its associated protections, and fall outside of the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Among other challenges to addressing IDPs’ needs, the authors note that the different funding streams of humanitarian and development actors and the existing field architecture for UN agencies inhibit efforts to operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus, while being not conducive to joint action or collective outcomes. The authors also cite inadequate collection, processing, and sharing of data on IDPs, and the fact that supporting IDPs is not traditionally perceived as a development issue and is insufficiently included in development strategy and planning.

On initiatives that have been taken at the international level regarding IDPs, the authors outline: the April 2018 launch of the multistakeholder ‘GP20 Plan of Action for Advancing Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People 2018– 2020;’ the development, by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), of a framework for addressing internal displacement; and the establishment, in 2018, of a UN Joint Steering Committee in charge of advancing humanitarian and development collaboration and assessing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, following the UN Secretary-General’s proposal to reform the UN development system.

The brief also notes that 37 States sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General in July 2018 asking him to appoint a high-level panel on IDPs in order to bring attention to existing efforts and galvanize continuing action.

The conference reviewed actions toward implementing the agenda set at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt.



The Midterm Review of the Asian and Pacific Ministerial Declaration on Population and Development took place from 26-28 November, in Bangkok, Thailand. Highlights of the meeting included renewed commitments by some countries to provide universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, and recognition of migration as an important dynamic in reducing poverty and providing other social benefits.

Delegates welcomed achievements in maternal and child health, but noted that some countries are experiencing increased poverty.

Delegates noted commonalities between ICPD concerns and the SDGs in the areas of human rights, sexual and reproductive health. Delegates welcomed health achievements across the region, especially in maternal and child health, but noted that some countries are experiencing increased poverty. Several countries expressed a commitment to providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including voluntary family planning, and to promoting gender equality. Other issues discussed at the meeting included: population aging; increased poverty levels in some countries; and the need for comprehensive data on migration.

Armida Alisjahbana, ESCAP Executive Secretary, warned that, based on current trends, the region is unlikely to achieve any of the SDGs by 2030, except SDG 4 on universal education. Kaveh Zahedi, ESCAP, urged countries to increase their investments in people, including in essential healthcare services, and to improve data gathering on vulnerable communities.

The outcome of the Bangkok meeting is captured in a Chair’s summary, and will feed into discussions at the global review of the 1994 ICPD Programme of Action in 2019, to be conducted by the UN Commission on Population and Development at its 52nd session in New York, US, 25 years after the ICPD took place in Cairo, Egypt.

In 1999, delegates at ICPD adopted a 20-year Programme of Action in the areas of human rights, population, migration and urbanization, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, and sustainable development. In 2010, the Programme of Action was further extended. The last comprehensive review of ICPD was conducted in 2014, affirming the links between that agenda and the emergent 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In preparation for the 25-year review, regional conferences also have taken place in Europe, the Arab Region, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 52nd CPD will convene from 1-5 April 2019.

305,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

In June 2018, the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), presented initial findings on ways in which technology can support the SDGs, during the third STI Forum. The UNGA resolution adopted on 22 November 2018 (A/RES/73/17) requests the two bodies to update their findings, invites them to strengthen their synergies and mutually reinforce their work on STI, and requests the Secretariat to avoid overlapping meeting dates to further increase coherence. The fourth STI Forum will take place from 14-15 May 2019. Looking ahead to the UNGA’s 74th session, the resolution also invites the UNGA President to convene a high-level thematic debate to take stock of progress on the topic.

Presenting the draft resolution, Juan José Gómez Camacho, Mexico, said new technologies “can change the destinies of nations.” He called for the consideration of technological change in the next follow-up and review cycle on SDG implementation, given the opportunities presented by new technologies, as well as the fact that their impacts will depend on governments’ ability “to come together and cooperate on realizing a global vision.”

On 7 December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) announced that more than half of the world’s population will be using the internet at 2018’s end. ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao noted that the milestone “represents an important step towards a more inclusive global information society.” Despite ITU highlighting that 96% of global society now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, Zhao underscored that many are still waiting to experience the gains associated with internet access or a digital economy. With near-global coverage and the fastest rates of growth taking place in Africa, the impact of the internet on society is only expected to increase.

AI algorithms must shed human biases, participants stressed at the 2018 Internet Governance Forum.

In November, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brought together more than 3,000 participants at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on the theme ‘Internet of Trust.’ Key messages are available on the Forum’s eight major topics:

Cybersecurity, Trust & Privacy;

Development, Innovation & Economic Issues;

Digital Inclusion & Accessibility;

Emerging Technologies;

Evolution of Internet Governance;

Human Rights, Gender & Youth;

Media & Content; and

Technical & Operational Topics.

The Chair’s Summary underscores the cross-cutting nature of new technologies, noting that governance of the internet must be both multistakeholder and multidisciplinary to ensure that systems do not discriminate and that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms shed human biases. [UN Press Release] [IGF Homepage]

The IGF is convened annually by the UN Secretary-General, and this year, was hosted by the Government of France. In his remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron launched the ‘Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described opportunities afforded by the digital world, but also advised vigilance. Recognizing that traditional forms of regulation do not necessarily apply to the new challenges that have accompanied the digital era, Guterres noted the emergence of potential issues around cybersecurity, data and instances of “the Internet being used as a platform for hate speech, for repression, censorship, and control.” Guterres emphasized the need to create a shared language, calling for a dedicated effort to include and amplify weak or missing voices.

Next year’s IGF will be hosted by the Government of Germany. An advisory group containing 52 members has been appointed to lead preparations. [UN News Release]

Also in November, the World Web Summit 2018 took place in Lisbon, Portugal, bringing together approximately 70,000 attendees. The 24 discussion tracks ranged from autonomous vehicles to cryptocurrencies to health. Guterres described the web as having the potential to turbocharge the world’s progress towards the SDGs, saying the UN itself is utilizing technologies to enhance impacts and achieve its goals. He also raised concerns on uneven social impacts, the spread of hate speech as noted at the IGF, and the weaponization of artificial intelligence.

An event titled ‘High-level Briefing on Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development: Findings from the World Economic and Social Survey 2018’ took place on 1 November 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Moderated by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, the event reviewed findings from the 2018 survey, a common message of which is that “technology is neither exogenous nor neutral,” meaning that societal needs and policy prerogatives must guide the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies. The survey and event highlighted national-level policy measures that can maximize technologies’ potential while mitigating risks, taking economic efficiency, equity and ethical considerations into account.

307,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/africa-report-finds-slow-progress-on-clean-water-energy-urbanization/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Africa Report Finds Slow Progress on Clean Water, Energy, Urbanization","4 December 2018: The 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report highlights the region’s progress on the SDGs and shares lessons learned in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africa’s Agenda 2063. The 2018 report focuses on five Goals, aligned with the focus of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); and SDG 15 (life on land).

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa jointly prepared the annual report. They launched the report at the 12th session of the Committee of Director-Generals of the National Statistics Office, which took place in Khartoum, Sudan.

On SDG 6, the report finds that access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation has improved in Africa but remains very low by global standards, despite the fact that Africa, excluding North Africa, receives the largest amount of official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. In addition, there are wide disparities between and within countries, with higher access in North Africa compared to the rest of the continent. The proportion of people with safely managed sources of drinking water varies from 100% in Mauritius to 19% in Eritrea. Further, 43% of Africa’s rural population has access to basic drinking water services compared to 82% of the urban population. The report identifies several emerging challenges that threaten progress on SDG 6, including climate change, droughts, floods and water management.

On SDG 7, the report finds access to electricity has increased from 39.7% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2014 in Africa. Despite this progress, access to electricity is “much lower than the global average” and rural-urban disparities are “particularly stark,” with an average electrification rate of 70% among the urban population compared to 17% in rural areas. Hydropower generation accounts for slightly over 60% of Africa’s electricity supply but other renewable energy sources, particularly solar, remain “largely untapped.” Africa’s efficiency in energy use has improved but biomass reliance remains a challenge, with approximately 780 million people cooking with solid biomass.

On SDG 11, the report states that Africa is the fastest urbanizing region in the world, with the urban population predicted to increase from 40% today to 51.5% by 2040. The report reflects that much of the continent’s urbanization is “unplanned…and poorly managed,” and is characterized by severe service and infrastructure deficits and social and spatial segregation as well as the world’s highest proportion of slum dwellers. In addition, the report finds that Africa’s cities have made limited progress on air pollution and solid waste collection, loss and damage from disasters, access to public transport and urban sprawl, constraining the region’s efforts to achieve inclusive growth.

On SDG 12, the report finds that Africa, excluding North Africa, wastes more than 30% of its annual food production as a result of poor post-harvest handling, with most losses occurring at the level of production. Africa’s domestic material consumption remains low.

On SDG 15, Africa’s rate of forest cover loss is “much higher” than the global average. In contrast to this regional trend, Ghana and the Gambia have increased their forest cover as a percentage of their land area. Like other regions of the world, the report observes Africa faces the risk of extinction of major animal species. On a positive note, Africa outperforms most world regions in the conservation and sustainable use of its mountain resources.

The report also reflects on SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), emphasizing that the development of science, technology and innovation (STI) are key for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The report finds that Africa’s STI infrastructure, as measured by internet access and access to electricity, “is improving but relatively weak” and characterized by low investments in research and development and fragmented innovation systems. The report recognizes the investments made by Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia on research and development and strategies to strengthen their innovation systems. The report also underscores the need for strengthening inter-sectoral planning and collaboration to ensure coherent, effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

The report recommends that policymakers, inter alia: prioritize investments in water and sanitation to improve access, enhance health outcomes and leverage populations’ productive capacities; improve rural access to energy to address rural-urban disparities; improve access to energy-efficient cooking stoves to enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution and improve health outcomes; and provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The report also calls for strengthening capacities for urban planning and management to drive inclusive and sustainable economic prosperity and integrating urbanization in national development planning.

Participants discussed the report’s findings at the 13th African Economic Conference (AEC), hosted by the UNECA, AfDB and UNDP in Kigali, Rwanda, from 3-5 December 2018. Adam Elhiraika, UNECA, called for investing in data and analysis on urban trends and impacts of environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, among other recommendations. Chidozie Emenuga, AfDB, said the potential of Africa’s rapidly growing cities and urban settlements “has not been fully tapped.” He urged providing incentives to investments in sanitation, renewable energy and access to electricity.

308,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-votes-to-adopt-global-compact-on-refugees/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Votes to Adopt Global Compact on Refugees,"17 December 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted the Global Compact on Refugees, following a consultation process including a series of thematic discussions and meetings in 2017, and formal consultations on successive drafts between February and July 2018. UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés noted that the adoption of the Compact marks the beginning, not the end, of the international community’s work to respond comprehensively “to the challenges that face refugees and their hosts.”

The Global Compact on Refugees was called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which also called for a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The latter was adopted by 164 governments in Marrakech, Morocco, on 10 December 2018, and is scheduled to be formally endorsed on 19 December 2018, in the UNGA Hall in New York, US.

The refugee compact, while not legally binding, seeks to strengthen the international response to large movements of refugees and protracted refugee situations, and to better define cooperation to share responsibilities. It builds on existing international law and standards, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and human rights treaties. The Compact comprises four parts: i) an introduction setting out the background, guiding principles and objectives of the compact; ii) the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), as agreed to by UN Member States in Annex I of the New York Declaration; iii) a Programme of Action setting out concrete measures to help meet the objectives of the Compact; and iv) arrangements for follow-up and review.

The Compact was presented to the UNGA in September 2018 as part of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ 2018 annual report, and was then discussed during a high-level ministerial event hosted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On 17 December 2018, the UNGA considered the Global Compact on Refugees as part of a resolution on the Office of the UNHCR, which was adopted with 181 votes in favor, two against and three abstentions.

In a media stakeout following the Compact’s adoption, Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, clarified that the US and Hungary had opposed the UNGA resolution containing the Compact. However, he added that in 2018 UNHCR received the highest contribution ever from the US. The three governments abstaining from the vote were Eritrea, Liberia and Libya.

Also on 17 December, following the UNGA meeting to adopt the Compact, UNHCR hosted an event to mark the agreement. Espinosa said that through this agreement, the UNGA demonstrates its efficacy and utility, and cements its role as the ‘Parliament of Humanity.’ She added that low and middle-income countries host over 80% of all refugees.

The refugee compact contains four elements of particular importance for achieving the SDGs, including measures to ease pressures on host countries.

Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General, on behalf of the UN Secretary-General, outlined four elements of the Compact that are particularly important for achieving the SDGs. She noted that the Compact: i) sets out concrete measures to share the responsibility and ease the pressure on the small number of countries that host the majority of refugees; ii) seeks to bring humanitarian and development action closer together, building on the UN Secretary-General’s reform of the UN development system; iii) provides ways to create jobs and livelihoods, and recognizes that refugees and host communities themselves must be at the center of decision-making on refugee issues; and iv) calls on the international community as a whole to take broader initiatives to prevent conflict and build sustained peace.

Grandi noted that it was the first time there was such a concerted effort to reach an agreement on refugees at the UNGA. He reported that 15 countries have rolled out the Compact’s Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which he said has mobilized US$6.5 billion that would have not been accessible through traditional finances.

On next steps, Grandi highlighted that the Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, to take stock of the Compact’s commitments and achievements. He noted the need to plan for this event.

Via video messages, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Foreign Minister of Turkey, said the international community has not done enough to help refugees, and should also strengthen support to host countries and communities. Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stressed the importance of shared responsibility and partnerships to respond to the refugee crisis, adding that the EU and its member States comprise the largest donor worldwide.

Bertine Bahige, a Congolese refugee resettled in the US, remarked that all refugees are looking for hope, and are victims of circumstances they have not chosen. Talking about his experience spending five years in a refugee camp in Mozambique, he said he had felt safe and was given access to resources, but wished he could have had access to education and given the possibility to start building his life.

The 2018 assessment finds that ocean health is relatively stable but additional improvements are needed to achieve a sustainable future.

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and Conservation International developed the OHI to analyze the benefits people derive from the ocean. OHI draws on information from over 100 global datasets to analyze ecological, economic, physical and social dimensions of the ocean’s health and evaluate the benefits that oceans provide to people.

Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health.

The 2018 OHI finds the average score of our ocean’s health is 70 out of 100. The OHI tracks changes in ocean health over time. In 2017, nearly two-thirds of assessed countries experienced decreases in ocean health. In 2018, 111 countries experienced decreases and 109 countries experienced increases in ocean health. Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health. Germany was the only country in the top 17 scorers with a population over one million people. Countries that scored 50 or below included seven countries in Africa, one in Central America and two Middle Eastern nations.

NCEAS Director and OHI lead scientist, Ben Halpern, said the assessment provides an annual comprehensive diagnostic for the world’s oceans that supplies decision makers with information and knowledge to “implement effective actions for improved sustainable ocean management.” Halpern stressed that the OHI’s seven years of data has enabled “deeper insights into how healthy our oceans are through time and space.”

Also on ocean health, Esri announced a partnership with the OHI to produce an online tool titled, ‘Ocean Health Hubs,’ which will enable ocean managers to use data to better understand regional ocean health. Through the partnership, Esri and OHI have integrated OHI scores as a data layer in Esri’s ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World.

OHI Director, Eva Schemmel, explained that Ocean Health Hubs “will streamline data management, target setting and communication into one tool” that multiple collaborators can access and update. By enabling government agencies, scientists, managers, non-governmental organization (NGO) staff and citizens to use the hub together, Schemmel said engagement can be “more efficient and effective.” [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on OHI Assessment] [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on Partnership] [OHI Website]","4 December 2018: The Ocean Health Index (OHI) released its seventh assessment of global ocean health.

310,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/gentle-rain-from-heaven/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Gentle Rain from Heaven,"Do you recall Shakespeare’s masterpiece, ‘The Merchant of Venice?’ The story is set in the 16th century “Floating City.” Although past its heyday, it is still teeming with wealthy merchants making huge gains from silk or spice trade. Antonio, one of those wealthy merchants, has defaulted on his loan because he lost his ships at sea. His moneylender, Shylock, is pursuing his debts, asking for a pound of flesh.

It was around this time that insurance as we know it was invented, developed as a mechanism particularly in response to the needs of merchants – not necessarily to protect their flesh, but to protect their wealth, in case ships were lost to pirates or storms.

From the 16th to the 21st Century

Fast forward more than 400 years, the insurance industry has expanded and evolved.

Insurance is now available to us in many forms. We are all acquainted with life, health and home insurance. Those making a living from agriculture are also familiar with crop insurance, available to safeguard against the unexpected arrival (or not) of rain.

Yet while it is more widespread, it not yet universal. Just as many people in developed countries cannot imagine life without it, it continues to be out of reach for many, including farmers in developing countries.

Take the Philippines, one of the countries I have worked closely with over the last five years. Here, only 6 and 3 percent of rice and corn farmers, respectively, are protected by insurance. Probably the Venetian merchants of yore were more protected than Filipino farmers today.

Pursuing Protection for the Most Vulnerable

The question is how do we extend coverage to those who need it most? Essentially, we need to innovate.

In the Philippines, the Government and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) are doing just this: between 2014 and 2017, we tested a form of crop insurance accessible and affordable specifically for poor farmers: weather index-based insurance, or ‘WIBI’.

Under the project, financed by the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) established under the UNFCCC, WIBI was delivered to more than 2,000 farmers. Put simply, instead of payments contingent on damage verification by insurance agents (often months after an event), payments were automatically made within five days of rainfall being registered as too much or too little.

This short animation explains why crop insurance has traditionally been inaccessible for such farmers, why WIBI is considered a promising alternative and what we achieved.

Not There Yet

What were the results? Some 2,413 farmers signed up for a WIBI policy. Over the course of three years, 178 of those received payouts, totaling nearly US$30,000. Importantly, the recipients received payouts within five days, proving the advantage of WIBI over traditional insurance. The fast payouts enabled them to re-start planting activities in the same cropping cycle. This is critical as most farmers take out loans to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and a bad harvest immediately puts them in debt.

Does this mean that WIBI will replace traditional insurance? I don’t think so. During implementation, we also learned about the inherent shortcomings of WIBI, the biggest of which is the fact it only covers damage related to rainfall. It does not cover pests and diseases, which rice farmers report as an equally big risks for production.

In addition, the concept of WIBI is extremely difficult for farmers to understand. While traditional insurance is pretty intuitive – any damages on a farm, once verified by an insurance agent, will be compensated, whether they are due to pests, diseases or rainfall – compensation under WIBI is determined by whether the right amount of rain falls in the various stages of a crop’s growth. Yet farmers often don’t know how many millimeters of rain are required in different stages for good harvests, creating confusion as to eligibility.

Many of us can probably empathize. I certainly cannot explain what kind of coverage I have under my health insurance.

Where to Now?

Our work with the Government of the Philippines yielded some important findings: neither WIBI nor traditional insurance has the kind of versatility to make it attractive for poor farmers; and we need to be prepared to evolve different models and means of delivering insurance.

Efforts are underway. Recent technological advancements are reducing the time-consuming payout process of traditional insurance. For example, some are testing the use of photos taken by farmers themselves with their mobile phones for verifying damages. Meanwhile, satellite images, which are becoming cheaper and more precise, are also being used to verify damages on the ground.

Our work also highlighted fundamental questions about how best to protect poor farmers. Should countries invest their finite resources in developing better insurance products as we tried to do with the Government of the Philippines? Or should the same resources be used in educating farmers for pests and disease management, or in irrigation development so that insurance is not needed in the first place? Although the concept of crop insurance is gaining currency in developing countries, these questions are hardly asked, and the conundrums remain unresolved.

Gentle Rain No Longer Drops from Heaven

Returning to ‘The Merchant of Venice.’ The finale nears when Portia makes a plea to the moneylender Shylock to show mercy:

The quality of mercy is not strained;

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven;

Upon the place beneath…

(Act 4, Scene 1)

In the end, Antonio is saved. He also learns that his ships returned safely.

Farmers are not so lucky. If they have to default on their loans because of bad harvests, their lives must go on. There is no Portia to make a plea for them.

World leaders meet again in Katowice, Poland, this month to agree on the rulebook for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as promised in the landmark Paris Agreement three years ago but effective climate action does not appear to be in sight yet. As another year goes by with GHG emissions unabated, the quality of mercy seems to be strained as the gentle rain no longer drops from heaven.

Mozambique based its current NDC on its National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy 2013-2030, which seeks to increase community and economic resilience, and promote low-carbon development through integrating adaptation and mitigation into sectoral and local planning. The government has committed to reduce about 76.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 eq) from 2020 to 2030, conditional on the provision of support from the international community.

The Plan was developed in consultation with 21 government ministries and institutions and 18 NDC Partnership members, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Governments of Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the US, the European Commission (EC), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI), among others. [NDC Partnership Press Release] [Mozambique’s First NDC] [UNFCCC Interim NDC Registry]","28 November 2018: The Government of Mozambique has approved a three-year plan to begin implementation of its nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change.
By aligning short- and medium-term needs for adaptation and mitigation measures with resources and support from 18 NDC Partnership members through existing and planned projects, the plan seeks to fast track climate action.
The Partnership Plan addresses short-term priority needs set by the government for implementation of its long-term 2020-2025 NDC Roadmap, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring framework on low-carbon and resilient development that details sector-specific priorities that was developed through local and national level consultations.
The Plan covers agriculture, civil aviation, energy, early warning systems, forestry, health, transport, urban mobility, waste and water.

He described UNDP’s work with the UN Secretary-General’s transition team to ensure that the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019.



Among Steiner’s updates was the announcement that the transition of the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) was completed on 1 November 2018, and DOCO is now part of the Secretariat, with funding from UNDP and its current configuration until June 2019 in order to ensure a smooth transition.

Steiner said the system went through an exercise to determine how many of the current 129 Resident Coordinators (RC) want to remain RCs, and how many want to return to UNDP or their originating agencies. The exercise was completed at the end of September 2018, with 117 of them choosing to remain RCs. Thus the “lift and shift” operation will consist of moving 90% of the current RCs from UNDP to the Secretariat. He said this implies developing a service level agreement that will cover a second request by the Secretary-General, comprised of: putting in place an infrastructure to allow the RCs to operate on 1 January 2019; helping staff their offices in 129 countries; and setting the payroll for the 129 RCs and 1,200 RC offices and DOCO staff that form the new RC system.

Steiner reported that this operation will cost UNDP US$2.6 million, and emphasized the need to ensure sufficient funding for the Secretariat to support the new structure moving forward. He said the cost of the contribution to the RC system by UNDP will be US$10.3 million.

“Everything is happening as we speak,” Steiner noted, with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG) currently developing new job descriptions for the RCs, as well as the mutual accountability framework between RCs and the UN country teams. This exercise is being conducted as a collaboration between UNDP, the UN Secretariat, and the transition team, Steiner said. He added that interim protocols and internal control frameworks are also needed for the process to delink the RCs from UNDP.

Steiner also flagged the required “unprecedented exercise” of replacing the 117 UNDP country resident representatives, since the current RCs have been playing that role. He said that UNDP has had four months to identify and appoint the new resident representatives by the end of 2018. He reported that in one month of advertising the openings, UNDP received 3,500 applications, and 195 candidates are currently shortlisted. He saluted the fact that 22% of the candidates are from Africa.

Steiner noted that UNDP is coming from “an extremely contractive period,” in which it was in deficit while Member States’ contributions were at a historical low, and hundreds of posts were frozen or eliminated; the total staff decreased by 1,000 of its total of 8,000 between 2012 and 2017. Currently, UNDP is increasing at a rate of 6-9% per annum, and replacing its pyramidal structure with a “21st century” global policy expertise network, which will be rolled out starting 1 January 2019. Steiner said more resources are going to Africa and the Arab states in conflict, UNDP is reducing operational costs while delivering more, and it is “delivering on the promises for the UN development system reform.”

Steiner added that UNDP is exceeding delivery on all its six of its “signature solutions” in 2018, and anticipated having one of the highest rates of delivery in the history of the UN.

In the ensuing discussion, Member States asked whether UNDP or the RC will play the integrative role for the UN presence in countries (Albania), inquired about the timeline for new appointments to be discussed with host governments (El Salvador), asked about an internal communication strategy for UNDP’s new relationship with other UN agencies on the ground (Switzerland), asked what the impact will be on multi-country offices (Antigua and Barbuda), and requested information on plans for private sector partnerships (Netherlands, Sweden and US).

Steiner said UNDP will move away from coordinating UN agencies’ activity on the ground. He emphasized that the role of the RC is not to implement the SDGs, but to coordinate SDG implementation on the ground, and UNDP will support the RCs when requested. He explained that UNDP’s integrative platform is an offer, with the agencies on the ground and the RCs to decide if or when to use it. He clarified that UNDP’s principal role is not to serve as the integrative platform for the UN system but provide the development support.

The UNDP Administrator said the appointment letters for the RCs were to be sent to countries in November 2018. He also added that no major changes will be made to the current composition of the UNDP country teams.

The “new vision for the Resident Coordinator” is outlined on the UN’s reform website, which also provides other information on the repositioning of the UN development system, overall.

Leaders focused on the future of work, infrastructure for development, a sustainable food future and a gender mainstreaming strategy across the G20 agenda, among other topics.

In the Declaration, G20 leaders reaffirm their commitment to leading the transformation towards sustainable development and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as the framework to advance this goal and the G20 Action Plan.

On a sustainable food future, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to tackle food security and encourage the voluntary use and sharing of innovative and traditional agricultural practices and technologies. Leaders highlight the importance of collaboration among public and private stakeholders to facilitate adaptation, strengthen risk management, protect biodiversity and provide effective responses to reduce the impacts of extreme weather on agriculture. Leaders further commit to increase efforts to enhance efficiency, sustainability, productivity and value addition and encourage initiatives to reduce food loss and waste.

On education, G20 leaders recognize access to education as a human right and underline the importance of girls’ education. Leaders commit to promoting coordination between employment and equitable, quality education policies.

On gender, G20 leaders recognize gender equality is critical for economic growth and fair and sustainable development, and note progress in reducing the gender gap in labor force participation while affirming that more needs to be done. Leaders commit to continue to promote initiatives to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls and gender-based violence and to promote women’s economic empowerment and improve labor conditions for all, such as through access to quality and affordable care infrastructure and parental leave and reducing the gender pay gap. Leaders further commit to promote women’s access to leaders and decision making and increase their participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and high-tech sectors.

A strong economy and healthy planet are mutually reinforcing.

On infrastructure for development, G20 leaders reaffirm commitments to attract more private capital to infrastructure investment, and endorse the Roadmap to Infrastructure as an Asset Class and the G20 Principles for the Infrastructure Project Preparation Phase. Leaders commit to action to address data gaps, improve risk mitigation instruments and achieve greater contractual standardization.

On climate change, G20 leaders recognize that a strong economy and healthy planet “are mutually reinforcing,” and note the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15). Leaders recognize the importance of comprehensive adaptation strategies, and support actions and cooperation in developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable, including small island developing States (SIDS). Having discussed low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission strategies, shared country experiences and considered the work programme on adaptation, leaders look forward to “successful outcomes” of the Katowice Climate Change Conference. Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirm commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The US reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, “utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment.”

Also on energy, G20 leaders encourage energy transitions that combine growth with decreasing GHG emissions, and recognize opportunities for innovation, growth and job creation through increased investment in cleaner and sustainable energy sources. Leaders further recognize the “role of all energy sources and technologies in the energy mix and different possible national paths to achieve cleaner energy systems under the term ‘transitions’.” Leaders further commit to promote universal energy access by eradicating energy poverty.

On the future of work, G20 leaders recognize the importance of policy responses and international cooperation to ensure that benefits from technological transformations are widely shared. They endorse the Menu of Policy Options for the Future of Work, and state their commitment to consider individual country circumstances to harness technology to strengthen growth and productivity, support people during transitions and address distributional challenges, secure sustainable tax systems and ensure evidence-based decision making. Leaders further express commitment to, inter alia: promoting decent work, vocational training and skills development; making social protection systems strong and portable, subject to national law and circumstances; increasing labor force participation of underrepresented and vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities; implementing policies to improve the employment situation of young people, consistent with the G20 Antalya Youth Goal; and taking actions to eradicate child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and modern slavery in the world of work, including through fostering sustainable supply chains.

In the declaration, leaders also address the importance of: mobilizing sustainable finance and strengthening financial inclusion; enhancing early childhood development to break the cycle of intergenerational and structural poverty and reduce inequalities; implementing health-related aspects of the SDGs, including reducing the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR), moving towards universal health coverage (UHC) and ending HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; addressing the root causes of displacement and growing humanitarian needs; and preventing and fighting corruption and fostering transparency and integrity in the public and private sectors.

Their call came on the 32nd anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Right to Development. The Special Rapporteurs note that the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will review progress on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at a time when the world is “wealthier but also more unequal than ever before.”

The Rapporteurs’ statement was released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In it, the Rapporteurs stress that inequality and discrimination threaten the right to development and are drivers for migration. The statement cites figures of 800 million people living in extreme poverty, while the richest 10% of the world’s population earn up to 40% of total global income and hold half of the world’s total wealth. The Special Rapporteurs urge all stakeholders to take the opportunity of the HLPF review of SDG 10 to bring about more equal societies.

Besides highlighting the dynamics of inequality among individuals and communities, the Special Rapporteurs observe that inequalities in the global governance system are hindering the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS) and countries affected by displaced people from realizing their right to development, while they are being disproportionately affected by climate change, natural hazards, environmental degradation and austerity policies. The statement recalls that the Declaration on the Right to Development enshrines equality of opportunity for everyone to be able to access education, health services, food and housing, and that tackling inequality and combating discrimination are legally binding obligations.

The HLPF will convene on the afternoon of Tuesday, 24 September and all day on Wednesday, 25 September 2019, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The Q&A refers to the meeting as the “SDG Summit,” noting that it will meet under the auspices of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at the level of Heads of State and Heads of Government. The chair will be the president of UNGA 74.

DESA points to three expected outcomes from the Summit: a political declaration, a range of voluntary commitments, and the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the UN’s role. On the political declaration, DESA says that this will be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the Forum, following negotiations by Member States in a process to be co-facilitated by the permanent representatives of Bahamas and Sweden. The declaration will provide political guidance on accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, DESA notes.

On the voluntary commitments, the Q&A says that governments and stakeholders are encouraged to announce commitments for the implementation of SDGs. Commitments can be announced during the Summit, or online before the Summit.

On the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and UN role, DESA suggests that the Summit “could demonstrate the benefits of an inclusive multilateralism through the reaffirmation of the 2030 Agenda and the revitalization of the United Nations’ role in linking peace and security, human rights and development and promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda as the international community seeks to provide global solutions to our common challenges, promote prosperity for all and endeavor to leave no one behind.”

The three events will be mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate progress towards sustainable development, DESA notes.

The Summit also is expected to play several other roles, including:

Enable the international community to look back at areas where progress has been insufficient to meet the Goals on time, and identify what can be done to catalyze the needed changes;

Identify and showcase areas of progress, and consider actions needed for scaling up;

Share experiences and best practices, and provide access to tools that can accelerate change; and

Provide a space for building partnerships to further SDG achievement at all levels.

The Summit will convene in parallel to the UNGA’s general debate as it begins its 74th session in September 2019. Taking place back-to-back with the Summit will be the 2019 Climate Summit convened by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and the UNGA’s High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development (FFD). Like the SDG Summit/HPLF meeting under UNGA auspices, the FFD dialogue is mandated by the 2030 Agenda to take place every four years. DESA notes that the three events will be “mutually reinforcing in identifying areas for action to accelerate the progress towards sustainable development.”

Finally, the Summit will include side events, special events and exhibitions on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, civil society meetings, and an SDG media zone.

The handbook reflects on recent developments, including refinements to the LDC criteria and progress made by several countries towards graduation from the category.



The ‘Handbook on the Least Developed Country Category: Inclusion, Graduation and Special Support Measures’ was launched at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 27 November 2018. Authored by DESA in collaboration with the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP), it includes chapters on: criteria and procedures for inclusion and graduation; international support measures for the LDCs (such as measures related to trade, development assistance and support to participation in international forums); and indicators, methods and data sources for the LDC criteria. It updates the previous edition of the handbook, which was published in 2015.

According to the UN, LDCs are countries characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The LDC category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures are needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries.

The CDP is undertaking a comprehensive review of the LDC criteria, taking “relevant agendas” into account.

Decisions on inclusion into and graduation from the list of LDCs are made by the UNGA, based on recommendations by the CDP, endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The CDP, a subsidiary advisory body of ECOSOC and composed of 24 members, analyzes the list of LDCs every three years during “triennial reviews” of the LDC category to identify any countries that may qualify for inclusion into or graduation from the LDC category. To this end, it uses specific procedures and criteria, such as gross national income per capita, the human assets index, and the economic vulnerability index. The handbook indicates that in response to a request by the UNGA, the CDP is undertaking a comprehensive review of the LDC criteria during 2017-2020, “taking into account all aspects of the evolving international development context, including relevant agendas.”

According to the handbook, the initial list of LDCs, as proposed by the Committee for Development Planning (the predecessor of the CDP) and endorsed by the UNGA in 1971, included Afghanistan, Benin, Bhutan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Samoa, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Yemen. Throughout the years, 28 countries were added, as countries gained independence and faced severe developmental challenges, namely: Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Gambia (1975); Cabo Verde, Comoros (1977); Guinea-Bissau (1981); Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Togo (1982); Vanuatu (1985); Kiribati, Mauritania, Tuvalu (1986); Myanmar (1987); Mozambique (1988); Liberia (1990); Cambodia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Solomon Islands, Zambia (1991); Angola, Eritrea (1994); Senegal (2000); Timor-Leste (2003); and South Sudan (2012).

As of 2018, 47 countries are included in the category, as five countries have graduated: Botswana, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, the Maldives, and Samoa. Vanuatu and Angola are scheduled for graduation in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

The handbook reports that countries currently in the LDC category comprise approximately 13% of the world’s population, but account for less than 1.3% of world gross domestic product (GDP) and for approximately 0.9% of world trade.

The handbook is expected to be updated on a regular basis to reflect relevant developments, including the outcome of the triennial reviews of the list of the LDCs.

The brief underscores the potential contributions of UN-REDD Programme projects on planning for REDD+ to the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The brief aims to help countries engaged in REDD+ planning to consider additional environmental and social benefits, including biodiversity conservation, provision of food, fuel and fiber, support to local livelihoods and soil erosion control, using an integrated land-use planning approach. The brief further seeks to build capacity on the use of spatial analyses to help identify areas where REDD+ could deliver non-carbon benefits.

On the SDGs, the brief describes REDD+ contributions to SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). For SDG 13, the brief highlights contributions to climate change mitigation through supporting countries in the use of spatial analyses to plan for REDD+ actions that reduce emissions and deliver environmental and social benefits. The brief argues that these analyses help countries to: design interventions that strengthen adaptive capacity and resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters (contributing to SDG target 13.1); integrate climate measures into national planning, policies and strategies (contributing to SDG target 13.2); and improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation (in line with SDG target 13.3).

Consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen implementation of REDD+, the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

REDD+ actions contribute to several SDG 15 targets by focusing on the consideration of benefits beyond carbon in REDD+ and helping countries to integrate biodiversity and ecosystem values into national and local planning and poverty reduction strategies, in line with SDG target 15.9. Further, countries can design REDD+ actions to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services (SDG target 15.1) and mountain ecosystems (SDG target 15.4) as well as to promote the sustainable use of forests and halt deforestation (SDG target 15.2) and reduce habitat degradation and tackle biodiversity loss (SDG target 15.5).

On the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the brief highlights the contributions of REDD+ to Strategic Goals A, B, C and D. As an illustration, UN-REDD Programme projects help countries to identify overlap between areas of high risk of deforestation and areas that are home to endangered species, which helps countries to prioritize areas for REDD+ and sustainable forest management interventions (Aichi Targets 5 and 7) that can reduce pressures on biodiversity and forests while contributing to improvements in species conservation status (Aichi Target 12).

The brief highlights the results of the UN-REDD Programme, which supports 64 partner countries around the world. Twenty-two countries have published a National REDD+ Strategy or Action Plan, all of which include achieving non-carbon benefits among their strategies, goals or objectives. The brief underscores how the consideration of non-carbon benefits in national and provincial level planning can strengthen REDD+ implementation and simultaneously help countries to achieve the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The MDBs issued a declaration at the start of the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

The nine MDBs are the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), the New Development Bank (NDB) and the World Bank.

This commitment builds on a December 2017 commitment by the MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC), in which the MDBs and IDFC pledged to align financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, including to support the ‘Five Voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action with Financial Institutions.’ The MDBs commitment goes beyond specific MDBs’ 2020 and 2030 climate finance targets, and builds on their ongoing contribution to climate finance, which amounted to US$35 billion in developing and emerging economies in 2017.

There is an urgent need to ensure that financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low emission and climate-resilient development.

In the declaration, the MDBs stress international consensus “on the urgent need to ensure that policy engagements and financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-resilient development.” To realize this vision, the MDBs are developing a dedicated approach that will focus on six building blocks identified as the core areas for alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. These areas are: 1) alignment with mitigation goals to ensure MDB operations are consistent with countries’ low-emission development pathways and the Paris Agreements’ mitigation objectives; 2) adaptation and climate-resilient operations, such as actively managing physical climate change risks in a manner consistent with climate-resilient development and increasing clients’ and their communities’ ability to adapt to adverse climate impacts; 3) acceleration of the transition through climate finance, by further scaling up climate finance and operationalizing new approaches to bridge the climate finance gap and accelerate support to countries in achieving their nationally determined contributions (NDCs); 4) engagement and policy development support for countries and other clients to accelerate the transition to low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways; 5) an emphasis on climate reporting, including further development of tools and methods for characterizing, monitoring and reporting on results of activities, with an emphasis on harmonizing approaches where possible; and 6) alignment of internal activities, to ensure that internal MDB operations are in line with the Paris Agreement objectives.

A joint MDB working group is developing methods and tools to operationalize this joint effort for each of the building blocks. The MDBs further committed to report to COP 25 on progress on their joint Paris Agreement alignment approach and individual MDB progress towards this alignment.

320,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/behavioral-and-cognitive-approaches-to-biodiversity-conservation/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches to Biodiversity Conservation,"It was quite intriguing to read an article that explains how a sign that sought to promote awareness in conservation, had in fact worked against conservation. A sign was put up in a peatland forest in Arizona, US, to deter people from stealing from the forest. It read as follows: “Many past visitors have removed petrified wood from this park, destroying the natural state of the petrified forest.” Months later, when a review was done on the impact of this sign and pilferage from the forest, researchers were astonished to find that stealing had tripled.

A behavioral science perspective on how people perceived the sign suggests that people must have thought that “since others have done it, it is alright to continue doing so.” This is a startling finding for a conservation expert who never thought of this angle in conservation.

Let me give you another example. A recent World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report cites a 60 percent loss of biodiversity globally since 1970 in spite of billions of dollars spent on conservation and dozens of global political commitments. For the common man on the street, the message is simple: we have lost 60 percent of biodiversity but I am not feeling any immediate impacts. My needs are still met, I am wealthier, consume better and invest in issues of my choice. There is no great famine, no large death toll, no economic downturn that I can see in front of my eyes.

I know this is a provocative statement to make but this is more or less what is happening in our conversations about conservation. In a book titled, ‘The Death of Environmentalism,’ the author states that the word “warming” in “global warming” “feels good” for some people. Similarly, in conservation, declining biodiversity is still not seen as a threat to our survival by non-conservationists, including the general public.

My recent research into cognitive and behavioral thinking led to me to look for uncommon answers to the way we are communicating about conservation and its importance. A few thousand delegates who convene once every two years to have heated discussions on why we are losing in our actions to protect biodiversity and what we can do to improve the situation has not helped us in the recent decades.

Looking at cognitive science, I came across an interesting set of experiences from the advertising industry on how the industry captures people’s attention and imagination to push their agenda. Two specific examples are of relevance to how we advance the biodiversity agenda using cognition: social proofing; and communicating impacts of our actions.

Social Proofing Our Message

In an article published in the Wall Street Journal on turning consumers green, the author notes that there was more response to the sign that said neighbors are actively using the options to go green than to those that mention how much money one can save, how responsible one could be towards the environment or to what extent this is a moral obligation.

Reported progress on biodiversity conservation and climate change suggests that few are aware of this. Having reviewed all the national reports to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted by States until 2018, it is clear that almost all of them address what governments are doing for conservation but there is very little information on what others, including civil society, business community, UN agencies and academic institutions, are contributing. This is a major disconnect, which disincentivizes people from partnering in conservation. Few environment ministries’ web portals, united in the network of national Clearing-House Mechanisms, highlight successes of these stakeholders.

For the post-2020 biodiversity framework, we need to social proof the strategic plan and targets. Merely reporting that these are developed in a participatory manner through a few workshops and consultations will not do.

Communicating Impacts of Our Actions

We all know that in spite of all our efforts the environment is getting from bad to worse. All the investments are yet to give us impactful results, and we are struggling to make the “big breakthrough.” In this context, it is important to be cautious with our messages about challenges and failures.

It is alright to admit to failures, but environmental managers need to ensure that the message is communicated in a manner that clarifies the reasons for failure better. Additionally, the more the common man feels the guilt for their own actions, the better the chances for behavioral change. This, however, would require workable solutions.

Take the example of a 1962 advertisement by David & Goliath for the car rental company Avis that was far behind Hertz in brand popularity. It stated: “When you’re only number two you try harder. Or Else.” The advertisement increased Avis’s annual profit by US$1.2 million in a decade, and the company ran it for 50 years.

Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches in the Post-2020 Framework and 2030 Agenda

The 2010 Biodiversity Target was met only partially, and there are indications that the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be achieved in their entirety. At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Beijing, China, governments will face the challenging task of upholding people’s confidence in multilateral approaches to and national actions on saving biodiversity.

Conservation could benefit from cognitive and behavioral approaches now more than ever before. These approaches could help achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as well as SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 14 (life below water). This is the main message from a side event FLEDGE organized during the CBD COP 14 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The examples and approaches outlined in this article resonated with many countries who suggested actions towards behavioral change. It is our hope that countries will explore these options further as we develop the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

Until now, the role of RC has been combined with that of UNDP’s Resident Representative. The candidates for Resident Representative will be submitted to the respective countries’ governments for approval prior to appointment.

In May 2018 the UN General Assembly approved a set of changes for “repositioning” the UN development system, including reforms to the RC system.

The reforms to the RC system are part of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ efforts to align the UN development system with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.



During its 72nd session, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) agreed on a new funding scheme for the RC system, which will require a total investment of $US281 million in 2019. The reform of the RC system entails delinking it from the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and aims to create a system that is fully dedicated to the 2030 Agenda and independent from any UN agency, while being more transparent and more accountable to Member States.

The Fifth Committee met on 28 November 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Chandramouli Ramanathan, Acting Controller, introduced the Secretary‑General’s report on the matter, noting that the UNGA had decided to double the amount contributed to the RC system through the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG’s) cost‑sharing arrangements. This arrangement, which is one of three overall funding sources for the RC system, will amount to US$77.5 million for 2019. The UN Secretariat’s share is $13.57 million.

In the ensuing discussion, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) stressed that as the UN reconfigures the RC system, transparency and accountability to governments are essential, given that the UN development system relies “heavily” on the RC system to fulfill the mandates of intergovernmentally agreed outcomes related to sustainable development. Pakistan said poverty eradication should remain UN development system’s overarching goal.

China stressed that the new RC system should not compete with UN’s existing resources. The Philippines said the funding arrangement for the RC system must address the decline of core contributions while putting no additional burdens on programme countries.

Switzerland also for Liechtenstein emphasized that the Secretary‑General must provide full transparency to all stakeholders on the system’s expenditures, total costs of operations and results achieved. She commended the Secretary‑General for proposing relevant mechanisms to that end, including a dedicated website for Member States and partners.

On 14 November, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner updated Member States on preparations to ensure the reformed system will be in place on 1 January 2019. Among his updates, he noted that the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) has been transitioned to the Secretariat, and outlined the process of transitioning the current RCs to the new arrangements.

The MOP also agreed on key species action plans on African-Eurasian waterbirds, and adopted a resolution on AEWA’s contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Agreement’s relevance to the SDGs.

MOP 7 took place under the theme, ‘Beyond 2020: Shaping Flyway Conservation for the Future.’ The meeting convened from 4-8 December in Durban, South Africa.

On the Aichi Targets and the SDGs, the MOP determines that the greatest benefits to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 are AEWA implementation actions that, inter alia: ensure the conservation and wise use of national networks of protected areas; ensure that land uses are fully compatible with sustaining migratory waterbird populations; reduce, mitigate and compensate for habitat loss and degradation as appropriate, restore degraded habitats to reverse past losses and create new multifunctional wetlands; implement climate change adaptation measures related to waterbird habitats; remove unnecessary causes of waterbird mortality and ensure that harvests, where made, are sustainable; and develop strong engagement with local communities on the management and wise use of waterbirds and their wetland habitats. The MOP urges Parties to ensure that national authorities responsible for AEWA implementation are fully involved in updating national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) to further promote synergies between biodiversity-related treaties; and urges Parties to highlight to their development agencies the relevance of AEWA implementation in the context of SDG delivery and to stress the need to better integrate actions for waterbird and wetland conservation within relevant development projects to achieve benefits for both waterbirds and human communities. The MOP requests the Technical Committee to bring an assessment of AEWA’s contributions to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and a reflection on AEWA’s contribution to the post-2020 development agenda to MOP 8.

Climate change is a key driver of species decline.

Delegates adopted resolutions on, inter alia: guidance on the implementation of the AEWA Action Plan; climate-resilient flyways; strengthening the monitoring of migratory waterbirds; and financial and institutional arrangements. The AEWA Plan of Action for Africa for 2019-2027 responds to contemporary waterbirds conservation issues in Africa and across the flyway. MOP 7 also considered a report on the effects of plastic on waterbirds and on the conservation status of species listed under the Agreement.

On key species action plans, MOP 7 adopted new International Single Species Action and Management Plans (ISSAPs and ISSMPs) for the Barnacle Goose and Greylag Goose. The MOP extended the ISSAPs and ISSMPs for Black-tailed Godwit, Eurasian Spoonbill, Ferruginous Duck, Great Snipe, Lesser Flamingo, Maccoa Duck, Madagascar Pond Heron and White-winged Flufftail for an additional ten years. In addition, MOP 7 retired the plans for the Light-bellied Brent Goose and Black-winged Pratincole.

AEWA Executive Secretary, Jacques Trouvilliez, welcomed the MOP’s adoption of a new Strategic Plan and a Plan of Action for Africa. He said this mandate will enable all countries to collaborate to “ensure a future for waterbirds across a flyway that stretches from the very tip of Africa, across the Middle East to the High Arctic.” Trouvilliez also underscored the Agreement’s work to make the flyway more resilient to climate change, noting that climate change is a key driver of species decline.

AEWA is an intergovernmental treaty focused on the conservation of migratory waterbirds that migrate along the African-Eurasian Flyway. The Agreement covers 254 species of birds that are ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle.

324,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/afforestation-increases-water-supply-but-only-with-these-considerations/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Afforestation Increases Water Supply – But Only with These Considerations,"With increasing needs for water and food security and rapid urbanisation resulting from a booming global population, forests maintenance and development face great competition with other priorities. While we are losing forest resources at a high rate globally, afforestation efforts are made in some regions to offset this adverse effect.

Afforestation is the preferred measure for policymakers to solve a range of ecological problems, as it is generally believed that forests help to improve soil health and quality, reverse land degradation, halt land desertification, and provide clean water through an intensified water cycle. Especially within the context of SDG 15 (life on land), does afforestation always have a positive effect? The answer is ‘no,’ at least not always for water provision. A study of the relationship between afforestation and water supply in several regions under different climate conditions shows afforestation resulted in a decline in water supply in all climates (see Table 1).

These outcomes contradict the common belief that afforestation increases water supply. A critical driving process of these results is evapotranspiration, which is a key hydrological process in the water cycle. When lands are converted from other land uses to forests, the partitioning of precipitation into green (part of water available for plant use) and blue (part of water available for human use) water fluxes changes.

Evapotranspiration is a major green water flux, while river discharge and groundwater are typical blue water fluxes. Tree growth can consume more water than other shorter vegetation. According to the mass balance principle, if more water is used by trees, less water will flow into rivers and lakes or recharge the groundwater that people can directly use. The direct impact on water supply is becoming an increasingly urgent issue for water resource managers and planners as demands for water continue to rise.

How then can a positive effect of afforestation on water supply be achieved? We need to consider three central aspects.

First, scale matters: afforestation can accelerate the water cycle and movement at the global level. For example, more than 2 square kilometers of forest expansion can increase the possibility of rainfall. Trees transport water to the air, and water vapour moves to another place which can be geographically far from the afforested location, such as to another country or even continent through wind-driven circulation. This increases the possibility of precipitation in another location and thus contributes to the water supply in that other region. This indicates that, at a global scale, afforestation can indeed bring benefits to the water cycle.

Second, species matters: we must choose suitable tree species for afforestation to have a positive effect on the local water supply. Depending on the species, plantation forests may have different structure and amounts of water consumption (Schwärzel et al. 2018). Tree water use also declines with age. Over time, runoff reduction trends can be reversed, and water supply can be improved. Evidence shows, for example, that water supply may start to improve after 30 years in the case of pines and 15 years in the case of eucalypts (Scott and Prinsloo 2008).

Third, site matters: we need to establish forests in the right place. In dryland, less water is available from precipitation. As tree cover increases, the amount of water available is likely to become less and less, which is critical for areas that already suffer from water shortage and have high demand and competition for water (Zhang and Schwärzel 2017). Compared to dry-prone climates, water is not a limiting factor in tropical climate due to high precipitation. The decline in water supply resulting from afforestation is likely less critical and might even be negligible.

At the global level, many afforestation efforts are ongoing. There are, among others, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) in China, National Afforestation and Reforestation Plan (PNFR) in Ecuador, and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) in India. In Nigeria, afforestation is considered as a promising solution to achieve climate change mitigation and to solve water supply issues (Olorunfemi et al. 2016).

Nigeria recognises the importance of keeping their forests. The Nigerian savannah has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from 16°C to 37°C and an annual rainfall about 1,220 milimeters. Afforestation in this region could induce more precipitation, and water availability could potentially increase in the long term. However, we should also recognise that there are risks for water supply in the short term.

Forests – when managed properly – can increase resilience of water supply to enable adaptation to global change. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) recently published a global assessment report highlighting that all of the SDGs are either directly or indirectly related to water and the forest-water nexus. Scientific insights on the forest-water nexus are particularly important to manage and optimize the trade-offs. Afforestation does not always have positive effects on the water supply. The seasonal and annual water yield from forested areas largely depends on forest management, covering selection of tree species, forest structure, and density.

Understanding the interlinkages and feedback loops – as advocated by the UN University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES) via the Nexus Approach – will support more effective and integrated policymaking, and represents an important contribution towards achieving the SDGs.

The partners proposed a partnership and an annual forum that would underline how a transition to clean transport can provide cleaner air, innovative industry and a safe and stable climate.

According to the UNFCCC, the transportation sector has had the fastest emissions growth of any sector over the last 50 years. The transportation sector is responsible for 23 percent of global energy-related carbon emissions, and represents a major source of air pollution.

COP 24 is a platform to promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.

Kurtyka said the Polish COP 24 Presidency proposes “e-mobility as one of the main topics of this year’s COP.” He explained that Poland aims to contribute to global climate policy and galvanize global trends towards electromobility through the Partnership and its annual forum. He highlighted Poland’s experience in implementing legislation and projects on electromobility, including the ‘Zero Emission Urban Bus System’ (ZeEUS). Kurtyka stressed that Poland wants e-mobility actions “to become an impulse towards ensuring universal opportunities to live in clean, environmentally friendly cities.” Harrington said the UK and Poland “are calling on all countries to renew their efforts to accelerate the transition to low-emission vehicles to create a cleaner, greener legacy for future generations.”

The ‘Driving Change Together Partnership,’ or ‘Katowice Partnership for E-Mobility,’ is a dedicated framework for encouraging technological and organizational changes in the sector to further develop zero-emission transport. A proposal on the Partnership stresses that transport must be decarbonized to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and underlines the potential economic, health and environmental benefits of a transition to a low-carbon economy, in particular the development and deployment of zero-emission vehicles. The proposal recognizes initiatives committed to achieving the goal of sustainable transport and development of e-mobility, and calls on Parties and non-Party stakeholders to use COP 24 as a platform to “promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.” The proposal further declares an intent to work together to ensure that e-mobility and the UNFCCC process “complement and enhance each other” and share experience and expertise towards e-mobility through capacity building and peer-to-peer cooperation.

Through the Partnership, supported by an annual forum, the Polish COP 24 Presidency will create a network of partnerships between regional and national governments, cities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to build and share knowledge of electromobility and accelerate a “transport e-mobility revolution” at international and local levels.

In this report titled, ‘Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C’ (SR15), the IPCC identifies several synergies between addressing global climate change and limiting global warming, on the one hand, and the realization of sustainable development in general and the SDGs in particular, on the other hand. By pursuing sustainable development it will be possible, in other words, to address global climate change, itself one of the SGDs (Goal 13).

Indigenous knowledge and indigenous peoples have been explicitly recognized as essential to achieving the SGDs. Indigenous communities often hold knowledge about the local socioeconomic circumstances and traditional adaptation practices that are essential for the successful adaptation to climate change. For example, while increased rainfall contributes to soil degradation by washing out essential minerals, indigenous Bolivian farmers, having faced this issue for generations, address it by planting their crops on raised farms, which protects them from seasonal flooding. Conversely, where indigenous knowledge has been disregarded, problems have commonly arisen. In the Andes, for example, the introduction of genetically modified potatoes threatens the diversity of crops that holds a significant cultural importance for the indigenous population.

Yet, as the influential ‘State of the World’s Indigenous Peoples’ report shows, while some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have made great strides to include indigenous peoples in national climate deliberations, indigenous communities have too often been excluded from or underrepresented within efforts to translate international climate policies at a national level in many other places where governments are less open to dissent from their populations.

We believe that this exclusion and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples from national climate strategy deliberations is epistemic injustice. Someone is subject to epistemic injustice when they are being unfairly excluded, silenced or not taken seriously within a decision-making process. Living in fragile areas that are likely to be impacted the most by climatic changes, such as mountain regions, rainforests, coastal regions, and small island developing States (SIDS), many indigenous communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change. Hence, they have a special interest in implementing sustainable and responsive climate strategies that take their knowledge and interests into account. Excluding or underrepresenting indigenous communities within national climate deliberation unfairly disadvantages them in that regard.

Labeling the exclusion, silencing, and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples in these climate strategy deliberations “epistemic injustice” indicates that one of the main challenges to achieving SDG 13 (climate action) in indigenous communities, in particular, is one of representation and inclusion. How can this challenge be overcome?

First of all, it is important to recognize that many indigenous communities suffer from additional social, economic, and democratic inequalities and injustices that negatively influence their epistemic power to influence the agenda on climate change and climate adaptation. Hence, one way to enable and empower indigenous communities to be part of national climate strategy negotiations is indirectly through addressing structural and socioeconomic inequalities (SDG 10). In this way, epistemic power and socioeconomic equality are mutually reinforcing.

Second, it is important for indigenous peoples to organize in order to increase their voice. At the international level, this has been achieved through the establishment of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP), which aims “to enhance the engagement of local communities and indigenous peoples in the UNFCCC process” through the exchange of knowledge and best practices on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Indigenous communities could use this example to create similar platforms and partnerships at the national and regional levels, which, in turn, could contribute to the achievement of SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

However, many governments actively seek to suppress indigenous peoples from protesting national policies that run counter to sustainable climate action. Consider, for example, the legal actions taken against the Ardoch Alonquin First Nation of Canada protesting against uranium mining on their lands or, more recently, the arrests of Native American and Native Canadian protesters of the Keystone XL oil pipeline that will run through indigenous lands and threaten contamination of essential and culturally important sources of water, putting the health of indigenous communities at risk. The third recommendation is therefore for the international community to put pressure on governments and businesses to end exploitation and oppression of indigenous communities through the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies through the strengthening of a rule of law (SDG 16).

Most fundamentally, fourth, it is necessary to recognize the equal rights and voices of indigenous peoples as equal stakeholders in addressing climate change and to resist stereotypes of indigenous peoples and their knowledge as “primitive.” One of the greatest challenges to harness indigenous knowledge for climate action is still the perception that indigenous peoples are less knowledgeable than, say, scientific experts. More effort through the means identified above must be put into breaking this misconception to show that indigenous peoples, while some of the most vulnerable to climate change, possess valuable knowledge about sustainable and responsive climate strategies, which can and should be utilized in the development of national climate adaptation strategies.

We believe that this exclusion and underrepresentation of indigenous peoples from national climate strategy deliberations is epistemic injustice.
Excluding or underrepresenting indigenous communities within national climate deliberation unfairly disadvantages them in that regard.

Conference participants agreed on a joint vision to incentivize and redirect investment towards promoting waste prevention, recycling and other non-polluting activities and increasing the monitoring of transboundary pollution.

Officials from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Turkey, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Hungary, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Albania participated in the Ministerial Conference on ‘Innovative Solutions to Pollution in South East and Southern Europe,’ which took place from 4-5 December in Belgrade, Serbia. The Government of Serbia and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea organized the conference with support from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment).

The Joint Regional Vision on Innovative Solutions to Pollution seeks to strengthen the regional voice of the environment.

In the ‘Joint Regional Vision on Innovative Solutions to Pollution,’ environment ministers and representatives state their determination to support the development and dissemination of innovative solutions in the field of pollution prevention, monitoring and reduction and to strengthen “the regional voice of the environment” by taking specific actions. These actions include: encouraging environmental policy interventions at all levels by integrating existing policy instruments and creating new policies and tools addressing pollution and supporting inter-ministerial cooperation for improved policy coherence; fostering the development of innovative solutions addressing pollution, supporting green and environmentally sound technologies and promoting the sustainable use of natural capital, including ecosystem-based solutions to tackle pollution; promoting a circular economy by supporting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns in the region, encouraging sustainable lifestyles and making it easier to reduce the use of, reuse and recycle materials, contributing to minimized waste generation and disposal; and accelerating implementation of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) aimed at prevention, control and reduction of pollution, including through supporting the ratification processes of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

Signatories further commit to, inter alia: encouraging sustainable and innovative financing schemes and private sector-led actions towards sustainable solutions on and investments in non-polluting activities; enhancing regional cooperation in addressing transboundary pollution; encouraging establishment of and strengthening regional partnerships to promote exchange of experiences, transfer of clean technology and accessible use of best available techniques; enhancing and promoting cooperation with and among local authorities to support development of innovative strategies and plans; and strengthening engagement with the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA). Signatories request UNEP to, inter alia: support the Western Balkan countries’ capacities in implementing the SDGs; and establish a UNEP sub-regional presence for facilitating exchange of information and creation of partnerships. Government officials also recognize the need to improve availability of and access to relevant environmental data on pollution.

Conference participants discussed a report by UNEP, titled ‘The State of Pollution in the Western Balkans and Current Challenges.’ The report finds that countries in the region rank among the worst in Europe for air pollution and face serious challenges related to air and water pollution, soil contamination and unregulated waste dumping. For instance, 20-40 percent of inhabitants do not have municipal waste collection, which contributes to widespread illegal waste dumping and plastic pollution that ends up in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. The report also raises concern about the region’s energy plans, noting that all countries in the area plan to build new coal power plans. The report argues that the “economic and environmental reasoning behind this is questionable,” with solar and wind energy becoming cheaper than coal or hydropower. The report recommends that countries, inter alia: implement economic instruments, such as an excise tax on “dirty fuels” to address pollution and fund green incentives; introduce environmental objectives into energy and transport policies; and expand their networks of marine and terrestrial protected areas.

GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has expressed dissatisfaction over the state’s ranking at the fourth spot in the SDG ( Sustainable Development Goals ) Index by the Niti Ayog in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday and instructed secretaries to take the SDG index ranks of Gujarat seriously — especially the poor rank on social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health etc.

The officials also claim that the state could have performed better if the state schemes and other indicators had been included in the overall ranking. Chief secretary J N Singh also reportedly directed secretaries for regular monitoring of the goals and preparation of the district-wise goals to improve Gujarat’s SDG ranking next year.

Niti Aayog classified the states on four grades namely Achiever (100 score-1st grade), front runner(65-99 score-2nd grade), Performer (50-64 score 3rd grade) and Aspirant (0-49 score-4th grade). Though Gujarat managed to achieve 4th rank (along with other five states) in overall score due to its performance in industry, sanitation, urban management etc., its performance on the key social indicators like poverty reduction, zero hunger, health, gender ratio balancing have shown the state in very poor light as the state is clubbed with low-ranking states.

A senior officer close to the development said, “To improve the state’s ranking in the SDG index the strategy have been made to aligning/mapping of 388 state indicators identified by the State with 306 National Indicators Framework (NIF) through consultations with the line departments. Preparation of indicator-wise meta data by the state SDG cell and other agencies have been initiated. For a day-to-day monitoring, development of the state SDG dashboard will be started shortly.”

“The government has also decided to constitute district level SDG implementation committees,’’ said the official.

THE KIT

Since day one, we have been at the forefront of the MTB saddle game, supporting riders for over 20 years. While many are still onboard and riding today, they are having children of their own, which has shown us the need for quality youth components that were truly designed to fit smaller bodies. The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.

The publication is designed to help businesses integrate biodiversity into their activities by showing them where to start and how to identify existing indicators that could help measure and track their biodiversity performance.

The publication titled, ‘The Development and Use of Biodiversity Indicators in Business: an Overview,’ is aimed at businesses and practitioners already involved in the development of biodiversity indicators that are being created to provide context around the additional business applications where biodiversity indicators may be required for current or future business needs. The paper also targets businesses only starting their journey in exploring their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity.

The paper offers a logical series of steps to develop robust and reliable biodiversity indicators.

The publication notes that, while a variety of biodiversity indicators, tools, and guidance documents exist for businesses that address many specific business contexts, “what is missing is a big picture perspective and process to navigate the variety of business contexts where indicators are relevant.” To address these needs, the paper introduces an overarching process, which acknowledges the full spectrum of business applications in order to help businesses seeking to use existing indicators or embark on developing their own to measure their biodiversity performance.

The proposed process, the text explains, has many similarities with business decision-making frameworks, and offers a logical series of steps to work through in order to develop robust and reliable biodiversity indicators. The process emphasizes that indicators should always be built into larger management processes and that initial scoping phases are critical for indicator development, answering questions that clarify the business application for indicator use, such as why, what, when, for who, how often, and how detailed.

The paper also introduces a spectrum of business applications for biodiversity indicators. This spectrum outlines four prominent scopes for business applications of biodiversity indicators, which range from site- and corporate-level assessments of biodiversity performance to third-party biodiversity performance assessment.

SDG SDG SDG

Mountain bike component manufacturer SDG has a cool new upgrade kit that’s colour-coordinated and could be the perfect Christmas present for young riders.

The JR PRO KIT boxed-set comprises saddle, handlebar, grips and pedals, which are made, says SDG, to a similar standard as its main product lines.

The kit is designed for young riders on 18in- to 24in-wheeled bikes. There are four colour ways on offer: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue.

SDG

SDG Fly Jr saddle

SDG is known for its saddles, having been in the business of producing them for over 20 years. It’s taken that expertise and applied it to developing a saddle specifically for younger, smaller, lighter riders.

The Fly Jr saddle is constructed from synthetic leather with tough cordura sides for wear resistance. It’s shorter and narrower and has been ergonomically designed to fit smaller sit bones, according to SDG.

It’s also got a slight rise at the rear to help get the pelvis in a comfortable position, and to push against when powering off from a standing start. There’s also a small nose platform for climbing.

SDG Slater 90 pedals

These nylon composite pedals have a low profile design of 18mm and a 90x90mm platform for smaller feet. The pedals include six replaceable 2mm steel pins per side for grip.

A cro-mo axle with fully sealed bushing is designed to last a lot longer than many of the cheaper, plastic kids’ pedals on the market, and is also serviceable to keep it running. You’ll also be able to purchase additional parts and pins.

SDG Slater 650 handlebar

The cockpit has had some consideration put into it too. The Slater 650 handlebar is, unsurprisingly, 650mm wide and constructed from 6061 aluminium.

While the mount is 31.8mm, the bars taper to 19mm rather than the standard 22.2mm to suit smaller hands and fit the thinner Slater JR grips.

The bars are also supplied with four 15mm nylon shims, which will allow standard brakes and shifters to be mounted.

Slater Jr grips

To finish the whole set off it comes with colour-matched grips designed specifically for smaller hands. In addition to fitting on the thinner 19mm diameter handlebars, the grips also have a dual-density design that offers vibration damping and have a lock-on system.

SDG

SDG Jr PRO Kit price and availability

335,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-aquaman-a-ridiculous-glorious-mess,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Aquaman’: A Ridiculous, Glorious Mess","This fish tale may be overstuffed and undercooked, but at its best it’s wondrous and poetic like few Hollywood popcorn movies.

A couple of weeks ago, on the night of an Aquaman screening, I accidentally went to the wrong theater, and was chagrined for more reasons than one to find myself sitting through the first few minutes of Peter Jackson’s dystopian Mortal Engines (which went on to tank with both audiences and critics).

Since I had blown my chance to catch Aquaman that night, I briefly toyed with the idea of staying for Mortal Engines, but quickly decided against it. What I saw in those few minutes struck me as off-puttingly bleak, ugly and dull, like so much Hollywood spectacle these days.

So many blockbusters pour millions of dollars in immense computer-generated illusions that may be more or less persuasive, but aren’t especially worth looking at. Superhero movies are especially guilty of this. Cities are laid waste, planets are imperiled, fleets of starships clash, but not a single memorably crafted image of beauty or poetic power lingers in the imagination.

There are occasional exceptions. Black Panther’s Wakanda was a production design triumph. Doctor Strange, above all, crafted a dazzling visual vocabulary to express the magical world its characters inhabit.

What else? I recall no visual poetry in Avengers: Infinity War or Justice League. I’ve seen Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 twice each, but their brightly colored fantasies are as ephemeral as cotton candy.

So, now that I have managed to see Aquaman, there is this to say for it: Like the Star Wars prequels, like James Cameron’s Avatar, it’s a movie with tons of problems, but it also contains images that made me catch my breath — gorgeous and even numinous sights I will remember forever.

At times it feels almost like a setting for a live-action Hayao Miyazaki film, which is about the highest praise I could give for blockbuster production design.

Miyazaki has often found mythic power in human spaces, especially ancient cityscapes, flooded with water. However he would feel about this rather dim-witted film as a whole, I suspect the animation legend would appreciate the vision of Atlantis conjured by director James Wan (the Conjuring movies) and production designer Bill Brzeski, abetted by cinematographer Don Burgess (Cast Away, The Conjuring 2).

That’s not just due to the mesmerizing beauty of its translucent, jellyfish-like structures rising from the sea floor on slender stalks, with sea-creature-esque vessels soaring among them alongside actual sea creatures, but also for the haunting juxtaposition of the living bioluminescent cityscape with the shattered domes and pillars at the city’s roots: the ancient ruins of the original island city destroyed when Atlantis sank.

In the first of a pattern of striking parallels to Black Panther, Atlantis is just one of seven undersea kingdoms, each with its own vibe, all descended from the original Atlantean civilization.

What’s more, the plot turns on a struggle for the Atlantean throne between our hero and a sinister relative who wants to unite the kingdoms to wage war on the surface world for its malfeasance — in this case the despoiling of the world’s oceans rather than racial injustice, although racial themes also play a role here.

That’s because our hero, Arthur Curry, the half-Atlantean Aquaman (Jason Momoa), is disparaged by his full-blooded Atlantean half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) as a “half-breed” and “mongrel” (as well as a “bastard,” though the marital status of Arthur’s parents isn’t established).

As the first major superhero film with a virtually all-black cast, Black Panther is a landmark achievement, but racism and racial alienation are depicted in Aquaman where Black Panther only talked about them.

When Momoa was cast, I thought his Pacific Island heritage well suited to playing a man of the sea. Oddly, though, Aquaman establishes that the Atlanteans are Aryan; Arthur’s brown heritage comes not from his royal marine mother (Nicole Kidman), but from his human father, a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison, of partly Maori descent).

In another reversal of Black Panther, it’s the malevolent Orm who sits on the throne while Arthur is the outsider living in exile. Unlike Killmonger in Black Panther, moreover, Arthur wants nothing to do with Atlantis or his royal heritage (he’s got a major Aragorn complex).

Aquaman starts out unpromisingly enough. From the prologue, depicting the brief, star-crossed romance of Arthur’s parents in the wake of his mother’s attempt to flee an arranged marriage, to early action sequences involving submarines, the first act is pretty rote and surprise-free.

When Mera (Amber Heard), a red-tressed submariner from the undersea kingdom of Xebel, comes looking for Arthur, hoping he will challenge his brother for the throne and avert war with the surface world, Arthur initially wants nothing to do with it.

Things get more interesting when Arthur winds up being taken in chains, much like his mother years earlier, to Atlantis.

There’s an abrupt tonal shift as Arthur and Mera escape from Atlantis and embark on a quest for the fabled Trident of Atlan. In this Arthurian mythos, this is the equivalent of Excalibur, and would establish Aquaman not only as the rightful king of Atlantis, but as the master of the seven seas.

Here Aquaman improbably morphs into what feels more like an Indiana Jones sequel — or more precisely a Brendan Fraser Mummy movie — with the action moving from an underground desert crypt to a picturesque Sicilian coastal village. A lucidly directed and edited rooftop chase sequence pitting Mera against a tough but fragile opponent is a highlight in a film where a lot of the action is underwater.

Moving into the third act, the tone shifts again into full-on mythic mode. Aquaman faces an ordeal that goes to the heart of what heroism is as well as the nature of his claim to the throne.

In the climax, the parallels with Black Panther almost function as a rebuke to the earlier film. Black Panther was efficient and elegant where Aquaman is clunky and awkward; but by the same token Aquaman is wondrous and powerful where Black Panther is functional at best.

There are a half-dozen characters in Black Panther I care about more than I do anyone in Aquaman. But where Black Panther’s big climactic CGI battle was that film’s least interesting sequence, in Aquaman it’s a finale of preposterous grandeur, with leviathans and sea monsters that are a credit to Wan’s horror background. The final duel, too, is more satisfying on a number of levels, from what happens to why and how it happens to what happens afterward.

Like Thor in his first outing, Aquaman must prove himself worthy to wield an all-powerful weapon — but where Thor basically whiffed on what worthiness is all about, Aquaman proposes a ringing answer. There’s also moral progression from an early set piece in which, with fateful consequences, a heedless Arthur shows no mercy to an enemy (“Ask the sea for mercy,” he sneers) to the very different note of the denouement.

One thing is missing from this mythology: some representation of transcendent reality. Wonder Woman had the classical Greek gods, and Black Panther’s story started with a panther goddess and depicted mystical encounters with departed ancestors. Aquaman has a throwaway line about “the gods” making known their will through combat, but no thought went into this.

Aquaman is kind of a mess, but at its best it’s a glorious mess in a way that few popcorn movies these days are glorious. Roast it as much as you like, there is still joy to be had here.

“It started out when he was really tiny,” said St. Denis. “He loved to feed the animals. What we do at home is we have a fake tree that we put on the porch and we put carrots and everything on it and he gets to feed the animals.”

St. Denis said they then started to talk about the animals that didn’t have homes and she asked Richer if he wanted to do something for them.

“I explained it to him and he said, ‘oh yea,’” she said.

One of the things Richer loves about donating to the animal shelter is he also gets to go and check out the animals that are still there. All decked out in elf ears and Christmas themed clothes, the family and friends dropped off bags and bags of treats, food and toys for the animals.","Article contentIt all started with a little boy’s love for animals.

337,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-mary-poppins-returns,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Mary Poppins Returns’,"Like Christopher Robin, Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, and Steven Spielberg’s Hook, Mary Poppins Returns is yet another revisionist sequel about childhood whimsy lost and regained.

In the last 10 minutes or so of Mary Poppins Returns, something truly magical happens.

First, Dick Van Dyke shows up, virtually reprising his brief secondary role from Mary Poppins as the ancient bank president, except that, at 91 (at the time of the shoot; he’s now 93), he has now aged into the role — even if he’s still spryer than the doddering geezer he played in 1964. (That character died laughing in the original, so Van Dyke is playing his son here.)

Then, in the finale at the park, Angela Lansbury (also now 93) shows up to sing a song. It hardly matters that Lansbury has no prior connection to Mary Poppins. She’s an icon of the same milieu, having played a magical caretaker of children in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, another live-action/animation hybrid musical from exactly the same creative team. (Lansbury’s chief source of Disney cred comes, of course, from playing Mrs. Potts in Beauty and the Beast.)

Van Dyke dances and Lansbury sings — and somehow they’re just exactly the same, in a way that Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill weren’t and couldn’t be in the new Star Wars films.

They rise above all possible objections and criticism, and, for those brief minutes, Mary Poppins Returns feels genuinely of a piece with the original and its world. Not weak homage, like Fantasia 2000; not a pale retread, like the nouveau Beauty and the Beast; not a subversion, like Maleficent; but the Real Thing, like the underappreciated 2011 Winnie the Pooh.

So. About the two hours before that.

Here is where I must confess that, for all my affection for Van Dyke — and, of course, the legendary Julie Andrews — I have no great affection for Walt Disney’s beloved take on P.L. Travers’ magical nanny. I’m fully aware that for many readers this discredits entirely whatever thoughts I may have about Mary Poppins Returns, if not movies in general. I understand completely. Said readers are more than welcome to stop reading here and turn to some less contrarian critic.

I do recognize the tremendous talent that went into Mary Poppins. The Sherman brothers’ songs alone, arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, almost earn the film’s classic status. And I can’t complain too much about the sketchy plot and who-cares resolution, since clearly it’s beside the point.

One thing that does bug me are vestiges of themes and ideas inherited from Travers’ books that make no sense in their sanitized, Disneyfied context. I hold no brief for or against Travers’ books, which I’ve never read, but she was a complicated and unconventional woman with strong ideas about politics and social order, feminism and patriarchy, class and economics. Whatever one thinks of Travers’ ideas or how her books express them, in the movie these themes float about with no real purpose or function.

In a way, my lack of enthusiasm for Mary Poppins works in the new film’s favor. If Mary Poppins Returns, co-written and directed by Rob Marshall (Into the Woods), has a rather slapdash plot, well, so did the original.

There’s more plot here than in the original, and more conflict, with an established crisis, a villain, a menacing animated chase sequence, and a climactic action-thriller finale. Perhaps this is a concession to the expectations of a generation of children raised on tougher fare.

Yet nostalgia for the innocent spirit of the original pervades Mary Poppins Returns. Indeed, nostalgia for the original pervades virtually every aspect of the new film, from the production design of Cherry Tree Lane, where Emily Blunt’s Mary Poppins arrives to look after the next generation of Banks children, to the beat-for-beat exactness with which the sequel follows the original. It’s a meticulous exercise in re-creation, as exact as possible in almost every respect.

Young Michael and Jane are now grown-up and played by Ben Wishaw and Emily Mortimer. Michael, a sensitive artist, is a young widower with three children of his own (Pixie Davies, Nathanael Saleh and Joel Dawson). He now works as a lowly teller at the bank where his father was a partner. Jane is single and takes after their suffragette mother’s social consciousness as a labor activist.

What about Blunt? For generations of fans, of course, Andrews is the quintessential and irreplaceable Mary Poppins — but the character has been interpreted in other ways, notably in the popular stage musical. (Travers, meanwhile, hated the movie, but that’s another topic.) I saw Laura Michelle Kelly play Mary Poppins on Broadway in 2011, and I liked her slightly ambiguous, capricious, mischievous take on the character.

Blunt is a chameleonic actress, and her Mary Poppins is in the spirit of Kelly’s, which might only be another way of saying that Andrews’ absolute beatific benevolence belongs to her alone. Mary Poppins is not necessarily Julie Andrews, but Andrews being Andrews makes Mary Poppins the movie that it is, and no one else could possibly have done it.

Like this year’s Christopher Robin, Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, and the granddaddy of them all, Steven Spielberg’s Hook, Mary Poppins Returns is yet another revisionist sequel about childhood whimsy lost and regained.

Robin Williams’ lawyer in Hook had forgotten all about being Peter Pan. Likewise, Alice and Christopher Robin came to suppose that Wonderland and the Hundred-Acre Wood were just childhood imagination. Now, Jane and Michael also believe that all their adventures with Mary Poppins were just pretend, too.

Hook has been interpreted as an expression of nostalgia for the childlike wonder of Spielberg’s early work and concern about losing touch with that. Could Disney’s repeated revisiting of the same trope suggest a similar anxiety on a corporate level?

For the most part, though, the better you know Mary Poppins, the more certain you will be about what will happen next in Mary Poppins Returns.

Here’s where Mary and the kids visited Uncle Albert, so now it’s time for a visit to another relative of Mary’s (Meryl Streep), and it turns out that this one also plays with gravity. Here’s where Mary brings the kids to the bank and allows them to get into a scrape that causes their father grief, though it will all work out in the end.

Here’s where Bert and the chimney sweeps did Step in Time, so now we’ll have another big choreographed dance number with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Jack and his fellow “leeries” or lamplighters. (As this sequence approached, I thought: The sweeps went up to the rooftops, and that wouldn’t make sense for the leeries, so the obvious thing would be to go down … and, sure enough, a lamppost becomes a firehouse pole going down into the sewers, though the scene doesn’t stay there.)

This holds true until it doesn’t, and the climax is a suspense set piece corresponding to nothing in the original. At least the resolution is given narrative weight, though if you think about it it may occur to you that a) Mary Poppins sabotaged the family in order to “save” them, and b) Michael Banks is utterly incompetent to run a household or to be responsible for children.

And, if you have any affection for the denouement of the original, you may or may not be exasperated (I was) to hear a famous line that is the very soul of whimsy and playfulness suddenly given urgent dramatic meaning. Just imagine if one of the characters were a diabetic who had taken too much insulin and someone had said very seriously, “Quick! A spoonful of sugar, and hurry!” As bad as that would be, this is worse.

And yet the more nostalgic you are for Mary Poppins, it may be that the more you will enjoy this meticulous cinematic cover. The songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray) are pretty forgettable, but there are a couple you might hum a bit before returning to A Spoonful of Sugar and Let’s Go Fly a Kite.

One of the more memorable songs, Where the Lost Things Go, offers a kind of sentimental elegy for whatever is lost, including Michael’s late wife and the mother of his children.

Mary Poppins was hardly a Christian film, but at least in Feed the Birds there were saints and apostles looking down and smiling on people who showed they cared. Painting a whimsical verbal picture about a lost dish or spoon playing hide-and-seek behind the moon is one thing. That’s not a place I’d care to put my dearly departed loved ones.

Jammu and Kashmir stands at 20th spot in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index of the 29 states of India.

NITI Aayog, with the support of United Nations, has developed SDG India index, a comprehensive index to measure progress of states and union territories, through a single measurable index and the first baseline report for 2018.

The index covers 13 of the 17 UN’s sustainable development goals including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong and accountable institutions.

Four goals, including climate action and sustainable use of marine resources, were left out because of lack of data at the state level.

According to SDG report released by NITI Aayog, Jammu and Kashmir is placed at 20th spot, securing a total of 53 points. In the assigned sustainable development goals in India, J&K has not being able to bag top position in any of sustainable development goals.

The SDG includes no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economy growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequality, sustainable cities and communities, life on land and peace justice and strong institutions.

As per the SDG report, J&K is placed among performer states. States with 100 per cent score are enumerated as achievers, states with a score between 65 and 99 are front-runners, states with a score ranging between 50 and 64 are performers and states with 0-49 score are listed as aspirants.

Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key SDGs like removal of poverty and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the laggards.

A senior government official informed that the state government had in June this year ordered formation of a committee of 23 bureaucrats, including the chief secretary, and almost all administrative secretaries. They were asked to finalise the action plan for mapping of departments and schemes for each SDG target, facilitate approval of targets and indicators with timelines and resources for achieving SDGs, which would form Vision Document 2030 for the state and hold periodic review of progress on SDGs and suggest necessary corrective measures to achieve targets.

“But due to change of guard in the state’s power corridors, nothing much has been done in this regard,” he said.

According to the Index, the nation as a whole has a score of 58, showing the country has reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the sustainable development goals adopted by India and 192 other nations in 2015.

The Index tracks the progress of all the states and UTs on a set of 62 priority indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the government of India.

The index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country, its states and UTs. It is an aggregate measure which can be understood and used by everyone—policymakers, businesses, civil society and the general public. It has been designed to provide an aggregate assessment of the performance of all Indian states and UTs, and to help leaders and change makers evaluate their performance on social, economic and environmental parameters. It aims to measure India and its states’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030.","State hasn’t topped in any of 13 UN goals, achieves 53 points against national score of 58Jammu and Kashmir stands at 20th spot in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index of the 29 states of India.

The government’s premier think tank developed the country’s first SDG India Index to document the progress made by India’s states and Union Territories towards meeting SDG targets and released a baseline report for 2018.

The SDG India Index was constructed spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs (leaving out Goals 12, 13, 14 and 17). The Index tracks the progress of all the States and Union Territories (UTs) on a set of 62 Priority Indicators, measuring their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India. The SDG India Index is intended to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its States and UTs.

Each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are mapped with a set of 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. These were used as the foundation for building the SDG India Index.

A composite score was computed for each State and UT of India based on their aggregate performance across 13 of the 17 SDGs. The value of the score indicates the average performance of the State/UT towards achieving the 13 SDGs and their respective targets. The score ranges between 0 and 100.

It may be mentioned that if a State achieves a score of 100, it signifies that the State has achieved the national target set for 2030. On the other hand, if a State achieves a score of 0, it signifies that the State was the worst performer.

Target settings and its scores are Achiever (100), Front Runner (65-99), Performer (50-69) and lastly Aspirant (0-49). As per the SDG Index Score of States and UTs, Nagaland stands at a total score of 51 which fall under the ‘Performer’ category.

In the break-up of SDG India Index score by component goals, Nagaland is one of the three worst performers under Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure category with a Zero score. The other two states with zero score include Mizoram and Goa.

However, majority of the States and UTs have fallen behind on this Goal with 26 States and UTs in the ‘Aspirant’ category (with Index score less than 50).

In SDG Index Score for the Goal of Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Nagaland is also among the last three worst performers with a score of 40 with Manipur the lowest with a score of 33 and Jammu & Kashmir at 43.

Under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Good Health and Well-being, Nagaland is again has one of the lowest score (34) under the ‘Aspirant’ category.

However, under the SDG Index Score for the Goal of Peace, Justice and Strong, Nagaland is one of the ‘Front Runner’ with a score of 87. Under the Goal of Zero Hunger, Nagaland was accorded 69 points which also falls under the same category. In Goal of Clean Water and Sanitation, Nagaland stood at 58.

The SDG Index Score for the Goal of Reduced Inequalities for Nagaland stood at 80 which fall under the ‘Front Runner’ category, while Meghalaya, Mizoram and Telangana were the only three states which were deemed as ‘Achiever.’

In general, from among the states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have come out as the front runners in implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets.

Along with the three states, the UTs of Chandigarh and Puducherry were also among the front runners on the SDG India Index with a score between 65 to 99 on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 signifies that it has achieved the 2030 national targets.

SDG council was welcomed to its council chambers on Friday as North Glengarry Mayor Jamie MacDonald took his warden’s oath of office.

“Since the election there has been lots of talk at how inexperienced this council is,” said MacDonald. “We may be short of county council, but there is nearly 100 years of municipal experience on this council.”

MacDonald then joked that outgoing councillor Dennis Fife had 100 years of experience alone, but that was OK, change was good.

“Every four years, council gets to do a reset and start to plan this term of office and beyond,” he said. “We have many issues facing this term of council.”

MacDonald said he was hoping for better communication with the City of Cornwall as it was essential to the services they shared.

“Both sides need to work together,” he said. “I am confident under the leadership of Mayor (Bernadette) Clement this is achievable, stronger together.”","Article contentSDG council was welcomed to its council chambers on Friday as North Glengarry Mayor Jamie MacDonald took his warden’s oath of office.

The power-load system allows the paramedics to load the stretcher into the ambulance without using muscle power.

“Every year we recycle our ambulances,” said chief of EMS Bill Lister. “They last about five years and on this cycle we have two upgrades. The first one is the power-load system.”

The city has introduced blue flashing lights on ambulances, making them easier to see; and, a Stryker Power-Load System that will aide paramedics in loading patients into the ambulances.

The city announced on Friday it had brought in a couple of safety features that will make things easier, not only for our paramedics, but for drivers who encounter an ambulance on its way to helping residents.

“It’s a neat safety feature for them because it will reduce the loads on their bodies.”

Lister said the lifts act as a forklift in the back of the truck. Paramedics just bring the stretcher to the back of the truck and the forklift system lifts it into the back of the ambulance.

“The paramedic doesn’t have to worry about the lift part,” he said. “They can concentrate more on the patient. It’s a safety system.”

The system has the capacity of lifting a patient and all the emergency equipment up to 700 pounds. Each system costs approximately $27,000 and all 14 ambulances in the city’s fleet should be equipped with them within the next four years.

“There is about 50 pounds of equipment (taken on each stretcher every call) and a patient, about 190 pounds average, plus the stretcher which is about 100 pounds, that is what they used to lift before we got this mechanism,” said Lister. “About 15 years ago, we got these yellow stretchers which are battery powered lift stretchers and now we have the second component which is the power-load.”

The other change in ambulances is the addition of blue flashing lights.

“The change in the Highway Traffic Act allows us to change the lighting pattern on the trucks,” said Lister. “This is a safety feature for two reasons. One it alerts the drivers better to yield to the ambulance and the second it is seen from a greater distance.”

Lister said the decision to add the blue lights was a culmination of a number of studies, which proved blue lights worked best in fog and rain and other weather conditions.

“They realized that white and red was good, but it’s better with a blue light in there,” he said. “We will be rolling these across as we replace the ambulances.”

These two new ambulances, and every ambulance to be purchased going forward will have a new Stryker Power-Load System and new blue emergency lighting systems on the front and back.

The new power lift system lifts the ambulance stretcher and the patient into the ambulance and locks it in place without effort from the paramedics.

“This is a new safety system for paramedics and patients,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall and SDG Paramedics. “Until now, the paramedics had to lift all of the weight.”

Lister explained that the stretcher weighs 100 pounds, and that their average patient weighs 190 pounds, but that the new power-load system can lift up to 700 pounds.

The new power-load system will reduce the annual lifting load of paramedics by over 10 million pounds a year.

The new lighting system on the ambulances replaces the traditional red-white emergency lights on the front and back of the vehicle with a red-blue combo.

“Many studies have shown that the blue lights are more noticeable and effective in difficult weather situations like fog, rain and snow,” said Lister.

The Stryker Power-Load System costs $27,000 each and the new emergency lighting system will cost $600 each. Right now, only the two newest ambulances are equipped with these systems. Cornwall and SDG Paramedics replace an ambulance every 54 months and their goal is to have their entire fleet of 14 ambulances equipped with these systems within four years.","CORNWALL, Ontario – The Cornwall and SDG Paramedics Service unveiled two new ambulances on Friday, Dec. 14, 2018 that come with two new features that promise to increase the safety of paramedics and patients.
