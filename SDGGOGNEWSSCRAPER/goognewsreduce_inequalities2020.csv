The group of experts warn that sugary alcoholic drinks are contributing to obesity, type 2 diabetes, various cancers, liver damage and tooth decay as consumers are unknowingly drinking large amounts of sugar and calories. Action on Sugar is now urging the government to prove it really is committed to prevention and reducing inequalities, by stepping in and taking control of not only the food and drink industries, but also the alcohol industry.

Key Findings

Action on Sugar surveyed a total of 202[3] ‘ready to drink’ alcoholic beverages sold in-store and online. Out of the 154 products collected in-store, nutrition information on pack was shockingly low making it difficult for consumers to know exactly what they are drinking:

Only 63 products (41%) in-store had some form of nutrition information on pack

Only 14 products (9%) had ‘sugar’ information on pack

Due to the lack of information provided on pack (in-store), Action on Sugar commissioned independent laboratory analysis of 21 products (in addition to the information available on pack and on drink manufacturer’s websites), which has exposed for the first time the alarming and unnecessary variation of sugar and calories to the public.[4]

Traditional premixed cocktails

Many drinks in this category were exceedingly high in sugar. Notwithstanding its larger pack size (500ml), TGI Friday’s Passion Fruit Martini has over 12 teaspoons of sugar (49.1g) – the same as drinking nearly two cans of Red Bull![5]

Fruit Based/'Soft' Mixed Drink

The worst offender in this category was WKD Blue. If you were to drink a large 700ml bottle it would provide a staggering 59g sugar – the same as eating over 4 iced doughnuts in one sitting![6]

Yet again the sugar content in similar drinks varies considerably – proving reformulation can be achieved. For example, a 250ml can of Breezer Lemon and Elderflower Flavoured Alcoholic Drink has over five teaspoons of sugar (20.8g), compared to Balans Lime Aqua Spritz at 0.5g sugar per 250ml can.

Spirit/liqueur and Mixer (excluding gin)

The worst offenders in this category have in excess of 30g sugar (8 teaspoons) in a serving – more sugar than nine custard cream biscuits![7]

Interestingly Jack Daniel’s Whiskey and Cola has a larger sized can (i.e. 330ml) than Malibu Cola (250ml), yet is still lower in sugar, due to the higher sugar content of sweetened liqueurs.

The findings also clearly demonstrate that lower sugar products can be produced easily. For example, Asda Vodka, Lime & Lemonade has 12g sugar (3tsp) in a 250ml can, whilst Classic Combinations Vodka Lime and Lemonade has over a teaspoon of sugar extra at 16.2g sugar per 250ml can.

Gin & Mixers

The sweetest gin and mixer was Classic Combinations Pink Gin and Tonic, containing a 27g of sugar in a 250ml can – the same sugar content as Coke[8]. This is followed by Classic Combinations Rhubarb Gin and Ginger Ale with over five teaspoons of sugar (20.8g) in a 250ml can.

In comparison, Tanqueray Sevilla Gin and Tonic has a third less sugar at 18g, proving once again that it is possible to make this type of drink with much less sugar. A gin and tonic with diet/light/or low sugar mixers were all 0g sugar per serve, except for Sipsmith London Dry Gin and Light Tonic (3.3g sugar per serve).

Registered Nutritionist, Holly Gabriel at Action on Sugar, says: “This is the first time a survey of this kind has been conducted and the results highlight an immediate need for alcoholic drinks to be included in vital public health policies.

“Customers should be able to purchase better options and reformulating these drinks with less sugar, calories and alcohol is one way to achieve this. Our survey clearly shows that similar drinks can be made with less sugar and calories, yet drink manufacturers are failing to take the appropriate action. Urgent attention is required from the government to ensure that gaps in the law do not contribute to the rise in obesity and related health conditions, as well as alcohol harm.”

Katharine Jenner, Campaign Director at Action on Sugar, based at Queen Mary University of London, says: “‘Gin in a tin’ has become a cultural phenomenon with these types of drinks often consumed ‘on the go’ and without a moment’s consideration to how much sugar and alcohol goes into making them. Even if you did want to know, you can’t make a healthy choice as only one in ten of the products surveyed had enough information available. If consumers knew how much sugar was really in these drinks, would they still happily choose to drink their way to tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes?”

Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Queen Mary University of London and Chairman of Action on Sugar, explains: “Sugary alcoholic drinks are a double burden on our health: alcohol causes serious harm, and sugar in these drinks carries the same health risks as sugar in any other food or drink, which costs the NHS billions and shortens lives.

“It is a national scandal that because these drinks contain alcohol, they are not subject to the sugar tax or any form of coherent nutrition labelling. The new government needs to act now by taking control of the alcohol industry and stop them from exploiting vunerable young adults.”

A council wrongly reduced a disabled man’s personal budget by arbitrarily capping respite payments at the equivalent cost of residential care, despite this being an unsuitable way of meeting his needs, the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has found.

As a result, his parents had to top up payments for carers so that the respite could be provided in the family home, after the man had gone 16 months without respite altogether because of a failure to agree the amount between Sefton council and the family. This prevented his parents having a break at a time when his father had health problems of his own.

The man, known as Mr Y, who has a severe learning disability and autistic spectrum disorder and lives with his parents, Mr and Mrs X, had been receiving council-commissioned 2-1 care, five days a week, at a day service run by a nearby council for over 20 years. He also had a direct payment for three hours’ care a week and four weeks’ respite a year, provided at home by carers from the day service.

In May 2016, the council began a reassessment of his needs, which was not finalised until July 2017 because, the council said, it was pursuing continuing healthcare funding for Mr X.

The assessor recorded that Mr Y spent a great deal of his week in the community and that incidents involving challenging behaviour had “greatly reduced over the years”, recommending he continue to attend the day centre five days a week but his support decrease from 2-1 to 1-1. The assessor also said that he should continue to receive four weeks’ respite a year, but that this would cost £500 a week, equivalent to the cost of a week’s placement in a care home. This was despite Mr and Mrs X wanting to continue with respite within the family home funded by direct payments.

‘Intimidating’ meeting with council

Mr and Mrs X were invited to a “formal meeting” with the council in March 2017 to discuss the assessment but weren’t given a copy of it beforehand.

Mrs X said she expected to meet with the reviewing officer but was instead met with seven council officers, which she found intimidating. During the meeting, council officers queried why Mr Y needed two carers when outside of his home.

The council agreed to halt the meeting so Mr and Mrs X could consider the assessment. The next day Mrs X contacted the council and said she believed the current care package met Mr Y’s needs and shouldn’t be changed while also complaining she hadn’t been given a copy of the assessment prior to the meeting.

Mr Y’s assessment was completed in July 2017 and a copy was sent to Mr and Mrs X, who disagreed with the outcome. In October, Mr Y’s case was transferred to a different team and a new social worker was allocated.

No direct payments were received for Mr Y’s respite care in 2017, which the newly allocated social worker later recorded was because of the lack of conclusion over how much funding he should receive.

In an assessment in April 2018, the social worker recorded Mrs X’s “frustration that there is an outstanding issue relating to [Mr Y’s] respite which has prevented them from having an extended break from their caring role last year”. The assessment also recorded that Mr Y’s needs had not changed, apart from in respect of accessing the community, for which the assessor said that his needs had reduced but that he still needed two carers.

Residential care ‘not suitable’

The council’s legal team then advised the social worker that Mr Y receive funding for respite in line with the equivalent cost for residential care despite a care home not being a suitable way to meet his needs. The social worker recommended in the April 2018 assessment he continue to receive four weeks’ respite a year at home through a direct payment. A further assessment in June 2018 recorded that his needs had not changed from the April assessment.

Mrs X submitted a formal complaint to the council in June 2018 saying she received no respite at all during 2017 and had received no payments for respite in 2018. She submitted a further complaint in July 2018 in response to the decision to pay Mr Y’s respite care budget at a residential respite rate that Mrs X said wasn’t enough to provide respite care in the home.

On 11 August, two weeks before a planned holiday, Mrs X contacted the council and said she hadn’t yet received direct payment to fund respite.

The council advised her to contact a residential home. Mrs X told the council Mr Y wouldn’t cope in a residential setting and reminded them he had 1-1 care at home and 2-1 in the community. She said the council told her Mr Y would receive care from one carer in a residential placement who would also be caring for others, which she said would not meet Mr Y’s assessed needs.

When Mrs X received the respite money it was less than had previously been paid, equivalent to the cost of a residential respite stay at £570 per week.

Forced to top up carers’ wages

The regular carers agreed to provide respite for Mr Y in the home at a reduced rate (£4.41 per hour) because Mrs X’s holiday was imminent, so Mrs X offered to top up the carers’ wages.

At a further meeting in December 2018, the social worker and her manager reiterated that the council would only pay for respite at the residential care rate, and the authority subsequently offered Mrs X two weeks’ respite at this rate by way of apology for the failure to provide it in 2017-18.

After Mrs X’s complaint was referred to the ombudsman, the council told the watchdog that the social worker had concluded that Mr Y’s needs could be met in a residential setting, but that the respite payment was provided as a direct payment in line with the family’s preferences.

It added: “The most cost-effective way to meet [Mr Y’s] needs was via a residential respite placement. As such, if the family chose another method to meet his needs, the council would only pay for a service up to the same value as the most cost-effective option”.

Failings

However, among a number of identified failings, the ombudsman found that all evidence showed residential care to be unsuitable for Mr Y, and it was unclear how the council concluded that it was.

Despite the April 2018 assessment concluding residential respite was unsuitable and the June 2018 assessment recommending he receive respite at home, the council reduced his respite payment, wrongly setting an arbitrary upper limit, the ombudsman found.

“In setting the amount of a direct payment…the council must ensure it is enough to buy services which will meet the person’s eligible needs,” the report said. “In Mr Y’s case, it failed to do so.”.

The watchdog cited the statutory guidance under the Care Act, which states that, though councils may take financial considerations into account in how they meet need (though not whether they should be), they should not set arbitrary limits on how much they will pay to meet a need as this “would not deliver an approach that is person-centred or compatible with public law principles”.

The ombudsman also criticised the April 2018 assessment for finding that Mr Y’s needs to access the community had reduced despite concluding that his need for 2:1 care in the community was unchanged.

‘Confusion and delay’

He also found evidence of “confusion and delay”, saying the pursuit of CHC funding should not have delayed the completion of the reassessment started in May 2016 and ending in July 2017.

While the watchdog found that the impact of the council’s failings on Mr Y were not significant, as his parents had continued to ensure his needs were met, he found Mr and Mrs X had suffered an injustice by missing out on sixteen months of respite care and being forced to contribute to carers’ wages.

The ombudsman also found that the council’s offer of two weeks’ respite at the residential rate in acknowledgement of its failure to provide respite in 2017-18 was insufficient because Mr and Mrs X missed out on a service which would have provided relief from their caring role.

This was particularly important because Mr X was experiencing his own health problems, the ombudsman added.

The ombudsman also said it was “poor practice” for the council, in March 2017, to invite Mr and Mrs X to a meeting about the reassessment without providing them with a copy of it in advance and informing them of the formal nature of the meeting.

In response to the findings of the ombudsman, a spokesperson for Sefton said: “Since 2018 Sefton Council has worked with the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) to roll out a programme of mandatory training and development for adult social care practitioners which covers the recommendations outlined in the report.

“We do not set an arbitrary limit to care provision and will always apply the Care Act principles.

“The council cannot comment on any individual cases, however we will continue to work with the ombudsman to address the recommendations outlined.”","This was despite Mr and Mrs X wanting to continue with respite within the family home funded by direct payments.
Mr Y’s assessment was completed in July 2017 and a copy was sent to Mr and Mrs X, who disagreed with the outcome.
In October, Mr Y’s case was transferred to a different team and a new social worker was allocated.
It added: “The most cost-effective way to meet [Mr Y’s] needs was via a residential respite placement.
This was particularly important because Mr X was experiencing his own health problems, the ombudsman added."

According to a new survey from Action on Sugar, popular ‘ready to drink’ pre-mixed spirits and cocktails sold in supermarkets are high in ‘hidden’ sugar and calories.

According to a new product survey by Action on Sugar at Queen Mary University of London, popular ‘ready to drink’ pre-mixed spirits sold in major UK retailers are unnecessarily high in hidden sugar and calories (based on the measurements that alcohol contains seven calories per gram and sugar contains four calories per gram).

Now, Action For Sugar is calling for retailers to reformulate these drinks immediately to the agreed criterion set by the government in the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) or pay the fine.

“This is the first time a survey of this kind has been conducted and the results highlight an immediate need for alcoholic drinks to be included in vital public health policies,” said Holly Gabriel, Registered Nutritionist, Action on Sugar. “Customers should be able to purchase better options and reformulating these drinks with less sugar, calories and alcohol is one way to achieve this.

“Our survey clearly shows that similar drinks can be made with less sugar and calories, yet drink manufacturers are failing to take the appropriate action.

It is urging the government to prove it really is committed to prevention and reducing inequalities, by stepping in and taking control of not only the food and drink industries, but also the alcohol industry.

The survey incorporated a total of 202 ‘ready to drink’ alcoholic beverages sold in-store and online.

3,https://thewire.in/women/women-informal-workers-lockdown,"Mon, 25 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Wire,"Increased Care Work, Reduced Wages: Informal Women Workers Are Barely Getting By","In India, women are inevitably involved in some kind of productive or reproductive work but much of their work is invisible and they are largely employed in low skilled, low paid informal sectors with little or no social security.

Furthermore, women working in the informal sector face different structural constraints and women in poorer households are more likely to work in the informal sector and are often found in the more vulnerable categories of work, for instance as domestic workers or self-employed home-based workers.

According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2017-18, approximately 88% of total women’s employment is informal in India and 73% of employed women earn their livelihood working in the informal sector in Delhi.

In Delhi, one-third of the total women informal workers were employed in two occupations – domestic work and home-based work – and a few (less than 2%) were street vendors in 2017-18. In other informal sectors, like construction and waste picking activities, men appear to be key players while women usually comprise of the supporting workforce.

With a huge informal workforce and persistent gender-based occupation segregation, it goes without saying that the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying pre-existing inequalities, exposing vulnerabilities across every sphere, from health to the economy, security to social protection and women continue to bear the maximum brunt simply by virtue of their sex.

Against this backdrop, the Institute of Social Studies Trust attempted to capture the immediate impact of the COVID-19-induced lockdown on women informal workers by conducting five micro-studies, each focusing on workers living in Delhi and working in one of five informal sectors: domestic work, street vending, waste picking, home-based work and construction work.

The data for the study was collected through a telephonic quantitative survey and in-depth telephonic qualitative interviews during the second phase of lockdown (April 15-May 3, 2020).

Respondents for the survey belonged to the age group between 20 and 60 years. The average age of the women respondents was 38 and, on average, there were six members in each household. Of the total women respondents, 82% were married with the exception of eight who were divorced or separated and 19 who were widows.

The survey results indicated that the gendered impact of COVID-19 is profound and women are impacted differently because of their prime responsibility as caregivers and owing to the lockdown, their unpaid care work had increased manifold. Of the respondents, 66% indicated an increase in unpaid work at home and 36% reported an increased burden of child and elderly care work during this period.

A significant proportion of women respondents also highlighted the additional burden of arranging for food due to the stringent implementation of the lockdown and the increased instances of police harassment of men. The COVID-19 pandemic has once again underscored the gross imbalances in the gender distribution of unpaid care work and more than half of the women respondents indicated that the unequal division of the domestic responsibilities was prevalent and stated that no one helped them with household chores.

The survey results pointed to the major impact of the lockdown on the earnings of these workers and around 83% of women workers covered in the study were facing a severe income drop.

Construction workers were the worst hit as all of them reported a loss of paid work while 97% of the street vendors said that they had access to no source of income during the lockdown period. Further, only 6% of the construction workers received the relief amount from the Delhi Building & Other Construction Workers Board (DBOCW) and no special benefits have been announced by the Delhi welfare board – especially for the women construction workers. Of the women street vendors, 54% had taken emergency loans from local moneylenders at very high-interest rates to eke out a living and among them, 37% are finding it difficult to repay the loans.

Similarly, 91% of home-based workers and 86% of waste pickers said that the lockdown had lead to a major impact on their earnings. Women home-based workers stated that owing to the closure of factories and disruption of supply chain, payments were being withheld by employers and their income had dropped significantly.

Most of the waste pickers reported that they were facing difficulties not only in collecting waste owing to restrictions on movement but also while segregating and selling the same as all shops were closed. They are also forced to sell the waste at significantly reduced prices as only a few dealers were working.

The impact of the pandemic induced lockdown on domestic workers’ income or wages appeared less as most respondents reported that their employers had paid them salaries for March. However, they anticipated a cut in salaries for the month of April and May if the lockdown continued. Of the respondents, 68% stated that the inability to go out and police patrolling was the main reason why they weren’t able to go to work, while a significant proportion of women also reported fear of contracting the disease.

In terms of accessing essential food items, when India is already suffering from a “level of hunger that is serious” the recent International Labour Organisation report indicated that as a result of COVID-19, an estimated 400 million informal sector workers were at risk of abject poverty in India.

The survey results also indicated that food shortages seem to affect 60% of the women respondents and construction workers and waste pickers suffered the most. Out of the total respondents, almost half of them were dependent on Public Distribution System (PDS) for the availability of food and 31% received cooked food by the government at camps or night shelters in Delhi. But, in accessing these, they needed to stand in long queues for several hours daily where social distancing was difficult to maintain and often, they had to return empty-handed after food supplies would run out.

Sixty-nine percent of women attributed the increase in prices as the primary hurdle in accessing most of the essential items and 71% of respondents stated that they were spending money out of their personal or household savings to manage the daily expenses in the absence of income. When women informal workers were already struggling in their day to day life, they are more concerned about the continued loss of paid work and payment of house rent when the lockdown will be lifted.

All of the above findings indicate that under the current uncertain and unprecedented situation, at least some sort of minimum employment guarantee schemes from the government is likely to help informal workers and function as a stopgap solution in case of no work. There is no doubt that with a reservation for women in these schemes, a considerable percentage of women informal workers will be benefitted.

Similarly, universalising the PDS with a higher quantity of food grain allotment for at least the next few months with more publicity is definitely a worth try. Moreover, in places where PDS outlets are far away, arrangements for some other local distribution outlets along with ease of e-coupon system will not only reduce exclusion errors but also ensure that every person who is food insecure can access the same.

Credit: MCRI

Vaccination against rotavirus has led to a significant decrease in hospitalisations and deaths of children due to severe diarrhoea in the Western Pacific region, a new study has found.

The research, led by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) and published in BMC Infectious Diseases, showed the substantial impact of the rotavirus vaccine on inpatient and outpatient hospital attendances and child deaths in the Pacific Island country of Kiribati, despite high rates of malnutrition.

MCRI Professor Fiona Russell said the study looked at the impact of rotavirus vaccination on young children two years after its roll-out in Kiribati in 2015. The study provided convincing evidence for ongoing vaccination in Kiribati and other low-middle income countries with poor sanitation and inadequate cold storage chains, she said.

""Kiribati has one of the highest child death and malnutrition rates in the Pacific, which is due to the substantial challenges with the provision of safe drinking water and effective sanitation,"" she said.

""Kiribati introduced rotavirus vaccination following a series of confirmed rotavirus diarrhoea outbreaks, with up to 70 per cent of cases affecting children under five.""

Kiribati is the first country to document the effects of rotavirus vaccination in the Western Pacific region.

The study found acute gastroenteritis inpatient admissions decreased by 37 per cent and outpatient presentations by 44 per cent in children aged under five years. Inpatient severe acute malnutrition admissions also decreased by 24 per cent.

Importantly, the study also reported a 44 per cent and 64 per cent decline in acute gastroenteritis contributing to all under-five admissions and deaths, respectively.

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in children worldwide and kills about 215,000 children each year.

Almost all unvaccinated children will have experienced one or more rotavirus diarrheal episodes, regardless of their living conditions, by the age of five.

Professor Russell said the research would provide evidence for other policy makers in the Asia-Pacific region to consider introducing the vaccine.

""Very few countries in the Asia- Pacific have a rotavirus vaccine in their national immunisation programs, despite good data showing the vaccine's benefits,"" she said.

With Covid-19 cases falling and hospitals treating fewer critically ill patients, one could think the worst is behind the NHS.

But living alongside Covid-19 for the foreseeable future will mean stark choices. Even if a second wave is prevented, resuming routine hospital, primary care and dental services with such an infectious virus still circulating is going to be all but impossible without a vaccine.

A major problem will be the challenges of infection control: swabbing, testing and isolating patients before surgery, creating time for changing PPE between patients, allowing additional time between operations or treatments to deep clean or allow air changes in operating theatres or dentists’ consultation rooms.

Even if a more rapid test can be developed, the impact on a system used to running with very little spare capacity will be formidable. Even before the crisis, the number of acute and intensive care beds per 1,000 population was lower than most OECD countries. There are also challenges of supplying and distributing PPE to the frontline.

The NHS has large numbers of older hospital buildings, with shared accommodation and narrow corridors. Many hospitals and GP surgeries do not have waiting areas that allow for social distancing, and A&E departments before the pandemic were significantly overcrowded. Even if these difficulties can be overcome, the NHS will need to make sure it has enough beds and ventilators for a possible second wave.

The staffing problems will be profound. Workers in high-risk categories may need to be removed from frontline duties, worsening longstanding staffing shortages. Staff who remain will have to make big changes to their day-to-day work, changing daily practices like ward rounds and creating time for testing and PPE.

The combined effect: a reduction in the NHS’s ability to provide care. Waiting lists will lengthen, non-urgent procedures will be deprioritised, and patients will find it harder to get routine appointments. The big question facing politicians is how far the public will be prepared to accept such limitations on an NHS they have already sacrificed so much to protect.

Nigel Edwards is the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust

Sara Gorton: NHS and care staff deserve a substantial pay rise

While the immediate priority is still ensuring guaranteed supplies of PPE, regular testing of all NHS and social care staff and proper risk assessments for all vulnerable ​workers, ministers must guarantee that NHS staff can depend on a ​substantial wage rise. Any talk of a return to pay austerity ​would cause​ widespread horror.

All NHS staff – regardless of job, NHS employer or private contractor – need secure employment and decent pay. The good practices and collective agreements established in the NHS must apply elsewhere. The unfair two-tier pay system with its inferior rates and zero hours can’t continue.

Quick-fix Covid-19 payments by contractors cannot right the wrongs of removing staff from the safety of direct NHS employment. Where wages are cut for those off sick or isolating, staff may avoid testing and mask symptoms – increasing the risks.

The shameful low status and job insecurity for most care employees must prompt a proper rethink about how the sector is organised. Care workers deserve a decent, lasting, pay rise too.

There needs to be more home working. ​It could be safe and viable for many jobs, not just in commissioning, project management and administration. Some thought – and better IT – now could help to prevent any second-wave disruption.

There must be improvements in staffing levels too. Pre-pandemic numbers simply weren’t safe. Record vacancies meant stress, high turnover and burnout. And immigration changes will soon prevent the NHS and care sector from filling gaps with international recruits.

There must be no hasty dismissal of the 40,000 experienced staff who have returned from retirement. They could support a rest and recuperate programme for worn-out health workers and ensure safe staffing levels.

Combating coronavirus has come at a price. But allowing economic pressures to stifle proper future funding will cause further harm.

David Oliver: Support and empower health workers, and we’ll deliver

The pandemic has highlighted the innate strength of frontline NHS staff around the country. Acute hospital teams of clinicians, operational managers and support staff reorganised their patient triage streams, ward bases, rotas and redeployment.

They doubled and tripled intensive care unit capacity and managed to avoid using Nightingale hospitals, or be overwhelmed like some other countries. They worked closely with community partners to ensure medically stable patients left sooner. They started innovative models for post-intensive care unit (ICU) rehab, virtual wards or hospital at home.

Primary care has used more remote consulting and introduced “hot hubs” for suspected Covid-19 patients. We should retain the best of the innovations for those patients it doesn’t disadvantage.

If you support and empower and liberate local NHS and care staff, we will deliver. We are more than capable of agility and purpose. What’s needed is less managerialism and central control-freakery from central government agencies.

The number of deaths in care homes has shown the need for far more joined-up work with social care as an equal partner and not an afterthought. The prime minister’s pledge to find a lasting cross-party solution to social care must be honoured. It should end divisions between needs-based and eligibility-based means tested services, while supporting providers through higher local authority maximum fees.

Care homes need adequate PPE, testing and full access to enhanced healthcare support from local community and primary health services for residents whose health needs are often complex, acute or palliative and to ensure equity of access to acute hospital when it really is required.

“Protect the NHS” was understandably focused on protecting scarce acute hospital and ICU beds. But for any second wave, health and social care need to work more closely together in planning, infection control policies and healthcare for care home residents.

Rehana Azam: Failure to protect BAME staff is institutional racism

The GMB represents many of the thousands of ancillary staff from hospital porters and cleaners to ambulance workers and admin staff without whom our hospitals couldn’t function.

NHS employers were too late to undertake individual risk assessments to minimise these frontline workers’ exposure to the coronavirus. When risk assessments did happen, they were focused on staff with long-term health conditions and concerns over the lack of PPE and social distancing challenges.

Now we know that if you are from a Black, Asian, and minority ethnic background, you are more likely to be killed by coronavirus. Yet the experiences of NHS BAME staff at work weren’t fully taken into consideration.

It’s partly a question of deprivation. BAME people are more likely to have poor housing, lower incomes, higher risk jobs and greater risk of underlying health conditions. Last week’s official figures showed that those living in the most deprived areas are twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than those in the wealthiest areas.

Historic structural racism also plays a role, according to a draft of a report by Public Health England. It says this could make people from BAME groups less likely to ask for care, or to insist on having PPE.

The government’s failure to put in place additional protection for BAME frontline workers will have cost lives. It is no less than institutional racism.

What has to change in the NHS? Health risk assessments for BAME workers should be forensic and backed by law and there needs to be more work on tackling structural racism within the health service, including greater diversity in leadership roles. As one of the most senior BAME trade unionists in the country, I understand the importance of having more BAME people in senior management roles.

Testing and PPE still isn’t being provided consistently for all staff and we need rock-solid guarantees of full pay during Covid-19-related sickness absence – for every NHS worker.

When the last roll calls of the dead are read out and we see all of the faces that represent the underinvestment, the undervaluing, the stark inequalities heaped upon the shoulders of the NHS, then know this. We will not look away.

Sam Allen: Mental health services will face a triple whammy

The psychological fallout of Covid-19 will be profound for many people. Mental health in the UK worsened substantially in the first two months of lockdown. And NHS mental health services will potentially be faced with a triple whammy. Existing patients whose mental health needs have been exacerbated by the circumstances surrounding Covid-19, people who have developed mental health problems during this time, and traumatised health and care staff.

So, are we ready with the mental health support that will be needed?

It will be tough. People will need support, encouragement and empathy, particularly health and care staff who may feel they have simply been doing their job. The clap for carers has been a wonderful weekly moment of shared gratitude. But our NHS and care staff are not heroes. They are human. Some will be understandably traumatised by their experiences.

We are already seeing referrals to specialist mental health services increase after a temporary dip in recent weeks. But we also need to prepare for the mental health needs of people whose psychological trauma may not become apparent for many months.

We need to make sure the needs of those with severe, enduring mental illness are not overlooked. This is about timely and early intervention, prevention and ensuring services are accessible. A huge amount of planning is already happening.

Health and care transformation is so much more than strategy, taskforces or policy announcements. It’s about working with people and communities, harnessing their energy, creativity and expertise to transform services.","They could support a rest and recuperate programme for worn-out health workers and ensure safe staffing levels.

Anne Longfield said the reduced access to education in England was a ""very dangerous place to be"" (PA)

The children’s commissioner for England has accused the government of putting the right to education at risk amid the ongoing row over school reopenings.

Anne Longfield warned reduced access to education was becoming “the default” in some schools as many struggle to expand teaching due to coronavirus restrictions.

Speaking to the Observer, she said: “It has taken 200 years of campaigning to get children out of the workplace and into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all children.”

“We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start to go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be.

“We heard from the prime minister back in April that education was one of the top three priorities for easing lockdown, but it seems to have been given up on quite easily.”

Ms Longfield also urged the Government to intervene further, adding: “It might be the whole of the next school year where kids aren’t going to be able to come into the classroom in normal numbers.

“Maybe we need to look at enhancing the classroom space, getting more teachers, or more people in to teach.”

“You have to come up with the level of intervention, such as the Nightingale hospitals, such as the job retention schemes, which were amazing in their own right. There’s no reason why we can’t do that for children.”

It comes after education secretary Gavin Williamson was forced on Tuesday to confirm plans to bring all primary school children back to school for a month before the summer had been scrapped.

Instead, schools would welcome more year groups only if they had the capacity, but Boris Johnson later insisted he “fully intends” to have all children back at school by September.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of trying to “blame others” over his failure to build a consensus on reopening classrooms after revealing his offer to help had been rejected.

Meanwhile, chair of the education select committee and Tory MP Robert Halfon wrote to Mr Johnson this week urging him to introduce a “catch-up premium” and a summer tutoring programme, for every pupil receiving free school meals.

He warned the “life chances of thousands of children” were at risk if such plans, which could cost £560million per subject, didn’t go ahead.

‘FINANCIAL HARDSHIP’

Elsewhere, shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has called on the Government to extend free school meals in England over the summer to ensure a “holiday without hunger”.

Nearly 1.3 million children are eligible for the scheme, which has been replaced by a voucher system while schools have been closed.

The support usually ends over the summer holidays, but Labour is now calling for it to be extended to support families struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Ms Long-Bailey said: “Covid-19 has plunged many families into financial hardship, and this is likely to get worse over summer.

“Parents should not be forced to decide whether to feed themselves or their children over the upcoming summer holidays, when the government could easily continue providing free school meals.

The former Labour leadership candidate continued: “We know that the time spent away from school will have widened inequalities between children further and disadvantaged children need more support than ever during this pandemic.

“The Government has repeatedly said it will do ‘whatever it takes’ to help our economy through this crisis, the same should apply to children who are at risk of going hungry for six weeks this summer.”

Such a policy has already been implemented in Wales, with the devolved government providing each eligible child with the equivalent of £19.50 a week in food vouchers.","Reduced schooling a ‘dangerous’ threat to pupils' right to education, children’s commissioner warnsAnne Longfield said the reduced access to education in England was a ""very dangerous place to be"" (PA)The children’s commissioner for England has accused the government of putting the right to education at risk amid the ongoing row over school reopenings.

Other positive impacts of the policy include increased levels of volunteering, communities coming together to protect those who are more vulnerable, and a reduction in vehicle traffic leading to reduced pollution and improved air quality.

However, the report A Health Impact Assessment of the ‘Staying at Home and Social Distancing Policy’ in Wales in response to the COVID-19 pandemic also highlights significant negative impacts for individuals and communities.

For example, the economic downturn has reduced income and increased unemployment, with low income households being most affected. This is despite national support measures such as furloughing of employees.

Although the situation is still evolving, the report finds that the ‘Staying at Home’ policy has affected virtually all aspects of life in Wales.

Dr Sumina Azam, Consultant in Public Health, Policy and International Health, WHO Collaborating Centre on Investment for Health and Wellbeing, Public Health Wales, said:

“This report brings together evidence from a range of sources and highlights how the measures to protect us from coronavirus are having impacts across the whole of society. For example, the loss of social contact as a result of lockdown has led to more people feeling isolated. We know that there have been other negative effects on mental well-being, with those most at risk including healthcare workers, women, people on low incomes, those with existing mental health conditions, and older people.

“Some of the impacts could last for the long term and also increase health inequalities. The report helps to identify where we need to act to prevent such unintended consequences.”

Liz Green, Programme Director for Health Impact Assessment at Public Health Wales said:“Predicting health outcomes is complex and difficult, even more so in the context of ongoing restrictions and a rapidly changing situation. Nevertheless, this Health Impact Assessment provides plenty to think about, including helping to inform decisions and ensuring that the least harms and most benefits to health occur as restrictions are eased or in the event that lockdown needs to be re-introduced.”

Other key impacts highlighted by the report include:

The impact on children and young people who have had their education interrupted, have lost their routines and structures and missed being with their friends, with long term consequences for their educational attainment and life chances.

Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups have been identified as having worse health outcomes as a result of contracting coronavirus, and may also have experienced an increase in hate crimes.

The rapid increase in digital technology use has helped people stay connected, continue to work, and access education and key services such as health and social care. However, it has also led to some older people, those from disadvantaged backgrounds and people living in rural areas of Wales being excluded.

A reduction in the use of public transport, which could have a long-term impact when the restrictions are lifted.

Women and children are more likely to have experienced violence and domestic abuse in the home.

In the longer term, the report identified opportunities to promote environmental sustainability, wellbeing and the role of health in future policy-making.

The medical director at Croydon University Hospital has opened up about the difficulty of caring for dying patients when they could not see their families in person throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

In a blog post, Dr Nnenna Osuji spoke frankly about the challenges stating that there will be many “wounded” people moving forward.

She said it was not just frontline staff who witnessed “significant traumas” but that this was faced by many administrators, cleaners porters and catering staff.

The difficulty of the situation is laid bare in an anecdote of a young mother-of-three who lost her battle to CovidCovid-19.

Dr Osuji wrote: “I remember it because there were moments of hope then despair then hope again and eventual utter despair.

“We did our best to let the family embrace ‘virtually’ when, for understandable reasons, they could not be face to face. The scenario reduced me to tears and to I found myself grieving for the family I never met and their lives are forever changed.

“Even writing about this just now brings fresh tears. We will all have different versions of these tales which we harbour.

“Covid exposed us to illness and death at a scale and pace we have never seen and did not allow us the time to replenish.”

And speaking as the grand-daughter of a Nigerian chief Dr Osuji wrote about the murder of George Floyd which has sparked protests across the globe.

“The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted inequalities that exist in Britain with the BAME (black and minority ethnic) communities being disproportionately affected by the virus.”

She also told of being scared for her own family, including her 11-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son.

Dr Osuji added: “Covid has shone a spotlight on inequality in a way that should galvanise meaningful action.

“Risk factors that have been shown to have an impact include age, gender, deprivation, obesity, diabetes, recent haematology malignancy diagnosis, organ transplant and ethnicity.

“We know that if this were a matter of genetics only, we should be seeing a very different picture of Covid internationally.

“Access to housing, to good nutrition, to education, to employment, to wealth are all factors that impact our health and well-being. We see this in our own Croydon population.”

She finished by saying that it is a cycle that needs to be broken and everyone must work to reduce inequalities and improve health in Croydon.

The latest figures show 301 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died at Croydon University Hospital.

The hospital was one of the worst hit in London but things are now easing up with less coronavirus patients in intensive care and from Monday visitors were allowed back on the wards, with some restrictions in place.

[USA], July 19 (ANI): Flavored cigarette ban was linked to a significant reduction in smoking among youth and young adults, according to recent research led by George Mason University's College of Health and Human Services.

Some of the earlier research has shed light on the fact that flavoured cigarettes largely appeal to and are disproportionately used by underage smokers.

Nearly 90 per cent of smokers begin smoking by age 18, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. To reduce long-term health consequences and improve public health, preventing smoking initiation is key as is reducing the draw of flavored tobacco products.

On September 22, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's national ban on flavored cigarettes products went into effect. This banned the sale of flavored cigarettes other than menthol, but there was little information about the potential impact of this ban on youth smoking.

Dr. Matthew Rossheim, assistant professor of global and community health, led the study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. Researchers found that the flavored cigarette ban reduced smoking among youth (ages 12-17 years) by 43 per cent and young adults (ages 18-25 years) by 27 per cent.



""Our study suggests that the ban of flavored cigarettes was extremely effective at reducing smoking among young people,"" explains Rossheim.

""This shows incredible promise for future comprehensive bans of flavored tobacco products, including those in e-cigarettes, which to-date have received significant exemptions. Policymakers should take note of the evidence from this study and pass legislation to extend flavor bans to other tobacco and nicotine products,"" Rossheim added.

Rossheim and colleagues examined cigarette use among young people and adults from the 2002-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data. This included nationally representative data collected every quarter each year, providing a more sensitive measure to detect changes in smoking behaviors than previous research, as well as an adult comparison group to test whether there was an overall reduction in smoking that could have been a result of other factors.

Rossheim and colleagues did not see a similar reduction in smoking among older smokers, which suggests that this ban was effective at reducing smoking specifically among young people and that the reduction was caused by the ban and not by other influences.

""We observed an increase in smoking of menthol cigarettes among youth right after the ban took effect. It appears that young people smoke menthol cigarettes more when other flavor options are no longer available,"" added Rossheim.

Menthol flavor was excluded from the 2009 ban. Prior research has also shown that menthol-flavored tobacco products are disproportionately used by African Americans, which may explain observed health disparities.

Rossheim and colleagues suggest that to maximize their effectiveness among young people and to avoid increasing health disparities among African Americans, flavor bans should include all flavors and tobacco products. (ANI)

It’s weird when you recognize that, despite your best efforts, things aren’t even close to being equal in your household. While I’m the primary breadwinner for our family, my work hours have been altered and cut during the pandemic while my husband works the same – if not more – hours than he did pre-pandemic.

To be fair, my husband is an essential worker, and he has to leave the house to work while I work from home. Our daycare closed with the pandemic so I’m the sole caregiver for our three young kids – who range in age from 15 months to 7 years – for most of the day. Even though I get up at 4 a.m. to try to get all of my work done, I’ve lost anywhere from one to two hours of work time a day since the pandemic hit.

I know I’m lucky to be in a privileged position to have work when so many others don’t, and I’m thankful for that. And I know some people have been struggling with this reality way before the pandemic hit. I’m also fortunate to have a partner who is also working and who is happy to care for our kids when he’s home.

But our current arrangement is clearly unbalanced. In fact, I’m writing this story at home while keeping tabs on my two older children – the baby is napping. Meanwhile, my husband has two hands free at his job.

Moms have reduced their work hours by about 5 percent while the work hours of dads have largely stayed the same, a new study shows (Photo: Getty Images)

I’m not the only mom struggling with the status quo. Smitten Kitchen founder Deb Perelman wrote an essay for The New York Times detailing how it can feel like working parents have to choose between having a kid or a job during the coronavirus pandemic. Women’s health expert Dr. Jessica Shepherd, an ob-gyn in Texas, tells Yahoo Life she’s also had to scale back her work hours lately, both due to the pandemic’s restrictions on her ability to provide proper, safe care to patients and the need to care for her children. She specifically cites “having less access to babysitters, camps, and activities” as an issue, along with “trying to keep them safe by minimizing outings.”

Story continues

New research shows that the pandemic-induced status quo has only widened the gender gap in work hours. Moms have reduced their work hours by about 5 percent while the work hours of dads have largely stayed the same.

The study, which was published in the journal Gender, Work and Organization in July analyzed data from approximately 60,000 households surveyed by the U.S. Current Population Survey. The study’s researchers analyzed changes in the data from February to April in dual-earner heterosexual married households. Among other things, the researchers found that father’s hours didn’t fall below 40 hours a week, suggesting that dads continued to put in a full workweek. Moms, on the other hand, lost about two hours of work a week.

The researchers found that the impact was greatest in moms who had elementary school-aged kids or younger. Why? Those kids need the most help and attention during the workday, study co-author William Scarborough, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Texas, tells Yahoo Life.

What’s going on here?

A lot, actually. While the new study focused on the actual numbers and not so much the why, Scarborough says there are a lot of theories behind what’s happening.

The first is that, in heterosexual couples, kids “de facto go to mom first,” Scarborough says. “This is probably reflective of ongoing gender inequalities – mothers are doing the majority of caregiving,” he says.

Study co-author Liana Christin Landivar, a sociologist and faculty affiliate at the University of Maryland’s Maryland Population Research Center, tells Yahoo Life that moms are also “more likely to scale back at work than fathers, even under normal conditions,” although it’s not entirely clear why. “The pandemic has exacerbated these patterns,” she says. “With widespread childcare and school closures, someone has to provide the care. This has largely fallen to mothers.”

Women often “have no choice” but to cut back their work hours, especially given that many need to do general caregiving, homeschooling and housework on top of their paid work, lead study author Caitlyn Collins, an assistant professor of sociology and of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, tells Yahoo Life. “Women more so than men tend to be burdened with these tasks, given prevailing cultural beliefs about who can and should care for children,” she says.

The result, though, isn’t great for women. Scarborough anticipates that moms may end up earning less over time and may eventually land in fewer leadership roles as a result. Black and Latinx women as a whole tend to work in less flexible jobs with reduced access to benefits and more on-side work requirements, Landivar says —and this inequity can hit them especially hard. “Overall, this creates a negative pattern,” Scarborough says. “This is really going to hurt women’s work outcomes, we believe.”

What can families do about this?

Scarborough says it’s crucial for families to even recognize that this is happening. “We have this normative tendency for mothers to take on more than fathers,” he says. “I don’t think most fathers want to undermine their partner’s work productivity, but we need to see these gender inequities and to respond to them.”

Employers can also help out, Landivar says. “Employers will need to provide generous flexibilities to working parents who are working under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and men should use these flexibilities to the extent they are available,” she says. “Expanded government investment in childcare and paid sick and caregiving leave will be critical for parents, especially mothers, to maintain work attachment amidst limited childcare availability and school closures and the resulting increased expectations of homeschooling.”

Ultimately, Collins says, dads need to do more. “Fathers have a right and a responsibility to participate equally in childcare and housework—in good times and in COVID times,” she says. “This labor should not fall solely or mostly on women.”

James Jones, head of consumer affairs at Experian, said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we go about our everyday life, and in some cases our financial outlook and priorities."

The discourse around the coronavirus outbreak has shifted entirely to weathering the ramifications of the pandemic, however, beyond the devastation wreaked by COVID-19 , lies the HIV crisis, far from over.

The United Nations recently warned governments against the growing risks of relegating the fight against HIV to the periphery, circling the role of inequalities in impeding the global response to the pandemic. These inequalities, which are also reflected in the global management of the HIV outbreak, will likely result in the failure to achieve global targets for this year, throwing us ‘off course’ in the long run.

With 2.1 million of its total population affected by HIV, many of whom continue to live on the margins of society, India is no stranger to one of the world’s largest development and health challenges. And in the time of the coronavirus crisis, as several states negotiate varying phases of the lockdown, the communities affected by HIV continue fighting a unique battle.

Four HIV+ individuals and a couple of NGO workers recount their experience of the ongoing pandemic at a time when access to healthcare, despite being as indispensable as ever, is strained – and in some cases elusive.

Bhagyashree, Kolhapur

For 45-year-old Bhagyashree, who learnt she was HIV positive in 2007, the lockdown has presented unforeseen barriers which she learnt to circumvent with time and assistance from the Network of Maharashtra People Living with HIV/AIDS (NMP+), a community-based organisation supported by India HIV/AIDS Alliance.

On a regular day, Bhagyashree works in the fields and is able to generate enough income to ensure financial independence. However, due to strict restrictions placed on mobility in Kolhapur, she hasn’t been able to go to the field, or the nearest ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to get her dose of antiretroviral drugs, the HIV-suppressing medicines ought to be taken lifelong. “When the lockdown was imposed, I was already running low on the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) drugs. Because I live alone and do not have my own transport, I became anxious about not being able to go to the clinic,” recounts Bhagysharee. However, the counsellor at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre delivered the drugs to her after she reached out to them.

Not far from Bhagyashree’s house, live a couple, whom she remembers spotting at the ART centre in the past. While several people, like the couple, maintain confidentiality about their HIV status fearing unfounded stigma and ostracisation, the lockdown has made maintaining secrecy while continuing medication during the lockdown particularly difficult. “The couple live in a joint family whose members aren’t aware of their HIV diagnosis. They were unable to visit the ART centre during the lockdown without drawing attention. And so on one such day, their relatives found out about the couple’s HIV status and threatened to cut ties with them. The couple then reached out to me and I counselled the family and corrected their misconceptions about transmission of HIV over three days until they were convinced that it is perfectly safe to cohabit with a person living with HIV,” Bhagyashree adds.

While the lockdown may have allowed Bhagyashree to support her community, she has not been immune to quotidian struggles of a person living with HIV. “I have an inkling that my CD4 count has reduced and I seem to have lost weight since the lockdown as maintaining a proper diet has become increasingly difficult in these circumstances. I worry about not having enough to eat a lot these days.”

An NMP+ representative reveals that Bhagyashree would have to go to one of the three main ART centres in Kolhapur in case she wants to get checked, as the sub-centres (located in closer proximity) have been reserved for the dispensation of medical supplies.

Samina Ali*, Pune

A new mother, Ali gave birth to a boy just five months ago, soon after moving to Pune from Mumbai. As someone living with HIV for three years, it was expected that she would receive appropriate postnatal care. However, from ART non-adherence due to limited availability of the required drug to not being able to breastfeed, Ali’s experience of motherhood as well as the lockdown has been rife with anxiety and dread.

“I missed the ARV (antiretroviral) dose for about 20 days during the lockdown as I could not go to the ART centre to renew my prescription. Initially, the NGO workers could not reach me either as the police wasn’t allowing any movement on the roads whatsoever; some personnel were even attacked in the process of securing medicines for patients such as me.” With an infant at home, it was only after healthcare workers from India HIV/AIDS Alliance came to her rescue that Ali was able to resume taking necessary medication. However, she notes that due to her fluctuating regime, she had to take the decision to not breastfeed.

“In the eighth month of my pregnancy, I had gone to the nearby centre [in Pimpri-Chinchwad] and requested the officials to issue three months’ worth of supplies to me as I knew becoming a new mother would bring on its own challenges later, but I could not get the drugs despite being checked by a doctor.” It’s possible that Ali’s transfer from one ART centre to another did not materialise in time, or that it was never initiated, as the case may be. But the non-adherence has come at an expense only Ali seems to have to bear. “I have been giving my baby formula milk for the past five months, which again, is costly.”

Additionally, certain other logistical hitches seem to have exacerbated Ali’s plight: a dose of Co-trimoxazole is usually administered to infants born to HIV-positive mothers for the first 18 months. However, Ali reveals she received only two such units from the government clinic nearby and was asked to arrange the rest from private chemists — an expense too high for someone who last worked as a helping hand in a local beauty parlour. “The lockdown has made life extremely difficult for new mothers like me, and I fear for my child. Questions such as ‘What will the next month be like,’ ‘Will I get medicines next month,’ ‘What if no social worker will be there to help me’ routinely hound me” — her voice trailing off as she contemplates what the upcoming months might throw at her — “the government should have thought these things through.”

Prakash Kumar*, Allahabad

In Uttar Pradesh’s Kaushambi district, Prakash and his wife, both of whom tested positive for HIV roughly 10 years ago, travelled 70 kilometres to get their second round of ARV drugs in lockdown. Aside from the long transit, the lockdown hasn’t caused an upheaval in Kumar’s life mainly as the first round of drugs were delivered to his doorstep by the Care and Support Centre.

However, he does note that with the shift in the focus of healthcare facilities to treating patients with COVID-19 , people affected by other health conditions are bearing the brunt of an overworked force. “My wife had gone to our Primary Health Centre during the lockdown. However, despite waiting for the doctor and making enquiries, she had to return home, unattended,” says Kumar. While the pandemic can offer a segue into informed conversations on HIV, like Kumar, many believe not much headway has been made in the direction so far.

Institutional malfunctions aside, healthcare workers in the state say that an interrupted supply of medicines from the government has made navigating the lockdown easier for people living with HIV in UP. However, they too have certain concerns that are yet to be addressed.

33-year-old Vimlesh Kumar, employed with the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society, says scores of NGO workers are risking their lives each day to ensure people in outlying areas have uninterrupted access to HIV suppressing drugs, in accordance with the National AIDS Control Organisation’s (NACO) directives. Yet they haven’t been provided an insurance cover, even as other frontline workers appear to have been covered under a similar scheme, recently promulgated by the government. “If an employee of the National Rural Health Mission or an ART centre contracts the coronavirus , they are eligible for insurance benefits, but we are not. Therefore, it would be extremely rewarding if the government took notice of our effort and the risk involved and extended the insurance cover to include us as well,” Kumar adds.

Muskan, New Delhi

Originally from Bihar, New Delhi’s Muskan became HIV positive just six months ago. A transgender sex worker, she is something of a pariah in her south-west Delhi neighbourhood, and so used to being on her own. However, the lockdown days have been some of the toughest she has seen. ""On one such day, I noticed I had exhausted my ARV supplies and tried going to the hospital, but was turned away by the police on the way. I showed them my green book as well, but they did not oblige.""

Like all businesses, Muskan’s services have halted abruptly in view of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, her earnings have been virtually nil. To make ends meet, she has taken to begging at the nearby traffic signal with a few friends. Despite her daily labour, the medicine and food supplies in her kitchen dry up from time to time; this is when the NGO worker she speaks fondly of comes to her rescue, while aid from the neighbours remains out of question. The HIV epidemic is driven by sexual intercourse in India, and for particularly vulnerable communities such as Muskan's, free ARV treatment might not do much in helping them overcome social stigma.

“I sometimes wonder what the outcome would be if the people in my locality – those who have shunned me because of my profession, which to me, is simply work – discovered about my HIV status. For now, I have learnt to seek solace in the fact that my HIV diagnosis is limited to me, my two friends, and the NGO worker who has helped me immensely so far, and that I still have a roof over my head,” she says.

To commemorate the occasion, the ministry released information on the successes of the GST era.

GST implementation began in 2017. It has had its fair share of criticism, especially on certain sectors and commodities. However, the finance ministry released today certain areas where it has improved the situation.

Finance ministry on expansion of taxpayer base

The finance ministry issued a series of tweets on Monday morning, ""On the first death anniversary of Shri Arun Jaitley, we pay our respects and remember his lasting contribution to nation-building and the legacy he left behind as Union Finance Minister during 2014-19.""

Further, ""As we remember Shri Arun Jaitley today, let us acknowledge the key role he played in the implementation of GST, which will go down in history as one of the most fundamental landmark reforms in Indian taxation.""

The goal of the GST was to regularise a standard rate of taxation across India, ""Before GST, the combination of VAT, Excise, Central Sales Tax and the cascading effect of tax on tax resulted in the standard rate of tax being as high as 31% in many cases,"" the ministry said in a tweet on Monday morning.

However, the ministry has said following the implementation of the GST taxpayer base has grown over the years from 65 lakh before implementation to 1.24 crore, ""The multiple markets across India, with each state charging a different rate of tax, led to huge inefficiencies and costs of compliance. Under GST, compliance has been improving steadily. The taxpayer base has almost doubled to 1.24 crore.""

The ministry also said that now with GST the rate at which people need to pay taxes has come down significantly, ""GST has reduced the rate at which people have to pay tax. The revenue-neutral rate as per the RNR Committee was 15.3%. Compared to this, the weighted GST rate at present, according to the RBI, is only 11.6%.""

Furthermore, contradicting the criticisms against the GST implementation, the ministry has insisted that GST has made taxpayers more compliant. Moreover, it said that GST is 'taxpayer-friendly' in its outlook.

Comparison of pre-GST and GST tax rates

The ministry revealed about rate changes that, ""Now, Businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh are GST exempt. Initially, this limit was Rs 20 lakh. Additionally, those with a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore can opt for the Composition Scheme and pay only 1% tax.""

It also talked about the items that fall under higher tax slabs and how the 28% rate is restricted to sin and luxury items, ""Out of a total of about 230 items in the 28% slab, about 200 items have been shifted to lower slabs."" The GST has also brought relief to the construction sector the ministry said, ""Significant relief has been extended to the construction sector, particularly the housing sector. It has now been placed at the 5% rate. GST on affordable housing has been reduced to 1%.""

The ministry released a list of certain items showing the different between pre-GST and GST rates. Most daily use items have been brought under the 5% rate, while appliances saw a reduction from 31.3% to 18%.

Common-use items also saw a reduction from 29.3% to 18% under GST. Interestingly, cinema tickets came down from 35% to 110%, to 12% & 18% under GST.

The finance ministry revealed its concessions to the agricultural sector as well, ""Substantial concessions have been extended to the agriculture sector in GST. On fertilisers, the net tax incidence was halved in GST. On agricultural machineries, the tax incidence has come down significantly from 15-18% to 12% and on certain items from about 8% to 5%.""

Many are asking why certain items commonly used are required to have 5% tax levied on them such as oil and sugar. Moreover, items like soap and toothpaste both have an 18% GST levied on it.","It's the first death anniversary of Arun Jaitley and the finance ministry described him as one who 'played a key role' in the GST implementation.

The country's first in-person classes were launched in what will be a critical test for authorities in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The country plans to gradually ensure a return to school for millions of students in the coming weeks, based on the course of progress.

Strict measures aimed at preventing further infections are expected to allow for the further reopening of schools, which were closed since March. Fearing a serious gap in education, Turkey decided to join other countries for a reopening that was originally scheduled for Aug. 31. A heightened caseload, however, forced a postponement until Sept. 21.

Today's opening has been limited to one day only, while as of Sept. 28, students may be asked to attend classes for only two days a week. The number of students in each classroom has been reduced with separate school hours for students. Every class will last only 30 minutes, with 10-minute breaks in between. In the meantime, all other students will continue their courses online.

Education has been a major casualty of the pandemic, with experts repeatedly calling for conditions to prevail to allow for the resumption of in-person classes. Though Turkey has managed to run a relatively successful online education program since the last school year, many say that students should interact more with their teachers and classmates to guarantee better learning. The National Education Ministry has thus spent months working on various plans on how best to reopen schools without risk.

First graders and kindergarten students were chosen as first to attend in-person classes. As National Education Minister Ziya Selçuk put it, the decision stems from the need to get children familiar with school on the first day. Online education is more suitable for older students, authorities reasoned, as the curriculum for first graders and kindergarten students mostly relies on activities.

Starting at 8:45 a.m., students streamed into schools, meeting their classmates before the start of classes. Parents were ordered to leave after dropping off their children as part of measures against the pandemic.

Teachers then informed the students about measures they should take for hygiene. After their body temperatures were measured and hand sanitizers handed out, the mask-wearing students entered the school buildings.

Attendance is not mandatory, but most parents opted to send their children to school, especially in places with a lower number of cases. Authorities have repeatedly assured parents of the stringent safety measures being taken in schools in terms of social distancing and hygiene.

Each building was thoroughly disinfected and supplied with hygiene products before reopening, while free masks have been given to all students.

Masks are mandatory, though teachers are required to wear an additional face shield. Meanwhile, students are required to enter the school in a single file to avoid overcrowding, sanitizers are mounted on the walls in all corridors and classrooms have desks rearranged with at least 1 meter (around 3 feet) between each student to ensure social distancing. Staff and parent-teacher meetings are also required to be held online, while school meals will involve wrapped food, such as sandwiches.

The National Education Ministry also arranged ""contactless"" activities for kindergarten students that allow them to play games without having to touch or come close to each other. Some 60 activities and games have been planned for young students.

No decision has been yet made on the fate of other grades, but authorities plan to launch in-person classes in a number of weeks. For now, older students will take online classes with hours more flexible than those of a standard school day. Minister Selçuk recently announced that online classes could be held at various times between 8:30 a.m. and 8:20 p.m.

Based on pandemic trends, Turkey is considering a ""hybrid"" education model, with live online classes and in-person classes on different days and flexible school hours.

School closures have been common across the world over the course of the outbreak, but the United Nations has warned of “a generational catastrophe” as a result.

Last month, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on governments to get students safely back to the classroom as a top priority, the closures having affected more than 1 billion students across the world.

""We face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress and exacerbate entrenched inequalities,"" said Guterres, at the launch of an education campaign last month. He has called for the reopening of schools once the local transmission of the virus is under control.","The country's first in-person classes were launched in what will be a critical test for authorities in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Anyone who has ever taught or known a teacher knows how intense the workload can be — all over the world, teachers find themselves left adrift against a current of curriculums and nights spent grading papers, only to be rewarded with complaints and abuse from students, parents, and higher-ups alike. In Japan, things get even more intense for junior high school educators. Junior high school is when kids start joining extracurricular clubs and sports teams, and those need supervisors. Club activities can take place both before and after school and occasionally on weekends, and portions of summer vacation are carved out for events like competitions or performances.

One might wonder, then, when Japanese junior high school teachers are supposed to have time to do the other thousands of responsibilities they have to their students…and failing that, if there’s ever any time for them to get a break.

The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology is taking steps to address this problem by reforming club activities into “local activities”, meaning that local sports clubs, community workers, or gym staff could feasibly supervise in teachers’ stead. This also addresses the issue of teachers assigned to a club being unable to provide helpful guidance to their students; teachers are frequently assigned to sports or cultural clubs without any expertise in the club’s subject matter, meaning they can’t field student questions or give useful advice.

The reforms are expected to be put into practice in junior high schools three years from now, with high school reforms to follow suit depending on results. Response to the announced reforms was largely positive, although various netizens seemed doubtful that community figures would be capable of supervising the rowdy teens you’d expect to find in a junior high school club meeting.

“I wish they’d just let the kids take a break on holidays. You’re bound to get a lot of stuffy, old-fashioned types acting as ‘local guides’, too.”

“They should just let the teachers and the kids have the day off on holidays. Send them to private school if they’re that determined to do stuff.”

“‘Local activities’ means they’re just shunting work onto the private sector.”

“They’re giving this work to greenhorns who haven’t been trained in education? Those kids’ll eat them alive.”

It may be a very small step, but at least some effort is going towards lightening the load of Japan’s public school teachers.

The national speed limit on roads in built-up areas across Wales is to be reduced from 30mph to 20mph by 2023.

The Welsh Government has announced, based on the recommendations from the Welsh 20mph Task Force Group, the automatic 30mph speed limit on restricted roads is to be lowered to 20mph.

Restricted roads are roads in a built-up area and are identified by the presence of street lights.

A Welsh Government spokesperson said: “The report recommends turning the current Traffic Regulation Orders process on its head.

“Instead of the default speed limit being 30mph, with communities needing to make the case to go lower, the default speed limit will become 20mph, with a case needing to be made to go higher.

“Crucially it will be for communities, and local authorities, to decide which roads should remain at 30mph.”

The Welsh 20mph Task Force Group was launched by Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport Lee Waters in May 2019 and collated a report investigating the premise that 20mph should be the default limit for restricted roads.

The taskforce’s year-long study, which was made up by police, local authorities, public health experts and other key partners such as road safety groups, makes 21 practical recommendations for implementation of the change across Wales.

The Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport Lee Waters said: “80 children were killed or seriously injured in Wales in the last year for which we have figures. That’s 80 families whose lives will never be the same again.

“Whilst we have made progress on reducing deaths on our roads in the 21 years of devolution, despite our considerable efforts, there are still 4,000 accidents which result in injuries every year in Wales.

“The evidence is clear, reducing speed reduces accidents. It saves lives. Slower speeds in our communities improves quality of life too.

“According to the British Crime Survey, speeding traffic was rated as the most serious anti-social problem.

“Furthermore, fear of traffic tops the list of parent worries, with children kept closer to home, reducing their independence, and leading to the vicious spiral of increased danger, as more people drive their children to school. This, in turn, amplifies health inequalities.”

At the end of week five, I hit a breaking point studying for my upcoming microeconomics exam. In a stressed-out frenzy, I sent an email to the Tutor Clearinghouse, politely asking if my individual tutoring request for ECON 21 had been processed. I added that I “would be really grateful if my requested pairing could be made!”

Unfortunately, my excessive exclamation points and pleasantries were not persuasive enough. A couple days later, I received an automatic reply telling me that my request for a tutor had been denied. The staff at the Tutor Clearinghouse went on to suggest a couple other strategies I could use to manage a difficult course, like joining a group tutoring section. This would have been a helpful suggestion if the Clearinghouse offered a group tutoring section for ECON 21.

Before this term, I had only positive experiences with the Clearinghouse. In fact, I had a tutor every term of freshman year. My tutor for ECON 1, “The Price System,” simultaneously introduced me to monopolistic competition and, more importantly, FFB. I spent many late nights in Novack working through labs with my tutor for COSC 1, “Introduction to Programming and Computation,” and in the spring, I exchanged obscene numbers of Zoom meeting links with my tutor for COSC 10, “Problem Solving via Object-Oriented Programming.” My point is that I value individual tutoring. Thinking I had somehow cracked the code to on-campus resources, I told all of my friends to get a tutor if they ever took a difficult course.

Along with other students, I was disappointed when the Tutor Clearinghouse rolled back many of their tutoring services due to budget constraints this fall. Group tutoring became the main focus, and individual tutoring was reserved for students who “demonstrate[d] a particular need.” Academic Skills Center interim director Karen Afre gave some context for how these changes came about.

“There have always been more individual tutor requests than students who applied to serve as tutors, and like any other department, we also need to work within a budget,” Afre wrote in an email statement.

In order to continue providing peer tutoring at no cost to students, Afre wrote that the Tutor Clearinghouse began researching best practices and methods used at other universities.

“The data was overwhelming,” Afre explained. “It repeatedly emphasized the importance and value of group learning and collaborative work.”

As we approach the start of finals, I spoke to some students about how they feel about the Tutor Clearinghouse’s new emphasis on group tutoring.

Vandana Venkatesh ’23 participates in group tutoring for BIOL 12, “Cell Structure and Function.” She said that securing a spot in the group was stressful.

“For [BIOL 12], I remember when I logged onto the [sign-up] page literally 10 minutes after it opened, there was only one spot left,” Venkatesh said. “Further, there are only two sections for my [biology] class, meaning a total of 10 tutoring spots for a class with over 80 people.”

When I asked how effective this resource has been, Venkatesh reflected on the benefits of group tutoring.

“For me, the group dynamic has been positive. Everyone brings their own questions and bounces ideas off of each other, which is super helpful right before a test.”

“I think it really depends on the tutor and the people that show up,” she said. “For me, the group dynamic has been positive. Everyone brings their own questions and bounces ideas off of each other, which is super helpful right before a test.”

However, Venkatesh recognized that different students have different needs, and that “some people benefit more from group [tutoring] while some from individual.” She added that students enjoy being able to choose between different options.

Kate Kucharczuk ’23, a group tutor for MATH 13, “Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions,” agreed that group tutoring serves an important purpose.

“[It] can be good … if you have [the tutee] explain something to their peer,” Kucharczuk said. “… It’s helpful for [both students] to go over the material.”

However, Kucharczuk recognized the need for more tutors for upper-level courses, as well as the difficulties of being a group tutor right now. She expressed that the Tutor Clearinghouse could provide “a little more guidance and training for the [tutored] subject,” and that Zoom learning creates its own stresses and technological challenges.

Elizabeth Hadley ’23 sees value in the fall term’s academic resources. Hadley is a Latin group tutor hired by the Clearinghouse and an individual tutor hired by the Latin department. Her individual tutoring has been a particularly positive experience. In fact, her tutee, Joey Musa ’24, said that he sometimes feels as though the tutoring session is “more impactful on [his] learning” than his actual class session is.

“I think study groups, and what’s taking place instead of individual tutoring, [are] actually not as productive because they only meet once a week, and some people don’t thrive in a group environment or feel comfortable asking questions.”

But Hadley also agreed that students benefit from having different options.

“I think study groups, and what’s taking place instead of individual tutoring, [are] actually not as productive because they only meet once a week, and some people don’t thrive in a group environment or feel comfortable asking questions,” Hadley said. “… It’s harming students’ learning.”

Regardless of whether group or individual tutoring is more productive, many students — myself included — lack access to either resource for certain courses. Emily Dwyer ’23 requested an individual tutor for her economics course after seeing that no group tutoring section was offered. When her request was denied, Dwyer expressed frustration not only because she had such a positive tutoring experience her freshman year, but because she believes the reduced resources may exacerbate inequality among students. As Dwyer put it, “some students will have the financial resources to get any extra help they need, and others inevitably won’t.”

Dwyer understands that budget decisions impact the quantity of resources the Tutor Clearinghouse can offer; however, she does not see that as an excuse for the recent reduction in tutoring options.

“A pandemic that is affecting virtually every facet of students’ lives seems like a bad time to drastically cut a widely used element of the academic support system at Dartmouth, especially when there are already so many inherent inequalities with remote learning.”

“A pandemic that is affecting virtually every facet of students’ lives seems like a bad time to drastically cut a widely used element of the academic support system at Dartmouth, especially when there are already so many inherent inequalities with remote learning,” Dwyer said.

While many students benefit from group tutoring and other opportunities for academic support, the reduction of individual tutoring and overall downsizing of the Tutor Clearinghouse resources has either restricted or eliminated options for many students.

Luckily, Afre noted that the Clearinghouse is willing to alter their services based on student feedback, and the courses supported by group tutoring change every term.

“Based on the feedback we’ve received, students want more details about group tutoring,” Afre wrote. “Tutees want to be informed earlier about registration and about what courses are being supported. We hope to work on having multiple touch points with students moving forward.”

While we wait to see whether group tutoring will be available for more classes next term, here’s another piece of advice I received in my automatic reply from the Clearinghouse: Find a study buddy!","Kate Kucharczuk ’23, a group tutor for MATH 13, “Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions,” agreed that group tutoring serves an important purpose.

However, scientists wanted to know how much of that decline can be attributed to changes in human activity during pandemic-related shutdowns, versus how much would have occurred in a pandemic-free 2020.

Using computer models to generate a COVID-free 2020 for comparison, NASA researchers found that since February, pandemic restrictions have reduced global nitrogen dioxide concentrations by nearly 20%. The results were presented at the 2020 International Conference for High-Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.

Nitrogen dioxide is an air pollutant that is primarily produced by the combustion of fossil fuels used by industry and transportation--both of which were significantly reduced during the height of the pandemic to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading.

""We all knew the lockdowns were going to have an impact on air quality,"" said lead author Christoph Keller with Universities Space Research Association (USRA) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Keller works in Goddard's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO), which uses high-tech computer models to help track the chemistry of the ocean and the atmosphere, and forecast future climate scenarios.

He says, ""it was also soon clear that it was going to be difficult to quantify how much of that change is related to the lockdown measures, versus general seasonality or variability in pollution.""

No two years are exactly alike. Normal variations in weather and atmospheric circulation change the make-up and chemistry of Earth's atmosphere. Comparing 2020 nitrogen dioxide concentrations with data from 2019 or 2018 alone would not account for year-to-year differences.

But, because the NASA model projections account for these natural variations, scientists can use them to parse how much of the 2020 atmospheric composition change was caused by the COVID-19 containment measures.

Even with models, there was no predicting the sudden, drastic shifts in human behavior as the novel coronavirus--and the regulations attempting to control it--spread rapidly. Instead of trying to re-program their model with this unexpected event, Keller and his colleagues accounted for COVID-19 by having the model ignore the pandemic altogether.

The model simulation and machine learning analysis took place at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation. Its ""business as usual"" scenario showed an alternate reality version of 2020--one that did not experience any unexpected changes in human behavior brought on by the pandemic.

From there it is simple subtraction. The difference between the model simulated values and the measured ground observations represents the change in emissions due to the pandemic response.

The researchers received data from 46 countries--a total of 5,756 observation sites on the ground--relaying hourly atmospheric composition measurements in near-real-time. On a city-level, 50 of the 61 analyzed cities show nitrogen dioxide reductions between 20-50%.

In some ways I was surprised by how much it dropped. Many countries have already done a very good job in lowering their nitrogen dioxide concentrations over the last decades due to clean air regulations, but what our results clearly show is that there is still asignificant human behavior-driven contribution."" Christoph Keller, Study Lead Author, Universities Space Research Association (USRA), NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center

Wuhan, China was the first municipality to report an outbreak of COVID-19. It was also the first to show reduced nitrogen dioxide emissions--60% lower than simulated values expected. A 60% decrease in Milan and a 45% decrease in New York followed shortly, as their local restrictions went into effect.

""You could, at times, even see the decrease in nitrogen dioxide before the official policies went into place,"" said co-author Emma Knowland with USRA at Goddard's GMAO.

""People were probably reducing their transit because the talk of the COVID-19 threat was already happening before we were actually told to shut down."" Once restrictions were eased, the decreases in nitrogen dioxide lessened, but remained below expected ""business as usual"" values.

Keller compared his estimates of the nitrogen dioxide decreases to reported economic numbers, namely, the gross domestic products, of the nations included in the study. According to Keller, they lined up shockingly well.

""We would expect them to be somewhat related because nitrogen dioxide is so closely linked to economic activities, like people who travel and factories running,"" he said. ""It looks like our data captures this very well.""","Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, space- and ground-based observations have shown that Earth's atmosphere has seen significant reductions in some air pollutants.

Mounting evidence has linked chronic exposure with poor academic performance in K-12 students. Until now, no research had examined the impact of ""peak"" air pollution events, the 24-hour spikes of extremely high PM2.5 levels. For students in Salt Lake County, Utah, these episodes are a dangerous reality--the county's largest city, Salt Lake City, was among the top 10 most polluted American cities for short-term particle pollution in the latest American Lung Association report.

In a new study, University of Utah researchers found that more frequent peak air pollution exposure was associated with reduced math and English language arts (ELA) test scores for third graders in all primary public schools in Salt Lake County during the 2016-2017 year. The minimum peak pollution levels in this study are below what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines are ""safe"" levels of PM2.5. The results stress the need for legislators to enact policies that reduce the number of peak pollution days, and to advocate for lower federal pollution standards.

The huge takeaway is that this isn't about school location--it's not just the schools in the most polluted parts of the city. Everyone is impacted by peak pollution."" Casey Mullen, lead author, doctoral student in sociology at the University of Utah

The study highlights the environmental injustice of Salt Lake County's air pollution problem-- schools with a higher proportion of students of color and from households experiencing poverty were exposed to higher mean concentrations of fine particulates and more peak pollution days than were schools serving middle- to upper- class and predominately white students. Though peak exposures had a stronger effect on lower math proficiency in more socially advantaged schools.

""There are so many studies showing us that air pollution damages our brain's cognitive processing ability,"" said co-author Sara Grineski, professor of sociology at the University of Utah. ""Utah has made great strides to lower pollution in the past decades, but we need to keep pushing forward policies to reduce pollution. We already know it will improve Utahns respiratory health, but it also can help kids do a little bit better in schools.""

The paper published online on Sept. 22, 2020, in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. This research was funded by the Interdisciplinary Exchange for Utah Science at the University of Utah.

Air quality impacts test scores

The researchers looked at the Student Assessment of Growth and Excellence (SAGE) math and ELA scores of third graders in 156 primary public schools in Salt Lake County in 2017. They focused on the percentage of students whose scores were lower than grade-level expectations.

In order to ensure that air pollution was the only variable affecting test scores, the researchers created a school disadvantage variable that took into account Title I school status; Hispanic students; the percentage of non-Hispanic minority students who were Black, Asian/Pacific Islander or Native American/Alaska Native; and the percentage of students on free and/or reduce-priced meals. They also accounted for the school's neighborhood context.

""It is important to account for social disadvantage since social factors are tightly linked with standardized test scores. Students from low-income families have additional struggles that don't tend to affect more affluent students, such as food insecurity. Students from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds often have unequal educational experiences in the U.S. In some cases, they are immigrants themselves or the children of immigrants, and they might still be learning English,"" said Grineski. ""These factors influence standardized test scores.""

Then, they evaluated each school's chronic and peak air pollution concentrations. For chronic air pollution levels, they analyzed the daily PM2.5concentrations for each school using daily concentrations in the census tract housing each school from the U.S. EPA's Downscaler data. On average, schools had chronic PM2.5 levels of just over 8 micrograms per cubic meter. To establish peak air pollution episodes, the researchers identified the number of days each school was exposed to PM2.5 levels in the 95th percentile of PM2.5 concentrations for the year, which was 23 micrograms per cubic meter. The U.S. EPA's unhealthy air standard is 35 micrograms per cubic meter.

While chronic pollution exposure was associated with lower test scores, the effect disappeared when researchers controlled for the social disadvantage factors. In contrast, the frequency of peak pollution exposure was associated with a higher percentage of students who tested below grade proficiency in math and ELA, even after controlling for social disadvantage.

""Research shows that air pollution is associated with brain cell inflammation. That is well-established,"" said Mullen. ""With that in mind, our study findings suggest that future research should examine if repeated peak exposures to concentrations of fine particulate matter might be more damaging to children's brain functioning than chronic exposures.""

Reduce air pollution

The authors suggest that legislators could advance public health initiatives that protect children's exposure to air pollution. The researchers have consulted with urban planners about creating cleaner air routes for children to move around their communities. For the future, the state could improve regulations that would prevent schools from being built in high pollution areas. For now, investing in better air filtration systems in classrooms could help mitigate the poor air quality already exists. In the face of growing evidence that even low PM2.5 concentrations does damage to the human body, legislators should advocate for lower federal air pollution standards.

""Here, with constant air quality issues throughout the seasons, we need to increase awareness about air pollution exposures,"" Mullen said. ""This is a conversation everyone should be having--people need to be informed about what's at stake.""","Until now, no research had examined the impact of ""peak"" air pollution events, the 24-hour spikes of extremely high PM2.5 levels.

It comes after a UN report found that the wealthiest 1 per cent pump more than twice times as much carbon into the atmosphere as the bottom 50 per cent.

It is hardly the first time that wealthy figures have been accused of driving climate change with their lavish lifestyle choices.

Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCpario were among a slew of well-heeled celebrities criticsed for attending a Google climate summit in Italy last year - arriving on private jets and yachts that left an estimated 800-tonne carbon footprint.

Katy Perry (centre left) and Orlando Bloom (centre right) were among a host of celebrities criticised over a Google climate conference in Italy last year that they attended via private jet and yacht (pictured, backs to camera, are Oprah Winfrey and Bradley Cooper)

Perry and Bloom had hitched a ride to the Sicilian conference on the Rising Sun, a massive private yacht owned by music and movie producer David Geffen (pictured rear)

DiCaprio, a UN climate ambassador, has previously been criticised for speaking out on the issue despite frequently flying on private jets, renting a yacht from an oil baron, and owning four houses.

Oxfam's Confronting Carbon Inequality report singled out SUVs and frequent flying as two of the biggest drivers of the '1 per cent' carbon footprint, with many billionaires known to own private jets.

Like the UN report, published this week, it found the top 1 per cent contribute significantly more to climate change than the bottom 50 per cent.

Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is known to get around on a $65 million Gulfstream jet and in October 2018 was pictured taking an SUV to the airport with then-mistress Lauren Sanchez before hopping on board the aircraft.

Billioanire Mark Cuban owns three jets - a Gulfstream that he uses as private transport and two Boeing business jets, one that he rents out as a charter and another that he uses to fly his basketball team around, Business Insider reported.

And despite producing eco-friendly electric cars via Tesla, Elon Musk's love of private jets has previously made headlines after he flew 150,000 miles using a Gulfstream jet in 2018.

Other billionaires to own polluting vehicles are Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, owners of two of the world's largest private yachts.

Also criticised for attending the conference was Leonardo DiCaprio, who has previously come under fire for his use of private jets (pictured disembarking a jet in 2013)

DiCaprio, a UN climate ambassador, has spoken out frequently on the issue over several years, despite criticism for some of his own lifestyle choices

According to the UN, the richest will need to shrink their CO2 footprints significantly to avoid dangerous levels of global warming this century.

The annual study, carried out by the UN Environment Programme (Unep), highlights the gap between the levels emissions should be at to keep temperatures down and current real-life levels.

It found that the world's top 10% of earners devour about 45% of all energy consumed for land transport worldwide and 75% of that used for aviation.

The world's poorest 50% of households, meanwhile, consume just 10% and 5% respectively.

In order to hit the target of restricting temperature rises this century to 1.5C, significant cuts will need to be made to the carbon footprints of the 1%, bringing them down to about 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita by 2030.

'This elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets,' Unep executive director Inger Anderson wrote in a foreword to the report.

'The wealthy bear the greatest responsibility in this area,' she added.

Tim Gore, the head of climate policy at Oxfam and a contributing author to the report said that while the world's richest were consuming the most, others were bearing the negative environmental effects.

Other '1 per cent' figures to make frequent use of polluting vehicles are Jeff Bezos (left) who owns a $65m jet, and Roman Abramovich (right) owner of one of the world's largest yachts

'The UNEP report shows that the over-consumption of a wealthy minority is fuelling the climate crisis, yet it is poor communities and young people who are paying the price'.

'It will be practically and politically impossible to close the emissions gap if governments don't cut the carbon footprint of the wealthy and end the inequalities which leave millions of people without access to power or unable to heat their homes,' Gore said.

According to the BBC, taking one less long-haul flight could reduce an individual's CO2 consumption by almost two tonnes of CO2.

Households that switch to renewable electricity can cut carbon by some 1.5 tonnes, while eating a vegetarian diet can save around half a tonne on average, it said.

The report, published on Wednesday, also found that the positive environmental effects of lockdowns earlier this year intended to curb the spread of coronavirus are likely to be short lived.

It predicted that carbon production will have fallen by around 7% this year because of the pandemic, but estimated the reduction would only curb warming by 0.01C by 2050.

Rising temperatures are a contributing factor to wildfires which caused devastation in Australia, the Amazon and California (pictured) this year, along with other locations

However, the report did highlight that countries have an opportunity to seek a greener mode of recovery from the pandemic.

It found that if government's invest in climate action, expected emissions for 2030 could be cut by 25%.

This would give a 66% chance of the planet keeping temperatures below 2C.

'The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,' said Inger Andersen.

'However, Unep's Emissions Gap report shows that a green pandemic recovery can take a huge slice out of greenhouse gas emissions and help slow climate change.

'I urge governments to back a green recovery in the next stage of Covid-19 fiscal interventions and raise significantly their climate ambitions in 2021.'

Green recovery has so far been limited, according to the report, though some countries have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050.

However the ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement would need to be tripled in order to keep to the 2C goal and increased five-fold to meet the 1.5C target.","World leaders should aggressively reduce the carbon footprint of the wealthiest to curb the effects of climate change, experts have said.

The Great Reset is on everyone’s mind, whether everyone knows it or not. It is presaged by the measures undertaken by states across the world in response to the covid-19 crisis. (I mean by “crisis” not the so-called pandemic itself, but the responses to a novel virus called SARS-2 and the impact of the responses on social and economic conditions.)

In his book, COVID-19: The Great Reset, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab writes that the covid-19 crisis should be regarded as an “opportunity [that can be] seized to make the kind of institutional changes and policy choices that will put economies on the path toward a fairer, greener future.” Although Schwab has been promoting the Great Reset for years, the covid crisis has provided a pretext for finally enacting it. According to Schwab, we should not expect the postcovid world system to return to its previous modes of operation. Rather, alternating between description and prescription, Schwab suggests that changes will be, or should be, enacted across interlocking, interdependent domains to produce a new normal.

So, just what is the Great Reset and what is the new normal it would establish?

The Great Reset means reduced incomes and carbon use. But Schwab and the WEF also define the Great Reset in terms of the convergence of economic, monetary, technological, medical, genomic, environmental, military, and governance systems. The Great Reset would involve vast transformations in each of these domains, changes which, according to Schwab, will not only alter our world but also lead us to “question what it means to be human.”

In terms of economics and monetary policy, the Great Reset would involve consolidation of wealth, on the one hand, and the likely issuance of universal basic income (UBI) on the other. It might include a shift to a digital currency, including a consolidated centralization of banking and bank accounts, immediate real-time taxation, negative interest rates, and centralized surveillance and control over spending and debt.

While every aspect of the Great Reset involves technology, the Great Reset specifically entails “the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” or transhumanism, which includes the expansion of genomics, nanotechnology, and robotics and their penetration into human bodies and brains. Of course, the fourth Industrial Revolution involves the redundancy of human labor in increasing sectors, to be replaced by automation. But moreover, Schwab hails the use of nanotechnology and brain scans to predict and preempt human behavior.

The Great Reset means the issuance of medical passports, soon to be digitized, as well as the transparency of medical records inclusive of medical history, genetic makeup, and disease states. But it could include the implanting of microchips that would read and report on genetic makeup and brain states such that “[e]ven crossing a national border might one day involve a detailed brain scan to assess an individual’s security risk.”

On the genomic front, the Great Reset includes advances in genetic engineering and the fusion of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.

In military terms, the Great Reset entails the creation of new battle spaces including cyberspaces and the human brain as a battle space.

In terms of governance, the Great Reset means increasingly centralized, coordinated, and expanded government and “governmentalities,” the convergence of corporations and states, and the digitalization of governmental functions, including, with the use of 5G and predictive algorithms, real-time tracking and surveillance of bodies in space or the “anticipatory governance” of human and systems behavior.

That being said, “the Great Reset” is but a coordinated propaganda campaign shrouded under a cloak of inevitability. Rather than a mere conspiracy theory, as the New York Times has suggested, the Great Reset is an attempt at a conspiracy, or the “wishful thinking” of socioeconomic planners to have corporate “stakeholders” and governments adopt the desiderata of the WEF.

In order to sell this package, the WEF mobilizes the warmed-over rhetoric of “economic equality,” “fairness,” “inclusion,” and “a shared destiny,” among other euphemisms. Together, such phrases represent the collectivist, socialist political and ideological component of the envisioned corporate socialism (since economic socialism can never be enacted, it is always only political and ideological).

I’ll examine the prospects for the Great Reset in future installments. But suffice it to say for now that the WEF envisions a bio-techno-feudalist global order, with socioeconomic planners and corporate “stakeholders” at the helm and the greater part of humanity in their thrall. The mass of humanity, the planners would have it, will live under an economic stasis of reduced expectations, with individual autonomy greatly curtailed if not utterly obliterated. As Mises suggested, such planners are authoritarians who mean to supplant the plans of individual actors with their own, centralized plans. If enacted, such plans would fail, but their adoption would nevertheless exact a price.","Michael Rectenwald(MISES)The Great Reset is on everyone’s mind, whether everyone knows it or not.
