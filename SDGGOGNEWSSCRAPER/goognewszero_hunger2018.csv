Foundation to address hunger, food waste and the paradoxical relationship between the two,"" said Jessica Adelman, Kroger's group vice president of corporate affairs. ""Our newly-formed relationship with ReFED will challenge us to create the best strategy, structure and program to invest the funds in the most innovative solutions that will help end hunger in the communities we call home and eliminate waste in our company by 2025.""

There is a fundamental absurdity in the food system: 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. goes to waste, yet 1 in 8 Americans struggles with hunger. Kroger believes it can address this absurdity because it has tremendous scale – the physical assets, the technology, the resources, the people and the passion – combined with local connections to its communities to tackle this challenge.

Kroger's partnership with ReFED will help accelerate the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste vision. ReFED works with businesses, investors, innovators and policymakers to move the food system from acting on instinct to insights to solve the national food waste problem. The leaders at ReFED have deep knowledge and experience in food waste innovation, scaling solutions, and the philanthropic and impact investment sectors. ReFED has an innovator database with more than 400 food waste solutions providers, and the system closely tracks where investments are being made.

""Philanthropic capital is needed to foster innovation in ways that other sources of capital cannot; to target and scale solutions lacking a market-rate application, develop capacity for market-based solutions, and seed pilot projects, proofs of concept, and other market-building activities,"" said Chris Cochran, ReFED's executive director. ""We're excited to work alongside Kroger and The Kroger Co. Foundation – a true leader in bringing together capital and innovation to eliminate food waste.""

""At Kroger, our Purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit™, and it comes to life through Zero Hunger | Zero Waste,"" Ms. Adelman added. ""A company's purpose and social impact matter now more than ever. Our Innovation Fund gives us a platform to work with food waste industry leaders and seek input from other partners and stakeholders to maximize its impact. We look forward to crowdsourcing ideas, funding prototypes and pilots, and bringing solutions that work to scale to transform our communities.""

Kroger continues its inaugural work with long-standing partners Feeding America and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to accelerate progress toward achieving its Zero Hunger | Zero Waste vision.

Everyone, be warned.

The government cautions that the Day Zero threat will surpass anything a major city has faced since World War II or the Sept. 11 attacks. Talks are underway with South Africa’s police because “normal policing will be entirely inadequate.” Residents, their nerves increasingly frayed, speak in whispers of impending chaos.

The reason for the alarm is simple: The city’s water supply is dangerously close to running dry.

If water levels keep falling, Cape Town will declare Day Zero in less than three months. Taps in homes and businesses will be turned off until the rains come. The city’s four million residents will have to line up for water rations at 200 collection points. The city is bracing for the impact on public health and social order.

“When Day Zero comes, they’ll have to call in the army,” said Phaldie Ranqueste, who was filling his white S.U.V. with big containers of water at a natural spring where people waited in a long, anxious line.","CAPE TOWN — It sounds like a Hollywood blockbuster.

There was bad news – catastrophic actually – on three fronts:

Cape Town’s water usage went up again, to over 600-million litres per day, despite major efforts, over six months, to bring it down below 500-million litres.

The SA Weather Service informed us that as far as forecasting goes, we are flying blind. Last year the forecast of a wet winter proved to be widely off the mark. On Friday, the SA Weather service told us bluntly: We cannot predict whether or when rain will come. Previous forecasting models have proved useless in the era of climate change.

Day Zero – when the taps in suburbia are switched off – has moved from the realm of possibility to probability. There is no way in which water augmentation schemes will compensate for our ongoing failure to curb demand sufficiently in the short term .

This latter message, in particular, broke the sound barrier. Suddenly, after months of coaxing communication (“if we save water together we can avoid day zero”), the mayor changed gear: We are past the point of no return, she said. Day Zero is almost unavoidable. We WILL run out of water by the end of April unless everyone reduces their water usage to less than 50 litres per person per day.

The response to this announcement showed that reality had finally sunk in.

As the mayor’s press conference was under way, I called in the Province’s Head of Legal Services and said: “The crash the City has been trying to avoid now seems inevitable. We are bracing for impact. Sticking to the Province’s constitutional mandate of support and oversight is not enough in these circumstances.”

The answer I received was: “The legal test for provincial intervention in a local government mandate is when a municipality cannot or does not fulfil an executive obligation. At the moment the City is focusing on strategies to curb water use, augment supply, prepare for day Zero and communicate with citizens.

“When it comes to the functions of the national Department of Water and Sanitation, the province has no powers at all,” he added.

And, to underscore the point, as we grappled with the full scale of the crisis this weekend, the national Parliament tweeted this crisp message to the provincial Ministry of Local Government:

It could not be clearer than that.

Until last week, I accepted the legal argument that it would be difficult for the Province to cite “failure to fulfil an executive obligation” as a reason to intervene in the City’s preparations. They obviously cannot distribute water that the bulk supply system has not produced.

The principle (that each sphere of government must respect the integrity, mandate and functions of other spheres) is entrenched in our Constitution. Court judgments have been consistent: a sphere of government trying to interfere with the mandate of another has always been pushed back. Even a “mandamus” obliging the national department of Water and Sanitation to provide bulk water supplies would have to be sought by the City, not the province.

Last week, I still accepted these stringent limits on the province’s capacity to intervene. No longer.

As we begin the countdown to Day-Zero, the ground has shifted. While we must still do everything possible to prevent this ghastly eventuality (and we still can if EVERYBODY abides by the new water restrictions of 50 litres per person per day), my focus has shifted to overseeing plans for the day the taps run dry – and the weeks that follow. The province has a mandate to manage provincial disasters. The question that dominates my waking hours now is: When Day-Zero arrives, how do we make water accessible and prevent anarchy? And if there is any chance of still preventing it, what is it we can do?

In our most recent oversight discussions, on Friday the City outlined its Day-Zero plan as follows: One week before the six dams providing water to the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) are collectively projected to drop to 13.5%, the City will announce the date on which almost all the taps in Cape Town’s residential suburbs will be cut off.

The same may happen in other towns with a high dependency ratio on these dams – particularly Drakenstein, parts of Stellenbosch and towns on the West Coast (where we have been working very hard to reduce dependence on the Western Cape Water Supply System). If the City’s augmentation plan for Atlantis meets the deadline, it will be almost self-sufficient, and Saldanha Bay municipality has made significant progress in groundwater extraction.

Day Zero is currently projected to be 21 April. (This changes as water usage varies and other factors influence dam levels.)

It may also be delayed as the City and neighbouring towns intensify “throttling”, the process of drastically reducing water pressure in specific areas, where greatest savings can be achieved. This will inevitably mean that people in high-lying “throttled” areas may have very little water coming out of their taps, for extended periods of time, in the weeks ahead.

In weekend email correspondence with Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson, who now heads up the City’s drought response team, he indicated that plans to manage Day Zero may be substantially reviewed. But, as things currently stand, the indications are that, in less than 90 days’ time, municipal water may only be available at 200 Points of Distribution (PoDs) across the City.

The only water delivered through taps will be in informal settlements (where water is already fetched in buckets from standpipes) as well as certain business districts, the boundaries of which are currently being demarcated. Nor is there any detail yet on what measures will be in place to prevent abuse of access to places where water is still available.

However, according to the City’s current plan, most of Cape Town’s 4-million citizens will have to fetch water from a PoD. The maximum allocation will be 25 litres per person per day, distributed on the assumption that an average family comprises four persons. There is a proposal that larger families should register and provide proof of additional numbers through identity documents. Registration of household numbers above four will also be essential for the punitive water tariffs for exceeding the water-use limits, which will accompany the level 6B water restrictions.

The City has not yet revealed details of how allocation will be managed at the collection points, but the current proposal is to do so on the basis of municipal accounts where the number of users would be registered, and the person collecting the water would have to provide proof of identification and the registered number of persons in the household.

A sophisticated system will be necessary to prevent water theft through “double dipping”. These logistics must still be resolved in the short time remaining.

Consider this scenario: If every family sends one person to fetch their water allocation, about 5,000 people will congregate at each POD every day. That creates a logistical nightmare of its own. In addition, it will be impossible for individuals to carry, by hand, 100 litres of water allocated for a family of four every day. So provision will have to be made for transport. The City has not yet given details of how the traffic will be managed. I am awaiting a full operations plan, including personnel requirements, security, infrastructure and budgets.

As things stand, the challenge exceeds anything a major City has had to face anywhere in the world since the Second World War or 9/11. I personally doubt whether it is possible for a city the size of Cape Town to distribute sufficient water to its residents, using its own resources, once the underground waterpipe network has been shut down.

We have to look at supplementary methods, in partnership with the many private sector corporations that deliver their products to the farthest reaches of this province, in every community, every day.

South African Breweries have been the first to step up to the plate. In a discussion this weekend, Mr Ricardo Tadeu, SAB’s Zone President for Africa, and Mr Des Jacobs, SABS Western Cape Regional Director, committed the Newlands brewery to fill 12-million quart bottles with water (instead of beer) from the famous spring (whose water is normally used to brew beer). The SAB network will deliver water to retail outlets in designated areas of greatest need over several weeks. The bottling of water will have to start as soon as possible to ensure sufficient stockpiles.

Work is well under way between SAB and the South African Bureau of Standards to ensure that the bottled water will meet the required quality standard. Production will begin soon, and the bottles, labelled “Water, Not for Sale”, will be delivered at outlets when Day Zero arrives. Consumers will pay R1 for each “quart” (as South Africans still refer to the large beer bottle) which is about three quarters of a litre, with a maximum limit per person. The R1 is the cost of the bottle’s deposit. The water itself is free. When the bottle is returned, empty, it will be replaced, full, at no charge.

We are in discussion with the South African National Defence Force to store water supplies at military bases for safety.

There is a lot more we must do in partnership with the extensive retail distribution networks to deliver water to places people routinely visit during the course of the day – like supermarkets and cafes. During the days ahead I will be meeting representatives of major retailers and courier companies to discuss details of an emergency water distribution network in order to provide a massive multiplier effect for the PoDs. We will work closely with the City’s team preparing for Day Zero. Together we will have to step up public communication massively, so that no one is in doubt about the threat the City faces.

Up till now, over 50% of residents have ignored entreaties to save water.

Apart from water distribution, there are many other foreseeable crises associated with dry taps, such as conflict over access to water, theft of water, and other criminal acts associated with water, not to mention the outbreak of disease.

Our Provincial Disaster Management team has been meeting weekly since January 2017, and daily since 8 November (with a short Christmas break) to work out a detailed plan for every provincial department in the case of this eventuality.

At our Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, we will meet a high-level delegation from the South African Police Service, to discuss their contingency plans for the run-up to and aftermath of Day Zero. In such a disaster, normal policing will be entirely inadequate.

Today (Monday morning), I will lead the Provincial Disaster Management team in discussions with National Disaster Management Centre, under the leadership of Dr Mmphaka Tau. This will not be our first discussion. We had an in-depth engagement in November 2017 to prepare for an eventuality we still hoped, at the time, would be possible to avoid. Tomorrow’s meeting will also be attended by the State Security Agency, the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, all at a very high level.

In order to deploy these national agencies, we need the co-operation of National Government, which would be greatly facilitated by the declaration of a national State of Disaster. I have therefore written to President Zuma, motivating why he should declare a national state of disaster, well before we hit Day Zero. That would enable the SSA, the SANDF and the SAPS to formulate a shared plan with ourselves and the private sector to distribute water, defend storage facilities, deal with potential outbreaks of disease, and keep the peace.

Even if we manage a disaster of this magnitude reasonably smoothly, our economy will take a terrible knock. It already has.

In November 2017, Wesgro, the Western Cape’s economic development and investment agency, facilitated a meeting with 40 major corporations in Cape Town, to discuss our approach to the water crisis.

The province’s economy is supported by two major water intensive sectors: tourism and agriculture. Between them, they employ about 600,000 people who (at a conservative estimate of four persons per household) support almost three-million people. One of our major priorities has been to keep them employed. The crisis associated with large-scale job losses and hunger would greatly exacerbate the catastrophe of dry taps.

Fortunately, both these sectors have been very pro-active, and have worked hard to cut water usage and keep people in jobs. Agriculture, under the leadership of Agri-Western Cape, immediately agreed to cut its allotted water take-off per farm by 40% – and now by 60%. They have trimmed buds off vines and trees to reduce the plants’ need for water, dividing farms up into sections that will still be irrigated, and those that will not. A fly-over reveals the brown, barren strips along those that can still get water. High technology systems, introduced by the Western Cape’s Department of Agriculture, can assist in saving significant amounts of water by targeting available irrigation in the right amount, exactly where it is need.

The province has allocated over R100-million to help keep people employed and provide feed for livestock, with a particular emphasis on new and emerging farmers. The rest of the agricultural industry, countrywide, has done everything possible to rally in support of drought-stricken farmers, sending feed and other support. Without them, our agricultural sector would have been far closer to collapse. This year, we are expecting the lowest harvest in decades, which will cause projected losses of R1-billion to the sector and deprive 50,000 seasonal workers of their jobs.

This also has a knock-on effect on agri-processing sub-sectors, such as fruit and vegetable processors, juicers and canners, who obtain most of their raw produce from the Western Cape, both in terms of reduced volumes and quality.

The hotel sector has also been innovative, reducing their water usage by 50% in comparison with the situation three years ago. They have removed plugs from baths (to force guests into showers fitted with low-flow showerheads), and emphasised the importance of saving water. Hotels on the Cape Town Foreshore, which have basements below sea level, have to pump out seawater constantly and return it to the sea. Now they are busy installing their own desalination plants, at great cost, so that they can use basement water for consumption. After a meeting with the tourism sector to discuss the drought last week, a major hotel group reported that their desalination systems, for hotel use, could be up and running within two months. So, we continue to encourage tourists to visit Cape Town. Leading hotels will ensure that their water preparedness will be communicated on their websites.

To relieve the pressure on the municipal water system, local residents who can afford it might well book into hotel rooms that have water security and spare bed capacity, for the duration of the crisis, where their water needs would be met independently of municipal water. At the same time this would help offset the industry’s anticipated losses due to international cancellations, as Day Zero looms larger.

The Department of Economic Development has, for many months, been running a focused programme, called Water for the Economy, working with a range of water-intensive sectors to find ways of saving water while remaining economically sustainable. One major building and renovation company, for example, has fitted water carts to their trucks, to carry non-potable water which is well-suited for most of the functions for which it is required.

There are many similar examples, across different sectors. Supported by Green Cape (with a mandate from the province and the City to ensure the green economy drives growth and jobs), businesses and municipalities are better managing their water use and finding alternative water sources. Much work has also been done to support companies in preparing their “business continuity plans” in the event of a Day Zero. We need the City’s private sector network to engage actively with all their employees to reduce water use and to understand the link between saving water and saving their jobs.

And what of the provincial government departments, particularly education and health, for which we are directly responsible?

Work began early in 2017 on “business continuity plans” to ensure that these facilities can continue functioning in the event of Day Zero. Most critical are hospitals and clinics, where our plans are far advanced. We have focused specifically on drilling boreholes, and by the time Day Zero arrives, all hospitals and clinics will have been secured to continue functioning.

Schools are also a key focus and a major challenge. It is essential to keep them open, both so that education can continue and that children can be kept safe at a very challenging time. There are over 900 schools in the Cape Town Metro, of which 423 have boreholes. Some of these produce potable water, and for the rest, plans are advanced to link borehole water to the schools’ sanitation reticulation system, which will then be cut off from municipal water. It is obviously essential to provide water to schools without boreholes. But this must still be finalised.

One option is to establish a system of “sub-PoDS” where tankers could collect water for distribution to key institutions, such as schools. And when the immediate crisis is over, we will have to institute a long-term programme of managed aquifer recharge, to put back the water we have extracted.

Every provincial government department has a detailed business continuity plan in the event of Day Zero.

But although it now looks likely, it is a worst-case scenario. We can still avoid Day Zero by the skin of our teeth if every consumer cuts water usage down to a maximum of 50 litres per day. Here is a diagram of what can be done with that amount of water.

No person in Cape Town should be flushing potable water down a toilet any more. At home, for example, we turned off the tap of the toilet’s cistern, store grey water in the bath, and scoop it out to fill the cistern when needed. No one should be showering more than twice a week now. There is nothing wrong with a daily scrub, using the old-fashioned “skottel en waslap” method, with which many of us grew up.

It will also be essential that the City’s water augmentation projects come on stream timeously, but these cannot save us from Day Zero in 2018, without a significant reduction in usage. If everything goes according to schedule, augmentation schemes will, by the end of April, produce between 120-million to 150-million litres per day – either from ground water extraction or from small-scale desalination. This figure falls into perspective when we consider our failure to bring consumption down below 500-million litres per day.

As the drought is likely to persist, we will have to go for large-scale desalination in the years ahead, and we are grateful to all those entrepreneurs and consortia who have come forward to make proposals in this regard. We will follow them all up, to supplement the planning and feasibility studies we have done to date, in order to make sure we find the best long-term solution, while following due process of law (including the complex tender regulations). And we will do whatever is possible to compel national government to fulfil its mandate of providing bulk water infrastructure and supply.

However, in the short term, there is only one solution: We have to save water as if our lives depend on it. Because they do. DM

Despite progress made over the past few decades, about 767 million people globally continue to live in extreme poverty, half of them in sub-Saharan Africa.

The majority of the world’s poor and hungry live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their survival. However, their livelihoods are often constrained by limited access to resources, services, technologies, markets and economic opportunities, lowering their productivity and income. Fast population growth, increasing conflicts, civil insecurity and climate change exacerbate the situation, as the poor are invariably the most vulnerable.

In 2013, the African Union convened a High-Level Meeting on Renewed Partnership for a Unified Approach to End Hunger in Africa and signed a declaration to end hunger on the continent by 2025, by sustaining the momentum behind the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). The outcome of this meeting was a precursor to the 2014 Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods. Amongst others, this Declaration committed to end hunger and malnutrition by 2025 and ensure mutual accountability for results through a biennial review and reporting progress.

The Inaugural Biennial Report reveals that commitment number 3, “Ending hunger by 2025”, is not on track, with a score of 1.62 compared to a benchmark of 3.17 in 2017.

The report is in line with the UN publication The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017, which recognized that despite a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. It also highlighted that this trend is closely associated with the increase in conflicts in Africa, exacerbated by climate-related shocks, drought and other factors that threaten to reduce the agricultural and livestock productivity of the African continent.

The warning sign that Africa needs to step up its efforts and find new ways working with its partners towards the ambition of ending hunger in Africa by 2025 is thus clear.

The commitment to end hunger was further strengthened by the adoption of the Africa 2063 Agenda, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, SDG 2 aims to “End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.” Several countries in Africa, as well as their regional economic entities, have made considerable progress to align agricultural and other policies, programmes and investments related to food security and nutrition with the Zero Hunger vision of the 2014 Malabo Declaration and SDG 2.

However, the continent as a whole faces considerable challenges in attaining these goals while facing low agricultural productivity, climate change and environmental degradation, as well as high youth unemployment. Recent estimates on food security and nutrition reveal that the prevalence of undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 20.8 percent in 2015 to 22.7 percent in 2016; in concrete terms, this amounts to about 224 million people who are undernourished, up from 200 million in 2015.

Ending hunger is both a moral and an economic imperative. With strategic concerted efforts, it is a dream that is possible by 2030. It is, therefore, important to keep up the momentum and redouble current efforts in a coordinated, integrated and aligned approach to enhance food security and curb malnutrition.

A renewed call for action

Key challenges in achieving the SDGs include addressing food insecurity and undernourishment in Africa. Doing so will require:","In 2013, the African Union convened a High-Level Meeting on Renewed Partnership for a Unified Approach to End Hunger in Africa and signed a declaration to end hunger on the continent by 2025, by sustaining the momentum behind the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

For Immediate Release

Americans -- who make up just 4 percent of the world’s population -- produce more than 30 percent of the planet’s waste, and the results are disastrous for our public health and the environment.

A new report released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund, Frontier Group, and Toxics Action Center, Trash in America: Moving from Destructive Consumption to a Zero-Waste System, details the effects of overconsumption in America, including water contamination, air pollution, habitat destruction, and global warming. The report also examines how good policies can minimize the proliferation of waste and incentivize reduction, repairs, reuse, recycling, and composting.

“The consequences of our disposable, single-use society are frightening, when you step back and consider the massive public health and environmental effects,” said Alex Truelove, director of U.S. PIRG’s Zero Waste Campaign. “There’s really no reason to handle waste the way we do. The vast majority is recyclable or compostable, and the remainder is repairable or reusable. We have the technology we need to create a zero-waste society, we just need the willpower.”

More than 65 percent of what we throw out in the United States is dumped in landfills or burned in incinerators. Landfills regularly leach hazardous liquids into drinking water supplies and incinerators emit carcinogenic pollutants and neurotoxins into the air. Millions of tons of plastic end up in the oceans too, harming and killing marine life.

To replace those discarded materials, we perpetuate a vicious cycle of mining, logging and clearing land for agriculture. An area the size of Mexico is farmed each year for food that is thrown away worldwide and about 900 million trees are cut down for U.S. paper and pulp mills every year. This system of extracting resources, producing goods, disposing of waste, and transporting materials accounts for 42 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

Right now, very few incentives exist for individuals and businesses to change their behavior. It’s often preferable for producers to make temporary and disposable goods so that consumers continually buy more, and if consumers pay a flat fee for garbage regardless of how much they throw out, there are no direct incentives to waste less.

“As a country, the United States currently only recycles and composts 35 percent of disposed materials. But proactive cities, states and even other countries are diverting 80 to 90 percent of materials from landfills and incinerators to recycling and composting -- showing that the U.S. can move toward zero waste too,” said Abi Bradford, Policy Analyst with Frontier Group and co-author of the report.

America has the tools to shift away from this harmful system to a “closed-loop” economy that produces zero waste. The report explores these solutions, including mandatory accessible recycling and composting, extended producer responsibility, bans on non-recyclable disposable items, right to repair laws, incentives for material innovation, and opposing the proliferation of landfills and incinerators.

“There is encouraging news,” concludes Truelove. “The actions and policies needed to reach zero waste exist, and they’re being implemented at city, state, country, and corporate levels. We just need to keep moving swiftly in the right direction nationwide.”","A new report released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund, Frontier Group, and Toxics Action Center, Trash in America: Moving from Destructive Consumption to a Zero-Waste System, details the effects of overconsumption in America, including water contamination, air pollution, habitat destruction, and global warming.

The title couldn’t be more straightforward. It is, on its face, a rigorous, uncannily meticulous account of the storied night raid, led by SEAL Team 6, on the Abbottabad compound in Pakistan, which culminated in a violent end to the 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden.

It’s the kind of account a reporter can only properly write long after the dust has settled on the event itself. Hollywood had already made multiple movies out of the story, including Kathryn Bigelow’s prestigious, expensive, Oscar-nominated Zero Dark Thirty, and the political machine had long since given it the requisite spin. This history is the pretext of Hersh’s reporting, which is as much a procedural account of the pivots in planning and intelligence leading up to the raid as it is a reckoning with the false fronts of a convenient, misleading political legend. “The killing was the high point of Obama’s first term, and a major factor in his re-election,” wrote Hersh. Much of what we thought we knew about the event turned out, according to Hersh and the retired senior U.S. official who provided the backbone of much of his story, to be false. “The White House’s story might have been written by Lewis Carroll.”

Some time after running Hersh’s piece, LRB ran a letter from a man named Francis X. Archibald, an octogenarian former Democratic politician from South Carolina:

Regarding Seymour Hersh’s story, the facts are these: 1. Osama bin Laden orchestrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America.

2. The CIA found out where he was living.

3. U.S. Navy SEALs killed him. End of story. Most Americans don’t give a flying f**k about the details of the venture.

In short: No one cares. Extended cut: We killed him. What else matters? The LRB’s editors responded that “Seymour Hersh’s piece [has] received more than 2 million page-views online”—in other words, Try again. Curiously, the following year, on the fifth anniversary of the Abbottabad raid, the CIA’s verified Twitter account live-tweeted the operation “as if it were happening today”—as if Hersh’s reporting hadn’t blown the lid off. The time-stamped tweets, supplemented with pictures of Obama and his furrow-browed staff watching the raid live from the Situation Room, received thousands of favorites and retweets. But they received even more replies, many of them deeply critical.

It appears many people do care to get the story of Osama bin Laden’s killing right, in part because, as Hersh and others have reminded us, the so-called War on Terror didn’t end with that victory, as was implicitly promised. The CIA’s lame Twitter reenactment was a reminder of the U.S. government’s predilection for making do with its broken promises. But there was no distracting from the fact the war had, to that point, been raging for 15 years—and that culture, writ large, was too willing to buy into the party line.

A movie like Zero Dark Thirty went a long way toward establishing that party line, in the first place. When it was released late in 2012, debates raged as to the meaning, purpose, accuracy, and danger of the movie, and of Hollywood retellings of recent political history more broadly. Was Zero Dark Thirty a nuanced apologia or merely a reckless one? (Its status as a political defense was generally taken for granted.) Suddenly, everybody was a sociopolitically minded movie critic. We’ve tended to think of this kind of pushback as an essential indicator of the now-common Oscar backlash cycle. Even before it was an Oscar nominee, Zero Dark Thirty was clearly an Oscar movie, having racked up strong reviews and honors from critics’ groups paired with the legacy success of its director, who in 2009, with The Hurt Locker, became the first woman to direct a movie honored with Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Other Oscar-nominated films made since 2012, including La La Land and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, have been subject to similar levels of scrutiny—albeit with lower stakes.

In the case of Zero Dark Thirty, the debate centered around the role movies play in our culture and their responsibility to the public, accordingly. “Zero Dark Thirty is a gorgeously-shot, two-hour ad for keeping intelligence agents who committed crimes against Guantánamo prisoners out of jail,” wrote Naomi Wolf in a first-person letter to Bigelow published in The Guardian. “It makes heroes and heroines out of people who committed violent crimes against other people based on their race–something that has historical precedent.” She likened Bigelow to Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl, a precisely chosen comparison: Reifenstahl is as much remembered for being an innovator of cinema as she is an apologist for reprehensible politics. Glenn Greenwald, too, had his say, claiming that Bigelow’s film “uncritically presents as fact the highly self-serving, and factually false, claims by the CIA that its torture techniques were crucial in finding bin Laden”—a fairly confident read from someone who admits, in the same essay, that he had not seen the movie. Michael Wolff—yes, that Michael Wolff—called the film “Homeland without the character quirks,” suggesting that despite its desire to appear journalistic, the movie tries to get away with claims and implications that a “nonfiction writer couldn’t do,” as if Zero Dark Thirty’s ostensible realism were the same as a claim to being nonfiction.

But much of the debate about Zero Dark Thirty was more substantial. It had been revealed that the CIA had willingly cooperated and even collaborated with Bigelow and her screenwriting partner, Mark Boal, in the making of the movie. This news dropped thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request on behalf of the conservative group Judicial Watch, which acquired emails between Pentagon and White House officials discussing their involvement with the project. News that the government had supplied Boal and Bigelow with information about the raid was taken to be, at best, a sign that Boal and Bigelow were necessarily beholden to the government’s version of events, and at worst, that Zero Dark Thirty was in fact altogether the government’s movie. It didn’t help that Boal is as much a journalist as a screenwriter, meaning that his script would automatically, even if unfairly, have the veneer of reported truth, nor did it help that the filmmakers themselves described the movie as a “hybrid of the filmic and the journalistic,” suggesting that its duty was not only to recount the events leading up the Abbottabad raid but, in the tradition of investigative reporting, to also reveal and advance new details about it.

So much of our misfortune as a nation can be attributed to the cottage industry of political narrative that it’s no wonder we can’t seem to wrestle with Zero Dark Thirty strictly on its own terms, as merely a movie. On the other hand, taking Zero Dark Thirty on its own terms means making sense of its ideology. No one who’d lived through Vietnam, to name one example, or who’d gotten a good education on any American war could be naive to the power of narrativized visual stories to shape national understanding, or to pull the wool over our eyes. Zero Dark Thirty was released just 19 months after the raid in Pakistan: It waded knowingly into a fraught slice of history just as that history was taking shape, and played a role, however hard to measure, in molding public understanding. Response to Zero Dark Thirty became an occasion to wrestle with the American myth-making machine, via Hollywood. It’d be difficult to claim this is unfair.

But it’s also difficult to take seriously the argument that representation is endorsement. I keep coming back to Glenn Greenwald’s provocative parenthetical disclaimer: “I have not seen this film and thus am obviously not purporting to review it; I am, instead, writing about the reaction to the film: the way in which its fabrications about the benefits of torture seem to be no impediment to its being adored and celebrated.” How can you detail a movie’s fabrications—which number plenty in even movies that strive for accuracy, being that they’re movies—without seeing it? Supplement this with Wolff’s hand-wringing over Bigelow’s film violating the standards of journalism and what you have is a conversation that takes Hollywood images at their word, and evaluates them accordingly.

Then again, let’s be honest: Most of us consume movies (and TV shows, and television news, the galaxy of recorded images on the internet, and other specifically visual forms of media) this way, and despite the many chances the 21st century has given us to improve upon this widespread image illiteracy, we seem stuck in our ways. To pose an entire argument against Zero Dark Thirty without seeing it, or even to see it while tethered to our own strict political predispositions, makes it difficult to afford nuance, not only to the images onscreen, but to what happens between those images, or outside of them, or to what happens when a smart filmmaker purposefully places those images in contradiction to each other. No movie is a blankly realistic representation of what it’s showing you onscreen, not even one meant to seem “journalistic”; every cut, every detail, every elision of time or space is a break with reality. Zero Dark Thirty points us somewhere a little thornier than an easy endorsement of torture. On the other hand, it isn’t an indictment. That’s the central difficulty of the movie.

The enduring fascination of Zero Dark Thirty, and a key to what makes its politics so strange, is that it doesn’t see its most dangerous ideas as matters of politics: It sees them as matters of procedure and personal might. In sly ways worthy of more discussion than they’ve gotten, the movie makes the hunt for bin Laden feel personal, not political. That attitude, rather than a strictly pro-torture one, is what I’ve lately found myself wrestling with. The film starts off by asking us to endure long, brutally graphic scenes of torture at black sites in Pakistan and elsewhere, scenes premised on thinking of enhanced interrogation as, at base, an exchange. “When you lie to me,” says an operative named Dan (Jason Clarke), “I hurt you.” Later: “Partial information will be treated as a lie.” What Dan says is borne out in his treatment of a detainee named Ammar (Reda Kateb), who is, over the course of more than a year, waterboarded, beaten, interrogated while forced to stand and sit in stress positions, and humiliated by being stripped nude in front of a woman. That woman is Maya (Jessica Chastain), the central character of the movie, who’s based on a real-life active agent, and whose desire to kill bin Laden on her own terms eventually overwhelms the movie.

Initially, these abject, brutal early scenes feel like straightforward retribution for the 9/11 attacks, which open the movie: Bigelow bombards us with a nauseating mix of distraught calls to the police and loved ones from people in the towers and on the planes, played over a blank, black screen before the story starts. Torture immediately follows. Then the scene of a terrorist attack—the 2004 Khobar massacre—then more ostensible gathering of intel from detainees, then another attack—the 2005 Tavistock Square bus bombing, which was one of four bombs to go off in London that day—then more gathering of information. The pattern continues just so, as if to suggest that the gathering of intel via torture is frustrated by continued failure: It doesn’t save anyone and gets the CIA nowhere. For Maya, the central failure is in her inability to nail down one of Osama bin Laden’s supposed couriers, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Her eventual success in tracking this man is, it’s true, partly the result of intel culled from years of torturing detainees. But the extent to which torture “works” in this movie is tempered with all the incidents in which it doesn’t—including in one of the film’s most dramatic scenes, a reenactment of the 2009 bombing at Camp Chapman which, in the movie’s rendering, kills one of Maya’s closest colleagues.

This, plus Maya’s immediate experiences with being attacked, are what make the movie shift away from being “about the CIA” toward being about one agent, and her own mission. By the time Maya is really on bin Laden’s tail, torture—to hear the CIA agents in the movie tell it, anyway—is verboten. Obama has forsworn it; it just doesn’t play well on the world stage. Terrorist violence, however, has long since crept into Maya’s life. It is no longer a news bulletin or a historical abstraction. She’s lost friends; she herself has survived a bombing and a barrage of bullets. And she’s soaked it all up and thrown it back into her work. By the time all of this happens, the rhythmic back and forth between interrogation and reenactment has been broken, and all that is left is Maya, and her hunger. The hunt for bin Laden no longer feels like the ritualized misexecution of overwrought interrogation tactics. It is powered, instead, by a singular thirst for personal payback, proffered by a woman who, as the movie sees it, practically has to force the country’s hand to get what she wants. President Obama, who hovers just outside the movie, never fully materializing, seems halfway reluctant. Maya is a zealot, by comparison.

Boal’s script seems unambiguous on this front. Maya is given lines like “I’m gonna kill bin Laden” and “A lot of my friends died trying to do this. I believe I was spared so I could finish the job.” To the men of SEAL Team 6, describing the Abbottabad compound, she says, “Bin Laden is there. And you’re gonna kill him for me.” She’s a character defined by the singularity of her vision and effort, which makes it hard to see her as a metaphor for the rest of us. Maya is Maya. The workplace drama of it all, with Maya reminding her boss every day that they still haven’t killed bin Laden, makes it feel like a Sisyphean one-woman effort, a fight to nudge the entire presidential administration into action through persistence and smarts. The administration, which still has the Iraq WMD debacle in its rearview, is comparatively muted; you get the sense from this movie that, so far as Maya is concerned, being resistant to torture and action on the bin Laden front is a sign of over-cautiousness, and that over-cautiousness is what puts American lives in danger.

But again, what’s fascinating is that the government’s cautiousness frustrates not only a bigger political need, but also Maya’s ability to get payback. Rooting for Maya entails rooting for the apparatus of the state—the practice of torture, above all. What’s unclear is whether, independent of Maya, the movie would feel so aligned with the CIA’s methods that it’d still depict them with such care were she, or a character with her display of might, not here. It reminds me of one of the film’s eeriest images, in the offices of the CIA, in which Maya’s shadow gets cast across a framed American flag. It’s a single shadow: Just hers. Even as you sense it’s a shadow that hangs over the entirety of the nation, the movie doesn’t make it easy to imagine “the nation”: All it gives us is her.

None of this is to say that Zero Dark Thirty doesn’t tempt misreads on the part of the audience—if anything, the opposite. The movie is only too eager to confound easy explanations: That is what makes it formidable, powerful, and prone to problematic and complex interpretations, of the sort that one-note backlash debates don’t really have the capacity to generate. Nothing in the movie sums this up as neatly as its final scene. After bin Laden is killed, Maya boards a military plane and prepares to travel back home. She is alone. Chastain, in a fine display of all the weary moral uncertainty undergirding the movie, is overtaken by a blank, exhausted expression. It closes the movie. You might read that last image as, “Is it worth it?” Certainly Maya doesn’t look as relieved as you might expect, and in that regard, she is the rest of us, over time. The war on terror didn’t end with this event. But what remains fascinating is that this is a question pitched, again, toward the individual. Is it worth it for whom—Maya, or the country? The United States falls out of view in the final moments of Zero Dark Thirty. The Abbottabad compound disappears, the soldiers disappear, CIA procedure disappears. Maya is all that’s left.","A movie like Zero Dark Thirty went a long way toward establishing that party line, in the first place.

The aircraft, unique in Europe, has been adapted to perform parabolic flights that enables the plane to rise 50 degrees, then making it descend in the same way, to recreate the conditions of weightlessness.

These flights, specifically for scientific research, are sometimes open to the general public.

After winning the premiership and not making the finals the next year, it’s easy to say that their season was a failure. In a season that was ridiculed by injuries, the hunger that saw them win the flag in 2016 was far too inconsistent in 2017.

The premiership defence was in full swing as the Dogs won five of their first seven games of the season. In this run however, they were everything but convincing, struggling to put away North Melbourne and Brisbane, while they were able to beat eventual finalists Sydney and Richmond.

The next eight games saw the Dogs lose six and only win two as the wheels looked like they were falling off in the premiership defence. After a four-game winning streak, to leave the Dogs at 11-8, there hopes of making it into September was dashed, with losses to GWS, Port Adelaide and Hawthorn to end the season.

One of the biggest problems for the Bulldogs last year was their inefficiency in the forward line. The recruitment of Travis Cloke was a bust, while Tom Boyd struggled to show even a glimpse of the form that he showed on grand final day in 2016. Stewart Crameri and Tory Dickson were way too inconsistent, while the form, fitness and attitude shown by Jake Stringer eventually led to him being shown the door come trade period.

The Dogs were in the bottom four for scoring last year, while their tackle count dropped from the 5th best in the competition to the 10th best. In order to combat this, key midfielders had to spend time down forward, which resulted in a dramatic drop in their clearance numbers, which was a strong asset in 2016 for the Bulldogs.

Off Season Grade

In: Jackson Trengove, Hayden Crozier, Josh Schache, Aaron Naughton (Pick 9), Ed Richards (Pick 6), Callum Porter (Pick 74)

Out: Jake Stringer, Matthew Boyd, Robert Murphy, Travis Cloke, Stewart Crameri

Off season Grade: B+

Former number two draft pick Josh Schache comes to the Kennel with high hopes he can drastically improve a poor forward line last year. Along with Jackson Trengove, who can either play back, forward or even ruck, they both should add a different dimension to the Dogs. Hayden Crozier, a long time target for the Dogs arrives in a bid to aid the forward line. Jake Stringer is a big loss for the Dogs considering the form he is capable of, but considering his attitude and motivation last year along with his form, maybe a move for both parties was beneficial.

Defining Period

The bulldogs have a pretty fovourable draw this season. They play three of their first four games at Etihad Stadium, where they also get to play two games at their new adopted home in Ballarat. They get to play four games on Friday night while also playing double up games against Carlton and North Melbourne. In a surprising move by the AFL, the Dogs were stripped of playing on Good Friday after only one year.

Before the bye this season, the Bulldogs only have to play outside of Victoria three times. They travel to Canberra in a match against traditional rivals GWS, whilst also travelling to Perth to face Fremantle and and Adelaide to play the Crows. Other then that they will play their remaining games at Etihad Stadium. Within this stretch pre the bye, the Dogs have winnable games against West Coast, Fremantle, Carlton, Gold Coast, Brisbane and Collingwood. If they can be 6-5 or even 7-5 going into the last 11 games of the season, finals may be on the horizon.

Round 1 GWS Giants, UNSW Canberra Oval (Away)

Round 2 West Coast Eagles, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Round 3 Essendon, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Round 4 Sydney Swans, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Round 5 Fremantle, Perth Stadium (Away)

Round 6 Carlton, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Round 7 Gold Coast, Mars Stadium (Home)

Round 8 Brisbane Lions, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Round 9 Adelaide Crows, Adelaide Oval (Away)

Round 10 Collingwood, Etihad Stadium (Away)

Round 11 Melbourne, Etihad Stadium (Home)

Champion Data Suggests…

Champion Data suggests that the drop off last year started with the dip in form from their top 10 players. Nine of their top 10 players were down on their 2016 form. Only Mitch Wallis increased his output. Champion Data also highlights the dip in key statistical measures that the Bulldogs prided themselves on in 2016. Their kicking differential, handball differential, disposal differential, contested possession differential, time in forward half, inside 50 differential, goals per inside 50 and shot at goal kick rating were all down. Bulldogs ability to trap the ball in their forward line was significantly less while there forwards didn’t deliver.

Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths: The Bulldogs’ strength lies within their players aged in between 21-24. They have eight players within this age bracket, but more importantly the quality of this ranks 6th best in the league. In the midfield, they have eight players, with seven of them qualifying for relative rating. Six of these players are rated positively with Lin Jong breaking even. Marcus Bontempelli, Toby McLean, Caleb Daniel, and Lachie Hunter all rank in the top 35 percent of there age bracket and position, while Bailey Dale and Jack McCrae both rank as average but have a positive rating.

Overall, they have a pretty good list. Champion Data ranks the Bulldogs’ general defenders as the 3rd best in the league, whilst also ranking their mid-forwards and midfielders as the 4th best in the league. The Dogs will be heavily relying on their small to medium size players to help them propel back up the ladder. A similar tactic to the way Richmond played last year could be on the cards.

Weaknesses: The Bulldogs forward line was very weak and powerless last season. Liam Picken and Jake Stringer were the leading goal kicker with 24, the lowest tally by any club in 2017 and the lowest for the Bulldogs since 1989. They have lost Stringer, delisted Crameri and Cloke has retired. They have brought in Josh Schache, to add a focal point to the forward line, however he is still yet to blossom into a key forward. The Dogs will be desperately hoping he can perform and show his potential that he showed as a junior.

Bulldogs’ high conversion rate from forward 50 entries were the highlight in 2016, but their lowlight in 2017. The Dogs were ranked 18th in the competition for goals per inside 50 and 18th for shot on goal rating.

The Bulldogs’ inability to win a one on one contest is also a massive weakness hence the recruitment of defender Jackson Trengove. In defensive one-on-one contests, the Bulldogs have the second worse mark loss percentage, and the worst mark win percentage.

Prediction

11th

Can Luke Beveridge replicate his 2016 form? He has the quality players but do they still have the drive and commitment needed to succeed. With Marcus Adams returning in defence, alongside new recruit Jackson Trengove, a formidable defence could be formed. The emergence of key defence prospect Lewis Young alongside Easton Wood, Shane Biggs and Dale Morris could mean the Dogs will be hard to score against this season. Jack Macrae, Mitch Wallis and Lachie Hunter are vital to the teams chances to help shoulder the load off Marcus Bontempelli. Josh Schache will add another dimension alongside their small forward brigade spearheaded by Picken and Daniel. If Jason Johannisen can overcome a tag, he could go to the next level.

We have them finishing in 11th, but anywhere between 8th and 12th could be decided by a win or two.

Previous: Brisbane Lions, Gold Coast Suns, Carlton, North Melbourne, Fremantle, Collingwood, Hawthorn, St Kilda","The premiership defence was in full swing as the Dogs won five of their first seven games of the season.

In his new book, A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment and Zero Net Carbon Emissions, Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Muhammad Yunus proposes social business as a way to reshape many facets of the modern world. As the creator of the Grameen Bank and a pioneer of the field of microcredit, Yunus has helped low-income people around the world empower themselves through locally-rooted entrepreneurship.

Yunus makes it clear that he finds the very founding premises of capitalism to be the root cause of the growing economic and social inequality being experienced around the world. Only through a conscious effort to restructure the economic thinking that governs the world does he believe that we can reverse this destructive trend.

Yunus argues that employing a model of social business could be the solution to this inequitable system. Social business organizations run counter to capitalist assumptions about the very purpose of business itself. Rather than serving as simply a means to maximize corporate profits, social businesses strive to create sustainable solutions to pressing issues in society. Through Yunus’ framework for social business, this movement hopes to create a “world of three zeros”: a world with no poverty, no unemployment, and no net carbon emissions. Packed with a plethora of real examples of social businesses functioning around the world, the book presents a hopeful picture for how dedicated individuals can create a lasting impact on society.

Social Business

Yunus is a trailblazer when it comes to encouraging entrepreneurship globally. He first gained international recognition for his Grameen Bank in his home country of Bangladesh. Recognizing the challenges faced by poor women in his country when it came to securing credit, Yunus began the Grameen Bank to provide small loans to promote rural entrepreneurship. The bank defied conventional banking, working in small villages, focusing on women, and forsaking any use of collateral. Despite, or perhaps because of, these radical differences, the Grameen Bank has found remarkable success. The bank has grown to serve 9 million women every year, lending over US$2.5 billion, and incredibly maintains a nearly 100% repayment rate. This remarkable phenomenon seems to be the foundation of Yunus’ tremendous trust in the innate good of human nature and the fairly radical idea that nearly all businesses can be economically feasible, even successful, while still focusing their primary resources on promoting positive social change.

Yunus intends to create an entire ‘social business sector’ made up of companies that follow these principles. As he defines it, a social business is simply “a non-dividend company dedicated to solving human problems.” In practice, once a company has paid off its startup loans, the business structure is such that all profits flow back into improving and expanding the business. Success is not measured by dividends paid to board members, but by the amount of people who are reached and helped. Through the promotion of social business, Yunus hopes to bring about a future of three zeroes.

Zero Poverty

Yunus argues that to solve poverty, society needs to reframe its view that capitalism is the best economic framework. He provides plenty of data to support his claim that modern capitalism has contributed to the growing level of income inequality. A relatively tiny amount of the global population holds an astronomically large share of global wealth. It is well-documented that poverty typically becomes a reinforcing cycle, as the physical and mental consequences of being poor lead to fewer educational and employment opportunities and worse health outcomes. Yunus hopes that through social business and promoting entrepreneurship, this unequal flow of wealth can be reversed.

Yunus discusses the case of Uganda, which many Westerners will be surprised to learn is the nation with the highest rate of entrepreneurship in the world. More than 28% of all Ugandans have started a business in the last three and a half years, and 80% are expected to start a business at some point in their lives. One social business there, Golden Bees, offers supplies and training to help Ugandan farmers learn the skills required for beekeeping. The farmers are able to develop increasing economic independence and Golden Bees stays sustainable by helping to process and market the farmers’ products. Social businesses like this are now working with entrepreneurs across the world, in developing countries like Uganda and Bangladesh but also in wealthy nations like France and the United States, where inequality still exists on a large scale. The French Action Tank in France works to identify and target the country’s poor, who may be harder to immediately identify than in poorer countries. Similar projects are being incubated in India and Brazil as well.

It is a compelling case that people in the developing world are in fact more predisposed to entrepreneurship when one considers the millions employed in micro-entrepreneurial ventures in the informal economy, which encompasses more than 60% of the labor force in many developing countries. By removing the barriers to entrepreneurship faced by poor people and shifting the narrative around ‘informal’ or ‘grey market’ employment, Yunus believes poor individuals can economically empower themselves and radically improve their lives.

Zero Unemployment

The second core issue that Yunus identifies, is an unnecessary reliance on others for employment. The view that we depend on others for employment limits the potential of individuals and puts them in a tenuous position in society. People, especially young people, who spend several years unemployed or underemployed tend to face lifelong consequences in terms of income and job security. Yunus suggests that unemployment is not a problem of individuals but of a system that encourages reliance on job markets rather than job creation. Social businesses can help encourage entrepreneurship and financial independence and thus alleviate the problem of unemployment for populations that conventional markets often fail to reach, like the rural poor. The model can also help employ those who may be otherwise traditionally overlooked in formal employment opportunities, like poor women, former prisoners, or those lacking formal education. Local, small-scale social businesses also help stem wealth inequality trends by preserving wealth within a community. Yunus asserts that microcredit and social business development can help turn people from job seekers into job creators, all while addressing important social needs.

Zero Net Carbon

Finally, Yunus hopes to use social business to address global climate change. Contemporary debates over climate change policy often center on the balance between supporting economic growth and protecting the environment, especially for developing nations. Yunus, in the relentlessly positive tone he maintains throughout the book, suggests that these two goals need not conflict. Sustainable business strategies can grow economies while being environmentally responsible. What is more, the youthful nature of developing country economies make them inherently well-positioned to embrace sustainable business in their path to growth.

He points out several new businesses focused on sustainability that are using the social business framework to protect the environment and support their communities. Social businesses are helping to bring solar energy to rural Bangladesh, reforest Haiti through the production of forest-based goods, and reduce plastic waste accumulation in Uganda. Because they are unconstrained by profit-maximizing agendas, social businesses often have greater flexibility in addressing environmental challenges.

Yunus sees this third goal as of equal importance as zero poverty and zero unemployment, as the impact of climate change is historically felt most strongly by the world’s poor. Through no fault of their own, the poor suffer the most from society’s inaction on climate change. With this in mind, Yunus insists that all social businesses must be environmentally sustainable to ensure that they are not fixing one problem while contributing to another.

Broader Goals

Even those who are not directly involved in social business themselves can help reach the “world of three zeros.” Yunus suggests a series of ways to accomplish this global change:

In the face of massive global challenges like widespread poverty, income inequality, and climate change that are intensifying every day, A World of Three Zeros is a refreshingly positive and propositive read. Yunus is able to break down a somewhat radical concept—that global society would be better served by an alternative economic system—into actionable goals and strategies for achieving them. What the book’s inspiring outlook perhaps fails to fully address is how the greed and corruption of a powerful few can limit the impact of many positive actors, and how to effectively counter such a seemingly overpowering barrier. For each talented young person eschewing the corporate sector for social entrepreneurship, there is also a significant level of buy-in from entrenched politicians and profit-maximizing corporations. Yunus addresses this issue in chapters about good governance and financial infrastructure, by highlighting the Giving Pledge taken by 150 of the world’s wealthiest people. While this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, a peek at today’s priorities of governments in many of the world’s largest countries leaves some doubts about the capitalist system being modifiable in any meaningful way in the near future.

Yunus, to his credit, maintains his inspiring message throughout and looks only to the future, which he feels is an age of great possibilities, propelled by the immense wealth, potential, and creativity of the modern world. For anyone feeling bogged down by the diversity and scale of global problems in 2018, A World of Three Zeros can provide both an overarching framework and some concrete ideas to make positive change happen at both the local and global levels.","Clique aqui para PortuguêsIn his new book, A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment and Zero Net Carbon Emissions, Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Muhammad Yunus proposes social business as a way to reshape many facets of the modern world.

With the airing of it’s second to last episode, Channel Zero: Butcher’s Block brought one of the series’ core themes really into focus. In Candle Cove, Mike Painter had to reconcile with his brother’s death to save his daughter’s life. In No-End House, Margot Sleater and Jules Koja had to let go of their grief to be free of the No-End House. And in Butcher’s Block, Zoe and Alice will have to decide they want to embrace their mother’s legacy of mental instability or embrace their surrogate father’s legacy of death.

In essence, each of the series’ protagonists have been offered a kind of immortality. They were given the option to live without the inevitable pain and loss that comes with growing older. But the price of an immutable existence has always been incredibly high. For Mike, it would’ve meant sacrificing his own child and the children of others. For Margot and Jules, it would’ve meant feeding the house their memories and the memories of others. And for Zoe and Alice, it means literally having to devour others to survive. In each of Channel Zero’s worlds, you can live forever but not as a human being. To be free death, you have to give up something essential about being alive.

And while Mike, Margot, and Zoe seem to understand and embrace the idea that it’s fundamentally wrong to harm everyone to save yourself, I’m not so sure about Alice. And that uncertainty is absolutely thrilling.

I am an architect, they call me a butcher

“The Red Door” began in Butcher’s Block with Chief Vancyk (Tyrone Benskin) struggling with having cut his son’s throat. His wallow in misery was interrupted by Aldous (Bradley Sawatzky), who wanted to know where his brother Robert was. In the Andrew Wyeth-like realm of the Peaches, Zoe (Holland Roden) overheard the family argue about the fact that they had promised Izzy (Linden Porco) to someone, but had recently lost her. She also encountered a beautiful red door, behind which was something great and terrible.

One thing I really enjoy about Channel Zero is the way it unfurls its mythology. In this episode, we got to see the creature the Peaches worship and some information about its nature. In their estimation, it’s God. An understandable assessment as it provides them with long lifespans, incredible resistance to injury and beautiful place to live. But if it is a god, it is not a loving one. It demands human sacrifice in exchange for its gifts and communion with it inspires an unspeakable hunger in its worshipers. And given the antediluvian nature of its sacraments, its existence likely predates the rise of the Abrahamic faiths.

All of those details about the Peaches’ savior have been doled out in tantalizing drips and drabs, not large chunks of bland exposition. Creator Nick Antosca and his collaborators have given us just enough to follow the narrative, but not so much as to lose us in minutia. Increasingly, genre filmmakers and showrunners have become obsessed with making their mythologies feel weighty and portentous by adding unnecessary detail. But I think that approach leads to diminishing returns. Ultimately, too much articulation makes a fictional world’s contradictions and discontinuities more readily apparent. When it comes to the impossible and unknowable, I prefer the Channel Zero’s less is more approach.

I am a pioneer, they call me primitive

In Butcher’s Block, Aldous and his creatures went on the hunt after discovering Luke (Brandon Scott) wasn’t in Robert grave. Back at her place, Louise (Kirsha Fairchild) stitched Luke’s throat up. At the Peach mansion, Alice (Olivia Luccardi) told Zoe she knew the price of sanity and was willing to pay it. Later, Alice found Izzy hiding in one of the mansion’s walls. Back in our world, Louise saw that Aldous had arrived and hid Luke in her basement. Just as Aldous and his creatures were closing, Chief Vancyk decided to kill them all to save his son.

Another thing I really enjoy about Channel Zero is that it doesn’t sacrifice characterization for the sake of the plot. While this episode did a lot of necessary table setting for next week’s finale, it didn’t do so at the expense of its protagonists. Nobody did anything just because the plot needed them to do it. Writers Mallory Westfall, Justin Boyd and Nick Antosca dedicated enough real estate to main characters’ inner lives to keep the story grounded even as its narrative grew increasingly fantastic.

While both the Butcher’s Block and Peach estate threads were given a lot of nuances, the emotional weight of the terrestrial material was especially impactful. The episode did a great job showing the aftermath of Chief Vancyk’s betrayal. It was captivating to see the Chief buckle under the weight of his sins and to see how it shook up Luke’s entire sense of identity. And it was immensely satisfying to see that Louise and Luke had formed a real bond in the wake of the horror they’ve experienced. And it’s important to note that in addition to being extraordinarily well-written, the Butcher’s Block-set scenes also featured season-best performances from Fairchild, Scott, and Benskin.

I am purity, they call me perverted

Later, the Chief and Louise dismembered Aldous and the creatures’ bodies. In the other dimension, Alice gave up Izzy after Joseph assured her they don’t eat children. However, Edie (Diana Bentley) and a thankfully genital-less meat monster brought the girl to the red door. Afterward, the Peaches held a ceremony wherein Joseph removed Alice’s madness. Fed up, Zoe retrieved Izzy from beyond the red door and brought back to the world we know. But instead leaving with the girl, Zoe stayed behind to get Alice.

Zoe confronted Alice about Izzy’s whereabouts but Alice was lost in post-operative euphoria. Disturbed by the change in her sister, Zoe ate Alice’s madness to get back to the way she used to be. In Butcher’s Block, Luke shot his father after he proposed leaving the town and abandoning its people. In the mansion, Alice nonchalantly mentioned that Zoe probably returned home with Izzy. Zoe did, in fact, flee back down the staircase. After confirming that Izzy was gone, Joseph promised God he would get her back.

As with every other installment of Channel Zero this season, the episode was full of arresting imagery. With all the flesh-slicing and pulsating meat, “The Red Door,” was undeniably the series most viscerally unsettling chapter. Still, the episode had more going on than just an unusually intense presentation of gore. It seemed that Director Arkasha Stevenson and cinematographer Isaac Bauman made Butcher’s Block and the Peaches’ realm look fantastic and visually distinct as always but they also did interesting things with the world beyond the red door. Given the frequent use of abrupt zooms and opulent in that setting, that particular space had a strong Kubrickian vibe.

I know I believe in nothing but it’s my nothing

Previously, the final act of every season of Channel Zero has started with one its main characters taking a leap into the fantastic. Mike had to enter the world of Candle Cove to confront his brother. Jules reentered House World to rescue her best friend Margot. Butcher’s Block both conformed to and deviated from that pattern. On the one hand, Alice chose to commit herself to the Peaches and their dark faith. On the other, Zoe rejected it, both in reabsorbing her madness and by returning to the real world.

As such, it’s really hard to say where things will go from here. Obviously, the Wood sisters, Louise and Luke will have to have some kind of final reckoning with the Peaches. But given that our protagonists don’t share a unity of purpose, it’s hard to be optimistic about their chances. Although Alice came to Butcher’s Block to help her sister and other troubled people, she ended up finding personal deliverance. Given her extreme fear of losing her sanity, it’s hard to see her giving up her “blessing.”

Louise, Luke, and Zoe were all strong enough to resist because they had strong links to our world. For Louise and Luke, that link was their mutual desire to save their city. For Zoe, it was saving Izzy. But for Alice, schizophrenia and a lifetime being the only sane member of her family have greatly frayed her connection to humanity. And as Louise noted when talking about her experience with her own mentally ill sibling, “a person can only give so much, then they got nothing left to go around.”

This wasn’t a requirement put forth by showrunner Nick Antosca, but something that Stevenson did to get into the right mindset. ""I don't know if there was a thought process for me,” she recently admitted to VICE. “I was watching everything and anything that's inspiring. I grew up on classic horror… so that was very natural. No matter what we were making, I would be watching.""

Butcher’s Block tells the story of two sisters, Alice (Olivia Luccardi) and Zoe (Holland Roden), who move to a small town and end up connected to the mysterious Peach family, a once-elite clan that died off and left the town in ruin. As Alice and Zoe soon discover, the Peaches are alive—and living off of human flesh. Cannibalism, cosmic monsters, and stark set pieces abound. And as with past seasons of Channel Zero, the show conjures the specific effects of the artists and films that inspired it. VICE spoke with Stevenson about her influences and compiled a guide to the season's creepiest references.

Cannibal Holocaust

Right out of the gate, real fans of the cannibalism genre will know that what’s coming ain't pretty. The very first episode opens with “Crucified Woman” by Riz Ortolani, the main theme popularized by the 1980 exploitation film Cannibal Holocaust. Outside of anything involving zombies or Dr. Hannibal Lecter—we’ll get to him—it’s one of the most famous films about eating humans, and also one of the most controversial. To reference it in the first few minutes of Butcher's Block is some serious foreshadowing.

Hannibal

Bryan Fuller's three-season NBC drama might as well be a companion piece to Butcher’s Block. For one, Antosca himself was a writer and producer on Hannibal and brought specific things he learned over to Channel Zero. When it comes to food, for example, the closer to human the ingredients are, the more appetizing they're made to look. Stevenson explained that her crew made a concerted effort to make normal foods look unappetizing, while ""long pig"" looked gourmet. “[The food in the Peach household] has to be beautiful and inviting and lush and you want to have to be there. You want to be there,” Stevenson explained. “There has to be a temptation to join the Peaches, otherwise it's not evil and sinister.” On a visceral level, this allows the audience to understand Alice and Zoe's motivations, just as it did for criminal profiler Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) in Hannibal.

Joel-Peter Witkin

American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin's work skirts the line between a freak show and a graveyard. You might recognize him as the guy who takes photos of intricately-styled and posed corpses. As Stevenson described it, his work is ""very macabre but also very beautiful at the same time."" ""I wanted my photographs to be as powerful as the last thing a person sees or remembers before death,"" Witkin has said in the past. For Stevenson, the MO was to “take the macabre imagery and [make] it aesthetically appealing.""

Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives

One of Stevenson’s biggest personal influences for her work on Butcher’s Block was Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul's 2010 film, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. The first Thai film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, Uncle Boonmee features supernatural events such as a woman getting eaten out by a catfish, depicted matter-of-factly.

Stevenson described Weerasethakul's style as akin to “a malaria fever dream” and wanted to blend “social realism with a surrealistic aesthetic""—at least in the first episode. “The surrealistic aesthetic, almost like a virus, takes over, and images like a homunculus child eating a cat needed to feel natural to us. We looked at a lot of imagery that led us into the hyper-real very seamlessly.”

David Lynch

Beyond the Twin Peaks creator's generally unsettling vibe, some pervasive images popularized by Lynch made their way into Butcher’s Block. Take the creature that crawls out of Alice’s brain, which Stevenson refers to as “Father Time,"" for instance: It certainly bears a striking resemblance to Eraserhead's Lady in the Radiator, with her swollen papier-mâché cheeks and jerky movements.

“It was one of the things I couldn't really visualize,"" Stevenson recalled, ""and then we're on set and this thing stands up and it’s so deranged and so frightening. I was almost discovering how frightening it was as we filmed it.""

Thirst

Park Chan-Wook's Thirst, which came out after the Korean director's Vengeance trilogy (Oldboy, anyone?), stars a priest who turns into a vampire and struggles with his newfound hunger for human blood. Watching Zoe struggle with her taste for human flesh in Butcher’s Block evokes much of the same tragic sentiment, especially as we watch her cut meat from her own leg to ease her pain. For Stevenson, the struggle was all in how Chan-Wook utilized the camera: “The camera is a character in itself. It has a life of its own,” she explained. Bon appetit!

The online supermarket said an efficient supply chain helped it deliver almost every item of food it handled to customers, while also increasing the time they had to consume it before it went off. Just one in 6,000 lines are currently going to waste.



Three distribution centres meant less chance of waste than hundreds of stores, Ocado said, pointing to temperature control as an example, with whole sections of the customer fulfilment centres refrigerated.



The retailer said it used “bespoke software” which “calculates how to pack items to reduce product damage and decrease food waste”’.



It worked with suppliers to ensure products were packaged suitably for the “highly automated hotbeds of technology” they would pass through in one of the fulfilment centres, a spokeswoman added.

Meanwhile the company was also making efforts to give customers more time to consume food, with a recent chilled and bakery project increasing shelf life at home by over 50% for two thirds of the range.



“Our business model is built around efficiency and low waste,” said Ocado head of corporate responsibility Suzanne Westlake.



“By continually improving our technology, processes and our relationships with suppliers, we’ve been able to reduce our food waste to practically zero - I believe we have the lowest total food waste figures in our industry.”



Ocado supply chain operations manager Dan Kelly added: “Fresh products like meat or bakery items have a very short shelf life. We’ve been working hard with our suppliers and internally to help give customers more time at home to enjoy their food.



“By testing and tweaking the packaging on our mince, for example, we’ve been able to promise customers an extra two days of shelf life in their fridge - that’s on top of the three days we already promise.”



Helen White, special advisor on household food waste at WRAP, said: “Currently the average family of four waste the equivalent of £60-worth of food every month. Having the support of leading retailers such as Ocado is vital in the fight against food waste and crucial if we are to reduce the 7.3 million tonnes of food wasted every year from UK homes.”","Ocado has achieved near-zero levels of food waste with just 0.02% of the products it processses wasted.

Specifically, Tokyo will encourage target facilities of the Cap-and-Trade Program (total emission reduction obligation and emission trading scheme) that came into effect in April 2010 to donate CO2 credits (excess reduction credits) acquired through energy conservation efforts.

Carbon credits will offset the approximately 720,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide expected to be emitted over the four days on which the ceremonies will be held.

The Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program is the first such program to be adopted in Japan, and requires approximately 1,300 facilities which consume large amounts of energy to reduce CO2 emissions.

The characterising feature of this urban program is the inclusion of office buildings. In fiscal 2015, the facilities achieved a reduction in emissions of 26 per cent from the base year, and total retention of CO2 credits amounts to approximately 10 million tons.

By making Tokyo carbon-free for four days, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government takes a step forward in achieving sustainability, an important theme of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.

In fact, some locations of the high-end chain, which has locations throughout China, have one Michelin star. But, the new New York City outpost earns no stars from New York Times critic Pete Wells, who dropped a goose egg on the much-hyped restaurant today.

DaDong opened in New York in December. After news that chef-owner Dong Zhenxiang would be opening the first DaDong outside of China, eager New York diners snagged 2,500 reservations within the first two hours they became available, booking the restaurant through February. But, when Wells dined there, the duck — DaDong’s star menu item — “made very little impression at all.”

Wells writes in his zero-star review that although the Peking duck skin was crisp, “Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor.” He adds, “It was dry, too.”

The menu overall, which is more concise than the one served in Beijing, is “rife with dishes that are dead on arrival.” And although Wells approves of the presentation of many of the dishes, they only occasionally live up to their appearances.

Although it’s not the New York Times critic’s most scathing review — desserts and the wine list were high points — Wells couldn’t give a Peking duck restaurant with flavorless Peking duck more than a “satisfactory” zero stars, despite its stars elsewhere.

In celebration of St. Patrick’s Day this past weekend, Syfy dropped the out-of-nowhere announcement that a brand new installment in the *original* Leprechaun franchise is set to debut on the network next March, presumably on/around St. Patrick’s Day 2019. Titled Leprechaun Returns, it’s a 25-years-later sequel to the original film.

Most exciting of all, the new sequel is written by Suzanne Keilly (“Ash vs Evil Dead”) and directed by Steven Kostanski, one half of The Void‘s directing duo!

“The film picks up 25 years after the events of the 1993 original, which found a maniacal Leprechaun doing whatever it takes to track down his stolen pot of gold. Leprechaun Returns finds the leprechaun revived in the modern day when a group of sorority girls unwittingly awaken him while tearing down a cabin to build a new sorority house.”

On the casting front, Leprechaun Returns will see the return of Mark Holton, reprising the role of Ozzie from the original. As for the titular horror icon himself, Warwick Davis has been replaced after playing the pint-sized Lep in the original franchise’s previous six films. The role is being taken over by Linden Porco, who is no stranger to horror.

And if the teaser trailer for Leprechaun Returns is any indication, not only did the makeup team nail the look of the Leprechaun, but Porco is a worthy replacement for Davis…

The 21-year-old Linden Porco , who originally set out to be a professional soccer player, was born on August 29, 1996 with “cartilage-hair hypoplasia, a form of dwarfism that stunts growth, but allows for proportional development.” The actor, who measures 32″ tall, got his first film gig courtesy of 2006’s Little Man, wherein he played the title character’s body double when he was just 9 years old; Porco’s athletic ability made him, according to star Keenan Ivory Wayans, “a gift from the movie gods.”

Marlon Wayans’ head was digitally placed onto Porco’s body for the film.

Linden Porco has also starred in A Very Larry Christmas and “Sunnyside,” and he even played an uncredited “Body” (presumably Chucky’s body) in last year’s Cult of Chucky.

More notably, Porco played the creepy character “Smart Mouth” across six episodes of Syfy’s “Channel Zero: Butcher’s Block,” which just wrapped up its season last week.

With his undeniable acting talent as well as athletic ability, it would certainly be no surprise to see Linden Porco take over as the new Leprechaun for years to come, which of course depends on how well received Leprechaun Returns is next year. And as sad as we are to see Warwick Davis out, we’re thrilled that Linden Porco is in.

He seems to be the perfect man for the job.

23,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/international/europe/Video:-When-wheelchair-bound-Stephen-Hawking-tasted-Zero-G-free-float,"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Khaleej Times,Video: When wheelchair-bound Stephen Hawking tasted Zero G free-float,"The physicist took a jet flight from the US Kennedy Space Centre in 2007 that let him float in weightlessness.

British physicist Stephen Hawking took a flight in 2007 that gave the renowned scientist, who is confined to a wheelchair, a taste of the weightlessness of space.

Excerpts from the 2007 article:

Hawking and an entourage of caretakers and other thrill-seekers took off from the space shuttle's runway at the Kennedy Space Center in a specially modified jet that dives through the sky to give passengers an experience of zero gravity.

They returned to the space center in Florida about two hours later.

Hawking acknowledged before the flight that experiencing weightlessness, even for a few seconds, would be sweet relief from the bondage of a daily life immobilized by a debilitating and irreversible neuromuscular disorder.

""I have been wheelchair-bound for almost four decades and the chance to float free in zero G will be wonderful,"" Hawking told a pre-flight news conference.

The acclaimed cosmologist and best-selling author of ""A Brief History of Time,"" who has posited theories to help explain black holes and other celestial phenomena, lost his ability for natural speech after a tracheotomy that followed a bout of pneumonia in 1985.

He speaks with the aid of a computer-controlled voice synthesizer.

Hawking said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that he feared that the human race did not have a future if it didn't go into space.

""I therefore want to encourage public interest in space. A zero-gravity flight is the first step towards space travel,"" he said.

""Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers,"" Hawking added at the news conference.

In a reference to his affliction, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, Hawking noted that his flight also would serve as a demonstration that ""everybody can participate in this type of experience.""

During these flights, participants experience at least one free-fall, lasting about 25 seconds, where they float up from the floor. The maneuver is accomplished as the plane flies toward the ground following a steep climb.

The ride, which normally costs $3,500, was courtesy of Florida-based Zero Gravity Corp., which operates a commercial zero-gravity service similar to what NASA uses to train astronauts.

Hawking hopes the experience will lead to a suborbital spaceflight aboard a new passenger service being developed by Virgin Atlantic Airway's offshoot, Virgin Galactic. Commercial suborbital spaceflights are expected to begin in 2009.

How did humans come into existence?

Hawking's insights about black holes have opened new avenues of thinking about the nature of the universe and helped resolve troubling areas of physics where the laws of nature appear to break down.

Of all the universe's mysteries, Hawking said he would most like to know how it is that humans have come into existence.

""The universe is so big, so smooth and yet just right enough for us to exist,"" Hawking said in the interview.

Speaking with Hawking is a slow, meditative experience. He twitches one of the few muscles still in his control - his cheek - to scroll through word lists stored in his computer. Constructing a 35-word sentence takes 15 minutes and leaves him fatigued.

Still, Hawking doesn't wait for a question to converse.

A quip about Hawking's robotic voice having a nice British accent, prompts him to reply, ""Most people think my accent is American.""

Later, when asked about the prospects of intelligent life beyond Earth, Hawking said he hopes it exists.

""There is not much sign of it on Earth,"" he said.","The physicist took a jet flight from the US Kennedy Space Centre in 2007 that let him float in weightlessness.

Development is being handled by Lancarse, the same studio that developed the strategy RPG Lost Dimension.

Zanki Zero is a survival game set on Gareki Island. At the start, the only facility at the player’s base necessary for daily life is the water supply station. In order to prolong the lives of the main characters, players will develop their bases with various facilities and raise their levels.

The main characters are made up of eight human clones that are the last survivors of humanity. Excluding Sachika, the main characters are themed after the seven deadly sins (anger, greed, etc.). They include:

Minamo Setouchi – The police officer of “pride.”

Haruto Higurashi – The editor of “laziness.”

Yuma Mashiro – The madam of “gluttony.”

Mamoru Ichiyo – The doctor of “greed.”

Rinko Susukino – The florist of “lust.”

Zen Kubota – The farmer of “anger.”

Ryo Mikajime – The artist of “jealousy.”

Sachika Hirasaka – The girl of “original sin.”

The characters will grow old and die in a span of only 13 days, and their appearance will change from child to adolescent, to mature, to old.

Various other characters will support the main characters, which include a cast voiced by Masako Nozawa, Ryuusei Nakao, Mitsuki Saiga, Aina Suzuki, Toshihiko Seki, Ayana Taketatsu, Rika Tachibana, Toshiyuki Toyonaga, Hiroaki Hirata, Masaya Matsukaze, and Haruka Yoshimura.

When a character’s HP becomes zero, they will die. If surviving members do not follow the proper procedures, they will not be able to revive them.

Through the “Extend Machine” system, you can use “score” to create a clone of a character that died. You can also play mini-games.

Gareki Island has a television broadcast called “Extend TV,” which will guide the main characters.

Dungeons are ruins that players explore through real-time progression, where items can be collected and enemies fought. You can also take on missions assigned on Extend TV.

The battle system has a high nature of action. It keeps the feeling of exhilaration and accomplishment while using simple controls that incorporate movement and attacks, that even users who are not good at action games can enjoy.

Here are some additional tidbits, via a developer interview in the magazine:

The main characters are closer to ordinary people, rather than Danganronpa-like characters with special talents.

Danganronpa staff are involved in the game’s development, and the voice actors of the characters that appear in the game will meet the expectations of the fans.

Extend TV is fully voiced.

The revival of dead characters is not an easy to use system.

Skills and levels are handed down from previous clones. There is also a system where you become stronger the more you die.

There are advantages and disadvantages to aging. For example, you can attack many times as a child, while it is easier to unleash charge attacks as an old person.

The story does not have a time limit.

Dungeons are being prepared for the number of main characters that appear, and the atmospheres of the dungeons take after their traumas that are the seven deadly sins. Dungeons have fixed structures (in other words, they are not procedurally generated), but items drop at random places.

As a character grows, battles will gradually become more difficult, but non-combat deaths such as dying as a result of hunger-induced low stamina will increase.

ROME, Apr 11 2018 (IPS) - The United Nations, which is battling some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, still remains focused on one of its equally daunting undertakings: how to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.



But the latest figures released in a joint study by the European Union (EU), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) highlight the gravity of the situation just last year alone when some 124 million people in 51 countries faced acute food insecurity — 11 million more than in 2016 (even while the number of people living on the edge of starvation and hunger remains at 815 million worldwide).

The 2017 increase, according to the ‘Global Report on Food Crises’, is largely attributable to new or intensified conflicts and insecurity in Myanmar, north-east Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Sudan and Yemen.

Prolonged drought conditions have also triggered poor harvests in countries already facing high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, both in eastern and southern Africa.

And UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres warned last January that hunger is on the rise the world over, with Africa registering the highest rates.

The Secretary General said agricultural and livestock productivity in Africa was under threat largely due to conflict and climate change. He added, “climatic shocks, environmental degradation, crop and livestock price collapse and conflict are all interlinked”.

Still, the United Nations seems determined to work towards its targeted goal of Zero Hunger by 2030. But how feasible is this?

Asked about the impediments facing that goal, Dr Marta Antonelli, Research Programme Manager at the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition Foundation (BCFN), told IPS reducing the number of chronically undernourished people in Africa is one of the most urgent challenges that the world needs to face.

She pointed out that food insecurity, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, is related to a variety of interconnected factors, such as extreme poverty, un-diversified livelihoods, weak institutions and governance, and, especially, adverse climatic conditions and social conflicts.

“Climate change and severe extreme weather events could have a tremendous impact on crop yields, livestock, fish stocks and therefore affect farmer’s incomes (especially subsistence smallholder farmers) who become more vulnerable to food insecurity.”

Dr Antonelli said measures to tackle hunger in Africa include the harmonisation of governance of food security, sustainability and nutrition; building institutional responses to reduce extreme poverty and inequalities; supporting more efficient agricultural systems; ICTs and technology innovation.

Additionally, it also includes supporting farmers to diversify livelihoods and reduce vulnerability; restoring land and increasing integrated land and water management to improve harvests; identification of strategies for building resilience to shocks through adaptation to climate change, institutional response mechanisms; and finally monitoring and reporting of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through generation and sharing of reliable data.

The BCFN Foundation, a non-profit, independent think tank working for food sustainability, addresses today’s major food related issues with a multidisciplinary approach — from the environmental, economic and social perspective. That goal is to secure the wellbeing and health of people and the planet.

Asked what role BCFN can play, as part of its contribution to a resolution of the food crisis, Dr Antonelli said the coexistence of hunger and obesity, the overexploitation of natural resources and food loss and waste: these are the three paradoxes identified by the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition Foundation.

According to BCFN, it recognises three imbalances that beset the global food system: food waste (nearly 1/3 of world food production), hunger in the face of epidemic levels of obesity (2.1 billion people impacted), and unsustainable agricultural systems (1/3 of world grain production is used for animal feed, foodstuffs are used for first generation biofuels instead of feeding people.

Dr Antonelli said: “Since 2009, we use a multidisciplinary approach to study and analyse the relationship between food and scientific, economic, social and environmental factors. Through research, dissemination and public engagement, our contribution to shift towards more sustainable food systems includes the Nutritional and Environmental Double Pyramid, the Milan Protocol, the publication of Eating Planet.”

Moreover, in 2016, BCFN launched the Food Sustainability Index (FSI), developed by The Economist Intelligence Unit with the Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition. The FSI analyses, ranks and maps 34 countries worldwide on a range of indicators, from food waste per capita to agricultural biodiversity and CO2 emissions from agriculture, to determine the sustainability of their food systems.

“We fund young research through the ‘BCFN YES!’, a contest open to PhD candidates and young research fellows around the world. The award is given in recognition and support of innovative projects on food and sustainability. We also believe that involving media and journalists is also pivotal to shed a light simultaneously on local and global food sustainability, inform people on supply chains and inform their choices.”

For this reason, the BCFN launched in 2016 the Food Sustainability Media Award, which invites journalists, bloggers, freelancers and individuals to submit work, either published or unpublished, on food safety, sustainability, agriculture and nutrition. (www.goodfoodmediaaward.org).

BCFN has also developed a series of educational programmes for school children and the MOOC on “Sustainable Food Systems: a Mediterranean Perspective” realised in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Mediterranean with SDG Academy and The University of Siena, with a major educational purpose.

It consists of a series of pre-recorded lectures, readings, quizzes, discussion forums and deals with environmental and climate-related challenges basing upon Mediterranean experience, how sustainable farming systems is being utilized as a roadmap for positive action and implementation of Sustainable Development Goals.

Asked about the importance of food sustainability– including eliminating waste and reducing obesity – as a key factor in reaching the 2030 goal, Dr Antonelli said the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs establish a global set of objectives for all countries in the world to be achieved by the year 2030.

SDGs range from the eradication of poverty and hunger, to the need to act for climate mitigation, to the promotion of education and gender equality, to preserving natural resources such as water in sufficient quantity and quality for human needs.

Food access, utilisation, availability, quality and sustainability are at the core of all SDGs and represent a pre-requisite to implement the 2030 Agenda in all countries in the world.

Agriculture accounts for one third of global GhG emissions, cover 38% of the world’s land surface (an area still in expansion), accounts for 70% of water withdrawals and 80% of desertification.

The number of hungry people, she pointed out, is rising again and exceeded 815 million in 2016; overweight and nutrition challenges affect two billion people both in the North and the South of the world; and about one third of the food produced for human consumption gets lost or is wasted.

“We cannot transform our world without fixing the food system first.”

Asked about the countries making the most progress in the Food Sustainability Index, she said the FSI Index shows that, when defining food sustainability by looking at country’s performance in sustainable agriculture, nutritional challenges and food loss and waste, the top scoring countries are France, Japan, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Italy, South Korea and Hungary.

The presence or absence of sound and well-implemented policies is fundamental in shaping the score of the countries analysed. Generally speaking, high human development is moderately correlated with higher sustainability of food systems.

The analysis performed in 2017 on the Mediterranean countries revealed that the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries are those struggling the most in achieving sustainable food system, especially in the area of food loss and waste, whereas they perform relatively better across the nutritional challenges indicators.","UN’s Zero Hunger Goal Remains a Daunting ChallengeROME, Apr 11 2018 (IPS) - The United Nations, which is battling some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, still remains focused on one of its equally daunting undertakings: how to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.

26,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/305369-the-zero-hunger-challenge,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The News International,The zero-hunger challenge,"According to the latest estimate, there are still nearly half a billion people who either go hungry or are undernourished in the countries that fall within Asia and the Pacific. Some 490 million people do not obtain the daily nutrients that are required to lead a healthy and productive life.

The region made a considerable amount of progress during the 1990s and 2000s in dealing with the problems created by malnutrition and hunger. But in recent years, we have found that the fight against hunger has slowed down in recent years and, in some cases, its effects have been reversed.

This comes as bad news for all of us because various governments had pledged to wipe out hunger, in all its forms, by 2030. In other words, in little more than 12 years, no one should suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The reality is that we have 152 months (give or take) or around 4,560 days to achieve this task.

As an economist, I have done the math that can guide us in handling this issue. As per my own estimates, we must pull 107,456 people out of hunger every day in Asia and the Pacific. So, this means we need to help around 107,000 or more people on a daily basis for a long time until our target is met.

Of course, we must do this against the backdrop of limited natural resources; climate change; an aging populations; and urbanisation. Hunger must also be eradicated amid conflicts; natural disasters; and humanitarian crises.

The growing demand for protein-rich foods can be viewed as one factor that can help defeat hunger. But in some countries, this trend has led to obesity, which must be tackled simultaneously. After all, the challenge is to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, nutritious foods at all times.

But when you consider the alarming statistics and the challenges before us, the situation appears to be depressing. But no one is ready to throw in the towel. In fact, they are willing to do just the opposite. The good news is that governments across this region are acutely aware of these challenges and aren’t giving up at any cost. They have recently reaffirmed their pledge to go the extra mile and eradicate hunger in all its forms from their respective countries.

Last week, government ministers and senior officials from 40 countries across this region came together in Fiji to provide strategic direction and assign priorities for the FAO to tackle these issues. This was the first time in more than two decades that such an event – the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC) – had been convened in the Pacific.

The passion and intensity with which discussions were held and ideas were shared was particularly striking. There was a clear edge to the talks: the effects of climate change on food and agriculture were now being realised. While the delegates engaged in productive discussions, a category-3 cyclone battered the conference venue – as if to remind delegates of the urgency of the tasks at hand.

The countries called upon the FAO to further assist them in strengthening their sector-specific contributions and help them monitor progress toward meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). They also wanted further support to integrate agriculture into their national policies, strategies and programmes for climate change and disaster risk reduction management.

To meet these SDG goals, and as part of their nationally-determined contributions, countries have highlighted the need for improved and more resilient crops; more efficient irrigation; improved animal and fisheries management; enhanced fertilisers; low-emission rice; and sustainable forest management as suitable measures that ought to be implemented.

The FAO is supporting governments to scale-up climate action for food and agriculture under the 2030 Agenda by mobilising finance and expertise at the field level and advocating for a more prominent role for food and agriculture in the global climate change agenda.

But climate change is not the only cause for concern. The countries acknowledged that food systems need to be addressed to tackle the growing rates of obesity – especially in the Pacific, where it has reached epidemic proportions. A great deal of concern was also evident because the number of people suffering from hunger has once again been on the rise in some parts of Asia. This trend has emerged after decades of reductions in the continent.

Civil society organisations that participated in the Fiji conference reminded governments that decisions made in meetings like these must be inclusive. The result must be in everyone’s best interest – particularly the most disadvantaged and food-insecure groups in society.

Adapting agriculture to climate change; improving nutrition for all; and eradicating hunger in all its forms will require teamwork. This form of teamwork was evident at the APRC. The FAO and its member countries and partners can collectively score the winning goal – the zero hunger goal. We can do this within the allotted time because we know that it isn’t impossible.

Kroger directed a total of $181 million in food and funds to end hunger in local communities and rescued 91.2 million pounds of safe nutritious food that could no longer be sold from its retail stores, or shipped from its distribution centers and manufacturing plants, for Feeding America® food banks last year alone. Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Food Rescue program started 10 years ago as its Perishable Donation Partnership.

""Zero Hunger | Zero Waste addresses a fundamental absurdity in our food system: 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. is thrown away, yet 1 in 8 Americans experiences hunger.

""We are intently focused on reducing food waste throughout our operations.""

Kroger is working with long-standing partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF), conducting a comprehensive food waste analysis to identify where the company stands today in its journey to zero food waste, and establish a framework for measuring and reporting food waste reduction going forward.

""You can't improve what you don't measure,"" said Pete Pearson, Director of Food Loss and Waste for WWF. ""Many businesses don't understand how much waste they create and its tremendous environmental impact. Kroger's zero waste goal comes at a critical time, and we hope more businesses follow their lead.""

Starting today, customers can visit the Kroger Facebook page to engage with the #ZeroHunger video by sharing an idea or photo that expresses ways shoppers can reduce food waste in their everyday lives. For each engagement, Kroger will donate $5 to WWF, up to $100,000.

Kroger recently introduced a blog series featuring easy tips and suggestions from the company's chefs and sustainability leaders, like 10 Ways to Cut Down on Food Waste, to help customers become a part of the solution.

(Reuters Photo/Philimon Bulawayo)

According to the latest estimate, there are still nearly half a billion hungry and undernourished people living in the vast Asia-Pacific region.

Some 490 million people, each one lacking in the daily nutrients required to lead a healthy and productive life. This region had been making great progress during the 1990s and 2000s in fighting undernutrition, but we see that the fight against hunger has slowed in recent years and in some cases actually reversed.

That's bad news for all of us, because governments had pledged to wipe out hunger in all its forms by 2030.

In other words, in a little more than 12 years from now, there should be no more people in the world suffering from hunger and undernutrition. In reality, that leaves us with 152 months (give or take), or around 4,560 days to get the job done.

As an economist, I like to do the math. By my own estimate, that means we must lift 107,456 people out of hunger each day in Asia and the Pacific. That is 107,000 today, 107,000 tomorrow, and so on, week after week, month after month, year upon year.

Of course, we must do this against a backdrop of limited natural resources, climate change, shifting and aging populations, urbanization and amid conflict, natural disasters and humanitarian crises that confound our efforts.

With greater demand for protein-rich foods, we can see this as one factor in helping to defeat hunger, though in some places it is leading to obesity, which must be tackled simultaneously. After all, the challenge is to ensure all people are getting access to affordable, nutritious foods at all times.

But when you look at those hard numbers and the challenges before us, it is depressing, yes. But no one's ready to throw in the towel – in fact, just the opposite.

The good news is that governments across this region are very aware of these challenges and they aren't giving up either. In fact, they have just now reaffirmed their pledge to go the distance and eradicate hunger in all its forms from their lands.

Just last week, government ministers and senior officials from 40 countries in the region came together in Fiji to provide strategic direction and set priorities for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to tackle these issues going forward. It was the first time in more than two decades that such an event – the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific (APRC) – had been convened in the Pacific.

What I found striking was the passion and intensity of the discussions and sharing of ideas. There was a clear edge to the talks – the effects of climate change on food and agriculture were now being seen and felt. While the delegates talked, a Category 3 cyclone battered the conference venue – as if to remind them of the urgency of the tasks at hand.

Agroecology Key Element to Zero Hunger and Food Security

By Jaya Ramachandran

ROME (IDN) – More than enough food is produced in the world to feed everyone, yet 815 million people go hungry, according to FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. How to ensure that a growing global population – projected to rise to around 10 billion by 2050 – will have enough food to meet their nutritional needs, is therefore one of the greatest challenges the world faces. Experts see in agroecology a solution.

Agroecology, they say, can help transition to sustainable food and agriculture systems that ensure food security and nutrition for all, provide social and economic equity and conserve biodiversity and the ecosystem services on which agriculture depends.

Family farmers must remain central to bringing agroecology to scale, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva stressed in his closing remarks to the Second International Agroecology Symposium from April 3-5 at FAO in Rome.

""It's time to scale up the implementation of agroecology,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""We have succeeded in moving from talking about what is agroecology, to now having specific program targets to be achieved in the next few years, and strong support from civil society and those governments who have worked hard to make this symposium a success,"" he added.

""When we speak of agroecology, we are not speaking of strictly technical matters. I would like to stress the social aspect, so when we say that we are going to strengthen the role of agroecology in FAO's work, we are saying that we are going to strengthen the role of family and small-scale farmers, fisher folk, pastoralists, women and youth,"" he said.

The FAO Director-General also highlighted the Decade of Family Farming (2019-2028) and the Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) as opportunities to raise awareness about the valuable link between family farming, agroecology and sustainable development.

The Symposium underscored the need to recognize that scaling up agroecology is a key element to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), endorsed by the international community in September 2015. Goal 2 aims to ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.""

The Symposium brought together more than 700 participants with representatives from 72 governments, around 350 civil society and other non-governmental groups, and 6 UN organizations.

The Symposium Chair Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias emphasized in his summary that ""Agroecology offers multiple benefits"" – including for increasing food security and resilience, boosting livelihoods and local economies, diversifying food production and diets, promoting health and nutrition, safeguarding natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystem functions, improving soil fertility and soil health, adapting to and mitigating climate change, and preserving local cultures and traditional knowledge systems.

""It is critical that legal and regulatory frameworks are implemented in a way that ensures transformative change towards sustainable agriculture and food systems based on agroecology, and respects, protects and fulfills farmers' rights and access to productive resources such as land, water and seeds.""

The Chair's Summary also drafts a way forward including a list of ""urgently needed"" commitments from stakeholders. Governments are called on to develop policy and legal frameworks to promote and support agroecology and sustainable food systems, and to remove ""perverse incentives"" for unsustainable agriculture.

The Summary calls on FAO to develop a detailed 10-year action plan for agroecology and to begin implementing the Scaling up Agroecology Initiative.

Consumers and citizens are urged to act as agents of change in the food system to promote responsible consumption. Donors are asked to increase long-term funding to agroecology, while academia and research organizations are encouraged to increase research on agroecology.

On the sidelines of the Symposium, the World Future Council (WFC) with FAO and IFOAM – Organics International kicked off a global contest for the visionary policies that create enabling environments for agroecology, the 2018 Future Policy Award. The winners will be recognized in a ceremony at FAO in Rome later in 2018.

The Future Policy Award 2018 is supported by the FAO, the World Future Council, IFOAM-Organics International with the assistance of Green Cross International, DO-IT - Dutch Organic International Trade and Sekem Group (Egypt).

Every year, the most visionary policies tackling humankind’s most pressing challenges are commended with the Future Policy Award (FPA), the only global award hitherto that recognises policies rather than people. The World Future Council has awarded this annual prize since 2010 in partnership with UN agencies.

“This year’s Future Policy Award will reveal proven solutions that make sustainable agriculture possible. The World Future Council is determined to further cooperate with FAO in order to identify and share the best policies for advancing agroecology in the interest of future generations. It is critical that we learn from the policies that are already making an impact,’’ says Alexandra Wandel, Director of the World Future Council.

“World Leaders and the UN General Assembly recognise the potential of agroecology to achieve healthy nutrition for all and to address social injustice, climate change and biodiversity loss”, notes Peggy Miars, World Board President of IFOAM – Organics International. “We see it happen in numerous countries where the policy framework gets it right. Let’s showcase and reward these innovative policies!” [IDN-InDepthNews - 06 April 2018]

Through our research, advocacy and campaigns, we’re working to:

Give communities the right to know: Simply put: if it’s in use, we should be able to find out about it. We have the right to know what chemicals are in the products we buy, that are stored at the factory down the street, or that are sprayed on our crops, parks or schoolyards.

Prove it’s safe: Companies should be required to prove that a chemical or process won’t endanger our health or the environment before it’s put into use. And once reasonable concerns about a chemical's risk have been established, we should stop its widespread use unless and until independent research proves it's not harmful.

Eliminate chemicals of concern: Some chemicals are so dangerous, or pose such a risk to our health or the environment, that we should stop their use immediately.

Zero out toxics: We should require that manufacturers develop plans to phase out the use of any chemical that has been proven to be toxic and replace it with the best available alternative.

None of this is easy, since some of the policies meant to safeguard us from toxics are stuck in the past. And unfortunately, the current administration in Washington, D.C., is slashing some of the EPA and FDA programs that do exist to protect us from toxic threats. So to get us closer to zeroing out toxics, we need to work in the states, in cities, and directly with the companies that are creating or using these toxic chemicals.","And once reasonable concerns about a chemical's risk have been established, we should stop its widespread use unless and until independent research proves it's not harmful.

To address this significant issue more broadly, the Walmart Foundation is also donating $15 million USD (~$19 million CAD) in funding to support Canadian initiatives and research to reduce food waste along the food chain, from farm to fork.

Today's announcements build on business and philanthropic initiatives the company has been undertaking since 2005 in Canada and around the world to eliminate waste and relieve hunger. In Canada, Walmart has reduced food waste in its own operations by 23 percent between 2015 and 2017.

The company's journey to zero food waste in Canada by 2025 will continue to be guided by a three-part strategy.

Improving operational efficiencies while enhancing value to the customer by efforts such as :

: Discounting repackaged bruised or peak-freshness produce through Walmart's $1 / $2 Bag Program and reducing prices with Walmart's Customer Value Program to allow for the quick sale of fresh meat, bakery, dairy and produce items approaching their best-before dates

Food waste: A global issue

Food waste is an important global issue, with substantial repercussions in terms of both food security and the environment. The United Nations Environment Programme reports that roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tons — gets lost or wasted. In Canada, the cost of food waste was identified as $31 billion in 2014, according to a report from Value Chain Management International, up 15 per cent from 2010.

The grocer is teaming with Rubicon Global, an Atlanta-based provider of sustainable, cloud-based waste and recycling solutions, in its goal of eliminating all forms of waste at its stores, with food waste a particular target.

“Food waste is how we can make the most significant change, not only for what’s ending up in landfills, but for our communities as well,” noted Jason Wadsworth, manager of sustainability at Rochester, N.Y.-based Wegmans.

Added Wadsworth: “Wegmans has been tackling the issues of hunger and food waste in our communities for many years. Both present complex challenges that certainly can’t be solved overnight, but as a food company, we know we can make a positive impact, and we are committed to doing so.”

Although its efforts to minimize food waste date back to the 1970s, the company’s more recent projects in this area include using imperfect produce and slightly blemished food in its foodservice operations, allowing local food pantries and food banks to pickup unsaleable perishable food items to distribute to the needy, diverting food scraps from landfills by offering them as feed for local livestock, and sending food scraps for anaerobic digestion to be turned into energy, or sending them for composting.

In addition to the Zero Waste initiative, Wegmans is an active participant in the EPA’s Food Recovery Challenge and has enrolled as one of the first U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions, committing to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. Through partnerships with Rubicon and local food banks and pantries, as well as haulers in its market area, the grocer tracks all of the food coming out of its stores whether it’s waste, being donated or being diverted from landfills as feed for livestock, composting or anaerobic digestion.

“It’s all about continuous improvement,” explained Wadsworth. “We have programs in place at all our stores aimed at minimizing waste, but we’ve committed to the Zero Waste journey because we see opportunity for improvement within those established programs, as well as how we educate our store employees. The more they understand the programs, why they’re in place, their importance, and how they benefit the environment, community and the company, the more successful we are in achieving our goals and the sustainability triple win.”

Walmart Canada has announced a commitment to achieve zero food waste by 2025, while Walmart Foundation is providing $15m in grants to support Canadian initiatives and research to reduce food waste along the food chain from farm to fork.

The strategy builds on the company’s efforts since 2005 to eradicate food waste. In Canada, Walmart reduced food waste in its own operations by 23 percent between 2015 and 2017.

“We are stepping up in the fight against food waste and hunger,” said Lee Tappenden, president and CEO, Walmart Canada.

The company has declared a three-step strategy to zero food waste in Canada by 2025:

Improve efficiencies, enhance value:

It will improve operational efficiencies while enhancing value to the customer.

These will include discounting repackaged bruised or peak-freshness produce through Walmart’s $1/$2 Bag Program and reducing prices with Walmart’s Customer Value Program to allow for the quick sale of fresh meat, bakery, dairy and produce items approaching their best-before dates.

Walmart will also improve bakery production operations to reduce over-production while providing additional processes, training and resources to associates.

It plans to implement organic recycling programs in 338 stores and distribution centre locations across Canada, allowing facilities to recycle unsaleable and unsold food into animal feed, compost and energy.

Increasing food donations:

All Walmart Canada stores will be paired with local food banks to maximize surplus food donations, with approximately 85 percent of stores regularly donating their surplus food products.

Providing philanthropic support:

Walmart Canada has committed $1 million to Food Banks Canada for the 2018 Fight Hunger. Spark Change. campaign in support of food banks across the country.

Mr Tappenden added: “I’m very proud of our comprehensive, 360-degree approach to tackle these issues.

“In addition to the Walmart Foundation’s significant funding, Walmart Canada’s operational initiatives, food donations and philanthropy will help to further reduce food waste and food insecurity in Canada.”

Supporting food waste innovation in Canada

Walmart Foundation will also be investing $15 million USD across Canada in not-for-profit organizations engaged in research and innovative initiatives to reduce food waste along the food chain.

These projects include a $621,600 USD granted to create a roadmap that will present a deeper analysis of food waste and loss across the supply chain by region, sector and food type, and will include insights on the causes of food waste and loss.

This information will be used to outline potential solutions that could reduce food waste and loss through prevention, recovery and recycling.

A $1.5 M USD in funding for FoodRescue.ca, an online system that provides access for businesses to quickly and easily donate surplus food of any kind, such as perishable dairy, prepared foods, produce and freshly baked products.

The Daily Bread Food Bank will receive a $726,352 grant to enable Daily Bread to work with five large food banks in Ontario to help with the distribution of fresh produce across the province.

Food Banks Canada will get $2,310,000 to allow it to foster greater collaboration, build skills and share best practices across its network.

35,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/uk-to-review-climate-target-raising-hopes-of-a-zero-emissions-pledge,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,UK to review climate target raising hopes of a zero emissions pledge,"The UK is to review its long-term target to cut climate emissions as part of global efforts to curb rising temperatures, the government has announced.

The announcement by clean growth minister Claire Perry during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) raises the possibility the UK could implement a target to reduce emissions to “net zero” by 2050, tightening the existing goal to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by that date.

Such a target would require more stringent cuts to carbon in the short as well as long term, and a much faster transformation of key parts of the economy – including energy, transport, industry and housing – than has yet been contemplated. The government’s statutory advisers would be expected to set out key choices on how this could be achieved.

Under the global Paris agreement, countries have committed to curbing temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to prevent dangerous climate change.

Such a move will require the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. The UK government pledged in 2016 to enshrine a zero target in law, but has not yet passed any legislation.

After a global scientific review of the impacts of, and action needed to keep to, a 1.5C rise is published this autumn, the UK’s climate advisers will be asked to review the country’s 2050 target, Perry said in a speech on Tuesday.

After the report, she said: “We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets.”

The committee recently suggested the UK would have to meet the net-zero target by 2045-50 in order to do its bit to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5C.

A temperature rise of 1.5C is seen by some countries, such as low lying islands at risk of rising sea levels, as the limit beyond which their very existence is threatened.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “For a safe climate we need all governments to aim for cutting pollution to net zero levels by 2050.

“This decision to review Britain’s long-term climate target sends a strong message to the EU and other big economies that London is committed to the Paris agreement, and now it’s time they too considered what more they can do.”

Ways of meeting the net-zero target could include investing in projects to grow trees and restore soils, to take up greater carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as more controversial measures such as investing in emissions reduction projects overseas. Even with such methods, the UK is likely to have to bring forward targets on phasing out diesel and petrol engines, and expand renewable energy generation and, potentially, nuclear power.

Many actions under Conservative-led governments since 2010, however, have dismayed climate campaigners and may have to be reconsidered. These include the failure to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, limits on renewable energy, the scrapping of carbon capture and storage projects and tax breaks for fossil fuels.

John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the review was extremely important and could provide a “valuable lead” for other countries.

“The data shows that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency.

“Fossil-fuel dependent cars and vans need to be removed from sale by 2030, a step-change in energy efficiency standards in our construction industry should be prioritised, and the government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget,” he added.

The government’s announcement was welcomed by others at the Commonwealth summit, where climate change has been seen as one of the key issues under discussion. Nearly half of the Commonwealth nations are classed as “small island developing states”, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.

Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which currently holds the presidency of the UN’s climate forum, told the meeting: “I am encouraged by Britain’s undertaking to review its climate targets with a view to increasing ambition. The [targets] we all promised to make in the Paris agreement should be setting high standards for the rest of the world to follow. But just as importantly, we in the Commonwealth can show how cooperation based on trust can supply the finance, technology and skilled resources to deliver the necessary transformation in our economies.”","The UK is to review its long-term target to cut climate emissions as part of global efforts to curb rising temperatures, the government has announced.

Walmart has announced its plans to achieve zero food waste by 2025 in its Canadian operations.

Walmart will implement its strategy in accordance with the Zero Waste International Alliance guidelines, which stipulate that 90% or more of discarded resources be diverted from landfills, incinerators and the environment.

In addition, the Walmart Foundation will donate $15 million USD (~$19 million CAD) in funding to support a number Canadian initiatives and research to reduce food waste along the food chain, from farm to fork, according to the retailer.

The retailer’s plans are based on a three-part strategy which will see it improve operational efficiencies and enhance value to the customer, increase food donations and provide philanthropic support.

Streamlined Operations

Walmart will offer discounted, repackaged, bruised or peak-freshness produce through its ‘$1/$2 Bag Program’ and reduce prices with its ‘Value Program’ to allow for the quick sale of fresh meat, bakery, dairy and produce items approaching their best-before dates.

It will also improve its bakery production operations to reduce over-production and create a more consistent quality.

The retailer plans to implement organic recycling programmes in 338 stores and distribution centre locations across Canada, which will allow facilities to recycle unsaleable and unsold food into animal feed, compost and energy instead of sending it to landfill.

Surplus Food Donations

In order to increase surplus food donations, all Walmart Canada stores will be paired with local food banks, with some 85% of stores regularly donating their surplus food products.

In the US, Walmart has previously provided millions of pounds of fresh food into the charitable meal system through a similar programme.

The retailer's Canadian operations have also committed $1 million CAD to Food Banks Canada for the 2018 'Fight Hunger, Spark Change' campaign in support of food banks across the country.

""We are stepping up in the fight against food waste and hunger,"" said Lee Tappenden, president and CEO, Walmart Canada. ""I'm very proud of our comprehensive, 360-degree approach to tackle these issues.

“In addition to the Walmart Foundation's significant funding, Walmart Canada's operational initiatives, food donations and philanthropy will help to further reduce food waste and food insecurity in Canada.""

Food Bank Donations

In addition to the retailer’s efforts, the Walmart Foundation will also invest $15 million USD in over half a dozen Canadian food banks, recycling programmes and academic research from Ontario to Vancouver.

""The Walmart Foundation is committed to being part of the solution on the important issue of food waste in Canada,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. ""We are excited to support these outstanding organisations pursuing innovative and effective initiatives all along the food chain.”

""As a business, Walmart believes the value-maximising strategy is the one that creates shared value – value for customers, business and society – by strengthening systems we all rely on,” McLaughlin continued. “We hope today's announcements will help accelerate momentum and inspire even more collective action to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger in Canada.""

But in India, “Day Zero” has come and gone for residents in many parts of the country, where taps failed long ago and people have turned instead to digging wells or buying water.

An expanding population, growing demand for water from agriculture and industry, and poor management of water supplies have sent India’s groundwater to ever lower levels.

That reality, combined with rising temperatures, threatens worsening scarcity, experts say.

Nearly 163 million people among India’s population of 1.3 billion - or more than one in 10 - lack access to clean water close to their home, according to a 2018 WaterAid report.

That is the most of any country in the world, according to the UK-based charity, which aims to provide clean water and better hygeiene to people without them.

Disputes with neighbours over the sharing of water from rivers that cross national boundaries also means tensions are rising as water shortages grow, said Michael Kugelman, a deputy director and South Asia expert at the Wilson Center, a policy think tank in Washington D.C.

“Countries that get along the least are forced to share and cooperate over water resources, and many major rivers originate in, or pass through, politically contested and tense areas,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“So you have population growth, intensifying climate-change impacts, poor water management and geopolitical tensions. It’s a perfect storm for greater water insecurity,” he said.

India is entangled in water disputes with its eastern and western neighbours - Bangladesh and Pakistan - which accuse it of monopolising water flows moving downstream toward them.

To the north and northeast, however, India fears a loss of water to upstream China, which plans a series of dams over the Tsangpo river, called the Brahmaputra as it flows into eastern India.

“ So you have population growth, intensifying climate-change impacts, poor water management and geopolitical tensions. It’s a perfect storm for greater water insecurity. Michael Kugelman, deputy director and South Asia expert, Wilson Center

Water losses

While India’s trans-boundary rivers are governed by treaties on how water should be shared, disputes are increasing as water shortages stoke tensions.

Apart from in Bhutan and Nepal, South Asia’s per capita water availability is already below the world average. The region could face widespread water scarcity - less than 1,000 cubic metres available per person - by 2025, Kugelman said.

Almost 600 million people in India are at high risk of being unable to continue relying on surface water - including in the country’s northwest and south, where much of the country’s staple wheat and rice are grown, according to the World Resources Institute.

Water supply in India may fall 50 percent below demand by 2030, the Asian Development Bank has forecast.

“Large parts of India have already been living with ‘Day Zero’ for a while now,” said Mridula Ramesh, author of an upcoming book on climate change.

“Much of it is because of bad management. Most cities lose between a third and a fifth of their water from pilferage or leakage through antiquated pipes, and we don’t treat and reuse wastewater enough,” she said.

Bengaluru, Karachi and Kabul are among the 10 cities in the world that are “on the verge of an imminent water crisis”, according to a report last month by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a research and advocacy group based in New Delhi.

Bengaluru, once known as the “city of lakes”, now relies heavily on groundwater, which is not being naturally replenished and cannot sustain the growing population, said Sushmita Sengupta at CSE.

“‘Day Zeros’ are inevitable unless cities push for judicious use of water - including rainwater harvesting and reuse of waste water, as well as more efficient irrigation, and regulation of tubewells,” she said.

Migration?

India is one of the largest consumers of groundwater in the world, with worsening shortages attributed in part to subsidies that help farmers run electric irrigation pumps cheaply for longer than needed, and to a lack of limits on extracting water or digging wells.

Some states are taking steps to manage water better. Karnataka and Maharashtra require industries to use treated urban wastewater, with Gujarat and other states also planning similar measures.

But regulating water use is a politically sensitive issue - one few policymakers are keen to address, Kugelman said. That’s the case even as thousands of farmers migrate out of parched rural areas or commit suicide as their crops wilt, he said. .

Water scarcity is expected to force 50 to 70 million people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and China from their homes by 2050, according to research by the Strategic Foresight Group in Mumbai.

“With greater migration to the cities, there will be increased social disruptions and greater stress on water resources in urban areas,” Kugelman predicted.

“These will, in turn, increase tensions between states and countries over water. Even treaties can’t help then.”

What does it mean?

A sub-solar point is when the sun is directly overhead at a particular latitude. When the sun is at the zenith (the highest point in the sky) its rays will be hitting a particular point exactly perpendicular to the surface.

This will make your shadow be exactly under you, making it look like there are no shadows. Take a small jump and you can see your shadow.

How often does it happen?

It occurs twice a year.

Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press

Over the past few years, a little green manual has been slowly making its way into the hands of Walmart store workers. Titled Would I Buy It?, the manual is a visual guide that helps employees decide whether fruits and vegetables are still good for sale and when they should be “culled.” For example, the sapota, a tropical fruit common in India, is supposed to soften as it ripens, the guide states – slightly wrinkled skin is completely normal.

The idea is to reduce the amount of perfectly good produce going to waste. It’s just part of a suite of changes the giant retailer has rolled out in a massive effort to cut food waste in its 411 stores across Canada – efforts that have already resulted in a 23 per cent reduction in waste since 2015. At a time when the need for corporate social responsibility is increasingly viewed as a given – especially for a polarizing brand such as Walmart – the company has focused much of its philanthropic efforts on sustainability and waste.

This week, the company doubled down, announcing $19-million in funding through the Walmart Foundation for charities and research institutions to address systemic issues contributing to food waste. The retailer is also on track to become the largest Canadian grocer to reach “zero food waste” (although its commitment to reach the target by 2025 puts them behind the Metro chain, which aims to do so by 2020).

“Zero food waste,” according to international conventions, means 90-per-cent diversion from landfills, whether through repackaging donations, or recycling and composting.

“Waste in food is a huge environmental concern as well as a cost concern,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation.

Over the past few years, waste has become a key issue for environmentalists and food activists and companies have taken notice. In Canada alone, an estimated $31-billion of food is wasted every year. Globally, an estimated one-third of all food produced is wasted.

From an environmental perspective, this means the resources used to grow that food – water, land and fertilizer – are also wasted. And as the food decomposes in landfills, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in its contribution to climate change.

Other grocery retailers also have made moves toward reducing waste. Loblaws made a splash with its “ugly” produce lines, designed to shift consumer’s expectations. It’s also pledged to reduce waste by 50 per cent. The Metro chain pledged to reach zero waste by 2020. But Walmart’s promise would make it the largest player in Canada to commit to zero food waste.

Ms. McLaughlin acknowledged that this focus on waste is not entirely altruistic. In addition to boosting the company’s image, cutting waste will also help Walmart to become a more efficient business.

“To the people who would say, ‘Well, you’re really doing this to strengthen your business.’ Absolutely. Yes,” she said. “We are doing this to strengthen our business. In a way that is good for society, and vice-versa.”

Within its stores, Walmart has already begun putting changes in place.

The company has implemented organic recycling programs at stores to convert spoiled food into animal feed and compost. It has also paired each store with a local food bank to maximize donations. Fruits or vegetables that are nearing spoilage are repackaged into bulk $1 or $2 bags (something that other retailers were already doing, but new to consistency-obsessed Walmart).

But retail makes up just a small part of a much larger problem at every step of the food chain – an issue the donation is meant to address. Just 10 per cent of waste happens at the retail level. Another 10 per cent happens at farms and 20 per cent in processing. Almost 50 per cent of waste occurs at the household level.

As with many corporate social responsibility strategies that involve partnering with charities, much of Walmart’s new funding will go toward food banks. A criticism in the past has been that charities aren’t always equipped to handle large corporate food donations. In this case, Walmart’s funding will be used to build capacity at food banks – including purchasing coolers and chillers to gather and store fresh products.

Another common criticism is that retailers are simply dumping unwanted (often unhealthy) foods on charities. One of those past critics was Aart Schuurman Hess, the chief executive of Greater Vancouver Food Bank.

In this case, Mr. Schuurman Hess’ organization will be receiving as part of the announcement more than $1-million to expand its program that turns unwanted tomatoes into soup. He said his concerns have been allayed here.

Not everyone was won over by the Walmart announcement.

Nick Saul, the CEO of Community Food Centres Canada − and an outspoken critic of the traditional food bank model − cautioned against Walmart executives’ linking food waste with hunger.

“Any company, including Walmart, that’s talking about reducing/eradicating food insecurity must prioritize, first and foremost, fair work practices and paying liveable wages with good benefits,” he said.

“And these same companies need to be clear at all times that food charity is not the answer − more inclusive public policy and an economy that does a better job of sharing its wealth are where the real solutions lie.”","Open this photo in gallery A Walmart store in Laval, Que.

Introduction

THE ZERO HUNGER CHALLENGE (ZHC) is an international call for action made by the United Nations (UN) towards a vision of a world without hunger. It is fully aligned to the 2030 Agenda and reflects the five elements from within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The zero hunger challenge is also aligned to the Africa Union Commission’s Agenda 2063 on ‘The Africa we Want’.

Lesotho is generally food deficit, hence addressing hunger is imperative and a top priority in the country’s development agenda. Overall, a large part of the population remains exposed to situations of chronic food and nutrition insecurity, especially the rural population, which is heavily dependent on subsistence farming and other rural non-farm activities.

Therefore, the Government of Lesotho (GoL)’s commitment to eradication of hunger and undernutrition is infixed in the national vision 2020 and elaborated in the 2017 Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP).

Achieving zero hunger requires integrated approaches that respond to the multiple, interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. To respond to the Zero Hunger Challenge, the Government of Lesotho (GoL) commissioned the Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR). The purpose of the ZHSR was to support national efforts to accelerate actions towards eliminating food insecurity and malnutrition. The specific objectives of the review were to:

Conduct a comprehensive review of the food security situation in Lesotho, including assessment of the adequacy of the strategies, policies, programs, institutional capabilities meant to support food security and nutrition for vulnerable groups and the poor in the country. Highlight the progress made and identify the challenges Lesotho must overcome if the country is to achieve zero hunger in line with the targets of SDG 2 and the country’s national commitments. Recommend how policies, programmes and strategies can be adjusted or adapted to have a food security or nutrition impact. Initiate the development of a national Zero Hunger Roadmap.

The ZHSR is framed within the pillars of SDG2 or zero hunger: (i) Access to Adequate Food and Healthy Diets for All People All Year Round (ii) An End to Malnutrition and All its Forms (iii) All Food Systems are Sustainable (iv) Double Smallholder Productivity and Income and (v) Zero Loss or Waste of Food. While the analysis is informed by key national policies and strategic frameworks geared towards addressing food and nutrition insecurity, the 2017 Food and Nutrition Security Policy (FNSP) is the overarching framework for the implementation of the ZHSR recommendations.

The Hunger Challenge in Lesotho

With a Global Hunger Index (GHI) of 24.1, Lesotho indicates a serious food security situation. The rising number of undernourished people continues to pose serious challenges in the country. As a result, the 2017 Global Hunger Report ranked Lesotho 80 out of 119 countries that were assessed. This is higher than Swaziland (71) and South Africa (55) but lower than Botswana (81), Namibia (87) and Malawi (80). According to the situational analysis, other key food and nutrition security issues identified within the zero hunger pillars include:

Access to Adequate Food and Healthy Diets All Year Round: The main source of food for the majority of Basotho population is own crop production; livestock products; remittances through economic migration, labour exchange and direct market purchases supplemented with the Government social protection interventions. Heavy reliance on food imports makes Lesotho susceptible to high food prices which increases pressure on vulnerable households’ food and nutrition security.

Low-income earners and the poor especially the rural population struggle to meet their minimum daily requirements for food intake as they can only access poor quality foods with low micronutrient content. The most affected households are those relying on farming with low earnings, herding, informal business or casual labour for most of their incomes; those headed by women and children, with high age dependency ratio; those with fewer employment opportunities and few assets. Overlying the food access situation is the high prevalence of HIV in the country.

An end to Malnutrition and all its Forms: Lesotho is currently experiencing the triple burden of malnutrition - under and over nutrition and micronutrient deficiency across all age groups. Although the prevalence of underweight children has marginally improved, low birth weight remains steady at 9.4 percent. Wasting is at 3 percent, which is an improvement relative to the 6 per cent and 5 per cent wasting attained in 2004 and 2009 respectively. Stunting at 33.2 percent remains a serious health challenge. Obesity is a growing challenge with 7 percent in children under the age of five years and 45 percent of women and 12 percent of men aged 15 to 49 years recorded as obese. The other challenge worsening nutrition outcomes in the country is the low intake of micronutrients such as Vitamins and Iron-folic acid. An underlying challenge is the poor access to improved sanitation. On the positive end, the proportion of mothers practicing exclusive breastfeeding has increased almost two-fold from 36 (2004) to 67 percent (2014).

All Food Systems are Sustainable: Climate change in Lesotho is likely to cause significant impacts on agriculture and general livelihoods. Land degradation is a pressing sustainable system issue. The effects of land degradation associated with soil erosion have already reduced the productive capacity of Lesotho’s croplands and rangelands. This will continue to constrain efforts to improve production efficiencies and total production in the face of climate change impacts. The cumulative effect of landcover losses from degradation and soil erosion ultimately reduces the country’s capacity to achieve zero hunger.

Double Small-Scale Productivity and Income: Lesotho continues to be a net importer of food to meet the needs of its people. In good harvest years, Lesotho is only able to meet roughly 30 percent of its annual cereal requirements. More than 70 percent of the population in rural Lesotho is engaged in agriculture and the performance of the sector plays an important role in their wellbeing. However, arable land is below 10 percent of total land area and the country utilizes only half of this land, with implications on resource use efficiency. Domestic food production has concentrated on three main cereal crops: maize, wheat and sorghum and their productivity has been on a decline. Maize dominates local cereal cultivation with 70-80 percent of total national cereal production. The low levels of maize production and yields (on average 0.5 MT/hectare) are primarily due to Lesotho’s high cereal production costs and other factors such as climate change and land degradation.

Adapt All Food Systems to Eliminate Loss or Waste of Food: This pillar focuses on minimizing food losses during production, storage and transport, and waste of food by retailers and consumers; empowering consumer choice; commitments by producers, retailers and consumers within all nations. According to the African Postharvest Information System (APHIS), Lesotho’s Post Harvest Losses (PHLs) for maize have been fluctuating over eleven years, between 2004 and 2015 across districts. For example, in Maseru post-harvest losses for maize were recorded at 2509 tonnes in 2004 compared to 2589 in 2015. The underlying constraints in measuring the losses and waste of food globally, has been lack of consensus in definitions and underdeveloped methodologies.

Key Strategic Gaps and Challenges

The following key strategic gaps and challenges were identified:

Weak enforcement of policies: While the country has a relatively developed enabling policy environment for food and nutrition security programming, the enforcement and implementation of these policies, strategies and plans remain problematic. To implement good policies and programmes that bring change will require effective public institutions and serious commitment by senior policy makers, and government. The weak implementation of policies and programmes is due to the absence of implementation frameworks and regulations and this is the major underlying constraint.

Coordination and implementation challenges: The major limiting factor has been the ad-hoc and uncoordinated manner in which policies and programmes have been implemented. While the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO) is mandated with coordinating food and nutrition programmes in the country it lacks the capacity for coordination.

There are also many structural, financial and technical challenges that stifle the operation of FNCO. These include: lack of coordinating skills, and management skills, lack of communication facilities such as internet connectivity, telephones, computers etc. Furthermore, FNCO operates within a meagre budget and depends on donor support to carry its mandate.

Weak decentralisation process: There are shortages of skills within the civil service to implement demand-led, marketoriented development, which is the focus of the Government and development partners. There is manpower as well as technical and critical skills shortages to undertake food and nutrition security activities particularly when it comes to nutritionists.

Insufficient/unavailability of nutrition data: The major gap here refers mainly to unavailability of data for monitoring of nutrition programming. This is against the absence of a functional nutrition surveillance or early warning system. At its best, the NSS collects, analyses and disseminates information on nutritional status on a quarterly basis; identify areas and groups at risk of malnutrition; and issue early warning to relevant stakeholders on nutrition related problems. However, there are data quality issues that are of concern and need to be addressed.

Weak monitoring and evaluation: Without strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks linked to the project and programme objectives with solid qualitative and quantitative indicators, nutrition and food security will not be achieved.

During the stakeholders’ discussions it was found that there are places where such frameworks do not exist and where they exist, they are not followed with sincerity.

Recommendations

Based on the situational analysis and gaps identified in policy making and programme implementation, the following strategic and specific recommendations needed to achieve zero hunger by 2030 by the GoL and its development partners are made:

Addressing the policy and institutional landscape

The first recommendations entail strengthening development and implementation of food security and nutrition related policies through a number of mechanisms that include: review of the constitution to make food and nutrition security one of the fundamental human rights; endorse and implement the long-outstanding decentralization policy, and its implementation mechanisms and finalize the Food Quality Control and Improvement Standards. Furthermore, there’s need for enhancing multi-sectoral coordination and implementation by engaging multiple ministries, agencies, other stakeholders (e.g., donors, civil society organizations (CSOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, development partners and the private sector. Finally, enhance the capacity of FNCO for multi-sectoral and stakeholder coordination and leadership. This will also require building capacity of the institution through skills development and training.

Sector - Specific Recommendations

In improving access to adequate food all year round, the GoL should strengthen procurement and audit controls, and public financial management systems to address over-pricing of goods and services. Social protection has a positive impact on food and nutrition security, the systems should be strengthened and the transfers expanded in coverage ensuring it covers all the vulnerable populations.

To address high stunting levels in Lesotho and micronutrient deficiencies for sustained improvements in nutritional outcomes, there is need to scale up the implementation of multi sectoral evidence based, high impact, cost effective nutrition interventions as well as the integration and linkages across multiple sectors and development programs that have indirect impacts on nutritional status. There is also need to increase private sector partnerships to improve nutrition for mothers and children. Advocating for increased government investment for proven interventions to tackle malnutrition is essential. Similarly, strengthening systems to ensure effective monitoring, evaluation and knowledge management to improve nutrition policy and programming is recommended.

Building sustainable food systems will require the GoL to intensify land, water and environmental management efforts that will ensure effective forest and agroforestry management strategies that are key to climate mitigating efforts.

To boost smallholder productivity and incomes, there is need to address the following strategic issues: development of policies and legal frameworks covering livestock feed, agriculture irrigation and mechanization, rangeland management and land use policy. Alongside this is the need for reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency of policies in place such as the universal subsidy policy. Another recommendation relates to the aggregation of smallholder farmers into upgraded value chains and establish market information centres that recognize the diversity of farmers.

No tangible work has been done to understand food waste and food loss in Lesotho. The main recommendation would be the commissioning of a baseline survey that is meant to provide an overview of the subject. The survey should point to critical sectors that require detailed research.

Develop a common Lesotho Zero Hunger Road Map

Informed by the Strategic Review Report, the country should develop a common Zero Hunger Road Map that describes what actions are required, a timeframe for action, and which key partners are required for each of the zero hunger pillars.

The Road Map will constitute the primary vehicle that will be used by GoL and all stakeholders to carry out its work, and its plans and assess progress toward the most important milestones.

The review is an independent, analytical and consultative exercise which the World Food Programme has initiated globally to identify the key challenges to achieving zero hunger in countries where it operates.

The report aims at ensuring the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 2, which will help the country chart a sustainable path to ending hunger, food insecurity, and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.

According to the report, everyone living in Ghana can have adequate and nutritious food throughout the year if there is a stronger integration between the pillars that affect food security and nutrition under the leadership of government.

The report argues that ending hunger and malnutrition cannot be achieved without a holistic approach that hinges on improvements in agriculture, and other sectors including nutrition, health, water, sanitation and hygiene, that directly or indirectly affect food and nutrition.

Despite significant reductions in food insecurity since the 1990s, hunger and malnutrition remain a real concern in parts of Ghana, especially in the three regions in the north and among rural and peri-urban communities.

According to the report, comprehensive action is required to overcome these challenges, hence the recommendation for a food security and nutrition advisory board at the Office of the President to embed this as a cornerstone of national development.

""Eliminating hunger and malnutrition forms the basis of achieving other development goals and therefore we are committed to implementing the clearly thought out actions identified in the roadmap of this Strategic Review,"" said George Gyan-Baffour, Minister for Planning.

The report highlights the need for the production and consumption of foods which are rich in nutrients. Apart from the increase in the production of maize, there has been a decline in production of traditional nutritious staple foods such as sorghum, millet, groundnuts and cowpeas over the past decade.

""As we seek to achieve zero hunger in our country, we should always remember that food production must be nutrition-sensitive. It is more important for food to nourish the body than simply fill the stomach,"" said John Agyekum Kufuor, Ghana's former President and the lead convener of the Zero Hunger Review.

WFP Regional Director for West and Central Africa Abdou Dieng said his outfit was using this review as the basis for WFP's five-year country strategic plan in Ghana which is built to support the government's excellent flagship programs and agricultural policies.

""In the new program, we will work more closely with the private sector to reduce post-harvest losses and malnutrition using a market-based approach which will be self-sustaining,"" Dieng said.

Launching the report, Akufo-Addo said the government's vision was to modernize agriculture, improve production efficiency, achieve food security, and profitability for farmers, all aimed at significantly enhancing agricultural productivity.

The last thing students want from a class is a zero.

Unless that class is specifically designed to get them to zero.

A group of 25 fourth-graders from The Mastery School, a charter school in Camden, recently took a Zero Food Waste challenge inside the test kitchens of Campbell Soup Company, at the company’s corporate headquarters.

Once they arrived at the kitchens, they formed culinary teams with names such as the Taste It Team, Healthy Consumers and Queen Cookers. Wearing red aprons and psyched to get busy, students took on the challenge as part of a six-week “Cooking Matters’’ program.

The class is administered by the Food Bank of South Jersey, in cooperation with Campbell's.

The Zero Food Waste class, offered to mark Earth Week, introduced the young chefs to six varieties of hummus: Spinach Hummus; Roasted Red Pepper Hummus; Simple Hummus; Black Bean Salsa Hummus; Avocado Cilantro Hummus and a Dessert Hummus. It also enouraged them to get creative and try to use every piece of food available.

Campbell's staff kicked off the event by highlighting the problem of food waste. An estimated 40 percent of the food created for human consumption is wasted in the United States. This has a negative impact on the environment, and dumps into landfills nutritional ingredients that could help fight hunger, they stressed.

“The big word today is sustainability,’’ Melissa Donnelly, manager of Sustainability Integration and Metrics for the Campbell Soup Company, told the young chefs gathered at a communal table in the middle of the room. “Sustaining is about what we are using and keeping things going and using things over and over … Not letting anything go to waste.

“We want you to be really creative about it and not waste any of the parts of any of the food you are using,’’ she explained. “For instance, the carrot peels are just as nutritious as the other parts you usually eat of the carrot … Think about how you can use them in your recipe, really think about new and innovative ways to use the food that would otherwise go to waste.’’

In previous Cooking Matters classes, the students had learned the importance of trying to “eat a rainbow,’’ improving nutrition by incorporating as many of the beautiful colors of nature as they can each day.

Orange ingredients are good for your eyes, recalled one student. And red foods — peppers, tomatoes — are good for your heart, said another, while other vegetables support brain and digestive health.

As the students split into groups, each with a Campbell Soup employee as a mentor, Jane Freiman, director of the Campbell's Consumer Test Kitchen, directed them to use as much of each ingredient as possible.

“I am challenging you all as your teams strive for zero food waste,’’ she said. “Now, how are we going to measure this? … When you bring back your finished dishes, you are also going to bring back your bowl of your food waste.’’

As they set to work, many young chefs said they had never tried hummus before, so tasting what they made would be an adventure.

Under the watchful eye of their coaches, the students scooped chickpeas from cans, diced fresh veggies and fruits, squeezed lemons and found unusual ways to keep that pile in the bowl to a minimum.

The results? Six tasty types of hummus, each with a different spin on the No Food Waste theme. One hummus was served inside scooped-out lemon rinds. Another featured a “tree’’ in its center, the stalk of the broccoli adding a touch of spring to the platter. Still others got creative with cilantro or sliced apples as garnish. Seeds from the veggies and fruit, they were reminded, could be gathered for future planting.

Student Sharen Medina said she enjoyed the challenge of finding ways to make the plate more inspiring. “It’s good and it’s fun,’’ she said of the class. “I helped by putting in the oil and the salt and cutting the cilantro.

“I didn’t come because of my friends are here,’’ she explained, adding that she enjoys seeing cooking shows on TV. “I want to learn to cook and my mom wants to cook with me.""

Asked if she would make the dish at home, Sharen said she may not have all of the ingredients, but “maybe when I grow up.’’

Ky’are Damon loves to cook and says many people in his life has inspired him in the kitchen. “I used to cook with a lot of people like my mom and my grandmom, so that helped me. And I used to cook breakfast for my family in the mornings,’’ he said. “I like trying new foods.

“We made the avocado hummus, and it worked out pretty good. I was trying my best not to waste any food,’’ he said. “It’s a fun challenge.’’

Ky’are said the best thing he’s learned in Cooking Matters so far is how to make stir-fry with chicken, tofu and peppers.

Amarys Lopez Vera also helped make the avocado cilantro hummus. She said it was really good, although in the kitchen she most enjoys making dessert. “I like to make cupcakes and brownies for my cousins. We get to try new things every time.’’

The students had time at the end of class to share their experiences, emphasizing what they’d learned about not wasting food. They got to taste all six types of hummus, and went home with a recipe booklet so they might be able to replicate the lessons in their own kitchens.

After inspecting the young chefs' creations, Freiman praised their efforts to keep scraps in the bowl to a minimum.

Afterward, she stressed the many components of this program that benefits kids once they leave the test kitchens.

“It gets started that interest in food, and teaches them not to be afraid and to do simple things. We get started with some experimentation and they work together as a team. It pulls in their math skills. And it’s important to experiment, and they are such creative children and we help them to unlock that.’’

It is gratifying, she said, to hear that some kids were cooking at home after the first class, sharing what they learned with their families.

Kim Fortunato is director of community affairs for Campbell Soup, as well as the president of the Campbell Soup Foundation.

Cooking Matters, she explained, was created by a program called Share our Strength in Washington, D.C., which is administered locally by the Food Bank of South Jersey. It is offered at Campbell Soup in partnership with the Food Bank as part of Campbell’s Healthy Communities’ 10-year initiative. (The company offers similar programs near other facilities in Norwalk, Conn.; and Ferndale, Mich.).

Donnelly’s focus at Campbell Soup is on food waste. Like the state of New Jersey itself, the company has made a commitment to reduce its food waste by 50 percent by 2030.

“We’ve also reported our food waste for the first time this year,’’ Donnelly said. “We’ve been transparent. It is about 400 thousand metric tons, and the majority of that actually goes to feed animals, compost … A portion still goes to landfills, but we are looking for ways we can be more efficient in our production processes and innovative ways that we can create new products from that waste.’’

She said her hope for the Zero Food Waste session was that kids would pay attention to what’s in their pantries and refrigerators back home, and be more mindful about not wasting it.

A group of around 200 students gathered this morning in front of Senate House, ahead of the University Council meeting this afternoon where it is expected that the University will make a final decision on whether or not to divest from fossil fuels.

Students held banners and congregated around the gates of Senate House lawn as speeches were given. After around half an hour, the group began walking down Senate House passage, and gathered behind the Old Schools building. Protesters chanted “hey, ho, fossil fuels have got to go,” and sang about divestment to the tune of Beyoncé’s ‘Love on Top’.

Keira Dignan, a Zero Carbon member who spoke at the rally, said individual people are made to feel responsible for climate change, “because you didn't turn your lights off or recycle your yoghurt pots properly,” when large corporations refuse to divest – and “100 corporations produce 71% of emissions.” She added that “you would not fight a house fire with a water gun.”

Cambridge University Palestine Society (PalSoc) Chair Ed McNally spoke at the rally Louis Ashworth

The rally comes after three years of lobbying, and protests from students calling on the University to divest. Past petitions in favour of divestment have been signed by thousands of students, and pro-divestment motions have been passed by Regent House, the Cambridge branch of the University and Colleges Union, CUSU, and the Graduate Union.

Matt Kite, a representative from Cambridge Defend Education and CUSU education officer-elect, drew parallels with student rallies during the academic staff strikes last term. He criticised a tendency to label the University as “complicit” in working with the fossil fuel industry, saying “complicity gives the University the benefit of the doubt,” when “Corporation Cambridge knows what it is,” and the “corporate university will never be a democratic university.”

Rufus Jordana, another Zero Carbon representative, spoke on the University Council meeting that was due to begin. He said “every single councillor today who votes against divestment today is a sell-out.” He added: “They are selling out their students, they are selling out future generations, they are selling out the global south … “we are in occupation now and we will continue that.”

Some students opposed the rally, as a few Cambridge University Conservative Association members hovered in the background, and student Rickesh Advani stood alone barbecuing in opposition. He said that he does not “think some people being able to spray paint Senate House is democratic,” when he supports “companies like BP that do nothing wrong, they make profits.” In reference to his barbecue, he said “by burning something, I’m putting stuff in the environment, and showing I don’t care about what goes in the environment when it has a benefit to me.”

The University currently has certain indirect investments of its £6.3bn endowment in fossil fuel companies such as Shell, BP, and ExxonMobil, though the total value of its investments in the sector is unknown. Analysis of the Paradise Papers leak in late 2017 showed that it had invested a total of £1.3m in Guernsey-based private equity firm Coller International, which is channelled principally into oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell.

Earlier this week Zero Carbon activists spray painted the Old Schools building with slogans such as “Cambridge Divest From Fossil Fuels”, flowers and hearts, amid controversy over the Grade I-listed nature of the building and potential damage to the stone.

Several members of Zero Carbon have been on hunger strike since Wednesday, with the three first-years vowing to continue until the University divests. Other climate activists have been taking part in a Zero Carbon occupation of Greenwich House, the University’s administrative centre. These protests have fallen in with the society’s promise to continue to escalate action until the University commits to full divestment.","Students held banners and congregated around the gates of Senate House lawn as speeches were given.

Four years ago, after signing up for “My Green Home”—an effort by the Green Building Council of South Africa to make buildings more energy efficient—her family saw their house in the middle-class suburb of Pinelands retrofitted with energy saving LED lights, low-flow showerheads and roof-top solar panels, as well as winter insulation.

As part of the green makeover, the family also learned to cut their energy use by hanging laundry out to dry rather than using a tumble dryer, switching off appliances that aren’t being used, and switching to washing laundry with cold water.

“My children were very excited as we got to do this as a family,” Makalima-Ngewana, a consultant at the University of Cape Town’s Graduate School of Business, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Better yet, since joining the programme, her family’s energy costs have fallen by nearly 90 percent, she said.

As South African cities aim to battle the effects of climate change, from drought in Cape Town to the threat of rising seas and flooding in Durban, four cities have banded together to try to create zero-carbon buildings, which produce no contribution to climate change in their use of energy.

Working in conjunction with the C40 Cities initiative—a group of major world cities trying to cut climate-changing emissions—the plan is to require new buildings in Johannesburg, Cape Town, eThekwini (formerly Durban) and Tshwane (formerly Pretoria) to become much more energy efficient, to cut electricity bills and greenhouse gas emissions.

“ The problems encountered include the common perception that green buildings are expensive. They can be but they don’t have to be. Thulani Kuzwayo, marketer, Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA)

Tim Pryce, who runs C40 energy and buildings programmes worldwide, said the effort seeks to help South African cities rapidly scale up low-carbon building efforts and share what they learn with other cities.

Buildings make up the largest single source of emissions in C40 cities globally, with over half of the total emissions, he said.

“If we are to avoid hugely damaging impacts from climate change—impacts that will make the current water shortage in Cape Town look minor—we need to drive these emissions down as rapidly as possible, towards net zero carbon all around the world by 2050 at the latest,” Pryce told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

‘Net-zero’ future

Cities that achieve “net zero carbon” would produce very few climate-changing emissions, with those still produced offset by means such as planting carbon-absorbing trees.

Ensuring new buildings are highly efficient and run largely on renewable energy is crucial to try to limit global warming to relatively safe levels, Pryce said.

“Our target is to work with the four cities to bring policies, such as better building codes or more ambitious planning requirements, into effect by the end of 2020,” he said.

Building experts from Sustainable Energy Africa, an organisation that promotes equitable and low carbon clean energy development, will work with teams in the target South African cities to make that happen, he said.

“It is indeed a good thing,” said Thulani Kuzwayo, a marketer with the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA), which has certified over 300 “Green Star” buildings since 2009.

To achieve the certification buildings must be energy efficient, comfortable, handle waste responsibly and contain spaces that contribute to the health and well-being of their users.

The effort “can shift paradigms in planning, design, construction and building operation,” said Kuzwayo, who is also chair of the World Green Building Council’s African regional network.

Because many buildings are made to last up to 50-100 years, building them for efficiency can result in a huge savings in climate-changing emissions over time, Kuzwayo said.

However, South Africa is still at the early stages of adopting green building standards, he said.

“The problems encountered include the common perception that green buildings are expensive. They can be but they don’t have to be,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Perceived elitism associated with green buildings also can be an issue, as people tend to view them as expensive, he said.

He said changes in how buildings are created must be led by governments “for the desired scale and impact”.

“If government leads in constructing and operating energy-efficient buildings, it will propel the adoption drastically,” Kuzwayo said.

From power to water

Sometimes, the worries each city faces can help drive action.

In Cape Town, the “My Green Home” effort launched “right after the power utility, Eskom, had problems to provide adequate electricity in the country,” remembers Makalima-Ngewana, whose household was chosen as one of the programme’s pioneers.

“People were challenged to come up with alternative ways to save and use power,” she said.

Now Cape Town has a new worry: water supplies, in the face of longer droughts linked to climate change.

Makalima-Ngewana’s family is now adapting to that as well, through things like reusing household wastewater as part of the city’s home greening efforts.

“Though the initial focus was strongly focused on energy saving—we still do it up to now—due to water problems we also now utilise our grey water at home,” she said.

The University Councillor, Umang Khandelwal, has been criticised by Cambridge Zero Carbon Society for not publicly declaring her stance on divestment.

In an open letter signed by 16 student societies, the pro-divestment group calls on the University management to “make the right choice” by “immediately committing” to remove the University’s direct and indirect investments in fossil fuel companies.

Notable signatories include Cambridge Universities Labour Club, CUSU Women’s Campaign and CUSU BME Campaign.

In the letter, Khandelwal is urged to “publicly come out in favour of divestment” and “commit to speak and vote in favour of full divestment” at a University Council meeting on Monday. At the meeting, the findings of the University’s working group on divestment, of which Khandelwal is a member, will be discussed, with the University Council expected to come to a decision on whether to commit to full divestment.

In a statement, Zero Carbon Society said that Khandelwal had “fallen short on all accounts” of fulfilling her campaign pledges of advocating “divestment, accountability, representation, and values-based decisions”. They added that they “deplore[d] her inaction” and said that Khandelwal should “immediately take leadership” on divestment, claiming they “received no reply” when they asked her to sign their open letter.

Despite making no explicit promise to divestment, in her manifesto she listed one of her goals as to make “values-based decisions” including “scrutinising university business over ethical standards”. In an interview last year with The Cambridge Student, Khandelwal said that divestment was one of the “most important policies”; commenting that “it is time that the University makes a real commitment to effective ways of combating climate change”.

In response to Zero Carbon’s claims, Khandelwal said that she has “consistently engaged with and responded to student groups, the student press, mainstream media, and the University” on “multiple occasions in a timely and professional manner”. She noted that she had served on the University’s divestment working group “for the past year”, adding that there has been “an excellent exercise of consulting widely across the University” as well as with “external stakeholders”.

Marcel Llavero Pasquina, Khandelwal’s successor as University Councillor for the 2018-2019 academic year, is a member of Zero Carbon Society. As part of his campaign, Pasquina promised to help create a “democratic, transparent, and accountable University” and pledged his support for environmental justice, gender equality and decolonisation.

Over the past few months, Zero Carbon Society have escalated their direct action. In March, the group held their largest march to date, which was attended by over 300 students. Last week, “Cambridge divest from fossil fuels” was sprayed on the walls of Senate House, which the University said had to be removed at “significant cost”. On Wednesday, three first year undergraduates began a hunger strike and this Friday evening student activists began an ongoing occupation of Greenwich House, the University’s finance offices.","Umang Khandelwal during hustings for independent University Council representative last year Louis AshworthThe University Councillor, Umang Khandelwal, has been criticised by Cambridge Zero Carbon Society for not publicly declaring her stance on divestment.

National action program seeks to reduce malnutrition, increase food security.

Vietnam has launched a Zero Hunger program that seeks to lower malnutrition rates and stunted growth through improved nutrition and sustainable food production.

The National Action Program Zero Hunger was launched by Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Saturday, June 6, Vietnam News Agency reported.

It targets reducing the number of stunted children under two years old to below 20 percent nationwide and 25 percent for children in the north and the Central highlands. It also aims to get children under two years with low weight for their height or age to below 5 percent.

The program has policies supporting pregnant women and providing adequate nutrition.

It also encourages farmers to develop a sustainable food system by participating in co-operatives and production chains. This will enable households to increase production through large scale farming and gain higher incomes.

Zero Hunger will be funded by the national poverty reduction program to the tune of VND545 billion ($23.7 million) plus during the 2018-2025 period. Many ministries have been assigned to implement it.

The National Action Program on Zero Hunger follows a U.N. goal to find long term, sustainable solutions to eliminate hunger in all forms by 2030 through national food security.

Nine million Vietnamese people are still living in extreme poverty, according to a World Bank report released last April.

Vietnam's poverty rate fell by almost 4 percentage points since 2014, to 9.8 percent in 2016, but the problem is far from solved, especially among ethnic minority groups, the report said.

In Vietnam, poor people are defined as those who earn up to VND700,000 ($31) a month in rural areas and VND900,000 ($40) in cities. According to the General Statistics Office, 8 percent of families in Vietnam were living under the poverty line last year.

Official statistics show that the number of people living in hunger in the country dropped by 32 percent from the previous year to 746,100 in 2017.","Vietnam has launched a Zero Hunger program that seeks to lower malnutrition rates and stunted growth through improved nutrition and sustainable food production.

7 June 2018, Rome, Italy - Exchanges between developing countries of experiences and knowledge gained through their national hunger and poverty reduction efforts are proving to be a game changer for sustainable development, according to a roundtable discussion among experts and policymaker held at FAO.

""Under the 2030 sustainable development agenda, we all have the obligation to work to translate our political will and the resources we have available into action on the ground that lead to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger,"" said FAO Deputy-Director General Dan Gustafson during the discussions.

But while UN organizations and other international actors have a role to play in providing technical cooperation, assistance, and ideas, ""really it's the exchange of best practices, new ideas, innovations, experiences in how countries have addressed problems, and the policies and institutions they've used that will make a difference,"" he added.

The event brought together a diverse group of participants from all world regions to take a close look at the South-South model of development cooperation.

Under that model, developing countries themselves exchange resources, knowledge, and experts with one another to both build their own response capacities as well as to shape and drive their own development agendas.

Case studies from China, Ghana, Kenya and Senegal using FAO Knowledge Exchange Platforms to facilitate South-South cooperation were among the experiences discussed at the event.

Productive partnerships

Under South-South model for development cooperation, FAO and international donors like the European Union, are adopting at ""triangular"" approach -- two or more southern countries take the lead, while international partners fill in the gaps identified by the country-driven process.

China was one of the first countries to engage with FAO on South South cooperation and has over the past two decades has contributed some $80 million to FAO to support that work and mobilized over 1,000 of its own agricultural technicians.

""Only sustainable development is good development; only cooperative development is genuine development,"" said Niu Dun, China's Ambassador to FAO, said in his remarks.

""FAO's South-South and Triangular cooperation efforts provide a platform for co-development that allows countries and regions with the same objectives to have fruitful cooperation,"" he added.

Jan Tombinksi, Ambassador to FAO for the European Union -- a major support of the Organization's South-South program -- said: ""We will never achieve sustainability of development without there being an ownership of the process in countries,""

""The days of predominately North to South knowledge transfers are gone,"" Tombinksi added.

He cited FAO's Food and Nutrition Security Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) initiative, which the EU funds, as illustrating how the new approach can make a difference.

Tombinksi noted how, for example, support from FIRST helped Kenya's government build up its planning capacity and developed national agriculture development and investment plans as well as a national Food and Nutrition Security Policy.","The event brought together a diverse group of participants from all world regions to take a close look at the South-South model of development cooperation.

55,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zero-calorie-foods,"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Healthline,38 Foods That Contain Almost Zero Calories,"Calories provide the energy that your body needs to function and stay alive. While there is no evidence to support that negative-calorie foods burn more calories than they provide, foods that are already low in calories may actually provide fewer calories than expected. This is because your body uses energy to digest them. If you’re trying to decrease your total calorie intake, eating more low-calorie foods, such as certain fruits and vegetables, is an easy way to achieve that goal. Here are 38 foods with almost zero calories.

1. Apples Share on Pinterest Apples are highly nutritious and one of the most popular fruits in the United States, according to USDA’s Economic Research Service (1). One cup (125 grams) of apple slices has 57 calories and almost three grams of dietary fiber (2). Since your body has to burn energy to digest apples, the net amount of calories provided by this fruit is probably fewer than reported.

2. Arugula Arugula is a dark, leafy green with a peppery flavor. It’s commonly used in salads, is rich in vitamin K and also contains folate, calcium and potassium. One-half cup (10 grams) of arugula has only three calories (3).

3. Asparagus Asparagus is a flowering vegetable that comes in green, white and purple varieties. All types of asparagus are healthy, but purple asparagus has compounds called anthocyanins that may help prevent heart disease ( 4 ). One cup (134 grams) of asparagus has only 27 calories and is rich in vitamin K and folate, providing 70% and 17% of the DVs, respectively (5).

4. Beets Beets are root vegetables that typically have a deep-red or purple color. One of the most researched benefits of beets is their potential to lower blood pressure ( 6 ). Beets contain only 59 calories per cup (136 grams) and 13% of the DV for potassium (7).

5. Broccoli Broccoli is one of the most nutritious vegetables on the planet. It’s a member of the cruciferous family of vegetables and may help fight cancer ( 8 ). One cup (91 grams) of broccoli has only 31 calories and over 100% of the amount of vitamin C that most people need per day (9).

6. Broth There are many varieties of broth, including chicken, beef and vegetable. It can be eaten alone or used as a base for soups and stews. Depending on the type of broth, one cup — or about 240 ml — usually contains 7–12 calories (10, 11, 12).

7. Brussels Sprouts Brussels sprouts are highly nutritious vegetables. They resemble mini cabbages and can be eaten raw or cooked. Research shows that eating Brussels sprouts may protect against DNA damage due to their high vitamin C content ( 13 ). These nutritional powerhouses only have 38 calories per cup (88 grams) (14).

8. Cabbage Cabbage is a vegetable with green or purple leaves. It’s a common ingredient in slaws and salads. Fermented cabbage is known as sauerkraut. It’s very low in calories and contains only 22 calories per cup (89 grams) (15).

9. Carrots Carrots are very popular vegetables. They’re usually thin and orange, but can also be red, yellow, purple or white. Most people associate good eyesight with eating carrots since they’re rich in beta-carotene, which can be converted to vitamin A. Getting enough vitamin A is necessary for proper vision. A one-cup serving (128 grams) of carrots has only 53 calories and over 400% of the DV for vitamin A (16).

10. Cauliflower Cauliflower is typically seen as a white head inside green leaves. Less common varieties have purple, orange and yellow heads. In recent years, cauliflower has become very popular as a substitute for higher-carb vegetables or grains. One cup (100 grams) of cauliflower has 25 calories and only five grams of carbs (17).

11. Celery Celery is one of the most well-known, low-calorie foods. Its long, green stalks contain insoluble fiber that may go undigested through your body, thus contributing no calories. Celery also has a high water content, making it naturally low in calories. There are only 18 calories in one cup (110 grams) of chopped celery (18).

12. Chard Chard is a leafy green that comes in several varieties. It’s extremely high in vitamin K, a nutrient that helps with proper blood clotting. One cup (36 grams) of chard has only 7 calories and contains 374% of the DV for vitamin K (19).

21. Lemons and Limes The juice and zest of lemons and limes are widely used to flavor water, salad dressings, marinades and alcoholic drinks. Citrus does more than just add flavor. Research shows that lemon juice has compounds that can act as antioxidants to fight and prevent diseases in your body (30). One fluid ounce (30 grams) of lemon or lime juice has only 8 calories (31, 32).

22. White Mushrooms Mushrooms are a type of fungus with a sponge-like texture. Vegetarians and vegans sometimes use them as a substitute for meat. Mushrooms contain several important nutrients and have only 15 calories per cup (70 grams) (34).

35. Watermelon As its name suggests, watermelon is a very hydrating fruit. It tastes delicious on its own or paired with fresh mint and feta. Watermelon contains some of almost every nutrient and a high amount of vitamin C. There are 46 calories in one cup (152 grams) of diced watermelon (50).

36. Zucchini Zucchini is a green type of summer squash. It has a delicate taste that makes it a versatile addition to recipes. In recent years, spiralizing zucchini into “zoodles” as a substitute for higher carb noodles has become very popular. Zucchini is also quite low in calories, with only 18 per cup (124 grams) (51).

37. Beverages: Coffee, Herbal Tea, Water, Carbonated Water Some beverages are very low in calories, especially when you don’t add anything to them. Plain water contains no calories. Most herbal teas and carbonated waters have zero to very few calories, while black coffee has only 2 calories per cup (237 grams) (52). Choosing these drinks over beverages with added sugar, cream or juice can help you reduce your calorie intake.

Enlarge this image toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images David McNew/Getty Images

President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" practice of 100 percent prosecution was modeled after an earlier get-tough policy on the Southwest border called Operation Streamline. It was supposed to streamline the process for punishing unauthorized immigrants and deter people from jumping the border.

Streamline began in December 2005 as a pilot program in the sleepy border town of Del Rio, Texas. The Border Patrol was frustrated then — as now — by the impunity of undocumented border crossers. So it began referring every first-time crosser for prosecution. Prior to that, the immigrants had been allowed to return to Mexico without criminal charges, a procedure called voluntary departure.

If Streamline was supposed to deliver consequences to unauthorized crossers, it also bogged down the courts. Today, nearly 60 percent of all prosecutions for all federal crimes in the nation are for immigration violations, according to the TRAC project at Syracuse University.

""Operation Streamline has been going on for a number of years and it doesn't seem to be deterring people from coming into the country,"" says Joseph Cordova, supervisory assistant federal public defender in Del Rio. The number of unauthorized crossers apprehended each month has soared to 50,000 for each of the past three months.

""The deterrence of spending a little time in jail doesn't seem to be having an impact on them,"" he says.

His observation is shared by federal Judge Alia Moses, who has been on the bench in Del Rio since the beginning of Operation Streamline, 13 years ago.

""I've been down there when they have prosecuted, and I've been down there when they haven't. And it's the same, OK?"" she says. ""People come for economic reasons or they come because they have a reason to be in the United States.""

Moses says the program was initially successful, then it fell off as undocumented immigrants avoided Del Rio and crossed elsewhere.

Under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the program was expanded to other areas of the border in Texas and Arizona.

""That's why they expanded it, because some of these people just stopped coming to the Del Rio Sector, and started going to, say, Laredo or Big Bend Sector or somewhere else,"" says Jon Anfinsen, president of the local Border Patrol union in Del Rio.

While Streamline may have satisfied a hankering for border justice, no one can say whether it achieved lasting results. In 2015, the Inspector General of Homeland Security declared the program increased the workload for Border Patrol agents, yet the agency could not prove it had any effect on illegal border crossings.

""There is no credible data indicating that prosecuting people for crossing the border is a deterrent,"" says Judy Greene, director of Justice Strategies, a pro-immigrant policy research group.

In 2016, she co-authored a highly critical report on Streamline. It estimates that in the first 10 years of the program, incarceration costs alone topped $7 billion.

Now President Trump has signed an order to end family separation, but the administration says it will continue its controversial ""zero tolerance"" practice.

Border agents, judges and attorneys interviewed for this story agree this new emphasis on prosecuting illegal crossers requires even more resources than Washington is sending. There's a need for more judges, more lawyers, more court staff, more adult detention cells and more shelter space for children.

""I can't imagine this is a good policy,"" says a senior official inside the U.S. District Court's Western District of Texas, who asked not to be identified.

Under ""zero tolerance,"" 70 children a day were being sent to federal shelters while their parents are prosecuted. In the first five weeks of the program, the number of children removed from their parents topped 2,300.

Chris Carlin, supervisory federal public defender in Alpine, Texas, points out most of the prosecutions under ""zero tolerance"" are for one of the lowest crimes in the U.S. criminal code.

""A petty misdemeanor is the federal equivalent of a parking ticket,"" Carlin says, ""and the consequences of a parking ticket should not be that you lose your child.""

The Trump administration had insisted it had no choice: kids cannot accompany parents who are jailed by the Department of Justice. But under Streamline, the Border Patrol used discretion. As a rule, agents did not send parents to criminal court and break up families.

""We didn't see them,"" says Judge Moses. ""The Border Patrol was letting them go just through the immigration process and they weren't even coming into court.""

That discretion had consequences. Moses says word got back to Latin America that parents could travel with their kids and after they were caught the family unit would be processed and allowed to continue its journey into the U.S. Border agents say this practice, that they derisively call ""catch and release,"" is what caused the recent surge of families illegally crossing the border.

Moses adds, ""This wave [of families crossing] we've been seeing in the last few years, at least in my judicial division. It's a very recent thing."" She says some adult immigrants who appeared in her court brought children who do not belong to them in order to take advantage of ""catch and release.""

Moses says she has no idea if family separation will be a deterrent to the current wave of illegal immigration.","The Last 'Zero Tolerance' Border Policy Didn't WorkEnlarge this image toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images David McNew/Getty ImagesPresident Trump's ""zero tolerance"" practice of 100 percent prosecution was modeled after an earlier get-tough policy on the Southwest border called Operation Streamline.

McALLEN, Texas – Confusion reigns on the border as immigration officials, prosecutors and Border Patrol agents scramble to fulfill the president’s demand for a zero tolerance approach to unauthorized migrants while simultaneously keeping families together.

President Donald Trump’s decision Wednesday to order that migrant families be kept together – an abrupt reversal of his earlier stance – sowed more confusion into what was already a complicated system of law enforcement, courts, warehouse-like detention buildings and re-purposed daycare centers.

Advocates are near tears as they struggle to reunite parents with kids who have been whisked away by the byzantine federal bureaucracy that’s placed children in as many as 15 separate states. Meanwhile, the court system maintains its grinding job of processing of dozens of migrants daily, fulfilling the president’s promise to punish anyone caught crossing the border illegally.

USA TODAY has been on hand for an in-depth look at how the problems are unfolding in McAllen, the busiest border point for unauthorized migrant crossings.

Courtrooms packed, solutions scant

Magistrate Judge J. Scott Hacker raps on the courtroom door as he enters and nearly 70 shackled migrants stand without a word. Here in this stifling 8th-floor courtroom in downtown McAllen, these migrants will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sneaking across the border, pay a court fee averaging $10 and be released from criminal custody with a sentence of time served.

They aren’t free to go yet, but how they’re treated demonstrates the challenges faced by the government and advocates as they manage the flood of people seeking a better life in the United States.

Trump has insisted that virtually everyone caught crossing the border be criminally charged, and Hacker must ask each detainee whether they understand what’s going on, to confirm their real name, and to plead guilty.

Occasionally adjusting his reading glasses, Hacker runs down the list of prisoners who have been seated in alphabetical order, their legs shackled but their right arms free to swear an oath to tell the truth. Before beginning, Hacker warns them that lying in court could bring felony perjury charges and a far harsher punishment than the misdemeanor they’re charged with today. Most of the people at this hearing were detained by Border Patrol agents on Wednesday. None are parents who were traveling with children, and all are adults claiming to be 18 or older.

Thursday is the first day that no parents have been separated from their kids at the border, brought to court and charged. On Wednesday, 17 adults brought to court after being split from their children were hustled back onto a bus and returned to a detention center without being charged. Their fate in the courts remains unclear.

“Si,” says one of Thursday’s detainees in response to a question from Hacker. “Yes,” barks a blue-suited interpreter. “Si,” says the next. “Yes,” barks the interpreter. The hearing goes on like this, Yes after Si, all morning. As required by law, each of the migrants met with a federal public defender before the hearing, and each pleads guilty. The shackles jingle. The guards scowl. Reporters scribble.

'Torture of the Children'

Efren Olivares, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, is torn. On one hand, Thursday is the first day in about a month that not a single parent has been brought to federal court after being split from their children. That’s good, he says. The bad news? The federal government has no concrete plans to reunite families who have been separated, he says, and it’s possible this new policy will be changed at any moment. For weeks, Olivares has been meeting with migrant parents who’ve been separated from their families.

“It is absolutely a form of punishment, and so is prolonged detention,” he tells a gaggle of reporters outside the courthouse. “It’s torture of the children, in my opinion.”

Like other migrant advocates, Olivares has no idea how the federal government plans to reunite families. Adults and kids separated at the U.S.-Mexican border have been spread to facilities in 15 states, advocates say, and federal authorities won’t discuss exactly how they plan to reunite families, especially when the adults are detained in immigration camps not designed to house children. Advocates say it appears some adults have been deported without their kids, and others have been told its their responsibility to pay for their travel to wherever their kids are being held.

Olivares said he’s heard that some border guards have been documenting family groups with photographs, and challenged authorities to explain their plans: “What they have now is a rudimentary system.”

Hunger strike planned

Outside the courthouse, Kerry Kennedy is fighting back tears. She’s just watched those nearly 70 migrants being processed for a misdemeanor crime. This doesn’t look like the country she loves, and it’s certainly not the one her father, Bobby Kennedy, envisioned.

“Nobody deserves to be treated this way,” Kennedy said as the hot Texas sun glared off the pavement. “The first question is why these men and women are in a criminal proceeding in the first place. This will cause trauma for the rest of their lives.”

Kennedy and staff from the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights nonprofit attended court Thursday so they could better understand the process. It horrified her: “That’s not who we are as American people. That’s not the kind of county most Americans want it to be.”

Kennedy is joining in a hunger strike starting Saturday and planned to last 24 days — one day each for 100 of the estimated 2,400 migrant children forcibly separated from their parents. Strikers will take turns fasting for 24 hours in a McAllen park near the federal courthouse.

Legal limbo for detainees

A guard walks across the pavement outside the courthouse, dozens of shackles hanging over his shoulder. Inside the black Bentsen Tower, Hacker has finished processing the migrants. Each has been convicted, their guilty plea recorded, their sentence served.

But they aren’t free to go.

Under the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy, these migrants now face a separate immigration process that will likely end in deportation. Guards for the private security contractors shackle the migrants and herd them onto unmarked buses and vans for transport back to the Border Patrol detention center. It’s not yet noon.

They are responsible for getting attorneys if they wish to fight deportation. Many don’t.

Kindness in the blistering heat

The temperature has broken 90 after several days of rain and street flooding around the city. Outside the downtown bus station, a dozen teal-shirted volunteers huddle in the shade waiting for one of those unmarked buses to arrive.

Federal officials as a courtesy have told the Catholic Charities volunteers that a bus with about 100 people on it will arrive at 2 p.m. from the Ursula Detention Center a few miles away. Able to hold up to 1,000 children when it was first created under President Barack Obama, the detention center has become a flashpoint of international outrage.

The clock hits 2:30. 3. 3:30. 4. Still no bus. At 4:20 it finally rolls in and volunteers and journalists swarm around it.

The door opens and a private security guard stands on the pavement as a stream of women and young children step off. The guard helps a few bewildered mothers as they struggle to hold their paperwork and their kids. The volunteers step in, offering reassurance and a place to rest. For four years, Catholic Charities has operated a migrant respite shelter in McAllen, providing hot meals, clothes and showers for people released from federal custody and headed elsewhere in the United States while they wait for an immigration hearing.

It’s not clear, even to the volunteers, what criteria the federal government uses to decide to release, although every adult gets an ankle monitor. On Wednesday, the group was both men and women, along with children. Friday, it was only women with young children.

“When you see the children, see the the mothers,, see their faces, you know in your heart it’s the right thing to do,” said shelter founder Sister Norma Pimentel. “God has wired us to care for one another.”

Friday evening, the group walked in the hot sun the few blocks between the bus station and the shelter. The migrants released from custody aren’t obligated to visit the shelter, but volunteers say it’s become known as a safe haven. Most of the people released in this group had been held 3-5 days, generally staying with their kids in the Ursula shelter designed initially to just hold kids.

As the group approached, the shelter’s glass doors swung open and migrants straggled through, some carrying kids who were too young to walk. Applause broke out from the volunteers as the doors swung shut. Shelter spokeswoman Brenda Riojas said a little kindness goes a long way.

“You have to realize, for a lot of these people, this is the first time anyone’s smiled at them in days,” she said.

58,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/why-businesses-must-go-beyond-zero-to-reverse-global-warming/,"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",eco-business.com,Why businesses must go beyond zero to reverse global warming,"In pronouncing 2018 the Year of Climate Action, the Singapore government could not be sending a clearer or more timely signal. As a fast-paced, resource-intensive society, Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions per capita far outstrip the average country’s—we rank 26th out of 142 nations. Though small, we pack a punch contributing to what has come to be known as the greatest challenge to our species. If we are to solve the climate problem, we would have to act together—and quickly.

Indeed, we have seen action bubbling up, here and in the region. Earlier this year, the Singapore government announced an impending carbon tax on facilities that surpass 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in a year. Civil society groups have also risen to the challenge—the Singapore Youth for Climate Action, for example, have been coordinating community workshops over the past two-and-a-half years.

But there is one wild card, and that is industry. Businesses can both radically scale up positive change and cause significant environmental impact. The manufacturing sector alone, which contributes to 20-25 per cent of Singapore’s economy, is expected to account for a whopping 60 per cent of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

To reverse global warming, businesses need to become adept at two things: reducing carbon emissions on a sweeping scale and decreasing the amount of excess carbon already in the atmosphere. Each of these presents a significant opportunity for innovation and growth.

At least one company has had success with the first approach. Ant Financial, the financial technology arm of the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba, released an app in 2016 that aims to make low-carbon lifestyles appealing to the masses. Ant Forest users who make sustainable lifestyle choices get to cash in points for actual trees to be planted on their behalf. The app already engages over 220 million users who have collectively planted more than 10 million trees.

Other businesses are focusing not merely on achieving carbon neutrality, but on strategies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Companies are now developing technology that takes greenhouse gases out of the air and stores the captured carbon in raw materials and useful products—from yarn to fertiliser, fuel to baking soda.

Interface Inc, a flooring manufacturer with its Southeast Asian centre of operations in Singapore, developed and released a carpet tile prototype last year called Proof Positive. It is bio-based (made from renewable plants) and so stores carbon produced during photosynthesis. The production of the tile results in less carbon in the atmosphere: while the average Interface carpet tile has a carbon footprint of seven kilograms of carbon dioxide per square metre, the Proof Positive prototype tile stores two kilograms of carbon dioxide per square metre. If we keep recycling the tiles through our carpet recycling programme, this carbon can be kept out of the atmosphere for decades.

London-headquartered company Carbon Clean Solutions Limited (CCSL) has patented a way to make useful materials out of waste carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants. Its flagship project, the Tuticorin power plant located in Tamil Nadu, India, captures the carbon dioxide released from the factory’s boiler and transforms it into raw material for baking soda.

Businesses are also looking to reverse global warming by tapping—and magnifying—nature’s ability to process and store carbon.

The Bangalore-based company Afforestt helps organisations—including schools, factories and zoos—grow forests in urban contexts, using methods that work with nature (such as mixing soil with microorganisms rather than adding nutrition) to accelerate forest growth.

In partnership with leading biomimicry innovation consultancy Biomimicry 3.8, Interface is piloting an approach that imagines manufacturing of the future. Factory as a Forest envisions a redesign of a factory so that it runs like an ecosystem, managing and sequestering carbon where possible and operating as a functional equivalent to natural habitats.

“ To reverse global warming, businesses need to become adept at two things: reducing carbon emissions on a sweeping scale and decreasing the amount of excess carbon already in the atmosphere.

For its first pilot project in New South Wales, Australia, Interface’s Minto factory measured the ecosystem services that a nearby forest could provide—then challenged its employees to create ideas the factory could implement to make it perform more like the local ecosystem, such as using wetlands and roof gardens to purify water.

These examples signal an incoming tidal wave of innovative business models geared towards solving the climate challenge at scale. We know this because businesses sharing similar, radical ambitions are banding together. RE100, a coalition of global companies committed to 100 per cent renewable power, is one good example. So is NextWave, a group of businesses working to develop a commercial-scale supply chain out of ocean plastic, reducing ocean pollution—a contributor to global warming—in the process.

What this means is that companies and organisations that want to take action now have the opportunity to not just follow in the footsteps of restorative businesses, but to take off from where those footsteps end and jumpstart bold business models of their own. And once we have that critical mass of businesses setting goals to reverse global warming, we can perhaps begin to create a climate fit for life.

Western media keeps referring to an alleged chemical attack on Douma, Syria, as an established fact, but have yet to produce one iota of evidence from the town that, until recently, was controlled by Jaysh al-Islam.

Unverified videos, emanating from the Western-funded propaganda construct the White Helmets, do not constitute evidence, nor do testimonies taken in Turkey or Idlib, Syria, which is under terrorist rule.

On the other hand, there are many testimonies that contradict the accusations, including those of 17 Syrians from Douma (among them doctors and medical staff), who, on April 26, spoke at the headquarters of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague, stating that there was no chemical attack.

The leaderships of the US, UK, France and their lapdog media, unsurprisingly, dismissed the Syrian testimonies as “obscene” and a “masquerade”. It should be noted that the same media took as utterly credible the words attributed to a then-seven year-old girl named Bana al-Abed, living in eastern Aleppo, before it was liberated. Corporate media and Western leaders had no issues with the credibility of Bana, who was living surrounded by twenty-five terrorist cells in her district alone. But the testimonies of Syrians from Douma are “obscene.”

There are other statements by civilians that contradict the accusations, given to journalists who bothered to go to Douma and listen to them, like Robert Fisk, Germany’s ZDF, One American News, and Vanessa Beeley.

In fact, it was the Syrian and Russian governments who called for the OPCW to investigate, and it was the US, UK, and France which illegally bombed Syria with 103 missiles, including 76 missiles on Damascus itself, before the OPCW inspectors could investigate.

None of the accusations have been “proven” and, when the OPCW does eventually issue its report, it is worth recalling that their report in the previous year, on the allegations of a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib, contained “irregularities,” to put it mildly. The most glaring irregularity (mentioned in the annex section of their report) was the admission of 57 “victims” to hospital before any alleged attack even could have occurred. Another unexplained irregularity was sarin showing up in urine but not in blood tests from the same sample.

Douma residents expose lies of chemical accusations

In late April, I traveled by taxi to Douma, with a translator only, where I spent a few hours in the town, talking to civilians so traumatized by the rule of the terrorist group Jaysh al-Islam that they mostly wanted to talk about how hellish their lives had been. But first I went to the hospital in question.

Passing through Martyr’s Square, one of the sites allegedly targeted by a chemical attack but now busy with pedestrians and traffic, the underground hospital was just some hundred metres beyond. Inside, I recorded an interview with a medical student who was at the hospital on April 7, the day of the alleged attacks.

According to Marwan Jaber, patients who came in were being treated for normal shelling injuries, as well as for breathing difficulties, due to the combination of dust and their having taken refuge for extended periods in basements.

Jaber told me that, while staff were treating normal bombing injuries and breathing cases, “strangers” entered screaming about a chemical attack and started hosing people with water. Hospital staff calmed the situation down and went back to treating the patients as ‘normal’ shelling victims, as they had not exhibited any indications of having been exposed to a chemical agent.

Patients’ symptoms were “not in line with the symptoms of a chemical attack. There wasn’t pupil constriction or Broncho-constrictions leading to death,” Jaber recalled. “The symptoms we received were all symptoms of choking, patients affected by the smoke and regular war injuries. They came here, we treated them, and dispatched them home,” Jaber said, noting that none, not one, had died.

Nor were any of the hospital staff affected, as one might expect they would be had a chemical agent been used. The staff, as seen in the video produced by the White Helmets, wore no protective clothing, as would have been necessary when dealing with a toxic chemical.

In Marwan Jaber’s opinion, the unfamiliar men who barged into the hospital screaming weren’t trained in medicine. He went so far as to doubt whether they’d finished high school.

Below the hospital, a network of extensive, reinforced tunnels, large enough for vehicles, enabled Jaysh al-Islam to move freely while they held Douma residents hostage.

Ghouta residents on alleged chemical attacks, 2018 and 2013

As I walked around Douma, I asked residents about life there and especially about whether they believed there was a chemical attack in their town. Some replied they had no idea about an attack. But most replied decisively no, there hadn’t been any.

Read more

At a stand selling vegetables and fruits, Tawfeeq Zahran replied that he believed Jaysh al-Islam had spoken of a chemical attack to frighten them, to make them fear the Syrian army and government. Men around him nodded their agreement. They spoke more about their starvation under Jaysh al-Islam and about the public executions by sword that the terror group had routinely carried out.

A group of young men selling baked goods waved me over, handing me one. They also replied that they knew nothing of an attack. They were more concerned about the fact that, under Jaysh al-Islam, they couldn’t get the flour needed for their baked goods, much less food to live. This was a constant among every civilian I met: Their hunger and terror under Jaysh al-Islam’s rule.

In 2013, the West and its media had accused the Syria government of a chemical attack in eastern Ghouta (oddly at the very time when OPCW inspectors were in the country to investigate a previous allegation). These accusations were shot down by reports from investigative journalists, particularly Seymour Hersh, who concluded that terrorists possessed sarin and the workshops to manufacture rockets. Indeed, I saw one of these mortar and rocket workshops when in Saqba, eastern Ghouta. Massive amounts of missiles of varying sizes lay, as-yet unused, inside the workshop.

Two days after allegations of a chemical attack in April 2018, the Saudi ambassador to the US, Khalid bin Salman, tweeted a condemnation of the Syrian government’s “barbaric” act. The irony, aside from Saudi’s support to the barbaric Jaysh al-Islam, lies in the fact that, according to Mint Press News, Saudi Arabia also gave chemical weapons to terrorists in Ghouta for the 2013 attack.

The Mint Press article cited anti-government fighters who said they’d been given chemical weapons which they didn’t know how to use, naming Saudi Prince Bandar as the source.

The co-authors of that Mint Press article came under intense pressure to retract the article. According to a statement from Mint’s executive director and editor, Mnar Muhawesh, the authors suspected the pressure was from the then-head of Saudi Intelligence, Prince Bandar, one author saying “that the Saudi embassy contacted him and threatened to end his career,” if he continued investigating the attack.

So, in early May, I went to Kafr Batna where, in August 2013, hundreds of people had allegedly been treated at the Tuberculosis Hospital.

Mohammed al-Aghawani, administrator of the hospital, told me:

“There was no chemical attack. I wasn’t at the hospital that night, but my staff told me what happened. Around 2am, there was suddenly noise, shouting, cars arriving at the hospital, bringing civilians. Some people, armed men, said there was a chemical attack. Some of them had foreign accents. They took people’s clothes off and started pouring water on them. They kept bringing people in till around 7am. Around 1,000 people, mostly children, alive, from nearby villages like Ein Terma, Hezze, Zamalka. Many people later said their children never came back.”

Upon closer analysis, footage from that night shows that some of the victims appeared to have had their throats slit, peculiar indeed if they had “died from a nerve agent.”

In an ice cream shop in Kafr Batna’s main square, I asked employee Abdallah Darbou whether he knew anything about the alleged 2013 attacks.

“Yes, we heard about it, but that didn't happen. They claimed that the Syrian regime had carried a chemical attack on us. No, they didn't. I was living in Jisreen, close by, I have been living the real story for seven years. They didn't attack us.”

Other residents I spoke with had no idea about the alleged attacks.

I took a taxi to the Horjilleh centre for displaced persons, just southeast of Damascus, where I met Marwan Qreisheh, from Kafr Batna. Regarding the 2013 incident, he recalled the fighting between Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman, saying, “500 were killed, from both sides. They spread them on the ground, released something like tear gas, and started to film, saying the ‘regime’ bombed the area with a chemical weapon.”

Also at the Horjilleh centre, Mahmoud Souliman Khaled, a younger man from Douma, spoke of his young niece. “My sister from Beit Sawa decided to bring her children to our house. While they were on the street, there was a big explosion and a strange smell. Her daughter fell to the ground. They took her to the nearest hospital and they found out that she suffocated and died instantly. Her mouth was open and she had blue lips, it was obvious that she had suffocated.”

Khaled spoke of the aftermath, how terrorists exploited the toddler’s death: “They took photos of her and they started using them on social media and on websites. They said that she was killed in a chemical attack from the government. But she died from the chemicals that they produce. They killed her.”

Another hoax

After speaking with many civilians in Douma, Kafr Batna and Horjilleh, not only about whether the Syrian government had bombed them with chemicals or nerve agents but also on the truly horrific conditions they’d endured under Jaysh al-Islam, it is my opinion that the videos alleging a chemical attack in Douma were a hoax. There are enough testimonies to the contrary of the accusations, there is a dearth of any evidence to support the claims, and there is every reason to believe that terrorists and the West’s propaganda group, the White Helmets, would stage videos and fake accusations in order to incriminate Syria and Russia.

Read more

Syria and Russia are the two parties with zero interest in perpetrating a chemical attack against Syrian civilians, for moral reasons and for the obviously pragmatic one of not wanting to be militarily attacked as a consequence. FUKUS (France, UK & US), the Gulf states and Israel are parties with every reason to want a chemical attack scenario in Syria, to prolong their dirty war on Syria.

The media was right to use the words “obscene” and “masquerade”, but only in regards to the official story of events in Douma, the corporate media’s lapping up of another dodgy White Helmets video and that same media’s obfuscation of the cruelty and barbarism of the terrorists who ruled in Douma and all of eastern Ghouta.

Developed by Weight Watchers, the simple, flexible new programme – WW Flex – puts even the most chaotic eater in control. As its SmartPoints system considers weight loss and nutrition, it enables you to plan meals without worrying about complex calorie calculations.

Being a solid foundation for healthy eating, WW Flex has more than 200 zero Points foods which can be eaten in portion sizes that suit you, without counting or tracking. A diet including plenty of zero Points foods allows you to enjoy skinless chicken or turkey breast, fish, eggs, pulses and a huge variety of fruit and vegetables without making any dent in your SmartPoints budget.

So go ahead and tuck into a deliciously sweet piece of fruit, everything from nutrient-packed berries to sweet pineapple and melon, bananas or crunchy apples carry zero Points. You can even enjoy a tangy tinned fruit dessert if it comes in natural juice (drained) or water. It’s the same for vegetables. Hit the vegetable aisle at the supermarket and fill your basket with what you fancy.

You can enjoy an extremely wide variety (apart from starchy vegetables) freely. Pile your plate with a huge mixed salad or a generous portion of steamed broccoli, cauliflower or cabbage.

Amazingly, even peas and sweetcorn will not dent your daily Smart-Points allowance. Tinned vegetables are acceptable, as long as they’ve been tinned without oil or sugar (check the labels before you buy them).

You can happily cut down on starchy veg like potatoes, sweet potatoes and parsnips by stirring in a can of zero SmartPoints butter beans, chickpeas, lentils or split peas into soups and summer stews.

Stock your kitchen with zero Points foods so you’re never more than a few minutes away from rustling up a delicious meal or snack. And take a look at the delicious 0 SmartPoints recipes overleaf for inspiration.

If you enjoy a beer, steer clear of the pints (5 SmartPoints for a pint of lager, 9 SmartPoints for Guinness) and order a bottle of Becks beer (3 SmartPoints per bottle) or even alcohol-free beer (Becks Blue is just 1 SmartPoint per bottle) instead.

85g dark chocolate

3tsp cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting

½tsp instant coffee

2 egg whites

1tbsp light brown sugar

100g half-fat crème fraiche

¼tsp salt

Finely chop the chocolate and place it in a heatproof bowl with the cocoa powder, coffee, vanilla and 4tbsp water. Bring a pan of water to a simmer over a medium-low heat and set the bowl of chocolate over the water – do not let the base touch the water.

Stir occasionally until the mixture is melted and combined, then set aside to cool slightly.

In a bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then add the sugar and whisk again until the meringue mixture is thick and glossy. Stir 50g of the crème fraîche into the chocolate mixture, then stir in one-third of the meringue mixture and all of the salt.

Summer Pudding 6 Smart Points

This treat promises to be bursting in flavour so for a delicious and healthy dessert, follow this recipe for Summer Pudding

Serves 6

250g raspberries

250g blackberries

200g cherries, pitted and halved

2½tbsp caster sugar

600g strawberries, hulled

9 slices thick-sliced white bread, crusts trimmed

200g 0% fat natural Greek yoghurt

Line a 2ltr pudding basin with a double layer of clingfilm, making sure there is a good amount of overhang. Put the raspberries, blackberries and cherries into a large pan with 3tbsp water and the sugar, then bring to a simmer over a low heat. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the strawberries and cook for 2 minutes, until the fruit has slightly softened and released some of its juice. Strain over a large bowl.

Dunk 1 slice of bread into the strained fruit juices, then press it into the base of the prepared pudding basin. Set aside another slice of bread for the top and cut the remaining 7 slices into thin strips.

Briefly dunk each strip in the juices then place around the inside of the basin, pushing together so you have a basin lined entirely with bread, with none of the inside of the basin showing. Spoon the fruit into the bread-lined basin, pouring any spare juice over the bread as you go. Cut the final piece to fit the top, tucking it in. Bring the clingfilm up and over the top of the pudding.

Place a plate and heavy weight on top, then chill overnight. Remove the weight, plate and clingfilm, then slide a palette knife between the bread and the basin to dislodge the pudding. Turn out onto a plate, discard the clingfilm and serve with the natural yoghurt.

Cinnamon ‘Ice Cream’ with Warm Apples & Filo Cigarillos 1 Smart Point

This stylish and tasty dessert costs just one Smart Point, making it the perfect choice, so perhaps you should follow the recipe for Cinnamon ‘Ice Cream’ with Warm Apples & Filo Cigarillos

Serves 4

4 ripe medium bananas, unpeeled

2tsp ground cinnamon

For the cigarillos

45g sheet filo pastry

Calorie controlled cooking spray

½tsp icing sugar

For the apples

4 Jazz apples, unpeeled

1tsp light brown sugar

Freeze the bananas in their skins for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight. Then take them out of the freezer and leave to stand for 10 minutes. The skin should now easily slice off with a sharp knife, so peel it off and discard, then chop the flesh into chunky slices.

Pop the banana slices into a food processor and pulse a few times until a smooth ‘ice cream’ forms. Stir in the cinnamon, then scoop into 4 individual portions, place on a plate and refreeze until ready to serve. Defrost slightly if it becomes too hard.

To make the cigarillos (you can do this in advance), preheat the oven to 200°C/fan 180°C/gas 6. Using a sharp knife, cut the filo into 8 rough squares. Starting at one corner, roll each square up tightly to form a cigarillo.

Mist with cooking spray and sprinkle with the icing sugar. Bake for 10 minutes until crisp and golden. These are best served warm, so if you made them in advance, gently reheat.

Meanwhile, quarter and core the apples, then cut into wedges. Heat gently in a pan with the sugar until soft but with a bite – about 10-15 minutes. Serve the apples topped with the ‘ice cream’ and cigarillos.

Fresh Berry Sponge 6 SmartPoints

1tbsp icing sugar

2tbsp lemon curd, mixed with

1tbsp hot water

200g raspberries

100g blueberries

Fresh mint leaves, to decorate

TASTY TIP If you prefer, you can use strawberries instead of the raspberries here Advertisement

Preheat the oven to 220°C/fan 200°C/gas 7. Mist two 18cm sandwich tins with the cooking spray and line the bases with circles of baking paper.

Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat the eggs and sugar in a large bowl until very pale and light in texture – this will take about 5 minutes on full power.

Sift the flour into the mixture and fold it through using a large metal spoon. Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and level the tops.

Bake for 8-9 minutes until golden brown and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and turn out of the tins onto a cooling rack.

Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave until completely cold. Remove the lining paper. Mix together the soft cheese, lemon zest and icing sugar. Spread half the mixture over the top of one sponge, then spread the lemon curd over it. Top with most of the berries. Sandwich the 2 cakes together and decorate the top with the rest of the soft cheese mixture, the remaining berries and the mint.

You’ve likely heard by now that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant over the weekend because of her ties to the Trump administration.

Stephanie Wilkinson, co-owner of the Red Hen, a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, told the Washington Post that several of her employees are gay and were not comfortable serving Sanders, who regularly defends Trump’s anti-LGBTQ policies, including his ban on transgender people in the military.

After news broke that Sanders was asked to leave the restaurant, Republicans were quick to criticize the business owners, accusing them of discrimination.

Even Donald Trump himself took aim at the restaurant:

The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018

But Republican strategist Ana Navarro put it best when she tweeted:

Some who defend baker’s right to refuse service to gay couples, whine re ppl refusing service to a person who’s the face of a deceitful Administration. What’s good for the goose, is good for the Red Hen. Difference is, being gay is not a choice. Being an accomplice to Trump, is. — Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) June 24, 2018

FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva and UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay today signed a new Memorandum of Understanding in Paris. It comes more than 70 years after the first partnership signed between the agencies.

""This new agreement opens a new chapter in the relationship between our two organizations,"" said FAO's Graziano da Silva. ""We need to work closely together to accelerate our efforts towards the goals set out under Agenda 2030.""

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay welcomed reinforced collaboration between UNESCO and FAO as two key Specialized Agencies of the UN system. ""The nexus between education, culture, food, and health is at the center of many of the challenges faced in this century"", she highlighted. ""We are committed to strengthening our collaboration in these areas to create sustainable futures for societies.""

Under the partnership, FAO and UNESCO have agreed to support the development of learning modules, teaching aids and practical sessions for agricultural secondary schools, universities and farmer field schools on food security and sustainable food systems. The agencies will also explore opportunities for nutrition education and healthy nutrition in schools.

This builds on the joint work already being carried out in South Sudan's cattle camps, where literacy and numeracy training by UNESCO is incorporated into FAO's Pastoral Field School approach. This means young people can access a formal school curriculum as well as topics on livestock management and livelihoods' diversification.

FAO and UNESCO will also develop a joint knowledge-sharing platform on the nexus between food, culture, and peace, and develop special education projects in poor, rural conflict-affected areas.

The two agencies in cooperation with international organizations, governments, and large youth organizations will develop a global platform for young people to become champions of the SDGs in their local communities, and an international award will honor outstanding contributions.

FAO will also continue work on the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems, and build on the existing cooperation with UNESCO's World Heritage Systems.

The cooperation will also further explore synergies between UNESCO's 1972 World Heritage Convention and FAO's GIAHS in the field of sustainable fisheries, wildlife conservation and protected areas, climate change, and forests. The agencies will also work to identify elements of living heritage related to agricultural heritage systems and review measures to safeguard them at the national level.","The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have renewed their partnership to boost efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including the goal of Zero Hunger.

The policy, which some officials say started early May, directed the prosecution of all immigrants who entered the United States illegally and led to the separation of children and parents traveling together. (Trump signed an order to stop the separations, but not the policy, June 20.)

In its release of June border data, the Department of Homeland Security credited the policy for a dip in migration numbers.

But immigration experts said the success of one policy change is unclear with just a month’s worth of data. There is a long pattern of southwest border apprehensions declining from May to June.

Here are the facts.

June’s southwest border data not an anomaly

Immigration officials made 34,114 southwest border apprehensions in June, a 15 percent decline from 40,338 in May.

That’s in line with a long-standing trend. Border Patrol data shows that June apprehensions have been lower than May’s every fiscal year since 2000, with the exception of 2017.

DHS spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton pegged a decline that’s slightly bigger in a July 5 news release: ""Following the implementation of the administration’s zero-tolerance policy, the June 2018 Southwest Border Migration numbers declined by 18 percent when compared to the previous month.""

The 18 percent decline accounts for border apprehensions and inadmissibility numbers. Apprehension data is a way of tracking illegal entry, while inadmissibility is a metric of people seeking, but denied, lawful admission at ports of entry.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency within DHS responsible for border security, noted in its website that the May-June decline ""follows the overall downward trend for this time of year.""

A narrower look at the data also shows that the number of family members apprehended in June compared to May wasn’t significantly different. There were 9,485 in May and 9,449 in June.

There still isn’t enough time or data available to judge the impact of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, said Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low-immigration levels.

""The May to June drop doesn't look all that remarkable,"" said Jacob L. Vigdor, a professor of public policy and governance at the University of Washington.

Broad shifts in policy, changes in the number of migrants intending to cross the border, and the Border Patrol’s effort or success from month to month can all impact the fluctuating apprehension numbers, Vigdor said.

""While some might look at that May to June drop and say it's a sign of the administration's success, others could look at the same data and note that the last four months — March through June — represent the four highest apprehension totals since Trump took office,"" Vigdor said.

Pew Research Center analyzed apprehension data for family members and found that more family members were apprehended this January to June period than any other January to June span since at least 2012.

Most of the social science research on the border has confirmed that the decision to come to the United States illegally is driven by factors such as economic and political conditions and violence, not by changes in U.S. immigration policies, said Everard Meade, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.

Regarding the administration’s claim of a crisis at the border, ""there's no empirical case for it,"" Meade said. Overall, fewer people are trying to get in than in recent years, and there are more resources and personnel securing the border, Meade said.

""When we say something is a crisis, that creates a pretext for setting aside our normal way of debating an issue, but also creates an excuse for not following common procedures,"" Meade said.

In a June 6 statement reporting an increase in illegal crossings from April to May, DHS said it will take time and help from Congress to reduce illegal immigration.

""No one expects to reverse years of political inaction overnight or in a month,"" Houlton, the department spokesman, said. ""It is also clear change will take more than administration action alone.""","The Donald Trump administration billed its ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy as an escalated effort needed to address a ""crisis"" at the border, even though apprehensions were at their lowest point in decades.

The challenge was launched by The Climate Group and C40 Cities on 10 July 2018 in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), which will convene in San Francisco, US, from 12-14 September 2018. It urges the global auto industry to accelerate the manufacture of electric vehicles and increase production to fulfill growing demand, bringing together the collective purchasing power and influence on the market of stakeholders and existing programmes, which have until now been focused on separate sectors. In this way, the challenge provides an opportunity for the auto sector to take the lead in the large-scale transition to electric vehicles and help deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The ZEV Challenge calls on:

automakers to signal their willingness to work towards an endgame for combustion engine vehicles running on fossil fuels, and in the meantime, commit to a ZEV percentage of sales by 2025;

more multinational businesses to join EV100, which brings together forward-looking companies committed to fleet electrification and making electric transport the ‘new normal’ by 2030; and

states and regions to join a new Under2 Coalition ZEV initiative that focuses on procurement, infrastructure and policy.

The challenge is currently being supported by the State of California, EDF Energy, LeasePlan, Unilever, New York City, Paris, Los Angeles, London, Milan, Rome, Mexico City, Medellín, Copenhagen, Pittsburgh, and the regions of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Navarra, Spain.

The Navarra region of Spain has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them.

Several countries like France and the UK have already announced end dates for the sale of fossil fuel-run vehicles, and the State of California has committed to putting five million zero-emission vehicles on roads and highways by 2030.

Speaking about the challenge, Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto said governments have the purchasing power to force manufacturers to provide off-the-shelf electric vehicle technologies. Mexico City Mayor José Ramón Amieva said his city is already working on the country’s first electric bus corridor.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan noted the city’s introduction of the world’s first Ultra Low Emission Zone beginning in April 2019, which will provide the opportunity for industry and government to work together to create more sustainable cities. Shane Rattenbury, ACT Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability, noted the ACT government’s commitment to a zero emissions passenger vehicle fleet from 2019-2020 and a 100% renewable electricity supply from 2020.

Manu Ayerdi, Vice-President for Economic Development, Navarra, Spain, said his region has achieved an 82% increase in electric vehicles annually through progressive policies such as a 30% tax deduction for individuals and companies purchasing them. Medellín Mayor Federico Gutierrez Zuluaga said buses in the city’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system will be equipped with electric buses.

71,https://www.environmentalleader.com/2018/07/campbells-peachy-zero-waste/,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Environmental Leader,Just Peachy Salsa is Campbell's Zero-Waste & Revenue Stream Solution,"Six years ago, farmers in New Jersey were paying to send undersized or blemished peaches to the landfill. Campbell’s saw an opportunity to turn those peaches into salsa called Just Peachy, providing a new revenue stream for the local food bank. In a recent interview with Forbes, the company’s head of sustainability describes the corporate advantages.

Talking with local farmers and the food bank about what they needed, Campbell’s came up with a recipe for a shelf-stable peach salsa called Just Peachy. Nine Campbell’s suppliers offered up ingredients and packaging, while nearly 100 of the company’s employees volunteer to produce, box, and palletize the salsa.

The salsa gets sold by the Food Bank of South Jersey at retail outlets and farmer’s markets, and 100% of the proceeds go back to the food bank and its hunger relief programs.

“We want employees to be engaged and to see the entire process, and to feel like they’re actually making a difference in the community that’s tied into the business proposition for society,” David Stangis, VP of corporate responsibility and chief sustainability officer for Campbell’s Soup, told Forbes contributors Jim Ludema and Amber Johnson.

Since Just Peachy launched in August 2012, the effort has saved farmers money, headed off a waste stream, and raised more than $300,000 in revenue for the food bank. That has allowed the organization to provide more than half a million meals for food insecure residents in the area.

For Campbell’s, the partnership has produced several key corporate benefits:

It helped inform the company’s Real Food philosophy and led to other product ideas, Stangis told Forbes. “Inspired in part by the Just Peachy experience, the company has launched other efforts to explore how food waste can be a product development opportunity,” the contributors wrote.

During fiscal year 2017, the company contributed $61.9 million in global giving and 12,200 volunteer hours total. Just Peachy encourages a deep level of employee engagement and gives meaning to work, the Forbes authors say.

“Companies who connect their brand to positive social action earn strong reputations that encourage buying and customer loyalty,” the Forbes contributors pointed out. In April, the Reputation Institute named Campbell’s number one on their list of America’s Most Reputable Companies. The following month, Corporate Responsibility Magazine put the company on its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens for the ninth consecutive year.","Campbell’s saw an opportunity to turn those peaches into salsa called Just Peachy, providing a new revenue stream for the local food bank.

Yep, two years after its original scheduled theatrical release in September 2016 was delayed, it looks like Patient Zero will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD only, according to Bloody Disgusting, with a possible VOD release date to come.

The film was completed back in 2015 and was originally scheduled for release on September 2, 2016, but that date was then pushed back to February 17, 2017, before it was removed from Sony's schedule altogether last January.

The recent news means that audiences will finally get to see the film in full on October 23, 2018.

Alongside Smith, Patient Zero also stars Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games), Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones), and Agyness Deyn (Clash of the Titans). It is directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky.

The film's synopsis reads: ""An unprecedented global pandemic of a super strain of rabies has turned the majority of humankind into highly intelligent, streamlined killers known as 'The Infected'.

""One victim, Morgan (Matt Smith), who is asymptomatic and can communicate with the infected, leads the last survivors on a hunt for Patient Zero and a cure.""

Speaking about the film in 2015, Ruzowitzky said: ""The great days of zombies are a little bit over. It's time for something new.""

The director added that 'the infected' are ""much sexier"" than your traditional zombies. ""They have a lot of energy, they're fast, they're good-looking,"" he said. ""Not those walking vegetables.""

The books are scarce in public schools so many parents buy them for their children.

This country had been independent for nearly two decades by the time Rudaviro Mbango was born, but many Zimbabweans still believed in then-President Robert Mugabe’s promise of free education for everyone was alive.

The nation would prioritize high-quality schooling, Mugabe said. Even the poorest students would have an equal chance to learn. Somehow, Mugabe and his administration kept the allure of that promise alive, even as public education faltered. Eventually, students across the country complained that their schools didn’t have enough books or supplies. Poorly paid teachers struggled to make ends meet. And while tuition was technically free, parents worried about finding money to cover fees and other required costs.

Related: How Robert Mugabe became Zimbabwe’s leader and clung on till now

Mbango, now 20, says she couldn’t take her exams because her parents couldn’t afford to pay the $90 fee.

“l feel robbed of a chance to better my life,” she says.

Zimbabwe has long claimed to have a literacy rate near 100 percent, but it’s not clear whether that statistic is accurate. Many schools struggle to keep enough teachers in classrooms, so private tutoring is common among families who want to ensure that their children pass standardized tests. Even with tutoring, it’s not unusual for less than one-quarter of students to pass those tests.

Zimbabwe’s presidential election, set for July 30, is nearing, and many of the candidates say that reforming the education system is a top priority.

Elton Steers Mangoma, a candidate running under the Coalition of Democrats, says he hopes to give an opportunity to girls who are now in the situation that Mbango was in years ago.

“Those who can pay must pay, but those who can’t pay — their children will go to school,” he says.

Mangoma says he would ensure that girls in particular have a shot at an education.

Even if those girls don’t pass their exams, at least they’ll have learned something, he says.

But Noah Manyika, a presidential candidate running for the Build Zimbabwe Alliance party, says Zimbabwe’s economic crisis is the root cause of the nation’s faltering education system. If widespread poverty isn’t dealt with, he says, the quality of education will continue to fall.

“We have to fix the economy at first, and that will have an impact on the education sector,” he says.

Other candidates and their spokespeople echo similar sentiments.

Douglas Mwonzora, the secretary-general for Movement for Democratic Change Alliance, led by presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa, says education in his administration would be funded through foreign direct investment, private-public partnerships, taxes, overseas assistance and domestic savings and pensions. The key, he says, is to ensure that the money goes where it’s intended to go.

“Funding, in our view, is not going to be a problem,” he says. “It hasn’t been a problem in the education sector. It’s the misallocation of resources. … A lot of resources are wasted in bureaucratic overheads [and in] the funding of the ministry officials, at the expense of education.”

Under the new model, he says, education would be free for students through secondary school.

Meanwhile, Paul Mavhima, the minister of primary and secondary education, argues that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was part of a group that pushed Mugabe out of office in November, has made significant strides in improving Zimbabwe’s education system in the few months during which he’s been in office. Mnangagwa leads the ZANU-PF political party, which Mugabe once headed.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries provided an international development loan to Zimbabwe to open 17 schools, he says. Construction has started on all 17 schools, he adds.

Plus, he says, the government has spent $3.5 million to buy books and other supplies, all of which have been distributed. A second, $4-million phase has started, he says, which will provide more supplies and teaching materials to the schools.

Still, he says, the country needs 2,000 more schools. Those could be paid for through public-private partnerships with foreign investors, he says.

But even some ZANU-PF officials dispute this rosy outlook.

Joram Gumbo, the secretary of education within ZANU-PF, says the country desperately needs to provide practical training for its students.

School graduates wind up selling scratch-off cards with minutes for cellphone plans, he says, and they “can’t do anything to improve the economy.”

""This Is Zero Hour,"" the slogan and label of the worldwide marches, is aimed at clearly articulating the necessity of immediate and bold climate action as warming global temperatures continue to spark extreme weather events and wreak havoc, disproportionately inflicting irreversible harm on the poorest nations and most vulnerable communities.

A year of relentless organizing and planning in the making, the three days of action beginning Saturday are bolstered by a detailed and ambitious platform (pdf) that calls on political leaders to:

Respect the rights of Indigenous people;

""Recognize the constitutional right of youth to a livable climate"";

Eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies ""immediately""; and

""Ban all new fossil fuel infrastructure and make massive investment in local solar and wind energy companies"" in the coming years.

""Kids are suing the government, we're marching, we're lobbying, we're just pretty much just getting down and just begging them: Can I not have a world that’s totally falling apart?"" Jamie Margolin, a 16-year-old environmentalist, told the Huffington Post.

""Everything is on the line, so it's very hard to plan your future assuming that everything is going to be the same when you know it’s not,"" Margolin added. ""It's really scary, especially for a young person who is looking into what I want to do with my life... I just want to have a world to grow up in where I can live my life and not have to worry about such existential fears.""

13 August 2018, Rio de Janeiro - Improving the health of the world's soils is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger and combating climate change and its impacts, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva, today told participants of the World Congress of Soil Science.

In a video message to the event, which is being attended by more than 2,000 scientists from around the world, Graziano da Silva noted that approximately one third of the Earth's soil is degraded.

""Soil degradation affects food production, causing hunger and malnutrition, amplifying food-price volatility, forcing land abandonment and involuntary migration-leading millions into poverty,"" he said.

The FAO The Status of the World's Soil Resources report has identified 10 major threats to soil functions including soil erosion, soil nutrient imbalance, soil carbon and biodiversity losses, soil acidification, contamination, soil salinization, and soil compaction.

Graziano da Silva stressed the importance of sustainable soil management as an ""essential part of the Zero Hunger equation"" in a world where more than 815 million people are suffering from hunger and malnutrition.

Soils and climate change

""Although soils are hidden and frequently forgotten, we rely on them for our daily activities and for the future of the planet,"" the FAO Director-General said, underscoring the important role soils can play to support efforts by countries to mitigate or adapt to a changing climate.

In particular, he pointed to the potential of soils for carbon sequestration and storage, which has been documented in a global soil organic carbon map released by FAO. ""Maintaining and increasing soil carbon stock should become a priority,"" Graziano da Silva said.

He also noted how soils act as filters for contaminants, preventing their entry into the food chain and reaching water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, but that this potential is limited when contamination exceeds the capacity of soils to cope with pollution.

Global Soil Partnership

In his message, Graziano da Silva pointed to the Global Soil Partnership in which FAO works with governments and other partners to build technical capacity and exchange knowledge regarding sustainable soil management through the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management.

""Let us make make soils a vehicle of prosperity and peace, and show the contribution of soils to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,"" the FAO Director-General said.

""Maintaining and increasing soil carbon stock should become a priority,"" Graziano da Silva said.
""Let us make make soils a vehicle of prosperity and peace, and show the contribution of soils to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,"" the FAO Director-General said."

FAO Indonesia has kicked off its campaign for World Food Day in Bandung under the banner Road to Zero Hunger.

The campaign, which started on Aug. 5, is part of an awareness-raising programme for Indonesians, especially the youth and millennials, about food and nutrition issues in reaching zero hunger by 2030 as mandated under the Sustainable Development Goals.

""We want everyone, especially young people as well as food and culinary influencers, to realize that we still have many challenges to stop hunger in Indonesia by 2030, which include simple actions like eating more diverse foods, avoiding food waste and cooking meals correctly to improve nutrition,” Stephen Rudgard, the FAO representative in Indonesia, said in a statement on Thursday.

The campaign team will be on the road from August until October in four cities in Indonesia, including Yogyakarta, Kendari, Jakarta and Banjarmasin.

The campaign is working under the global theme of World Food Day ""Our Actions are Our Future; Zero Hunger 2030 is possible"".

According to the United Nations, more than 815 million people still suffer from chronic malnutrition, and the number has increased by 38 million since 2015. In Indonesia, 20 million people are still experiencing food insecurity and one in three children in Indonesia, even in West Java, experience chronic malnutrition or stunting.

FAO Indonesia partnered with community activators to stage an event called Masak Akhir Pekan (Cooking on the Weekend) in Bandung, which included discussions with students of Padjdajaran University’s Faculty of Food Industry about Indonesia’s path to reach zero hunger. (jun)

A total of $35,676,600 in funding will enable new states and communities across the US to deploy zero-emission Proterra battery-electric vehicles and related infrastructure.

Electric bus adoption is growing rapidly among a diverse group of transit agencies from coast-to-coast. The 23 winning transit agencies span 18 states from Alaska to New Mexico, Michigan and Maine, representing a new era of mobility as agencies in both red and blue states, and in rural and urban areas, implement electric transit programs. The Low-No grant funds will be used to purchase or lease Catalyst electric transit vehicles, battery systems and charging infrastructure. Transit agencies that partnered with Proterra on their grant applications include:

A cornerstone of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act passed by Congress and signed into law in December 2015, the Low-No grants support the development of transit buses and infrastructure that use advanced technologies. Eligible projects included those that replace, rehabilitate, lease or purchase buses, bus-related equipment and facilities. Projects also included workforce development components to train the next generation of U.S. transit talent. This marks the fifth consecutive year that Proterra’s partners have received the lion’s share of the grants awarded, underscoring Proterra’s popularity and success with transit agencies across the country. With Proterra Catalyst battery-electric, zero-emission buses, transit agencies improve their customer experience by offering a clean, quiet transit experience for riders. Adoption of all-electric buses is expected to improve the local air quality in each of the communities they serve, with zero tailpipe emissions. The 2018 Low-No grants represent a landmark year in the history of the program, with the greatest amount of funding awarded and 48 of 52 awards granted for battery-electric bus procurements.

“Now in our fifth year of Low-No Grant participation, it’s gratifying to see such widespread momentum and enthusiasm for zero-emission transportation and battery-electric fleets,” said Ryan Popple, Proterra CEO. “We commend these transit agencies for their efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption and build a cleaner, healthier future together.”","Proterra announced that 23 transit agencies have won Federal Transit Administration Low or No Emission Vehicle Deployment Grants (Low-No) for Proterra battery-electric buses and charging infrastructure.

In July, two girls from Allahabad University, Neha Yadav and Rama Yadav, and another student, Kishan Maurya, waved black flags in front of Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah’s convoy. They were protesting against the treatment of students by the Uttar Pradesh government. The response from the government was brutal. The flag-waving girls were dragged by the hair, beaten, and had cases slapped against them on charges of rioting and disturbing the peace.

This is not the first such case. Last year, another student from U.P., Pooja Shukla, had to spend nearly a month in jail for showing black flags to U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. There are two pertinent points to consider here: the black flag, and the person waving it, a university student. What is it about this combo that seems to terrify the state so much?

Also Read Lucknow varsity students face the music for blocking Yogi Adityanath

Waving a black flag is perhaps the most innocuous form of non-violent protest imaginable. It is not a dharna, it is not a march or a public rally, and it doesn’t involve the narrative build-up of a rousing speech — all of which are legitimate means of protest protected under the Indian Constitution. However, while all of these are collective expressions of dissent, requiring resources and coordination among a good number of like-minded people, waving a black flag requires nothing more than a piece of black cloth or a rag. It is a form of protest that is available to the lone individual, to a citizen unaffiliated to any political party or group but who nonetheless wants to communicate her dissent to a representative of the state that she believes has grown deaf to her complaints.

Unlike a hunger strike, which, too, is a means of protest available to the individual, waving a black flag doesn’t even need publicity from the mass media to build pressure in favour of thedemands. All that is needed is for a few others — fellow citizens, onlookers — to witness the few seconds of the gesture, and it is done. But today even this modest symbolic protest seems intolerable to the public servants of a country that prides itself on being a democracy.

What is particularly ironic is that the state’s reprisals — Ms. Shukla claimed that she has been denied admission to a postgraduate course because of her act of protest — are being visited upon girl students. This makes a mockery of the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign that is being propagated extensively using public money. Police cases and jail time, in addition to being academically disruptive, are bound to damage a young student’s career prospects. This is a steep price to pay for exercising one’s constitutional right. It is a worrying sign when a government that has seen scores of elected representatives emerge from student politics begins to display zero tolerance for political activism among students.

A plea to step up to the plate.

Matthew Hennessey has written a rallying cry for his generation. In Zero Hour for Gen X: How the Last Adult Generation Can Save America from Millennials, Hennessey, an editor at the Wall Street Journal, writes: “America stands anxiously on the cusp of an unknown future. Unlike the baby boomers, Generation X’s race is not yet run. Unlike the millennials, we remember what life was like before the Internet invaded and conquered nearly everything. In that memory resides the hope of our collective redemption, the seed of a renewal that could stem the rot, decay, erosion, and collapse all around us.” He talks about the book and the plea.

Kathryn Jean Lopez: You write: “Nothing seems like what it was anymore. Nothing seems like it will be what we thought it would be. Everything feels like it’s on the verge of radical change, or complete collapse.” And Gen X is going to save us?

Matthew Hennessey: Yes, that’s the general idea. When I say Gen X needs to “save the world” I’m of course being dramatic for the purpose of getting people’s attention. The way we save the world is not by forming a Gen X Rapid Reaction Strikeforce with a mission to somehow make it 1985 again –although that would be cool and I would join– but by adjusting how we live in relation to the technologies that have come to dominate everything we do. Some of the changes I suggest are subtle and some are quite dramatic. My point is that Gen X will soon be the only ones who remember what life was like before these technologies came along. Someone needs to keep the flame alive. I don’t see anyone else stepping up to do it, so the job is ours.

Advertisement

Lopez: Who are you talking to exactly? Who are the Gen Xers? And surely you’re not talking to every single one of us?

Hennessey: Yes. That’s why I’m yelling.

Advertisement

Gen Xers were born between about 1965 and 1980. The definitions of all these generations are a little loose and people will often quibble with the cutoffs. I don’t pretend that these designations are like the age cutoffs for entering kindergarten or something.

Lopez: “Do not go quietly into the good night of millennial domination, whether in your professional or personal life,” you write. “Stand up for regular order, face-to-face meetings, and systems that reward merit over all else. Celebrate experience. Find a way to promote humanistic values. Don’t let childish ignorance or the promise of a utopian future steamroll your sense of right and wrong. Give as good as you get, even as the grey hairs form on your temple, as technological change outpaces your ability—and desire to keep up, and your 20/20 vision begins to blur. Gen X may be small, but we are tough. Our specific experiences should allow us to punch over our weight.” What do you have against Millennials?

Hennessey: You assume I have something against Millennials, but I really don’t. The word is useful to me mostly as a proxy for the app-soaked, Millennial-friendly world that is still busy being born all around us. I work at the Wall Street Journal with some great Millennials, who are clever, kind, and not always staring at their phones. If they ended up running the world I’d be thrilled.

If you read Zero Hour you will see I have some contrary opinions about culture’s drift toward a utopian, semi-socialist techno-paradise premised on the idea that privacy, free speech, edgy comedy, and newspapers have outlived their usefulness. Millennials don’t appear terribly worried about where things are going. I want them to wise up. So this book is aimed as much at them as it is at Gen Xers. There’s a hunger among younger people for a more authentic way of living. You see it in the hobbying around vinyl records, vintage fashion, artisanal gin, and old-timey bikes. Some of that is posturing , but some of it, I think, betrays a real longing for a simpler time.

Lopez: You blame Baby Boomers for “the American jungle of imperfect justice, war, sky-high debt, hyper-partisanship, and cultural decay.” You say it’s “their dream of peace and harmony gave way to the nightmare of a diseased political culture, where every election is potentially the end of the world and where it’s almost always mandatory to impugn the other guy’s motives.” Did you not get Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire” message about his generation?

Hennessey: The Piano Man doth protest too much. I once started a fire in our house. The first thing I said was, “Mom, I didn’t start this fire.” She wasn’t fooled, and nobody else should be either. With their cheeks covered in ash and smoke rising from their hair, baby Boomers have the nerve to stand there and say they didn’t start the fire.

Baby Boomers got a few things right — civil rights, the Beatles, I might be able to think of something else if I had a little more time — but they got most of the big questions wrong. They went to war on American institutions, from the military to the family, and for no good reason that I can see. They are, as Paul Begala once called them, a “garbage barge” of a generation. I don’t think it’s really up for discussion.

Lopez: You describe your thesis as: “If Generation X doesn’t get its act together — and fast — we . . . will have the rug pulled out from under us just as we’re on the verge of realizing our potential.” What does it mean to realize our potential these days? Is it the same as it ever was?

Advertisement

Advertisement

Hennessey: Yes and no. I’m talking specifically here about the danger of being invisible, leaving no mark. The Baby Boomers were a huge cohort, just massive, but the Millennials are even bigger. Now the Millennials are passing through the culture like a giant ostrich egg in the digestive tract of a python: impossible to miss. Gen X is a tiny robin’s egg by comparison. We are in real danger of going down in history as a blip. I’d rather that didn’t happen.

Lopez: What’s so special about Gen Xers?

Hennessey: What’s special about us is that we don’t think we’re that special. We were repeatedly told that the world didn’t give a crap about our self-esteem. Being raised in the long shadow of the baby boom convinced us that everything fun or interesting or important had already happened. Our older cousins constructed such a towering mythology around their own heroic young lives during the ’60s and ’70s that we stopped thinking of ourselves as living in a consequential era. For most of us that changed on 9/11.

We’re special because we grew up on playgrounds made of concrete. We rode bikes without helmets on our heads or pads on our knees. We left the house for hours at a time and our parents neither knew where we were nor had any way of getting in touch with us. Our upbringing wasn’t perfect, but for the most part we developed naturally the kind of free-range resilience that parents today pay good money for. We’re special because we remember.

Lopez: What is the tyranny of the “Internet of Things” and why are you waging a jihad against it?

Hennessey: The Internet of Things is what you get when science fiction merges with reality, but nobody stops to think whether it’s a good idea. I’m simply uninterested in living in a world where the refrigerator knows that I’m running low on butter and orders more on my behalf. Or, which is more likely, Amazon decides I’m using too many plastic straws and cuts me off. We are adults. We don’t need this nonsense. Not because it won’t be convenient — it will be very convenient — but the tradeoffs in terms of privacy, ultimately, will be unbearable.

Lopez: Why do you invoke William F. Buckley in your cause?

Advertisement

Hennessey: That might be slightly overstating it. In the book, I allude to the famous line about standing athwart history yelling “Stop!” Enough on the right and left will appreciate the reference — at least I hope so. I never met Mr. Buckley, though, based on what I’ve heard, I suspect he would share my antipathy to the Amazon Echo (though maybe he would have enjoyed a driverless car that allowed him to type out his column in the back seat while hurtling up to Stamford on the Merritt Parkway).

Lopez: You and I care very much about the Catholic Church. Especially as a new season of scandals has opened, what must Gen X Catholics do? Including Gen X priests?

Hennessey: What an interesting question. Zero Hour isn’t a religious book, and I can imagine a certain type of critic saying, “Hey, Hennessey, you sound like you’re arguing for a Benedict Option — don’t you have the guts to come out and say it?” But I’m a big fan of doing one thing at a time. Maybe there will be a second volume that specifically addresses the faith component of my little thesis.

For now, I think it’s enough to say that Gen X priests — and the Gen Xers who are raising faithful families — can make use of the same advantages in their parishes and local communities that I describe in these other contexts. Parents need to put down the phone and pick up the Catechism (I don’t pretend to be great at this). A good social-media priest can be enjoyable, but priests ought not to be striving for blue check marks. Some prominent priests on Twitter seem better at stoking division and riling people up than they are at bringing people into closer communion with Jesus Christ. Come drink at our parties and barbecues. Play basketball with our sons. All this will do far more to fill the pews with young people than your bad priest jokes on Facebook.

Also, please, pastors, principals, and Catholic educators, stop this awful march to outfit our Catholic schools with whiteboards, iPads, and all other enemies of concentration and reflection that public schools have so eagerly embraced. Let’s make Catholic schools different. You know, how they used to be.

Lopez: How did your father show you “what it means to be a good man”?

Hennessey: By being a good man himself, day in and day out. He’s 83 and he’s still a good man. A great man, in fact. He helped a lot of people during his life — I mean a lot of people — but he never advertised his good deeds. He had, and has, strong political views, but he never held it against others if they didn’t see the world his way. He’s fair, compassionate, strong, reliable, and funny. If I end up half the man he is, I’ll consider my life a success.

Lopez: How do you write a book on a train while commuting?

Hennessey: With a laptop.

Akbayan Representative Tom Villarin, highlighting the recent ""lewd"" federalism video of PCOO Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson, enumerated instances showing the incompetence of the Communications Department.

""This is not the first time that the PCOO has made a fool of itself. Simple errors in spelling or grammar are indicators of the huge error in appointing officials who are not up for the task of informing our people accurately, sufficiently, and responsibly,"" he said in a statement on Monday, with the hashtag #ZeroBudgetPCOO.

In June alone, PCOO committed three blunders. It said ""Norwegia"" instead of ""Norway,"" and then a few days later, it referred to late former National Security Adviser Roilo Golez as ""Rogelio."" It also wrongly identified Senator Sherwin ""Win"" Gatchalian as ""Winston.""

""If this is where our taxes go, perhaps it's time to remove its budget and use it for what our people truly need,"" Villarin said.

Related: Roque hopes PCOO learns from recent blunders

This call was also echoed by women's group Every Woman, who also called for the resignation of Uson for the ""sexualizing"" of the issue of federalism.

""In light of another unbelievable gaffe on the part of the PCOO, we also protest its request to increase its budget. We suggest the budget be reduced to zero. #ZeroBudgetPCOO #FireMocha,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday.

Based on the presentation of economic managers during the Senate hearing, PCOO has a P1.5 billion proposed budget for 2019 from this year's actual budget of P1.4 billion.

Senator Grace Poe called out PCOO for its request for a budget increase while other departments, such as the Departments of Education, Health, Agriculture, and Social Welfare, are getting ""deep cuts"" in their allocations.

27 September 2018, New York - Gender gaps in agriculture in Africa are holding back progress towards ending hunger and must be urgently addressed, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Director-General José Graziano da Silva said at a joint event with the African Union (AU) on the margins of the UN General Assembly.

""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition. For that, we must close persisting gender gaps in agriculture in Africa,"" Graziano da Silva said.

The Director-General called for better representation of women in governance mechanisms and decision-making processes, as well as adequate and equal access to land, financial resources, social protection programmes, services and opportunities for women in rural areas.

Addressing gender gaps

The findings and recommendations of the AU-FAO study The Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems were presented at the event. The Outlook is based on an extensive review of existing statistics, gender audits of 38 National Agricultural Investment Plans and in-depth country gender assessments carried out in 40 countries.

The study's recommendations call for a ""gender data revolution"" in the agri-food sector to inform sound policies and programmes, and elevating the gender benchmarks in planning, monitoring and accountability.

""We need to put in place gender targeted programmes that address women's specific vulnerabilities but also their key role in household nutrition and resilience,"" Graziano da Silva said.

""Evidence shows that when women are empowered, farms are more productive, natural resources are better managed, nutrition is improved, and livelihoods are more secure,"" he added.

The backbone of rural production

In some African countries, women account for up to 60 percent of the labour force in family farming. They are largely responsible for agricultural activities such as growing vegetables, preserving harvests and raising small ruminants such as sheep and goats. Women are also responsible for family nutrition through the preparation of meals.

Closing productivity gaps could increase food production and consumption by up to 10 percent and reduce poverty by up to 13 percent.

If women have the same access to skills, resources and opportunities as men, they can be powerful drivers in the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Empowering women in agriculture, value chains and trade will accelerate the achievement of the Malabo Commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals.

FAO and UN Women: building momentum on gender equality

On the sidelines of the event, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo met with UN Women's Deputy Executive Director Asa Regner.

UN Women recently commended FAO for its achievements so far in gender equality. In 2017, FAO met or exceeded 93 percent of all performance indicators under the UN System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

""FAO recognizes the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment - both within the Organization and in our work where gender is a major priority. We know that when women have decision-making power, all of society benefits,"" Semedo said.

""The partnership between UN Women and FAO has proven especially fruitful in turning words into concrete action. I look forward to continued, strengthened cooperation between the two agencies to unlock the potential of rural women and girls as agents of change,"" Regner said.

Equality in action

FAO and partners are providing technical support to many African countries in order to empower rural women. One example is the Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Women in Ethiopia, Liberia, Niger and Rwanda, implemented with the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and UN Women. The Programme has already enabled more than 40,000 women to receive training on improved agricultural technologies, and aims to enhance their access to financial services and markets.","""We need to better recognize and harness the fundamental contribution of women to food security and nutrition.

Statistics published by Reuters also show that indigenous peoples, of which there are around 5000 different communities across the world, constitute 15% of those reportedly in a position of extreme hunger and poverty.

Speaking to the Mexico City Forum on Indigenous Women, FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva commented, “indigenous women face a triple discrimination – poverty, gender and ethnicity, both within and outside their communities – making them highly vulnerable.”

It is no surprise, therefore, that the UN Food and Agriculture organisation (FAO) argue that tackling malnutrition among female indigenous communities is a critically important aspect of solving the issue of world hunger.

For this reason, the UN is working with the International Forum of Indigenous Women and the News Agency for Indigenous and Afro-descendant Women in a global campaign entitled #IndigenousWomen Visible Women to highlight the discrimination they face around the world.

Yesterday, September 5, marked the celebration of Indigenous Women Day, which saw the FAO make another special call for 30 South American leaders to join the campaign for the empowerment of indigenous women.

This year’s celebration also marked the introduction of an initiative labelled ‘violet chair,’ an urgent call to encourage the participation of indigenous women in Zero Hunger policy discussions, behind the metaphor of a seat at the table.

“We cannot be short of food…corn… plantain… these are the foods that characterise our countries,” said Indira Vargas, a member of the Ecuadorian Quechua indigenous people, in a Visible Women campaign video.

“It is important to make indigenous women visible because it is a debt that states still owe indigenous towns and particularly indigenous women,” Salvadorian Betty Elisa Perez Valiente of the Nahuat Pipil community stated in an FAO campaign video.

In Mexico, advances in this area have already been made as July’s presidential election saw the first indigenous woman, traditional healer and Nahua speaker Maria de Jesus Patricio Martinez, run as a presidential candidate.","According to the United Nations, indigenous women have higher malnutrition rates than any other social group and typically earn a lot less than men, putting them at a serious disadvantage.

Kaleemullah, 35, has frequent visits to Basic Health Unit Iskalkoo these days with his two and half years old boy Abdul Rauf, who doctors say is malnourished, to get checked and receive the prescribed Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), the Plumpy’Nut specifically designed to treat acute malnutrition without complications. However, he returns his home hopelessly, when he is told that the program of Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition has not been relaunched.

Kaleemullah’s son was one of more than one hundred beneficiaries of “Food for Peace project”, A project for acute malnourished children at UC Iskalkoo of district Kalat in Balochistan. “My son was very weak but later he recovered and could walk but the closure of government run project has again left my child exposed to danger of being malnourished,” Kaleemullah told this reporter.

Back in, 10 centers to treat malnourished children were established in district Kalat – with the support of UNICEF in nine districts. Hundreds of registered children received Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) under the project, according to Rais Manzoor Ahmed, former District Nutrition Coordinator of “Food for Peace”.

Talking to this scribe, Rais said: “We have received some death reports of malnourished children who were part of nutrition project; it is feared that their deaths have been caused due to poor health.”

“A large number of poor people wait for a such a project to feed their children. Having seen the demand of people for healthy life of their children we suggest that all the BHUs and other health centers including DHQs of Kalat and Sikandar Abad should be included in such programs since Kalat is one of the poorest districts of Balochistan and such steps can help tackle malnutrition,” Rais Manzoor suggested.

When it comes to malnutrition, Kaleemullah’s son is not the first child who has worried his family members but there are thousands of children in Balochistan who suffer from malnutrition in Balochistan, the largest province of Pakistan in terms of area with least population. The nutrition wing of the National Health Services (NHS) has reveled in a recent report that nearly 80% of the children between the age of six and 25 months do not get a balanced diet leading to stunted growth, women and children are the immediate challenges being faced by the people in Balochistan.

Poverty is marked as the chief cause of malnutrition in Balochistan. United Nations Development Program in its recent report in 2018, has ranked Balochistan the poorest province of the country. Each province has been ranked on its citizens living below the poverty lines. Which is defined living on less than the $2 a day. It should be noted that in 2014, the World Health Organization(WHO) declared a state of emergency in Balochistan in consideration of the indicators of acute malnutrition. Due to the poverty in Balochistan, children remain severely and moderately malnourished.

Provincial Manager Balochistan Nutrition Program for Mothers and Children Dr. Ali Nasir Bugti says that Malnutrition refers to the abnormal physiological condition caused by deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in energy and/or nutrients necessary for an active, healthy life. Malnutrition includes undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity. These conditions can arise separately or coexist.

Talking to the Balochistan Point, Dr. Ali Nasir Bugti said: “Major percentage of Population living in Balochistan is food insecure. Food insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life that is missing in Balochistan.”

“For people to be food secure, food must be available in sufficient quantities – whether it may be obtained from home-grown, locally grown or imported from elsewhere. Adding more he said acute food insecurity and malnutrition are any manifestation of food insecurity found in a specified area at a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration,” Dr. Ali Nasir added.

According to the nutrition experts in Balochistan, the province is confronting serious issues of malnutrition, despite utilization of wealth and projects implemented by government, national and international organizations, there has been no remarkable improvement for many years.

The World Food Program officials state that 61% population in Balochistan is food insecure, whereas out of 20 foods insecure districts 10 are in Balochistan because 40% children are underweight, 52% ate stunned and 16% are wasted. In terms of other demographics 49% women are anemic along with 57% children are anemic.

BNPMC office has shared that 54.9% of women are vitamin A deficient whereas 73.5% children are suffering from vitamin A deficiency. On the other hand, 48.9 % of women and 56.8% of children are iron deficient in Balochistan.

Nutrition experts estimate that nearly 63 percent of households in the province are food insecure and Malnutrition rates in Balochistan are alarmingly high. Currently, more than half of all children under five are stunted – have low growth for their age – and 16 percent of the population is malnourished. According to a Survey conducted by the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) in 2011, almost 58 percent of Pakistanis are food insecure.

Gul Khan Naseer, Member Executive Council Scaling Up Nutrition Civil Society Alliance (SUN-CSA) Pakistan says that People in Pakistan are facing nutrition crisis while in Balochistan almost 83 percent of households are deprived of requisite nutrition. Mostly rural communities are affected by this problem. World Food Programme (WFP) has revealed that in Pakistan two out of every three households cannot afford a proper diet and in Balochistan, the situation is worst.

Talking to the Balochistan Point Gul Khan Naseer, said: “The first 1000 days (constituting 9 months of pregnancy and the first two years of life) is a crucial period as the damages of malnutrition during this period have profound and largely irreversible effects on health, brain development, intelligence, educational attainment, and productivity.”

“Balochistan Nutrition Program for Mothers & Children (BNPMC) is a good initiative of the Government that is addressing the malnutrition issue in seven districts of the Province, it must be expended to all the districts of Balochistan on emergency basis to address this major issue and a detailed and effective Health Policy is required to address the issue of malnutrition, promotion of breastfeeding and behavior change,” Gull Khan added.

Gull Khan is of the view that school level feeding programs have also been effective in past; such programs may be started again to provide nutritious food supplement to school going children at primary school level particularly in rural areas. “The Health Department, Nutrition cell, food department, education department, BNPMC and NGOs working on nutrition must jointly plan and implement awareness and behavior change campaigns and projects in the province with an at least 05-year plan,” Gul Khan Naseer suggested.

Pakistan is a signatory to The UN Sustainable Development Goals, that also aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030. Zero Hunger is one of the 17 Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Dr.Ali Nasir Bugti said that ending or controlling Malnutrition was a multi-context sectoral approach and liaising is fore mostly acquired but this could not be dealt alone by the Health Department or the Nutrition Program. “To this devastating situation Government must constitute a Nutrition Directorate on immediate basis where all departments i.e. Food, Fisheries, Agriculture, Social welfare, Local government, Information, Education, Livestock, Forestry, PHE, Irrigation etc have their representatives that work in a coordinated manner,” Said Dr. Bugti.

The initiative unites 38 signatories, including businesses, cities, states and regions, in their ambition to eliminate carbon emissions from buildings to save 209 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2050.

Construction and operation of buildings is responsible for 36% of global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. To reduce these emissions, governments around the world are developing standards for zero or near-zero emissions buildings and policies that aim to eliminate carbon emissions from buildings by increasing their energy efficiency and sourcing power from on-site or off-site renewable energy sources.

Under WGBC’s initiative, 22 cities, and four states and regions commit to enact regulations or policies that will require new buildings to be net zero carbon from 2030 onward, and for existing buildings to eliminate operational emissions by 2050. The 12 participating businesses set targets to eliminate operational carbon emissions from 10.7 million square meters of building space by 2030, aiming to support a wider market transformation towards net zero carbon buildings by 2050.

Industry, mayors and governors are willing to take drastic action to prevent catastrophic climate change.

In its press release, WGBC notes that the combined commitments will lead to a reduction of 209 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) by 2050. It further states that the commitment proves that “industry, mayors and governors are willing to take drastic action to prevent catastrophic climate change and create more comfortable, healthy and future-proofed environments for their employees and residents to occupy.”

Business partners to the Commitment were recruited in collaboration with the Green Building Council Network; cities were recruited in partnership with C40; and the selection of states and regions was supported by The Climate Group as Secretariat of the Under2 Coalition.

The Declaration notes that waste management is a primary service provided by city governments, and “is a sector over which mayors exercise significant authority.” It highlights that waste generation is increasing faster than any other environmental pollutant, and that action in the sector can reduce global emissions by up to 20%. The signatory cities and regions will avoid the disposal of at least 87 million tons of waste by 2030.

Waste management is key for cities to rapidly lower their emissions.

The commitments, made in advance of the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in San Francisco, US, aim to support the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Declaration underscores that global food waste alone amounts to 1.3 billion tons per year, and, upon decay, produces significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), but that when separated and treated, can enhance soils’ carbon capture capacity.

In order to achieve the commitments laid out in the Declaration, cities, regions and their leaders will:

reduce food loss and waste by decreasing losses along supply chains, minimizing the production of surplus food, and facilitating safe food donation;

implement source separated collection for food scraps and treatment infrastructure that recovers nutrients and energy;

support policies such as extended producer responsibility and sustainable procurement to reduce or ban single-use and non-recyclable plastics, while improving goods’ reparability and recyclability;

increase reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling of construction materials;

increase accessibility, awareness, scale and inclusivity of reduction, reutilization and recycling programmes and policies for communities; and

publicly report on the progress the cities are making towards their commitments.

In support of the Declaration, Mayor of Milan Guiseppe Sala emphasized that “waste management is key for cities to rapidly lower their emissions.”

(US); Paris (France); Rotterdam (the Netherlands); Sydney (Australia); Tel Aviv (Israel); and Tokyo (Japan) committed to the pledge. Combined, the cities are home to over 150 million inhabitants. [Advancing Towards Zero Waste Declaration] [23 Global Cities and Regions Advance towards Zero Waste]","28 August 2018: Leaders from 23 cities and regions have signed C40’s ‘Advancing Towards Zero Waste Declaration.’ The Declaration commits signatories to reduce the amount of waste generated by each citizen by 15%, reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and incineration by 50% and increase the diversion rate to 70% by 2030.
The signatory cities and regions will avoid the disposal of at least 87 million tons of waste by 2030.
Waste management is key for cities to rapidly lower their emissions.
The Declaration underscores that global food waste alone amounts to 1.3 billion tons per year, and, upon decay, produces significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), but that when separated and treated, can enhance soils’ carbon capture capacity.

The GCAS convened from 12-14 September 2018 in San Francisco, US, and resulted in range of new climate commitments and announcements by subnational stakeholders.

During the dialogue on rapid transition to a net-zero society, participants shared stories and ideas on the leadership and change required to make zero emissions development a reality, including strengthening and expanding public and private sector partnerships and synergies.

The dialogue aimed to: help to set the scene for the GCAS by bringing the Talanoa spirit into the Summit through constructive and inclusive dialogue with inspiring stories; provide high-level inputs to the GCAS outcomes; and contribute to the development of high-level key messages to be presented at the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue during the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018.

Many NDCs do not incorporate the “best ideas and solutions,” which are currently being implemented at the sub-national level, said Frank Bainimarama.

During the dialogue, COP 23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama stressed that current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) “fall far short” of the Paris Agreement’s goals, noting that many NDCs do not incorporate the “best ideas and solutions,” which are currently being implemented at the subnational level. The event focused on the third of the three questions posed by the Talanoa Dialogue process: How do we get there?

Participants called on political and government leaders at all levels to set national, regional, sectoral and city-level targets, and create the necessary frameworks to establish “predictable economic and a socially-conscious environments.”

Dialogue participants called on business leaders to:

establish and ensure the necessary resources to achieve science-based targets, including creating an environment that encourages innovation;

expand their climate ambition into supply chains; and

motivate their peers to take action.

Additionally, the dialogue called on:

the investment community to commit their companies and clients to use financial resources to expand technologies, incorporate the assessment of climate-related risk and promote financial disclosure;

civil society leaders to call for responsible, committed and accountable governments and companies, and promote behavioral change; and

spiritual leaders to unlock spiritual pathways for addressing climate change by helping people to reconnect to “the wonders of nature and creation, nurture love for the planet and foster compassion and reconciliation.”

The Fijian COP 23 Presidency and the Office of the Governor of the State of California organized the event.

The COP 23 Presidency also hosted a finance-themed Talanoa dialogue on 14 September 2018, which brought together representatives from across the financial system to determine what is required to reach net zero emissions and contribute to the SDGs. The event was co-organized by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Climate Policy Institute.

Talanoa is a traditional Fijian word used across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue. The process aims to support governments in raising their national climate ambition as they prepare for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, where dialogue outcomes will be formally presented to governments to inform the next round of NDCs, along with helping to raise short-term ambition.

An editor on the CBS News national desk was calling and directed LaGanga to drive to downtown Manhattan to shoot what, at that time, was thought to be a small plane crash at the World Trade Center.

Mark LaGanga after he shot his footage at ground zero on September 11, 2001

LaGanga, now a 60 Minutes cameraman, tried to make sense of the nightmare unfolding in front of him as he raced down Manhattan's West Side Highway. Then he turned on his camera.

Seventeen years after the September 11th terrorist attack, the footage LaGanga captured provides a remarkable firsthand account of rescue workers at ground zero moments after the two planes hit. It also gives viewers a rare look at the 29 minutes of dust, confusion, and stillness in between the time the two World Trade Center towers collapsed.

""I saw the twin towers fall""

LaGanga arrived on the scene shortly after 10 am. He stood on his news truck to get a better angle of the smoke billowing out of the north tower, not realizing that the south tower behind it had already fallen.

""There was so much dust and the street signs were hard to see that it never really dawned on me that one tower already came down,"" he tells 60 Minutes Overtime in the video above.

As LaGanga walked from the highway toward the base of the north tower, he interviewed passing firemen, asking the question on everyone's mind: ""What happened?""

On the street near the remaining tower, New York City looked unrecognizable, hazy and monochromatic. A thick layer of dust and soot caked every surface. LaGanga turned his camera upward to film the north tower, smoldering and stark against a bright blue sky.

Minutes later, it too would collapse. LaGanga's camera kept rolling.

""It sounded like a jet flying over,"" he says. ""That's why I panned up.""

As the building fell in on itself, people sprinted down the street, panicked. An ensuing wave of smoke and dust engulfed LaGanga's lens, and the screen turned to black. Several minutes elapsed. Finally, he coughed.

""Boy, that was close,"" a voice said in the dark.

LaGanga tells Overtime that he returned to film the rescue and recovery at ground zero for a week after the attack. Remarkably, he says he's experienced no adverse health effects as a result of his time on the site.

Mark LaGanga today

Since then, LaGanga has continued working as a photojournalist, most recently for 60 Minutes.

""At the end of the day, what we're trying to do is capture real moments,"" he says. ""So you just kind of follow and try not to get in anyone's way. But document real moments of what's going on.""

The six-month challenge starts from October 1 until the end of March 2019.

To ensure safe work environment in construction sites, the Dubai Municipality has launched a challenge to enable contractors achieve no construction accidents.

The Zero Accident Construction Challenge allows contracting companies to compete to achieve the largest number of working hours in construction sites without causing accidents or violating requirements of safety and security.

Set for companies with at least 30 workers that are registered with the Dubai Municipality, the challenge targets 1,000 contracting companies. The six-month challenge starts from October 1 until the end of March 2019.

Abdullah Ali Mohammed, head of building control department at the Dubai Municipality, said the challenge aims to strengthen self-censorship among contractors rather than intensifying inspection visits and imposing sanctions.

The department will intensify its team visits on all construction sites across the city to provide guidance and direction to the engineering and technical staff of the contracting companies.

""We want to encourage the contractors to take all preventive and precautionary measures to protect workers and secure construction sites, using the methodologies of training and education of workers according to the nature of work and the needs of construction projects,"" said Mohammed.

Winning companies will be honoured on World Labour Day, which falls on May 1, with a number of incentives and privileges including a two-year commercial licence renewal and the ability to execute one project higher than the contractor's degree (higher by three floors).

Mohammed noted that the challenge enables a contracting company to join with all its projects. He urged construction companies with more than 30 workers to participate in this challenge.

The municipality currently oversees approximately 22,000 under-construction buildings coming up at an area of approximately 561 million square feet.

Abdullah Al Shezawi, director of the building control department at the municipality, said the civic body would work closely with contractors to promote the concept of positive safety.

""We will instruct companies to use training methodologies and educate workers according to the nature of their work and the needs of the construction projects,"" he noted.

""The contractors will intensify the auditing operations, train their manpower and use the latest technologies and equipment to complete working hours without accidents,"" said Al Shezawi.

The required work hours without accidents are based on the number of registered labourers of contracting companies.

Al Shezawi said categories of challenge have been created to include largest number of contracting companies to expand the scope of participation and winning.

""Through the initiative, we hope to protect life and property with innovative standards and mechanisms of work and by applying the provisions contained in the Dubai Municipality Building Safety Practice Manual,"" he added.

Interested applicants can fill in the e-participation form through the challenge link available in Dubai PBS system until September 30. A certificate of participation will be given to all contractors who join the challenge.

SDG2 includes five targets and three sub-targets, as well as 13 indicators.

2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.

ADVERTISEMENT

2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.

2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.

2.4 By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.

2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.

2.A Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries.

2.B Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.

2.C Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

Progress to date

The UN's most recent SDG progress report for SDG2 starts on a bleak note. ""After a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again,"" it states. ""Conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing the reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 more difficult.""

The increase in the global undernourishment rate is marginal - climbing from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11 per cent in 2016 - but it amounts to 38 million more people going hungry and the potential long term causes of the reversal have policymakers globally extremely worried. Is this a blip caused by food price spikes and protracted conflicts in parts of the Middle East and Africa or is this one of the clearest signs yet that long-projected climate impacts are starting to bite?

Either way, the implications are severe. Malnutrition-induced stunting - where children are too short for their age - is declining in almost every region, but it still impacts 22 per cent of children under five globally. Meanwhile, further evidence of a flawed global food system is provided by the fact that last year 51 million children under five were suffering from wasting, while 38 million were affected by obesity.

Assessing progress on agricultural sustainability remains difficult given the huge number of metrics involved and the massive variations from region to region, but one figure stands out that suggests governments are yet to fully recognise the scale of the challenge: government expenditure in the agricultural sector as a share of GDP fell from 0.38 per cent in 2001 to 0.23 per cent in 2016.

There are few, if any, large scale government-backed sustainable agriculture programmes in operation and R&D funding across the sector is also notoriously underpowered.

However, there is also a potentially encouraging explanation for the fall in government expenditure, as the UN notes progress has been made in reducing subsidies that distort world agricultural markets, with export subsidies having halved inside five years from $491m in 2010 to less than $200m in 2015.

Business implications

SDG2 mirrors SDG1 in its remarkable breadth. Everybody needs to eat; every business has a stake in the food supply chain, whether directly as producers or consumers of food, or indirectly through the need for healthy employees and stable, food-secure societies; every country needs a sustainable agricultural sector, arguably above all else.

As such, all businesses can support SDG2 by purchasing food with strong sustainability credentials, promoting good nutrition amongst staff and stakeholders, and lobbying for a greater policy focus on sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation.

However, it is for businesses with a direct role in the food supply chain where SDG2 will inevitably have the biggest impact. The inter-locking goals of ending hunger and poor nutrition while embracing sustainable agriculture that improves ""capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters"" requires sustained increased in yields and higher productivity. But such improvements need to be delivered without the unsustainable intensification that has accelerated soil and biodiversity loss in many parts of the world.

The goal's targets imply systems change across the agri-food industry centred on drastically improved supply chain transparency, ever closer co-operation between farmers - including developing economy smallholders - and end customers, increased R&D spend, a better understanding of ecosystem services, more effective policy interventions and subsidy reforms, and an end to gaming the food commodity market in a way that creates food price volatility.

Business risks

As the most recent UN progress report makes clear SDG2 will be very difficult to achieve. The world is engaged in a race against time to accelerate the adoption of sustainable agricultural methods and enhance food security at a faster rate than climate impacts undermine yields. A failure to win this race would see businesses the world over have to wrestle with rising food prices and the social and economic insecurity that would inevitably result.

More specifically, businesses operating in the food and agriculture space face a web of risks relating to both the supply chain disruption that will likely come if sustainable agricultural practices are not embraced and the disruption that will inevitably accompany attempts to push the sector towards new approaches.

Risks include increased climate impacts leading to higher food prices and availability risks, as well as food price spikes contributing to economic, social, and political instability.

At the same time changes to agricultural subsidies could spark a major shake out of the sector that could lead to further consolidation, while tighter regulations to protect ecosystems and measures to secure fairer deals for farmers at the end of the supply chain could leading to higher short term costs for some operators.

Finally, emerging biotechnologies and changing consumer appetites, such as the trend for vegetarianism, could destroy value and lead to stranded assets for firms that fail to adapt.

Business opportunities

The global effort to deliver on SDG2 should improve the long term risk profiles for all businesses and also create a raft of specific business opportunities arising from the transition to sustainable agricultural techniques.

Reduced levels of malnutrition and food price volatility is likely to result in stronger economic growth in emerging markets and reduced risks of economic, social, and political instability globally. Meanwhile, improved climate resilience and genetic diversity of seeds and livestock should help minimise wider climate and security risks.

Increased R&D across the agricultural sector promises to also unlock a new era of innovation for a highly conservative and inefficient industry, bringing massive resource and cost savings across the piece. At the same time the targeted doubling of yields promises improved financial returns throughout the supply chain.

Similarly, improved nutrition has the potential to bolster economic growth and enhance productivity through improved health across the workforce.

And the nascent trends towards vegetarianism and more sustainable agriculture promises to cut methane emissions, curb deforestation, enhance ecosystem services, and free up more land for biodiversity, while also opening up major new technology-led markets.

Ultimately, businesses that take a holistic approach to SDG2 demonstrating progress in supporting smallholders, protecting habitats, and promoting sustainable practices, while tackling hunger and delivering healthy products should reap dividends amongst an increasingly values-led employee and customer base.","Progress to dateThe UN's most recent SDG progress report for SDG2 starts on a bleak note.

Nelson Mandela once said, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” This belief resonates with the theme of World Food Day 2018 – Zero Hunger World is possible by 2030. Celebrated on 16 October each year to revisit the status of food and nutrition security, the World Food Day informs the global development discourse, and renews the pledge to end hunger and malnutrition. In recent years, food insecurity has also been viewed as a non-traditional security threat for poor regions. Food-poor people are more likely to be embroiled in conflict, particularly over natural resources.

The task ahead is daunting. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) (2016), around 11 per cent of the global population is suffering from chronic undernourishment. The absolute number of undernourished people is the largest in Asia (FAO, 2017). The prevalence of undernourishment is rising in South Asia, from 9.4 per cent in 2015 to 11.5 per cent in 2016 (FAO 2017). Wasting and stunting are the visible consequences of malnutrition. According to a joint report of UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank (2018), wasting prevalence in 2017 was estimated at almost 8 per cent across the globe. The same report underlines the fact that approximately two-thirds of all wasted children under five live in Asia.

The figures are more depressing in mountain regions such as the Hindukush Himalayas (HKH) where people face multiple challenges including poverty, inaccessibility, fragility, limited market access and climatic induced risks. In the HKH region, nearly 31 per cent of the population suffers from food insecurity, 50 per cent are malnourished, and women and children suffer the most.

There are many factors that influence food security; poverty and climate change are the two biggest challenges. Climate plays an important role in agriculture and changing temperatures,erratic rainfall and increasing frequency of extreme events have impacted agricultural activities everywhere, creating unfavourable conditions for food production. Further, the change from multi to mono cropping systems limits the diversity of agricultural products. Likewise, an increasing inclination towards cash crops and changing food habits restrict the dietary intake of people and may result in malnutrition, undernutrition and even micro-nutrient deficiencies. Food wastage is also an emerging challenge that undermines the efforts to end hunger and malnutrition. According to the FAO, the global volume of food wastage is estimated at 1.6 billion tonnes of primary product equivalents. Ending food waste is therefore crucial to achieving zero hunger by 2030.

In a developing country like Nepal, social structures also determine food availability, especially for women. Women tend to first feed their children and other members of the family before eating themselves. In doing so, their nutritional requirements are often unmet as they consume whatever is left after everyone else has eaten. Such scenarios are common in villages and rural settings not only in Nepal but also in India. Low agricultural investments and poor health, sanitation and childcare practices are other hindrances in achieving zero hunger.

In the light of these facts, it may seem impossible to see a world free of hunger by 2030. Yet, countries like China and Myanmar have reduced under nutrition substantially.

It is also important to look at the future of food production to achieve the zero hunger goal. New technologies and devices like mobile phones can be used for knowledge transfer to rural farmers on the food production cycle and market linkages. Agriculture is a huge business and it is important to create opportunities and careers for the younger generation to take up and practice agriculture in order to safeguard long-term food security.

Fighting hunger is a global mission and zero hunger is also one of the main Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires strong determination and commitment from individual nations. Formulating policies that support better agricultural investments, providing agriculture subsidies and incentives, promoting child and women health care, prioritising nutrition programmes, and boosting the production and consumption of climate resilient native nutritional crops are some of the elementary practices that will be crucial in defeating hunger and creating a zero hunger world by 2030.","Fighting hunger is a global mission and zero hunger is also one of the main Sustainable Development Goals, achieving which requires strong determination and commitment from individual nationsNelson Mandela once said, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.” This belief resonates with the theme of World Food Day 2018 – Zero Hunger World is possible by 2030.

This article is part of a series of opinion pieces to mark World Food Day October 16

José Graziano da Silva is Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

ROME, Oct 15 2018 (IPS) - Just three years ago, in September 2015, all United Nations Member States approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition (Sustainable Development Goal number 2) was defined by world leaders as a cardinal objective of the Agenda, a sine qua non condition for a safer, fairer and more peaceful world.

Paradoxically, global hunger has only grown since then. According to the latest estimates, the number of undernourished people in the world increased in 2017, for the third consecutive year. Last year, 821 million people suffered from hunger (11 percent of the world population – one in nine people on the planet), most of them family and subsistence farmers living in poor rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.

However, the growing rate of undernourished people is not the only big challenge we are facing. Other forms of malnutrition have also increased. In 2017, at least 1.5 billion people suffered from micronutrient deficiencies that undermine their health and lives, At the same time, the proportion of adult obesity continues to rise , from 11.7 percent in 2012 to 13.3 percent in 2016 (or 672.3 million people).

Hunger is mainly circumscribed to specific areas, namely those ravaged by conflicts, droughts and extreme poverty; yet obesity is everywhere, and it is increasing all around the world. As a matter of fact, we are witnessing the globalization of obesity. For example: obesity rates are climbing faster in Africa than any other region – eight of the 20 countries in the world with the fastest rising rates of adult obesity are in Africa. Furthermore, childhood overweight affected 38 million children under five years of age in 2017. About 46 percent of these children live in Asia, while 25 percent live in Africa.

If we do not call for urgent actions to halt the increasing obesity rates, we soon may have more obese than undernourished people in the world. The growing rate of obesity is happening at a huge socio-economic cost. Obesity is a risk factor for many non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Estimates indicate that the global economic impact of obesity is about USD 2 trillion per year (2.8 percent of the global GDP). This is equivalent to the impacts of smoking or armed conflicts.

This year, World Food Day (celebrated every 16th of October) aims to remind the international community of its fundamental political commitment to humanity – the eradication of all forms of malnutrition – and raise awareness that achieving a Zero Hunger world by 2030 (so in 12 years-time) is still possible. The experience of Brazil is a good example to have in mind.

According to FAO estimates, hunger in Brazil was reduced from 10.6 percent of the total population (about 19 million people) at the beginning of the 2000s to less than 2.5 percent in the 2008-2010 triennium, which is the minimum value in which FAO can make meaningful statistical inference. This reduction in the number of undernourished people was mainly possible due to the firm commitment of former President Lula and the implementation of public policies and social protection programmes addressing extreme poverty and the impacts of prolonged droughts in the northeastern part of the country.

In fact, governments have the most fundamental role in achieving Zero Hunger by ensuring that vulnerable people have sufficient income to buy the food they need, or the means to produce it for themselves – even in times of conflict.

However, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment. It aims to provide people with the necessary nutrients for a healthy life. Zero Hunger encompasses the eradication of all forms of malnutrition. So it is not just about feeding people but nourishing people as well.

Current global food systems have increased the availability and accessibility of processed food that is very caloric and energy-dense, high in fat, sugar and salt. Food systems must be transformed in a way so that all people can consume healthy and nutritious food. We need to address obesity as a public issue, not as an individual problem. This requires the adoption of a multisectoral approach involving not only governments, but also international organizations, national institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector and citizens in general.

It must be a collective effort towards healthy diets that include, for instance, the creation of norms such as labelling and the banning of some harmful ingredients, the introduction of nutrition in the school curriculum, the adoption of methods to avoid food loss and waste, and the establishment of trade agreements that do not hamper access to locally grown, fresh and nutritious food from family farming.

“Our actions are our future” is the message of World Food Day 2018. It is time to renew our commitment and, even more important, the political support towards a sustainable world free from hunger and all forms of malnutrition.","Paradoxically, global hunger has only grown since then.
However, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment.
Zero Hunger encompasses the eradication of all forms of malnutrition.
Current global food systems have increased the availability and accessibility of processed food that is very caloric and energy-dense, high in fat, sugar and salt.

Food banks, which provide meals to those facing hunger through recovering surplus food, operate at the community level in dozens of countries and are estimated to reach more than 15 million people outside of the United States. The report suggests that with greater support from global partners, this model could be replicated and scaled to help solve the challenge of hunger.

“The State of Global Food Banking 2018: Nourishing the World” is the first publication to profile food banks on a global scale and includes profiles of these food recovery organizations in more than 50 countries. The study provides insights and demonstrates the effectiveness of the food banking model as a grassroots, community-led hunger intervention.

The publication is released on the heels of an announcement that hunger is on the rise, with 821 million people facing chronic undernourishment and billions more struggling with food insecurity.

""With the international community's goal of zeroing out hunger by 2030, the need for an effective method to address hunger and malnutrition has never been so clear,"" said Lisa Moon, president and CEO of The Global FoodBanking Network, in a statement. ""As this report shows, food banking is a proven and locally adaptable solution in solving this pressing humanitarian challenge.""

Key findings and conclusions presented in the report include:

Details on food banks served by The Global FoodBanking Network, operating in 31 countries, serving 7.78 million people, more than half of whom are children.

Food banks are an environmental asset as they procure wholesome, surplus food that might otherwise end up as waste throughout the supply chain and redirect it away from landfills to social service organizations that feed the hungry.

Because food banks' success relies on the management of local community leaders rather than temporary foreign aid, the concept is positioned for long-term, sustainable success.

Food banks can be adapted and tailored to work within specific countries' laws and respond to different community needs.

More than 60 million hungry children and families have access to food because of food banks.

Food banks are formed by local leaders to procure safe and surplus food from commercial food systems, which might otherwise go to waste or to landfills, and repurpose it for distribution to those facing hunger directly through community service organizations.

The report was made possible by the support of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation, Cargill and The Kellogg Company Fund, as well as through the strategic support for the organization offered by the PIMCO Foundation. It will be the first of an annual report measuring the impact of food banks, the organization said.","Advancing the food banking model globally will play a critical role in achieving the zero hunger sustainable development goal, according to a new report from The Global FoodBanking Network.

This article forms part of the IPS coverage for World Food Day, celebrated on October 16.

SANTIAGO, Oct 14 2018 (IPS) - For the third consecutive year, South America slid backwards in the global struggle to achieve zero hunger by 2030, with 39 million people living with hunger and five million children suffering from malnutrition.

“It’s very distressing because we’re not making progress. We’re not doing well, we’re going in reverse. You can accept this in a year of great drought or a crisis somewhere, but when it’s happened three years in a row, that’s a trend,” reflected Julio Berdegué, FAO’s highest authority in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The regional representative of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations said it is cause for concern that it is not Central America, the poorest subregion, that is failing in its efforts, but the South American countries that have stagnated.

“More than five million children in Latin America are permanently malnourished. In a continent of abundant food, a continent of upper-middle- and high-income countries, five million children … It’s unacceptable,” he said in an interview with IPS at the agency’s regional headquarters in Santiago.

“They are children who already have scars in their lives. Children whose lives have already been marked, even though countries, governments, civil society, NGOs, churches, and communities are working against this. The development potential of a child whose first months and years of life are marked by malnutrition is already radically limited for his entire life,” he said.

What can the region do to move forward again? In line with this year’s theme of World Food Day, celebrated Oct. 16, “Our actions are our future. A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible”, Berdegué underlined the responsibility of governments and society as a whole.

Governments, he said, must “call us all together, facilitate, support, promote job creation and income generation, especially for people from the weakest socioeconomic strata.”

In addition, he stressed that policies for social protection, peace and the absence of conflict and addressing climate change are also required.

New foods to improve nutrition

In the small town of Los Muermos, near Puerto Montt, 1,100 kilometers south of Santiago, nine women and two male algae collectors are working to create new foods, with the aim of helping to curb both under- and over-nutrition, in Chile and in neighboring countries. Their star product is jam made with cochayuyo (Durvillaea antarctica), a large bull kelp species that is the dominant seaweed in southern Chile.

“I grew up on the water. I’ve been working along the sea for more than 30 years, as a shore gatherer,” said Ximena Cárcamo, 48, president of the Flor del Mar fishing cooperative.

The seaweed gatherer told IPS from Los Muermos about the great potential of cochayuyo and other algae “that boost health and nutrition because they have many benefits for people,” in a region with high levels of poverty and social vulnerability, which translate into under-nutrition.

“We are adding value to products that we have in our locality. We want people to consume them and that’s why we made jam because children don’t eat seaweed and in Chile we have so many things that people don’t consume and that could help improve their diet,” she explained.

In the first stage, the women, with the support of the Aquaculture and Fishing Centre for Applied Research, identified which seaweed have a high nutritional value, are rich in minerals, proteins, fiber and vitamins, and have low levels of sugar.

The seaweed gatherers created a recipe book, “cooking with seaweed from the sea garden”, including sweet and salty recipes such as cochayuyo ice cream, rice pudding and luche and reineta ceviche with sea chicory.

Now the project aims to create high value-added food such as energy bars.

“We want to reach schools, where seaweed is not consumed. That’s why we want to mix them with dried fruit from our sector,” said Cárcamo, insisting that a healthy and varied diet introduced since childhood is the way to combat malnutrition, as well as the “appalling” levels of overweight and obesity that affects Chile, as well as the rest of Latin America.

The paradox of obesity

“Obesity is killing us…it kills more people than organised crime,” Berdegué warned, pointing out that in terms of nutrition the region is plagued by under-nutrition on the one hand and over-nutrition on the other.

“Nearly 60 percent of the region’s population is overweight. There are 250 million candidates for diabetes, colon cancer or stroke,” he said.

He explained that “there are 105 million obese people, who are key candidates for these diseases. More than seven million children are obese with problems of self-esteem and problems of emotional and physical development. They are children who are candidates to die young,” he said.

According to Berdegué, this problem “is growing wildly…there are four million more obese people in the region each year.”

The latest statistic for 2016 reported 105 million obese people in Latin America and the Caribbean, up from 88 million only four years earlier.

In view of this situation, the FAO regional representative stressed the need for a profound transformation of the food system.

“How do we produce, what do we produce, what do we import, how is it distributed, what is access like in your neighborhood? What do you do if you live in a neighborhood where the only store, that is 500 meters away, only sells ultra-processed food and does not sell vegetables or fruits?” he asked.

Berdegué harshly criticised “advertising, which tells us every day that good eating is to go sit in a fast food restaurant and eat 2,000 calories of junk as if that were entirely normal.”

Change of policies as well as habits

“You have to change habits, yes, but you have to change policies as well. There are countries, such as the small Caribbean island nations, that depend fundamentally on imported food. And the vast majority of these foods are ultra-processed, many of which are food only in name because they’re actually just chemicals, fats and junk,” he said.

He insisted that “we lack production of fruits, vegetables and dairy products in many countries or trade policies that encourage imports of these foods and not so much junk food.”

And to move toward the goal of zero hunger in just 12 years, Berdegué also called for generating jobs and improving incomes, because that “is the best policy against hunger.”

The second of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which make up the 2030 Development Agenda, is achieving zero hunger through eight specific targets.

Poverty making a comeback

“In Latin America we don’t lack food. People just can’t afford to buy it,” Berdegué said.

He also called for countries to strengthen policies to protect people living in poverty and extreme poverty.

According to the latest figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), poverty in the region grew between 2014 and 2017, when it affected 186 million people, 30.7 percent of the population. Extreme poverty affects 10 percent of the total: 61 million people.

Moreover, in this region where 82 percent of the population is urban, 48.6 percent of the rural population is poor, compared to 26.8 percent of the urban population, and this inequality drives the rural exodus to the cities.

“FAO urges countries to rethink social protection policies, particularly for children. We cannot allow ourselves to slow down in eradicating malnutrition and hunger among children,” Berdegué said.

He also advocated for the need for peace and the cessation of conflicts because “we have all the evidence in the world that when you lose peace, hunger soars. It is automatic. The great hunger hotspots and problems in the world today are in places where we are faced with conflict situations.”

“We have countries in the region where there is upheaval and governments have to know that this social and political turmoil causes hunger,” he concluded.","SANTIAGO, Oct 14 2018 (IPS) - For the third consecutive year, South America slid backwards in the global struggle to achieve zero hunger by 2030, with 39 million people living with hunger and five million children suffering from malnutrition.

At the celebrations held at New Delhi's UNDP office ahead of the World Food Day on October 14, experts agreed that instead of waiting for 12 years to reach the Zero Hunger target, the Union government and the civil society must act together to ensure food security quickly. Ending hunger and achieving food security by 2030 come under Goal 2 of the global sustainable development agenda. According to the United Nations, three in 10 stunted children in the world are found in India. Though the Indian government has launched several measures to improve agricultural production and ensure that food reaches the poor through its wide public distribution network, these are not adequate to end malnutrition and promote dietary diversity. Excerpts:

What kind of agricultural interventions are needed in India to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030?

The world needs to produce an estimated 60 per cent more food by 2050 to ensure global food security, and it must do so while conserving and enhancing the natural resource base. Thus, increasing world population inflates the importance placed upon the production of more food. However, it must be realised that increased food production does not necessarily translate into improved nutritional security, considering India, which is amongst the largest food grain producing nations, ranks 103rd out of 119 qualifying countries in the 2018 Global Hunger Index. With a score of 31.1, India suffers from a level of hunger that is serious.

Achieving zero hunger requires agriculture and food systems to become more efficient, sustainable, climate-smart and nutrition-sensitive. In addition, there is a crucial need for synchronisation among malnutrition, dietary diversity and production diversity.

On the other hand, shifting away from unsustainable high input-intensive crop production and monocultures towards more sustainable agro-ecological practices and diverse crop mix will yield improved production diversity. Further, agro-ecological practices such as zero budget natural farming, organic farming and permaculture play an important role in their impact on food and nutrition security as well as climate resilience. Similarly, organic farming and permaculture have the potential to help India’s farmers adapt to climate change by making crops hardy, and restoring soil and water health.

FAO has been pushing for biotechnology as a solution to increase crop yields in the face of climate change. Do you think it is a viable solution for India to increase food productivity?

FAO recognises that genetic engineering has the potential to help increase production and productivity in agriculture, forestry and fisheries.

Genetic engineering/biotechnology could lead to higher yields on marginal lands, reduce transmission of human and animal diseases through new vaccines, enhance climate resilience of crops and even fortify grains.

However, FAO is also aware of the concern about the potential risks posed by certain aspects of biotechnology on human and animal health, and the environmental consequences. For instance, caution must be exercised to reduce the risks of transferring toxins, creating new toxins or transferring allergenicss, which could result in unexpected allergic reactions. Similarly, risks to the environment from outcrossing and development of more aggressive weeds or wild relatives with increased resistance to diseases or environmental stresses, can upset the ecosystem balance. Biodiversity may also be lost due to displacement of traditional cultivars by a small number of genetically modified cultivars.

While biotechnology has several benefits to agriculture but it needs to be thoroughly evaluated on a case to case basis. The evaluation process should also take into consideration experience gained by national regulatory authorities in clearing such products, and careful monitoring of the post-release effects of these products and processes to ensure their continued safety to human beings, animals and the environment.

FAO and the Indian agriculture ministry have jointly launched the seven-year intensive Green Agriculture Project in September this year. How will it help us promote sustainable agriculture, one of the vital points of achieving Zero Hunger?

India’s agriculture sector needs to fully integrate environmental concerns in its policies, plans and programmes to ensure that the sector’s negative environmental impacts are mitigated and positive contributions are enhanced. Environmental mainstreaming is also important to the sector’s own long-term sustainability, especially under the context of a changing climate.

The Green Agriculture Project aims at mainstreaming biodiversity, climate change and sustainable land management objectives and practices into the Indian agricultural sector. It seeks to harmonise priorities and investments between India’s agricultural and environmental sectors so that national and global environmental benefits can be fully realised without compromising India’s ability to provide and develop rural livelihoods, and meet its food and nutrition security and social (particularly gender) goals.

What kind of structural changes are needed in the mid-day meal scheme to address the issue of hunger among India’s school children?

Social safety net programmes such as the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services and Public Distribution System have a direct bearing on the local production. While the central government spends billions of dollars annually on such programmes and is responsible for procurement, storage, transportation and bulk allocation, the state governments are responsible for distributing food and other items to consumers through a network of “fair price shops”.

The system focuses on selective high-yielding crop varieties that are procured, transported and distributed across the country, and is based on contract with individual farmers. With government purchase guaranteed, these contracts serve as strong incentives for farmers to produce these selected crops, but also result in the conversion of biodiverse agricultural systems to monocrops.

Rather, farmers should have a strong market incentive for more sustainable practices if these purchase programmes undertook additional criteria for purchasing agro-biodiversity products or environmentally-friendly products, and the demand base would help to reinforce sustainable local farmer practices that also yield additional environmental benefits.

Hence, the government leading the charge on local procurement/sourcing would improve the supply efficiency of safety net programmes, reduce post-harvest losses, reduce transportation emissions, and incentivise production that is harmonised with environmental, agricultural, and social objectives. This in turn will contribute to reduced carbon footprint and enhance the climate resilience of cropping systems.

In addition, along with localised sourcing, the sourcing of local traditional nutritious foods would help in securing nutritional benefits together with the preservation and conservation of indigenous crop varieties and foods.

To what extent can the Future Smart Food Initiative overcome nutrition gap and help Asia achieve Zero Hunger?

The Asia-Pacifi­c region was successful in achieving the hunger Millenium Development Goal (MDG) by 2014-2016. However, the region is still home to 515 million undernourished people, accounting for 64 per cent of the undernourished people in the world, with various forms of malnutrition—stunting, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity—still in play. Further, these issues manifest from the demand as well as the supply side, specifically, in the form of production and nutrition gaps in the agriculture and food systems.

A key solution to these issues lies in increasing the availability of and access to nutritious foods necessary for a healthy diet. Since conventional staple foods do not supply all the nutrients needed for a balanced diet, tackling the health problems caused by malnutrition requires the transformation of current agriculture and food systems towards more diversity at all levels. Dietary diversity is a cost-effective, affordable and sustainable means of eradicating hunger and malnutrition, and production diversity can help in addressing malnutrition and climate change simultaneously.

For instance, a study by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) shows that when mung beans are introduced in rotation with winter wheat and cotton during the short fallow period, farmers obtain an income increase from US$1384 to US$2907 from 0.5 hectares of land along with the nutrition benefits of Future Smart Food (FSF).

Thus, using sound scientific underpinnings to promote neglected and underutilized species (NUS) can help diversify food production and diets in economically, socially and environmentally sustainable ways while contributing to the resilience of smallholder and rural populations. This requires the overarching global vision on NUS to be translated into concrete actions on the ground.

Thus, the FAO is working with its Member Countries to reinvigorate both production and consumption of a variety of nutritious traditional foods. The initiative is intended to promote agriculture diversification with sustainable intensification for addressing Zero Hunger. NUS that are nutritionally dense, climate resilient, economically viable, and locally available or adaptable are considered FSF and include Pulses (pigeon pea), roots & tubers (sweet potato) and nutrient-rich cereals (millets & sorghum) that can contribute to the universal goal of ‘Zero Hunger’.

This would also provide focused effort to help marginalised and indigenous people improve their livelihoods and income; and contribute to the preservation and celebration of cultural diversity.","Excerpts:What kind of agricultural interventions are needed in India to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030?

Hunger is a global challenge. It is often erroneously assumed that hunger stems from lack of food. However, if we probe the root cause of hunger, the answer is far more complicated.

Though the global food production is enough to feed all human beings, still there are approximately 815 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment. India produces enough food to feed all its citizens, yet it is ranked 100 among 119 countries in the Global Hunger Index rankings. Though the country has been food-secure for the past decade, its economic growth and the changing demographics are transforming patterns of food demand. In India, the problem is further complicated as the food basket differs from region to region. There is a growing need for the design and development of more efficient integrated systems of food production, processing, preservation and distribution that will feed the changing tastes of the nation.

India wastes about 7% of its total annual food production and almost 30% of the fruits and vegetables because of inadequate warehousing facilities and cold storages. The situation is similar in other countries too. In Africa, it is estimated that the food wasted can feed close to 40 million people. Hunger is increasingly a processing, storage, supply chain and logistics challenge. According to the International Institute of Refrigeration, if developing countries had the same level of refrigeration infrastructure as developed countries, they would save 200 million tonnes of food or around 14% of their food supply.

In India, the National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) estimates that country has only 15% of the required temperature-control transportation facilities and less than 1% of warehouse facilities dedicated for transporting pre-conditioned agricultural produce. This lack of infrastructure means that only 4% of the country’s food is moved through cold chains. Cold chains do not just reduce post-harvest losses but also allow farmers to earn more by tapping into well-functioning remunerative markets, while maintaining the quality of their produce. Moreover, with growing climate variability and extremes, resilient transportation infrastructure will allow food to be transported from surplus to climate stressed areas, thus contributing to achieving zero hunger, goal 2 under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

India’s highly fragmented agricultural landscape makes the problem more complex. For example, despite being the world’s largest producer of banana, India has just a 0.3% share of the global trade. This is primarily because of the lack of large scale commercial farms and low consolidation among smallholders. Food loss and wastage is not only an issue of mismanagement of resources but also contributes to massive greenhouse gas emissions. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that food wastage accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Developing and upgrading rural infrastructure; training farmers in post-harvest practices that minimize losses; integrating small scale enterprises into value chains; organizing smallholder farmers into farmer producer organizations; customized financial services; investment in agricultural research; and last-mile marketing channels are extremely important to overcome the zero hunger challenge. They are also important for ensuring social equity, gender inclusiveness and reducing agriculture’s carbon footprint.

While this is an enormous challenge, it is an opportunity that compels action, especially for companies that are involved at various stages of the food value chain. Private companies have the competencies, insights as well as the resources to invest in potential solutions. Solving the problem of food loss and waste has the potential to have an enormous impact on society and on the company’s own performance. A report by the Boston Consulting Group estimates that solving the problem of food loss and wastage is a $700 billion opportunity for private companies.

Companies are also better positioned as they are better connected to the various stakeholders along the food value chains and have the ability to influence their behaviour. For example, the retail chain Tesco has started the ‘Buy one get one free—later’ programme wherein customers can buy certain food items and take the free product later when they actually need it, reducing the attraction to stock discounted products which often leads to food wastage. The problem of food waste is also intensified because of the lack of regulation around industry standards and policies. Companies can be advocates for industry standards that regulate food wastage and help increase general public awareness around the issue. The government, on its part, can have laws that penalize companies for wasting food within their supply chain and encourage repurposing and recycling of food items. For example, since 2016, France has been fining grocery stores for throwing away edible food.

American senator Daniel Webster once said, “When tillage begins, the other arts follow. The farmers, therefore, are the founders of human civilization."" The agriculture sector is a laggard in the fast changing economic landscape of the country. The farmer, the first participant of the economy, has to be supported to achieve the highest production and productivity and must be ensured a larger share of profit along the value chain.

Currently, we have a one-way movement of raw materials and a one-way movement of finished goods. This flow must be transformed into a two-way movement of commerce and healthy, nutritious food between the farmers and the consumers to overcome the zero hunger challenge and address poverty in all its forms.

José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has released a video message on the occasion of the World Food Day, October 16.

By Robin Gomes

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is urging nations, continents, sectors and professions to join forces and take action to eliminate hunger, saying a Zero Hunger World by 2030 is still possible. FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva made the call in a video message on the occasion of World Food Day that was marked worldwide on Tuesday.

FAO marks World Food Day each year on 16 October to highlight the need to step up efforts to end hunger and malnutrition in the world.

The theme of this year’s observance is ""Our actions are our future. A #ZeroHunger world by 2030 is possible"". Various events are being held in over 130 countries, including at the FAO headquarters in Rome, to mark World Food Day.

Listen to our report

Three years ago, in September 2015, all UN Member States approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 2 aims at the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This SDG was defined by world leaders as an indispensable condition for a safer, fairer and more peaceful world.

In his message, Graziano pointed out that this year’s World Food Day was taking place at a critical moment in the fight against hunger and malnutrition.

Growing number of hungry

The FAO Director-General noted that for 3 consecutive years, the number of hungry people worldwide has been growing and the trend showed the world was returning to levels of 10 years ago. According to the latest “State of Food Security in the World” report, nearly 820 million people were undernourished in 2017.



Graziano noted that conflicts, extreme weather events linked to climate change and economic slowdown were reversing the progress made in the fight against hunger.

He also noted that overweight and obesity levels were growing rapidly. The FAO chief said it was time the world community redoubled its efforts to achieve the global goal of Zero Hunger.

Joining forces against hunger, malnutrition

The FAO Director-General said this year’s World Day calls on the international community to work more closely together, and make use of the evidence and tools available. Three years ago, he noted, “all UN Member Countries pledged to end poverty and hunger, when they committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.”

“Zero Hunger,” Graziano said, “is still achievable if we join forces across nations, continents, sectors and professions, in the remaining years for 2030.” “ Taking action is not an option, Graziano stressed, adding, “ It is a necessary step to a truly sustainable future for all.”

Noting that our present actions will determine our future, Graziano said that a Zero Hunger World by 2030 is still possible.","(ANSA)José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has released a video message on the occasion of the World Food Day, October 16.

The government is working continuously in a phased manner to achieve the goal of ‘zero hunger’ by 2030, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said Tuesday elaborating efforts being taken to boost farm output. Singh remarks come a day after the Congress party took a swipe at the government over serious problem of hunger in India, which has been ranked 103rd among 119 countries on the global hunger index 2018.

“Achieving zero hunger level by 2030 is a big goal. Our government is working continuously in a phased manner towards that direction,” Singh said at a two-day ‘agri start-up and entrepreneurship conclave’ organised to commemorate the World Food Day today. The government has made significant progress in the last four-and-a-half years in increasing agricultural production and food security, he said.

As per the fourth estimate, foodgrains and horticultural crops output has touched a record 284.83 million tonnes and 307 million tonnes, respectively, in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June), he added.

On agri start-ups, the minister said the government is supporting 150 start-ups out of 200 and supporting entrepreneurs to establish processing units.

Even youth are being trained with farm skills as it is estimated that about 22 lakh skilled youths are required in the farm sector, he added.

Minister of state for agriculture Parshottam Rupala stressed on the need to promote food processing to ensure better income to farmers. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) director general Trilochan Mohapatra said that the government has set up 25 agri-incubation centres and 50 more will be established to provide training to entreprenuers.","The government has made significant progress in the last four-and-a-half years in increasing agricultural production and food security, he said.

People across the globe were having a collective moment of raising awareness about the hunger crisis on Tuesday, which marked World Food Day. Hunger, inextricably linked to poverty, disproportionally affects African-Americans, motivating many Black folks to find practical ways to fight to end the crisis.

Oprah Winfrey, who has long used her influence and celebrity status to call attention to human rights issues such as hunger, volunteered at the Freestore Foodbank in Cincinnati last month. The mogul partnered with retail company Kroger to attack hunger, WKRC, a CBS and CW affiliate, reported.

“Every step to zero hunger in this country, this city, this world is a step in the right direction,” Winfrey said at the time, spotlighting an issue that the United Nations said it hoped to completely eradicate by 2030.

The crisis hits home for many people nationwide, but for African-Americans, it’s been even worse. Black people are more than twice as likely to face hunger, according to Feeding America. That was widely connected to high poverty rates among Blacks — more than twice that of white, non-Hispanic households in 2017.

With such a high poverty rate, it is no wonder why African Americans are trying to fight back. Volunteers, farmers, activists and celebrities alike are all using their power to make a difference to combat hunger.

For instance, Chance the Rapper has played a role in trying to combat hunger in his native Chicago. The lyricist had teamed up with Lyft to donate $1 million to the city’s schools, and his gift can go a long way in helping provide breakfast and lunch for hungry students.

T.I. also recently decided to pay for a year’s worth of school lunches for a teenager in Florida. A high school had reportedly denied food to the teen, Danielle Aiken because she was 15 cents short in August.

Perhaps other rappers will also donate money for institutions in their home cities and help students afford school meals. The National School Lunch Program allows for 100,000 schools to serve school lunches to 30 million students each day. The program provides 20 million free lunches, 2 million reduced-price lunches in which students pay $0.40 each and 8 million full price lunches, according to the School Nutrition Association.

If more people support families struggling to provide meals for their school-age children and global hunger efforts, then the UN’s goal of ending hunger in just 12 years could come true.

110,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/10/10/zero-hunger-in-phl/,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Business Mirror,Zero hunger in PHL,"Ending world hunger is the focus of this year’s celebration of World Food Day on October 16. Through the event, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hopes that countries around the world will support its bid to wipe out hunger by 2030. Ending hunger, along with achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture are part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.

The Philippines is one of the countries that have committed to end hunger and achieve the other SDGs by 2030. Hitting the zero-hunger target, however, may be a tall order for the Philippines, partly due to inflation. Millions of Filipino families are regarded as “subsistence poor” or food poor, based on the latest available data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

PSA figures showed that the number of subsistence poor families in the Philippines remained above 1 million. In 2015, 1.303 million families were regarded as food poor. In terms of population, there were 8.225 million food poor Filipinos in 2015. These are people who earn less than the per-capita food threshold, or the amount required to meet their basic food needs.

The highest subsistence incidence, according to PSA data, was recorded in Mindanao, where the poorest provinces are found. The highest subsistence incidence among families was observed in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao at 17 percent. This means that nearly 2 out of 10 families in the ARMM are food poor and cannot meet their basic food needs. Among the provinces that make up the ARMM, Lanao del Sur recorded the highest subsistence among families at 33 percent, which indicates that 3 out of 10 families are unable to meet their basic food needs. The figure is also the highest in the Philippines.

Data from the PSA also showed that provinces where subsistence incidence breached 10 percent are areas that rely on agriculture. These figures bolster claims that farming is no longer a profitable venture in these areas, making it more difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed the entire country. Sans policies that would help improve the profitability of farming, planters would continue to leave the sector in droves and cause food production to fall significantly.

Apart from providing the need to increase production to meet the food requirements of a growing population, the government must step up its campaign against food waste. While millions of people go hungry, the FAO said one third of all food produced worldwide is lost or wasted. The global cost of food waste has been estimated at $2.6 trillion per year.

In the country, the Philippine Rice Research Institute noted that rice wasted in 2008 alone was equivalent to 12.2 percent of the country’s total rice imports of P7.27 billion that year. Citing data from the Food and Nutrition Research, rice wasted in 2008 could feed around 2.5 million Filipinos in a year. Citing the 2016 report of the PSA, PhilRice said each Filipino wastes an average of 335 grams of rice. This figure only accounted for the leftovers on plates after eating and did not include those intentionally cooked and fed to house pets.

The FAO had outlined recommendations that the government can adopt to achieve zero hunger by 2030. These include boosting social protection interventions, empowering local and subnational authorities, having “zero-hunger” budget allocations and partnering with academia. These recommendations are doable but also require a lot of political will, something that this administration has shown in its war on drugs.","Ending world hunger is the focus of this year’s celebration of World Food Day on October 16.

As the world celebrates the World Food Day this year, more people than ever before are going hungry, due to conflicts, climate variability and extreme poverty.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 2018 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, the number of undernourished people in the world increased in 2017, for the third consecutive year, from around 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017. Africa remains the continent with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, affecting almost 21 percent of the population (more than 256 million people).

70 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas where people’s lives depend on agriculture, fisheries or forestry. That’s why Zero hunger calls for a transformation of rural economy.

This year’s theme of World Food Day 2018 “Our actions are our future. A Zero hunger world by 2030 is still possible”, calls for collaboration among governments tocreate opportunities for greater private sector investments in agriculture, while boosting social protection programmes for the vulnerable and linking food producers with urban areas.

For thirty-three years now, FAO has been providing technical support to the government of Rwanda for the implementation of various projects to ensure food security and improving the nutrition of the smallholder families.

Ending poverty to end hunger through the social protection project

Christine Mushimirimana is a 50 year old widow, she lives with her seven children in a mud and wattle house in Nyamyumba sector, Rubavu District of Rwanda.

The people in her area are predominately smallholder farmers. Despite the soils being fertile, Rubavu District has amongst the highest malnutrition rates in the country, partly due to poor farming practices, lack of access to seeds and fertilizer. According to the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (2015) the stunting number of children under 5 years is 46%, whereas the rate of food insecure households stands at 26%.

Christine’s husband died in 2008 leaving her in a house he had built in late 1970s. Four of the Children are still in school, and one has recently completed secondary school, but is still unemployed. Two of Christine’s children were forced to drop out of secondary school, as Christine could not afford scholastic materials even though they attended public schools. Christine herself finished the first six years of primary school only.

The family house collapsed in 2015 due to old age and she had to sell her extra land to build a four-bedroom mud house. Initially, Christine grew a few crops, such as beans and maize, for family consumption, but it was not enough. Christine has supported her family through occasional labor, earning a wage of RWF 1,000 per day working from 7am – 3pm. Her family belongs to the first category (poorest of the poor) of Rwanda’s socio-economic classification system.

In 2017, Christine was selected as a participant in FAO’s social protection project linking the initiatives of VUP with agriculture, which a large number of Rwanda’s population depend on. She received training on good agricultural practices for vegetable production and small animal husbandry through a Farmer Field and Life School, but also training on essential life skills such as basics of agribusiness, nutrition and gender equality sensitization, and financial literacy. She also received avocado seedlings, vegetable seeds, two goats, and fertilizer.

Sprouting business wings

All the six hundred participants of the project were grouped in five Farmer Field and Life School groups. Each group was encouraged to start a savings and loans group, through which households collectively save money each week. Members of Christine’s group of 30 people each contributes a weekly amount of 400 Rwandan francs (approx. US $ 0.46). FAO contributed RWF 300,000 to the group to reinforce its financial capacity.

“I had always had a heart for business but I didn’t have capital and even skills, but more so, I wasn’t confident enough to try it out. Through the training, we were encouraged to be entrepreneurs that we can do business like other people,” says Christine.

She borrowed RWF 15,000 from the group and started out a small business of selling fruits and vegetables in a roadside market along the main Highway.

“Gradually my business has been good. The profits more than double the wage I used to get for a whole day’s wage. I have stopped farming for other people, I can now get the money I used to earn from cultivating people’s farms with little labor,” says Christine with a smile.

With the skills acquired from the training she is able to record her business transactions.

From the garden to market

Christine grew the seedlings and in the first harvest she harvested much more than her family can consume. Her attitude about growing vegetables had changed.

“Before, I couldn’t afford fertilizer, the goats I received gave me organic manure, which I used in my garden, and I realized increased production. I sold some and in the next three months I was harvesting again…It was amazing! I realized vegetables were profitable and could be harvested in a short time with a large output,” Christine says with excitement.

With now her business running the produce she sells is harvested from her gardens. Her business has grown from twenty Cabbages to more than five hundred Cabbages, and beans all from her gardens.

“I have since expanded my garden. I have added carrots, beetroots and eggplants to my agriculture. With the modern farming techniques I will be able to do commercial farming. I am eager next season to grow vegetables on a bigger piece of land,” Christine said.

Nurturing young entrepreneurs through poultry keeping

Victor Gashema, 28, lives with his mother and eight other family members in Gisagara District, Gikonko sector. He completed high school in veterinary studies in 2014, but he couldn’t find employment immediately.

“When I completed high school in veterinary studies, I was unemployed because there was no institution I would apply a job to since I was a secondary school graduate. We were taught how to rear and treat livestock,” he says.

Although he had the experience of keeping poultry, from his childhood and from school, he didn’t have capital to put it into practice. He decided to join his family to cultivate the family garden.

Victor, like other youth selected to benefit from the FAO poultry project, received 330 chickens, feeders, drinkers, and a poultry house was built for him. They received a number of trainings and conducted study tours to other poultry farmers in the country.

Every day he wakes up between 5am and 6am to feed his chickens feeds, after which, he washes the feeders. At 9am he picks eggs from the poultry house using a bucket.

Improving life at home

“The first eggs I sold the eggs and got money which I used to buy a piece of land worth 600,000 Rwandan francs, and got capital to establish a veterinary pharmacy. I also sold chicken manure. I saved some money and supported the family. I helped two of my siblings to stay in school,” he says.

After one year, he sold the chickens he had received as they were old, and replaced them with 450 one-day chicks – which, after four months – started laying eggs. Today he has a total of 1,450 chickens.

On weekly basis he gathers over 700 eggs and his weekly supply to the market is about 4,900 eggs. When he deducts all the expenses, in a month he earns a profit of about 150,000 Rwandans francs.

High demand, low supply

“The price of an egg we sell to our neighbors is lower compared to one that we impose for clients in the market. We sell to neighbors 70 Rwandan francs because they contribute to the security of the poultry farm. They pick the eggs at home,” he says.

To avoid high risk of losing his eggs while transporting them, he packs the eggs in a metal box stuffed with wood shavings and load the box on the motorcycle and drives to Butare.

“The market is big and I cannot satisfy it. I now target is to rear 5,000 layers which will give me a weekly production of at least 25,000 eggs,” he says.

An egg can end malnutrition

According to the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV4), Gisagara, his home area is one of districts in the country struggling with high rates of malnourished and malnutrition jeopardizing children’ growth. 48.5 per cent of the children under 5 years are stunted.

Every week, Victor gives out five eggs to families with stunted children – some are so vulnerable to even afford to buy one egg, and every month he supplies about 20 eggs to a health centre in his area.

“We have been receiving a good report right from the sector and from the District level, that more children were coming out of the red line. The meals they received from the center had an egg. The sector and District authorities thanked me for the contribution toward reducing malnutrition in our area,” he says.

(Following is the full text of the World Food Day 2018 Address of Saint Lucia’s Agriculture Minister Ezechiel Joseph.)

LET me take this opportunity to wish every stakeholder in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry sectors a successful World Food Day 2018. This day is celebrated every year around the world on October 16. The Theme for this year’s celebration is: “Our Actions are Our Future and A Zero Hunger World by 2030 is Possible”.

This Theme speaks to the negative effects we are experiencing right now from Climate Change which can impact our ability to meet our objective of a Zero Hunger World.

Despite the many challenges we are faced with, the leadership within the Department of Agriculture has developed and are implementing programmes to tackle the issue of food security for St. Lucia while at the same time addressing the theme of this World Food Day’s celebration.

We are seeing:

Increases in productivity in the agriculture sector;

Sponsored

1. Cabinet has approved the proposed option for the restructured St. Lucia Marketing Board and St. Lucia Fish Marketing Corporation;

2. With the support of the government of Taiwan, very soon we shall commence a three-year import substitution programme. The objective is to reduce the importation of seven vegetables we believe that can be grown on a sustainable basis in St. Lucia, namely: tomatoes, sweet peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, cabbages, watermelons and pineapples.

3. We will see very soon the opening of the National Diagnostic Facility at Union, which will be home to two Units of the Division of Agriculture and the Metrology Unit of the Saint Lucia Bureau of Standards (SLBS). The facility will provide technical and analytical services to agriculture and the other major economic and productive sectors.

4. We are in the process of reviewing the Agriculture Incentives Act. My Ministry believes that there is a need to amend Section of the Act. This would make the application process smoother and faster.

5. It is necessary to note that we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Cuba and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, Natural Resources and Co-operatives establishing a general framework of Technical Cooperation in Agriculture matters.

As we celebrate World Food Day this year, Agro-Processing and Value Added will be the area of focus.

In light of this we are expected to continue:

I. Empowering groups/individuals regarding their involvement in Agro-Processing.

II. Encouraging the utilisation of local grown foods and forest products will:

i) Improve the livelihood of participants;

ii) And increase the demand for their production.

In keeping with our area of focus and to contradict the misinformation out there, let it be known that the government has established Agro processing facilities in Fond Assau and Anse Ger.

We are also supporting many private individuals with the establishment of their own facility by providing capacity-building to processors and students at various schools.

In closing, I would like to wish our most valued farmers, fisher folk, agro-processors and citizens in general a happy and productive World Food Day 2018, as you joined the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, Natural Resources and Co-operatives and the international community in celebrating World Food Day 2018.

I thank you.","Share this post:(Following is the full text of the World Food Day 2018 Address of Saint Lucia’s Agriculture Minister Ezechiel Joseph.)

Since 2006 when President Paul Kagame inaugurated Girinka programme, 331,863 cows have so far been distributed to low-income families to transform their lives, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources.

The number includes 10 cows in gestation, which were donated to Kirehe families on Friday by Rwandans who live in Kenya.

It was part of the events to celebrate World Food Day under the theme; “Our actions are our future. A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible.”

Geraldine Mukeshimana, the Minister for Agriculture and Animal Resources, said that Girinka programme has impacted the lives of many Rwandans.

“We have a target to continue this programme so cows are given to all disadvantaged families,” she said.

“Government has rolled out substantial agricultural programmes for food security and fighting malnutrition,” she stated, highlighting Girinka programme as being top on the agenda.

Eradicating hunger [by 2030] is possible,” she added.

Mukeshimana explained that the prevailing security in the country was one of the reasons for the optimism to achieve zero hunger.

Climate change, she said, was one of the major obstacles to this effort.

Beneficiaries of Girinka are buoyant about its impact.

“I believe that this cow will lift me out of poverty,” said Emmanuel Hakizimana, one of the recipients from Rwabutazi Cell, Gatore Sector.

In addition to getting milk, he expects to get fertilisers to boost his crop yields.

Addressing malnutrition

“Malnutrition is still a concern for us,” the minister said, adding that from 2015 the stunting rate among children has dropped by two percentage points.

“In 2015, we were at 37 per cent, while this year, a recent study, found that stunted children are at 35 per cent,

“It means that we have to sustain efforts against stunted growth,” she said.

Leonille Uwamariya is a member of Tugaruke mu Nzira Cooperative, which comprises of 66 women farmers and every member has at least a cow.

“We women have made progress, our children are no longer malnourished and we no longer contract diseases related to poor nutrition,” she said.

Jean Damascene Nsengiyumva, Kirehe District Vice Mayor in charge of Economic Affairs, said that in past five years stunted growth in Kirehe district decreased from 42 per cent to 29 per cent.

Kirehe produces 4,000 tonnes of rice every year on 816 hectares and grows banana on 20,001 hectares.

The district also grows maize on around 26,000 hectares of consolidated land every season, producing over 80,000 tonnes.

Haiti - Politic : Goal zero hunger by 2030 it's possible !





To Damien in the premises of the Ministry of Agriculture where held an exhibition of agricultural products of the soil, the United Nations Organization for Food and Agriculture (FAO), the representation of the European Union (EU) and the Parliamentary Front against Hunger https://www.icihaiti.com/en/news-21538-icihaiti-politics-creation-of-the-parliamentary-front-against-hunger.html celebrated this week World Food Day around the theme ""Acting for the future, zero hunger in 2030, it is possible.""



In his speech, Jobert C. Angrand, the Minister of Agriculture put a lot of emphasis, on the theme chosen this year said ""Ann travay pou demen... Li posib pou kwape grangou nan peyi Ayiti avan lane 2030"". Despite a gloomy picture prepared by the Minister ""3 million people, or 30% of the Haitian population, are in a situation of food insecurity. An annual increase in population growth of 1.5%, meaning more than 11 million mouths to feed by 2020 and putting more pressure on agricultural resources. An agricultural supply that covers only 45% of food needsn"" he is convinced that it is possible to eradicate hunger in Haiti by 2030.



To achieve the goal of ""zero hunger"", Minister Angrand explained that it was necessary to sustainably improve the income and living conditions of the urban and rural population in a dual perspective of balanced development of the territory and the slowing of food insecurity, increase the contribution of agriculture, fisheries and livestock to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and increase the coverage of food needs. In the same vein, he made it clear that to combat food insecurity in the country, there is a need to increase domestic production and improve the quality and access to food.



""The Government's vision for strengthening agricultural production is through the promotion of strategic sectors (maize, rice, sorghum, beans, chickens, eggs, milk, vegetables, roots and tubers) in order to supply the national market. and strengthen food security,"" said the minister, adding that promoting and promoting local agricultural products in the fight against hunger will be a priority to reduce imports and create more jobs. He stressed that the government also aims to increase investment in productive infrastructure including agricultural infrastructure.



FAO and its partners call for a collective effort to create opportunities for all to lead healthy and productive lives. Strengthening social protection programs for countries, including by the use of drought-resistant seeds for farmers, the support by the general public for local food producers, and better eating habits are concrete actions proposed by FAO and its partners to the Government, farmers and the population.



Recalling that ""Zero Hunger by 2030"" is one of the commitments made by many countries including Haiti in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Zero Hunger Trust Fund (ZHTF), last Tuesday, got topped up with a donation of $10 000 from the St Vincent and the Grenadines Cricket Association (SVGCA) Inc.

The cheque was presented to Laura Anthony Browne, Executive Director of the ZHTF, by President of the SVGCA Dr Kishore Shallow, at a short ceremony held at the Central Planning Unit’s Conference Room, located at the Administrative Building in Kingstown.

Happy that his organisation has been able to make a contribution to the fund, Shallow noted that whilst it might be “small”, the sum can assist many children under the ZHTF.

Shallow, though, promised that it would not be the last, as the SVGCA Inc. would endeavour to contribute once its coffers continues to be replenished.

Established in 2016 by an Act of the Parliament of St Vincent and the Grenadines, the ZHTF zooms in on targetted interventions, geared at eradicating hunger here in St Vincent and the Grenadines.

At present, the ZHTF has three flagship undertakings, which are the Adopt a Classroom Programme, Skills Training Programme and a Golden Years Nutrition Programme.

Anthony Browne said, at last Tuesday’s handing over, that at present, children from 12 primary schools are involved in the Adopt a Classroom Programme.

The ZHTF executive director detailed the salient aspects of the programme.

“We start with them in Kindergarten and walk with them up to Grade Six we hope… We give them everything that they need to go school; all of their books… We give them money to buy their uniforms … We get their eyes checked… If they need glasses we provide for the glasses; we pay for the glasses and we are now doing medical assessment,” Anthony Browne explained.

The ZHTF forms part of the St Vincent and the Grenadines’ method of conforming to the Millennium Development Goals under the United Nations’ Millennium Declaration.","SVGCA Inc supports Zero Hunger Trust FundSocial ShareThe Zero Hunger Trust Fund (ZHTF), last Tuesday, got topped up with a donation of $10 000 from the St Vincent and the Grenadines Cricket Association (SVGCA) Inc.

Six BILLION pounds of produce goes unused every year, according to Kroger's senior innovation manager Nicole Davis, who spoke at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Food Forward Summit in D.C. last week. That's why Kroger's new brand, Pickuliar Picks, will encourage customers to buy produce that is nutritious and tastes fine, but is flawed physically in some way.

According to FoodNavigator-USA, Davis explained that when produce doesn't meet a specific color, shape, or size, it gets rejected—whether it's too tiny, bumpy, or has freckles and bruises.

A Kroger spokesperson told Delish that Kroger is excited to introduce Pickuliar Picks (which is coming in 2019) ""to transform the narrative around imperfect produce"" as part of the grocery chain's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Plan. Customers who buy the ""ugly"" produce will help Kroger's efforts to limit food waste.

Zero Hunger | Zero Waste is an initiative The Kroger Co. announced in September 2017 ""aimed at ending hunger in the communities Kroger calls home and eliminating waste across the company by 2025,"" a press release explained.

According to Food & Wine, other retailers have used similar methods to address the issue of food waste. Whole Foods and Walmart both sold ""ugly"" fruits and veggies in 2016.

We will update with more information on Pickuliar Picks as it becomes available. In the meantime, these restaurants are working to combat food waste as well. Check them out!

A side event at the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS), hosted by the Group and The B Team, highlighted the call.

As a GCAS press release notes, CEOs at the Summit indicated that without “ambitious and unequivocal targets set by governments,” businesses will not reduce their carbon emissions to zero or deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, companies such as Salesforce and others have taken it upon themselves to achieve zero net emissions by 2050.

The Corporate Leaders Group consists primarily of European business leaders from a variety of sectors working to increase their resilience and reduce emissions, in line with a transition to a more sustainable economy. The position statement highlights a lack of long-term signals and supporting policies from governments, which, the leaders note, would otherwise serve to avoid stranded assets and misinvestments.

The statement calls on governments to develop strategies that:

are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goals and the SDGs;

maximize certainty for businesses, investors and society as a whole;

are developed and implemented in an open and transparent way, in partnership with all stakeholders; and

will be regularly reviewed “in line with the Paris Agreement cycle.”

Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever, and The B Team Chair, outlined actions companies can take in order to start down the path to net zero emissions, including: winning commitment from the top; setting science-based targets; “transforming your company and driving that transformation throughout your value chain”; and “using your voice for advocacy.” [Aiming for Zero: Long-term Certainty for Economic Prosperity] [Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group Press Release] [GCAS Press Release]","12 September 2018: The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group issued a statement calling on the governments of advanced economies to develop “strong, credible and appropriate” strategies that will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest.

According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. is thrown away. At the same time, more than 10 percent of Americans struggle with hunger, reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

As part of the Kroger/Dillons-wide initiative, employees are taking a closer look at every aspect of the business and brainstorming ways to cut back on waste. Environmental accountability is gaining momentum in the corporate sector, with several major corporations like Walmart, Texas Instruments and Estee Lauder setting similar goals.

In Dillons stores, everything -- from unsold food items in the deli to shipping pallets -- can be directed away from landfills, says Sheila Lowrie, corporate affairs manager of Dillons.

“Each department has a way they can contribute to this movement,” Lowrie said.

In Hutchinson, the Dillons Marketplace store on 30th Avenue is diverting 79.19 percent of waste. The goal is to divert 90 percent company-wide by 2025.

Recycling takes no extra effort from employees -- the time spent collecting and throwing away trash is instead used for recycling. And employees are also using the recycling tips learned on the job at home.

“We weren’t doing the best of jobs before and we’ve come so far,"" said Dillons Marketplace Store Manager Mike Matney. ""When you go from throwing 20 to 30 trash cans out every day to throwing away none, you know you’re making a difference in the environment and the community,”

Other Dillons stores in Hutchinson are participating, but the Marketplace store is serving as a flagship that can develop solutions for others.

“We selected this store because it’s so large and there are so many departments,"" Lowrie said. ""If we can achieve it here, we can achieve it in other stores.”

Redirect

Fruit and vegetables with minor blemishes that would normally be thrown away are bagged and sold for a discount or donated to the Reno County Food Bank. Meat that hasn’t sold, but is still good to eat, is frozen and also donated.

“So far this year in our division, we were able to provide 100,000 meals since this time last year because of our focus on rescued food for donations,” Lowrie said.

Penny Taapken, director of the Reno County Food Bank, explained that donations straight from the store improve what she can offer area families.

“Clients can go out with more fresh produce, dairy, whatever they send us. That’s a supplement to what they’re able to receive,” Taapken said. “They all appreciate it; sometimes they come in amazed at what’s available.”

What can’t be donated can be diverted. The food bank can’t accept pre-made foods like sandwiches or cakes past their prime, but those can still be good for animals.

Meat trimmings from the deli department are used to make dog treats. Produce or bakery items are used to make feed for cattle.

“They take apart the sandwiches we have here so the meat goes in the meat rendering bin and the bread and cheese go in the food diversion bin. They’re doing a great job of making sure everything gets to the right place,” said Ben Hughes, expense manager for Dillons. “The cows love it when there are doughnuts. They love the sweet stuff.”

The resulting feed is kept in-state by going to Struther's Ranch in North Milton.

“Not only are we helping the environment, we’re also helping local companies,” Hughes said.

Improvements can still be made, such as in the floral department. Flowers and trimmings could be composted, but it isn’t cost effective.

“It’s a matter of having someone who will do it,"" Hughes explained. ""Composting is very expensive. There are divisions that compost, but it takes a lot of space. If you’ve been out to the dump, you’ll see rows and rows of composting that have to be constantly turned.”

Recycle

The first line of defense for non-food items is source reduction, Lowrie said. This includes smart ordering practices and returning shipping pallets for future use.

What can’t be reduced can often be recycled. Large pallets are sent back on the salvage truck to reuse, but reusing quarter pallets isn’t as easy. Instead, the store began selling them to crafters interested in making home decorations and other craft projects.

While employees make a number of changes behind the scenes, customers can also make small changes to lessen their impact on the environment.

“Every day, we use 6 billion bags throughout the whole Kroger company. About 10 percent of those bags are recycled every year,” Lowrie said. “So many of our customers are using reusable bags today, so we’d like to encourage this.”","Dillons stores are celebrating a year of implementing the Zero Huger/Zero Waste initiative, which seeks to improve communities by solving both hunger and food waste.

If someone were to ask which automaker offers more electric vehicle nameplates in America than any other, your first instinct would probably be Tesla. But note the qualifier in the question - nameplates. Tesla currently only has three, the Model S, X and 3. Within the next few months, Hyundai Motor Group will offer five across its Hyundai and Kia brands. The Ioniq electric and Kia Soul EV have already been on sale for some time. The Hyundai Nexo arrives in a few weeks and electric versions of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro crossovers will be here soon.

While it’s great that Hyundai is expanding the range of zero-emissions offerings, don’t expect HMG to be overtaking Tesla in overall sales volume anytime soon. While all of these are far more than just highly compromised compliance cars that we’ve seen arrive since 2010, Hyundai is taking care to match supply to demand. And since American car buyers continue to show a significant reluctance to buy EVs with anything but a Tesla badge, availability will initially be limited to California and a handful of other states that follow its emissions rules and have shown a hunger for these types of vehicles.

Sam Abuelsamid

That’s actually a real shame since the Kona Electric that we recently drove is both the anti-Tesla and in many (but not all) ways, potentially the most appealing mainstream EV available today. To be fair, the Tesla Model 3 isn’t really the competition for the Kona, that would be the Chevrolet Bolt. It’s similar in size to the Bolt and is currently the only other mainstream EV with a range that exceeds 200 miles. A longer range version of the Nissan Leaf is coming and while Tesla has promised a $35,000 Model 3, it’s unlikely to arrive before mid-2019 if ever.

However, let’s start with the most obvious aspect that sets the Kona apart from its battery-powered peers. It’s a sub-compact crossover utility. That puts it directly into the middle of one of the hottest growing segments in the market. Chevrolet calls the Bolt a crossover, but let’s be real about this, it’s a tall hatchback. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and frankly I prefer that layout to most crossovers.

The last time we had something close to this was the short-lived Toyota Rav4 EV with its Tesla-supplied battery and propulsion system. This is a variant of the funky little Kona that has already been on sale for several months with gasoline-fueled engines. Hyundai’s American design staff led by Chris Chapman in Southern California has revamped with the electric Kona’s face, replacing the grille with a solid stylized panel that looks modern and unique while retaining the Kona’s distinctive lighting features. The electric version also gets some tweaks at the rear, but this remains very much part of the Kona family.

Sam Abuelsamid

The more substantive changes are underneath. The floorpan frame rails are reinforced with an internal aluminum grid structure that provides more strength with only a modest increase in mass. This is to help protect the new 64 kWh battery pack. Unlike some prior examples where an existing model has received an electric conversion, notably the Ford Focus, Hyundai has done an outstanding job of minimizing the impact of adding so much battery to the vehicle.

It doesn’t intrude at all into the cargo space, instead filling the area between the axles and side rails. As a result, the Kona is able to retain its existing multi-link rear suspension. The Kona electric maintains the exact same 94.1 cubic feet of passenger volume and 19.2 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the seats as the gas variant. While the electric motor and power electronics under the hood preclude a Tesla style frunk, it has more space behind the seats than the combined volume in the Model 3 and folding the seats yields just shy of 46 cubic feet.

Sam Abuelsamid

The electric gets a new center console with electronic shift switches in place of the mechanical shift lever of the conventional model. The sleeker, floating console sweeps up, joining the dashboard just below the central vents but adds a storage area underneath for phones, maps, etc. Overall the feel of the cabin isn’t dramatically different from the existing Kona and there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with that.

The stand-up central touchscreen shares the same excellent display used in other Hyundai and Kia products. It provides good contrast and brightness in all lighting with virtual no glare or washout even when the sun is shining directly on it. The standard Hyundai user interface is fairly straightforward and easy to use with some additional menu items specific to electric operation. Unlike a Tesla, it also has support for Android Auto and Apple Carplay and has a wireless phone charger.

Driving the Kona Electric isn’t a dramatically different experience from the 1.6-liter Turbo variant despite carrying about 700 additional pounds everywhere. It hasn’t been as weight optimized as a Bolt and thus carries about 250 more pounds than the Chevrolet. At 201-hp, the motor matches the output of the Bolt but the Kona’s 290 lb-ft of torque outdo the Chevrolet by 24.

Sam Abuelsamid

A Kona EV isn’t going to keep up the higher powered Teslas in a drag race, but it’s roughly 7 second 0-60 acceleration matches the Bolt and should be more than adequate for almost everyone. The instant response of the electric drive makes it great for driving around town like Santa Monica boulevard or up Topanga Canyon road. The low rolling resistance tires limit ultimate adhesion but the Kona is nicely balanced and independent suspension gives it decent ride quality even with the extra mass of the battery. For now at least, there is no all-wheel-drive variant, but since the battery doesn’t intrude on the axle area, it should be possible to add a second motor in the back if the demand is there.

My biggest functional complaint with the Kona as well as the existing Ioniq Electric is Hyundai's decision not to go all in on one-pedal driving diving. While the paddles on the steering wheel allow the driver to dial in one of three levels of regenerative braking, there is no mode like the Bolt's Low ""gear"" or the Leaf's E-pedal switch that enables full regen braking down to a stop. At maximum regen in the Hyundai, it will generate up to about 0.25g of deceleration which is great for driving in traffic like that along Santa Monica Boulevard, it still ramps out at low speed requiring you to switch over to the brake pedal. Hyundai explained that their consumer studies indicate that most drivers prefer this, but since it's just a software implementation anyway, I think Hyundai should offer a full one-pedal mode for those of us that want to use it. Once you get used to it, it's definitely the best way to drive in traffic.

At 164 and 102.4 inches respectively, the Kona has exactly the same length and wheelbase as the Bolt. However, the Kona is 1.4 inches wider while the Bolt is 1.8 inches taller. Both have the same passenger volume, but it’s proportioned differently. The Kona gets an inch of additional shoulder room in front and nearly 2 inches in the rear. However, the Bolt has a three inch advantage in rear leg room which is instantly noticeable. This can partly be attributed to the Bolt’s thinner front seats but if you plan to regularly carry rear seat passengers this should be considered.

Another place where the Hyundai has an advantage over the Chevy is in charging. Both incorporate the standard SAE combo connector as standard equipment for DC fast charging. While both vehicles use liquid-cooled batteries supplied by LG Chem, the Hyundai supports a faster 75 kW charging rate than the 50 kW capability of the Bolt. That means you can get to an 80% charge in 54 minutes compared to the 79 minutes in the Chevy. With its extra 20 miles of range replenished faster, the Kona may be a better road trip option once Electrify America gets its first 500 charging stations open in 2019.

Sam Abuelsamid

The 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric appears to be a very solid option for anyone looking for a mainstream electric vehicle. Its shape makes it more of the type of crossover that today’s consumers seem to prefer and its design is distinctive and arguably more appealing than the competition. For those that need some extra rear seat room, the Bolt may be the better choice today or you can wait for the Kona’s corporate cousin, the Kia e-Niro. The Kia has the same 201-hp electric drive and 64 kWh battery but it’s 100.9 cubic feet of passenger volume make it considerably more comfortable than either the Kona or Bolt.

The sales success (if not financial success) of Tesla has inspired everyone to start taking the EV market seriously. That means we will soon have more appealing electric choices than ever, at least for those in California and the Northeast. Depending on demand, Hyundai has said it will expand availability as needed. The one big unknown at this is written is the price of the Kona Electric although it should be competitive with the Bolt, meaning somewhere around $37,000 to start when it goes on sale in January.

Hyundai covered the cost of travel and lodging for us to evaluate the Kona Electric","The Hyundai Nexo arrives in a few weeks and electric versions of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro crossovers will be here soon.
To be fair, the Tesla Model 3 isn’t really the competition for the Kona, that would be the Chevrolet Bolt.

Virulent bacteria evolve slowly, sometimes taking years before becoming dangerous enough to trigger a full-fledged outbreak.

In zero gravity, the trajectory of that same bacteria’s destructive power can be charted sometimes in a matter of days. As a result, pharmaceutical companies increasingly are looking to conduct experiments in space as part of the $3 billion “space economy.”

Merck, Procter & Gamble and Eli Lilly have all run experiments on the International Space Station over the past decade, but it’s expensive and labor intensive, requiring an astronaut to perform the tests.

Israeli-Swiss tech firm SpacePharma has a different approach.

For just $230,000 – a tiny fraction of the development budget for a new drug – clients can rent one of SpacePharma’s orbiting “minilabs” for up to six months.

SpacePharma pre-loads the tiny labs – no larger than a milk carton – with all the components required for a variety of tests and hitches a ride on a rocket.

SpacePharma has two minilabs already in operation. One went up with the help of India’s national space agency in February 2017. The other is integrated into the International Space Station and was launched from Virginia’s Wallops Flight Facility later that year.

SpacePharma was supposed to catch a ride on one of Elon Musk’s SpaceX rockets, but that plan got pushed back after the 2016 Falcon 9 explosion that also destroyed Israel’s Amos 6 satellite. SpacePharma plans to try again with the Falcon in early 2019, to be followed by another minilab launch with Italy’s Areianspace.

On board the minilab, all tests are conducted via remote-controlled syringes and pumps. There are no tiny humans or robots. Customers administer their experiments via a web interface from Earth.

“When there are no G-forces, everything grows and reacts much more clearly than on Earth,” SpacePharma chairman Yossi Yamin tells ISRAEL21c.

Proteins crystalize differently and molecules take on different shapes when there’s less atmospheric “noise” in the way.

SpacePharma conducts tests with bacteria, stem cells, spores, muscles and nerves. The company has developed what Yamin calls an “organ on a chip” – essentially a petri dish in 3D.

“On Earth, a petri dish allows you to grow a culture in two dimensions,” Yamin explains. “But with low gravity in orbit, you get a third dimension. The culture grows more like in the body itself, not smashed to the surface of the dish.”

Sometimes there can be bizarre reactions. A scientist working for NASA once sent flatworms to space to test their regenerative properties. Some of the worms grew two heads. Even crazier, when they reproduced in space, their offspring also had two heads.

Brings down astronomical costs

Not having an astronaut running the tests represents a huge cost savings. “To train an astronaut can cost $100 million,” Yamin says.

SpacePharma has raised $8 million since it was founded six years ago and employs a couple dozen staff. “Not many people imagined we could bypass an astronaut with such a small investment in money.”

SpacePharma makes money by charging for use of its minilabs, but the company is also developing its own intellectual property. Yamin says SpacePharma contracted with a big pharma company to use some of its reagents (substances used in chemical reactions) to create a new molecule that may help treat a particular respiratory disease. If it takes off, SpacePharma will receive royalties.

While pharma companies and research facilities have been SpacePharma’s first clients (the faculty of medicine at the University of Zurich recently carried out an experiment with microphages, a type of white blood cell), the low cost offers the opportunity for individuals with means to run their own experiments.

This might help with the development of “orphan drugs” for rare diseases that do not warrant a pharma company’s attention or investment.

“You don’t need 250,000 patients for a trial,” as a pharma company would demand, Yamin says. “You can start with just 250 people who have the same disease profile.”

Yamin imagines that if these patients connected on Facebook and each invested $1,000, it would be enough to claim real estate in a SpacePharma minilab. Indeed, there has been interest from several groups, including patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare but fatal brain disorder.

Bringing down antibiotics

Yamin founded SpacePharma in Switzerland with R&D in Herzliya. Another office is located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The company has partnerships with the European Union’s Horizon 20/20 program, the US National Institutes of Health, NASA, the Italian Space Agency and the Israeli Space Agency.

Miniaturizing the lab has been the company’s claim to fame so far, but Yamin says the next step is to make it “around the size of a James Bond suitcase,” which will allow SpacePharma to work with even more clients.

Tests done in outer space don’t always have to be returned to Earth in full; sometimes all that’s needed is the data. That’s the case with gene expression, which is how the information stored in DNA gets turned into proteins. “You don’t need to send back the gene itself,” Yamin explains.

It goes without saying that SpacePharma won’t be returning to Earth any plague-generating germs. “The idea is not to bring down more virulent bacteria but to bring down antibiotics!” Yamin emphasizes.

SpacePharma is not the only company running pharma tests in space – Nanoracks and Space Tango are among the better-known private competitors. Big players such as Airbus and Boeing are getting into the game, as well.

The US government-funded CASIS (Center for Advancement of Science in Space), a nonprofit group that oversees activities on the International Space Station, has managed more than 200 research projects in microgravity since 2011. And there have been some big success stories already.

Merck ran tests in space on its breakthrough cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda. Amgen developed osteoporosis medicine Prolia after gathering data from tests on Russian space mice. Testing in space enabled Milliken to make more flame-retardant textiles for first-responders. And retailer Target backed a “cotton sustainability challenge” in 2017 on the International Space Station with a million-dollar prize.

The market is clearly primed. Research firm BMI found that 60 percent of pharma company executives believe the space economy will have a high disruption on their sector in the coming decades. The long-term goal is to manufacture next-generation medicines in low orbit.

While SpacePharma works closely with CASIS, it doesn’t have to. That’s an advantage, Yamin says: SpacePharma clients don’t have to play by International Space Station rules if they simply want to experiment in microgravity on an independently orbiting minilab.

The band have been on hiatus since wrapping up their North American R40 tour in 2015, with guitarist Alex Lifeson reporting in January this year that Rush were “basically done.”

And in a new interview with Rolling Stone, Lee echoes Lifeson’s comments and says fans have “no chance” of seeing the trio tour together again.

When asked about the current status of Rush, Lee responds: “Well, I’d say I can’t really tell you much other than that there are zero plans to tour again.

“We’re very close and talk all the time, but we don’t talk about work. We’re friends, and we talk about life as friends. I can’t really tell you more than that, I’m afraid.

“I would say there’s no chance of seeing Rush on tour again as Alex, Geddy and Neil. But would you see one of us or two of us or three of us? That’s possible.”

Lee says that he’s been recording bits and pieces when he’s been playing in the studio, but hasn’t given much thought to a possible follow-up to his 2000 solo album My Favourite Headache.

We’re very close and talk all the time, but we don’t talk about work Geddy Lee

He says: “I’ve been so busy the past three years with the Geddy Lee’s Big Beautiful Book Of Bass book project, which consumed my entire being, that I haven’t been thinking about another music project at this point.

“I say that, and at the same time, another part of my brain is always thinking about another music project. But when you’ve spent 42 years working closely with the same people and formed the kind of bond and friendship that the three of us have had – and maintained to this day – it’s a big decision and a big question what you want to do next... or if you want to do something next.”

Lee’s book will be published on December 4 via Harper Collins and features interviews with artists including John Paul Jones, Adam Clayton, Robert Trujillo, Bill Wyman, Les Claypool and Bob Daisley, while Lifeson also contributes to the 400-page publication.

Meanwhile, Rush’s classic 1978 album Hemispheres will be reissued on November 16 to mark its 40th anniversary. Along with the original album, the new version will also include their set from the Pinkpop Festival in June 1979 along with a disc of 5.1 mixes and rare material.

The 45-metre catamaran will require no fossil fuels, offer unlimited range and has the potential to travel at 50 knots, with a cruising speed of 30 knots in any conditions – including no wind.

Belfast has a rich heritage of shipbuilding and Artemis Technologies, a spin-off from the America’s Cup team Artemis Racing, will establish a new centre at the city’s harbour in a bid to revive the industry.

The company led by double Olympic gold medallist Iain Percy aims to harness new green maritime technologies for its passenger boat.

He said: “It can go forever. This boat could set off on to the ocean and ad infinitum could sail around the globe at 30 knots.”

The watercraft will store wind power in electric batteries to cover spells when it is not blowing.

This means it will be able to sail in flat conditions or when the breeze is against it.

Mr Percy said the boat would be autonomous but manned, akin to an aircraft pilot who controls the plane while the actual wing movements are automated using sensors.

He said: “Sensors are better than sailors. It would not last very long if the pilot was doing it himself.”

The vessel will be ultra-light, built using cutting-edge composite materials and able to carry up to 50 passengers.

The ship was designed using expertise from the America’s Cup, F1 racing and aerospace firms.

Mr Percy added: “We aim to lead in the decarbonisation of the maritime industry by building on our America’s Cup heritage and expertise in hydrofoils, wing sails and control systems to develop and manufacture green-powered commercial vessels, helping to ensure a sustainable maritime future.”

The vessel has a variety of applications, including city-to-city passenger transportation.

It will be the first in a series of commercial maritime products developed by Artemis Technologies in Belfast using the wind and innovative energy recovery systems.

Mr Percy said: “Through collaboration, research and innovation we plan to utilise Belfast’s rich maritime history and the region’s world-class expertise in aerospace and composite engineering to create the UK’s most advanced maritime manufacturing facility.”

A total of 35 jobs will be created at the outset.

Belfast has a deepwater harbour, an asset Mr Percy said was hard to find and will be valuable for the commercial venture.

Under a new international agreement, issued by the International Maritime Organisation, the global maritime sector has committed to cutting emissions by at least half by 2050.

Mr Percy added: “We believe, given our expertise and the strength of the skills base here in Northern Ireland, that we can position the region at the forefront of helping deliver these targets, by developing new green innovations to assist in the decarbonisation of maritime.”

Food insecurity doesn’t just affect unemployed individuals and those living in low-income communities. That’s a common misconception. It’s an issue for working families — and for the business community overall.

“Even in the wealthiest communities, you still have families struggling to make ends meet,” said Gerry Brisson, director of Gleaners Community Food Bank. “Forty-seven percent of the people who get help from a food bank or food rescue are employed. You’ll find kids getting free and reduced lunch, breakfast, an after-school snack or dinner in every single public or charter school.”

Forgotten Harvest Director Kirk Mayes agreed. “If there are any life transitions going on behind closed doors, even if you live in an affluent community, the first place that instability rears its head is at kitchen tables.”

Among the physical toll hunger takes, there is an extraordinary annual $460 billion economic cost associated with food insecurity resulting from difficulty learning, reduced lifetime earnings, lost productivity and health-care expenses, according to economists The Perryman Group.

Nevertheless, the Environmental Protection Agency reports we don’t eat more than 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S., and we discard more than 37 million tons of food annually.

These staggering statistics encouraged The Kroger Co. to establish Zero Hunger Zero Waste, a program designed to eliminate waste companywide and help eliminate hunger in the 35 states in which it operates by 2025. The plan includes:

Creating a $10 million innovation fund;

Donating 3 billion balanced meals; and

Joining forces with thousands of nonprofits, including Gleaners and Forgotten Harvest, to make it happen.

“The reality is we operate businesses in Michigan, and people are hungry in Michigan. Oakland, Wayne and Macomb are three counties that are among the top most food insecure in the country,” said Rachel Hurst, corporate affairs manager at Kroger.

In October, Kroger partnered with Crain Content Studio, the marketing storytelling arm of Crain’s Detroit Business, to gather experts from government, nonprofits and retail to talk about solving the problems of hunger and food waste.","More than 40 million people are struggling with hunger in the United States.

The forum in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was organized by FAO and China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. In 2006, China was the first country to establish a strategic alliance with FAO on South-South cooperation, and today more than one thousand Chinese experts and technicians have supported 37 countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean on agriculture issues.

On the sidelines of the forum, FAO signed a two-year agreement with China and Madagascar that will see China share its technical expertise to boost Madagascar's agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors, with support from FAO. One of the aims of the project is to make Madagascar self-sufficient in rice production by 2025.

Working together

Demand by countries for South-South cooperation programs has increased in the past decade, and such programs have proven to be an effective instrument for sharing knowledge and facilitating mutual learning.

To respond to the growing demand, FAO together with sister Rome-based UN agencies the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have produced the Joint Roadmap on Sooth-South Cooperation as a common strategy for implementing triangular projects in developing countries.

Hunger and malnutrition in Asia

The forum comes as four UN agencies (FAO, UNICEF, WFP, WHO) released a new regional report on food security and malnutrition in Asia and the Pacific region. The report highlights that nearly half a billion people (486 million) are undernourished in the region, with little improvement in the last two years. One child in every four (79 million) suffers from stunting and 34 million children are wasting, including 12 million who suffer from severe acute malnutrition. At the same time, obesity in the region is increasing.

The four agencies warn of a colossal human loss to Asia and the Pacific and its economies if countries in the region do not recommit themselves to ending all forms of malnutrition and achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.

Centre of Excellence

The Director-General also announced plans to establish an International Centre of Excellence for Agriculture Innovation and Rural Development in Beijing. The Centre will provide training and capacity development for agricultural innovation and rural revitalization, and promote greater investment in rural areas in order to fast-track the achievement of Zero Hunger.

Graziano da Silva also signed a Memorandum of Understanding between FAO and the China Agriculture Science and Education Foundation. The collaboration will focus on fostering sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural development in China, reducing rural poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, and facilitating China's regional and international agricultural cooperation.

Flomo, Jr., has called on Liberians and international partners to work together, to ensure that everyone gets involved in agriculture, if Liberia and the world will attain zero hunger by 2030.

Minister Flomo said nobody can learn well in the presence of hunger, which has the propensity to damage the educational system of the country and the health sector.

“We know hunger and when you are hungry you can’t be strong to learn even if the best teacher is teaching you, and you lack strength as well. This can stop if everyone sees agriculture as the only way to end hunger in Liberia,” he stated.

Minister Flomo made these statements on Thursday, November 15, at the celebration of World Food Day (WFP) in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County, under the theme, “A Zero Hunger World by 2030, is it possible?” It was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, with funding from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

He continued: “We all need to collaborate and find different ways of ending hunger in Liberia, because the common people’s lives will change if they can afford to eat every day.”

Dr. Flomo further said the government has recently provided US$1.9 million to be used for rice production.

He noted that the government has also seen the need to produce more food in Liberia and that it needs to continue from all sectors of the country.

“If Liberia won’t achieve any other goal, let us achieve the goal of ending hunger by 2030. This can only be done when we all get serious about ending hunger in Liberia, “ he said.

Ms. Mariatou Njie, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representative to Liberia, who read a statement on behalf of Dr. Jose Grazino da Silva, Director-General of FAO, reiterated the organization’s commitment to support Liberia in implementing measures geared towards increasing food production and thus eliminate hunger in the country.

In this regard, Ms. Njie said, FAO Liberia, in partnership with the government, has been contributing immensely in providing support to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) number two in the country.

“With this in mind, FAO is keen in providing stronger support to invest in youth development and empowerment programs in the sector. In fact, governments have the most fundamental role in achieving Zero Hunger by ensuring that vulnerable people have sufficient income to buy the food they need, or the means to produce it for themselves, even in times of conflict,” she said.

However, she said, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment. It aims to provide people with the necessary nutrients for a healthy life.

She added that world leaders define the eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition as SDG2 and this is the cardinal objective of the Agenda.

Ms. Njie said the latest estimates have revealed that the number of undernourished people in the world increased in 2017 for the third consecutive year.

“Last year, 821 million people suffered from hunger – 11 percent of the world population – one in nine people on the planet.

“However, the growing rate of undernourished people is not the only big challenge we are facing. Other forms of malnutrition have also increased.

“As a matter of fact,” she said “we are witnessing the globalization of obesity. For example, obesity rates are climbing faster in Africa than any other region – eight of the 20 countries in the world with the fastest rising rates of adult obesity are in Africa.”

Furthermore, she said childhood overweight affected 38 million children under five years of age in 2017, and about 46 percent of these children live in Asia, while 25 percent live in Africa.”

“The growing rate of obesity is happening at a huge socio-economic cost. Obesity is a risk factor for many non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Estimates indicate that the global economic impact of obesity is about US$2 trillion per year (2.8 percent of the global GDP),” Ms. Njie noted.","The Minister of Agriculture Dr. Mogana S.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường made the statement at the International Support Group (ISG) Plenary Meeting 2018 held on Thursday in Hà Nội.

At the meeting, he called for co-operation and support from international partners, related ministries and agencies, domestic and foreign businesses, and voluteers to jointly implement the National Action Plan on Zero Hunger in Việt Nam by 2025.

“Việt Nam aims to provide enough food and nutrition to enhance Vietnamese people’s mental and physical health, and, at the same time, to implement the Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) to which the Government has committed with the UN,” the minister said.

The Zero Hunger initiative was launched by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in 2012.

Việt Nam was one of the countries with remarkable achievements in reducing the number of hungry and poor people.

However, some gaps remain. The child malnutrition rate remains high, based on the WHO classification. Particularly, the stunting–form malnutrition rate is especially high in provinces in the Central Highlands, north central and northern mountainous region.

Through the National Action Plan (NAP), Việt Nam aims to narrow the existing gaps and improve the country’s food security and nutrition.

The five key targets of the NAP by 2025 are that households will have enough food with sufficient nutrition all year round; malnutrition in children under two will be reduced; sustainable food systems will be developed; productivity and income of most small-scale production households will increase; and food will not be lost or wasted.

As agriculture and nutrition often involve different sectors and require diverse expertise, a complex action plan targeting different levels ranging from policymakers to community-level stakeholders will be implemented by different ministries.

“As a specialised agency of the United Nations with a clear mandate to address hunger and poverty, FAO has been taking the lead in undertaking the global Sustainable Food and Agriculture programme to contribute to the Zero Hunger goal,” said Albert T Lieberg, a representative of FAO Việt Nam.

“Achieving food security requires an integrated and holistic approach and we believe that, with intersectional collaboration and partnerships, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to reach a shared conviction of the National Action Plan so hunger can be eliminated in our lifetimes,” he said. — VNS","HÀ NỘI — The Vietnamese Government affirmed that agricultural development was the best solution to the ""Zero Hunger"" and ""poverty reduction"" challenges, contributing to the goal of sustainable hunger eradication, food security and improved nutrition.

WFP’s Executive Director, David Beasley, and Alibaba Partner and Chairman of the Alibaba Foundation, Sun Lijun, signed the agreement at Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou, China.

What exactly will come out of this partnership?

Under the framework, Alibaba will provide its leading technology and resources to support the digital transformation of WFP’s operations. In particular, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba, will collaborate with WFP to develop a digital World Hunger Map to monitor the status of global hunger and help enhance the efficiency of operations to support efforts towards the goal of ending world hunger by 2030.

Alleviating global poverty and fighting hunger is the shared vision of Alibaba and WFP, said Sun. We look forward to joining the global campaign of fighting hunger using our innovative technologies in data intelligence and cloud computing, as well as sharing our experience in China and worldwide.

Beasley lauded the strategic partnership as a milestone in the relationship between WFP and China’s private sector.

We now have a great ally in the fight against hunger, he said. The support and expertise of the Alibaba Group including their cloud computing, advanced data analytic capabilities, and online platforms will help WFP become even more efficient and effective in its work to reverse the trend of rising hunger around the world.

The visual World Hunger Map is intended to leverage data insights to help WFP improve assessment and monitoring to increase efficiency and shorten emergency response times. To coordinate their joint efforts, the parties will also create a Digital Transformation Working Group to determine priorities, assess new opportunities, and review progress on projects.

Alibaba established the Alibaba Poverty Relief Program in December 2017, aiming to invest RMB10 billion in five years to alleviate poverty with focuses on education, rural commerce advancement, empowering women, healthcare and environmental sustainability. In August, 2017, Alibaba worked with WFP on a poverty alleviation project by connecting small farmers in Anhui, a province in Eastern China, directly with the market to obtain better prices for agricultural produce.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Thursday, restated commitment of the Zero Hunger Strategic Initiative to end hunger and achieve food security by year 2030.

Zamfara students seek govt help over new tuition fees

The former president made this known on Thursday at the Nigeria Zero Hunger Strategic Forum Meeting in Sokoto State.

Obasanjo said the initiative, which would spread across the 36 states and Abuja, would work to improve food security through the promotion of sustainable agriculture.

“It is essentially also to bring us closer to a zero hunger world, rapid economic growth and increase agricultural productivity.

“At the moment, we are targeting six states. They are Sokoto, Kebbi, Borno, Ogun, Ebonyi and Benue.

“We are working substantially with our various development partners together to succeed on our target of ending hunger and poverty across the entire country,” he said.

Obasanjo said that the forum would support, encourage and monitor progress in the six states, adding that the governors of the states had agreed to implement the Zero Hunger Roadmap.

“I feel highly honoured to be here in the ancient city of Sokoto, the Seat of the Caliphate.” he said

In his remarks the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar said agriculture remained the mainstay of the economy.

“For the people of Sokoto state, especially our ancestors had laid for us a solid foundation on which sustainable development could have been engineered.

“Unfortunately, however, farming culture and all associated fortunes were thrown away as a result of the oil boom,” he said.

Abubakar said that the forum would no doubt serve as impetus which would embolden the government in its desire to implement the agriculture policies.

Sultan said that in January 2017, history was made when the Federal Government took the initiative by launching the Strategic Plan.

“The plan was tagged: “Synthesis Report of the Nigeria Zero Hunger Strategic Review’ and the effort is to end hunger and achieve food security by the year 2030.

Gov. Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal of of Sokoto state, said that strategic plans and programmes had been formulated over the years with an ardent focus on achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.

Tambuwal said that successive governments had made several attempts to reorient the people and to ensure the restoration of farming values, but very little successes had been recorded.

“I sincerely believe that with proper commitment and careful planning, the aspirations could be realised; and our state could excel and become a food basket for the nation.

“Therefore, as responsive communities, we are determined to channel our human and material resources in the most productive ways, particularly through the development of agriculture.

“Every citizen of our dear nation has the civic responsibility of advancing the course of its development.

“All hands must therefore be on deck to plan and realise our Zero Hunger desire as outlined by our Zero Hunger Strategic Initiative,” he said.

Alhaji Bashir Garba, the Chairman, Local Organising Committee of the event, said that the Sokoto State Government under the able leadership of Rt. Hon. Aminu Tambuwal had executed considerable number of projects to boost agriculture in the State.

Garba, who is also the Secretary to the State Government, said that this ranged from the procurement, distribution of farming implements, assorted fertilisers to chemicals. (NAN)

Much like Alibaba’s agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Alibaba’s involvement will be around the digital transformation of the organisation, using its cloud technology as the foundation.

The first step in the agreement will see Alibaba using this technology to create a World Hunger Map”, which will look at how much global hunger there is, as well as looking at ways the efficiency of the operations can be improved.

The map will use data to see where emergency response times could be shortened and assessment time reduced. As the project develops, a newly created Digital Transformation Working Group, comprised of members from both sides, will continue to look at priorities and look at new areas.

WFP’s executive director, David Beasley, said, “We now have a great ally in the fight against hunger.

A project to promote recycling, Zero Waste was first applied in the complex as well as ministries and spread to municipalities all across Turkey. In a speech at the summit, Emine Erdoğan hailed the progress made and called for more public awareness on the issue.

The project involves saving everything from paper to discarded metals for future use or for recycling. From ministries to small town restaurants with their own recycling practices, the campaign took hold in one year.

The first lady said in her speech yesterday that the Zero Waste project was necessitated by a need to ""redesign our lifestyle"" due to climate change. ""We need to revise our culture of consumption. Otherwise, there will be irreversible damage to nature, lives of its inhabitants, as well as to prosperity and economy of societies. The world needs to focus on use of renewable energy,"" she said. ""We aim for a more livable environment and a stronger economy by classifying the waste at its source and recycling it,"" she added.

""I am pleased to announce that we have not had garbage trucks at the presidential complex for a long time. Our personnel are trained and we have set up a system to maximize recycling of waste at the complex. For instance, we use compost for landscaping and I believe this system will be in use in all public buildings soon,"" she said. Erdoğan hailed support from the public and said companies, universities etc., had started setting their own systems for recycling. ""Now, we need municipalities [to be up] for a larger task of waste-sorting and recycling just like our citizens at home.

Municipalities should abandon uncontrolled waste storage practices or burning the waste and all cities should have facilities turning waste into energy or compost,"" she said. Giving the example of Kamikatsu, a town in Japan that is dubbed as the world's zero waste town as 80 percent of waste is recycled there, Erdoğan said the secret of the town's success was that ""everyone helped in this mobilization to reduce waste.""

""They devised as many as 45 categories in sorting waste and they even removed stickers from plastic bottles and sorted them separately. So, individual participation will be a turning point in this campaign,"" the first lady added.

Turkey's recycling drive saved more than 30 million trees between 2017 and 2018 and more than 1.7 million tons of waste paper and cartons were recycled last year and within the first three months of 2018.

In recent years, Turkey has started to prioritize waste management over concerns of rising environmental damage with municipalities responsible for garbage collection upgrading their waste management systems. Turkey also managed to recycle more than half of the plastic bottles in the market last year. According to official figures, out of the 236,000 tons of plastic bottles sold last year, 140,000 tons were recycled. In the first quarter this year, 17,500 tons of plastic bottles were recycled to be used again.

""You can set up a system but it won't work if you cannot change the behavior of people. Human factor is important. We would fail if people were not willing to participate,"" Emine Erdoğan said in her speech. ""Personal demands and rejections shape our life. For example, choosing canvas bags instead of plastic bags is a small step but helps us to preserve more trees and water sources,"" she said.

Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said at the summit that more municipalities would switch to recycling by the end of 2019 and they also work to curb the use of plastic bags. ""Starting next January, consumers will be obliged to pay for plastic bags while shopping.

He said that their aim was to bring the recycling rate to 35 within the next five years. ""This also means a TL 20 billion [$3.58 billion] saving for our economy,"" he added.

The summit concluded with awards to companies and nongovernmental organizations active in recycling campaigns and practicing it successfully, including Turkish Airlines, Boğaziçi University and public broadcaster TRT. First lady Erdoğan herself was presented with the ""Zero Waste, Zero Hunger"" award by the Turkey office of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for her project.","One year after it was launched, the Zero Waste project inaugurated by first lady Emine Erdoğan was evaluated at a summit in the presidential complex in the capital Ankara yesterday.
A project to promote recycling, Zero Waste was first applied in the complex as well as ministries and spread to municipalities all across Turkey.
The first lady said in her speech yesterday that the Zero Waste project was necessitated by a need to ""redesign our lifestyle"" due to climate change.
For example, choosing canvas bags instead of plastic bags is a small step but helps us to preserve more trees and water sources,"" she said.

AZE released the assessment in advance of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

AZE is a global partnership that works to identify, map and safeguard sites that are home to highly threatened species. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) supported the assessment as part of the ‘Alliance for Zero Extinction: Conserving Earth’s Most Irreplaceable Sites for Endangered Biodiversity’ project, which is led by BirdLife International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and American Bird Conservancy (ABC). The protection of AZE sites is a recognized indicator for the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets 11 and 12.

The assessment maps the ranges of 1,483 highly threatened species known to only occur in a single site. To qualify for AZE status, a site must be the last known location of a critically endangered or endangered species, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species extinction threat categories. The assessment classifies 853 sites as AZE sites and finds that 43 percent of AZE sites are currently unprotected. Among the 1,483 global AZE trigger species, 41 percent are amphibians, 15 percent are mammals, 13 percent are birds, ten percent are freshwater crustaceans, nine percent are cacti, four percent are cycads and eight percent are classified as other taxa.

Recognition of AZE sites as key biodiversity areas can improve lives through preserving local biodiversity.

AZE Chairman Mike Parr, who also serves as ABC President, emphasized that it has “been proven that well-managed protected areas prevent extinctions.” He said over 20 governments are taking action to protect their AZE sites, but stressed that urgent action is needed from all 109 countries and territories with AZE sites to protect these unique places and species.

The assessment provides evidence that effective protection can improve species’ status. As an illustration, Colombia established the Ranita Amphibian Reserve to protect two species of poison dart frogs (Andinobates dorisswansonae and Andinobates tolimense), an action that has improved the species’ status to the extent that neither frog qualifies as an AZE trigger species any longer. In the US, the ABC, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and others successfully translocated the Millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris) to a second Hawaiian island, which means that the species now occurs in two sites and is no longer considered an AZE trigger species. Brazil, one of the countries with the most AZE sites, became the first country to enact legislation to ensure that AZE sites are taken into account in national development and conservation planning.

In a press release, UNEP biodiversity expert Ersin Esen underscored the importance of conserving AZE sites beyond conservation benefits and preventing extinction of endangered species. Esen explained that the recognition and protection of AZE sites as key biodiversity areas “have the potential not just to save species but to improve lives” through preserving local biodiversity, protecting water sources, mitigating climate change effects and providing cultural and other ecosystem services.

As part of the wider project, AZE is working with the Governments of Brazil, Chile and Madagascar to improve management of AZE sites to halt global extinctions and safeguard key habitats for endangered species. The AZE project also works with key financial institutions to integrate conservation of threatened species into their environmental safeguard policies.

142,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/tory-mps-demand-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-theresa-may-climate-change,"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Guardian,Tory MPs demand net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"Fifty Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to adopt an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions to net zero before 2050, to show international leadership on climate change and protect British jobs.

Former ministers Damian Green, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry are among the signatories of the letter to the prime minister, which said that a stronger long-term goal would cut energy bills and improve air quality.

The UK is committed to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. But the government recently asked its climate advisers to consider whether a deeper cut is needed in the light of a landmark UN report on the risks posed by global warming.

Simon Clarke, the Brexiter Tory MP who organised the letter, said: “By setting a net-zero target before 2050 we can ensure the UK is at the forefront of the zero-carbon technological revolution whilst cementing our status as a global climate leader.”

More than 160 MPs have signed the plea to May, including from Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party. Organisers hope to get 100 Tory MPs signed up by the time the government’s advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, reports back next spring.

Meeting a goal of net-zero emissions before 2050 would require far-reaching changes beyond those already under way in energy, buildings and transport.

But the letter’s signatories argue it would put the UK “at the forefront of the race for investment in clean industries”, and build on a history of “British ingenuity” in science and engineering.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used his conference speech in September to commit the party to a target of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. The letter calls for the goal to be met before 2050 but there is no agreed date – WWF said this week that 2045 was possible.

The intervention comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Climate Change Act receiving royal assent on Monday, the same day the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is due to publish a major report on how global warming will affect the UK.","Fifty Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to adopt an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions to net zero before 2050, to show international leadership on climate change and protect British jobs.

143,https://animeuknews.net/2018/11/grimoire-of-zero-review/,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Anime UK News,Grimoire of Zero Review • Anime UK News,"There has certainly been no shortage lately of fantasy anime making it to the UK through either streaming or home video. The latest of these is a series from last year’s spring season, Grimoire of Zero, which is being brought to the UK thanks to MVM Entertainment. Time to jump in and see whether the series is a hit or a zero.

The story is set in a world where witches are hunted for causing harm to human kind with their sorcery. Our protagonist, simply called Mercenary, is a Beastfallen: a human who was cursed at birth to have the partial appearance of an animal. Beastfallen are hunted by witches, who wish to use their heads and blood in rituals, but they’re also feared by humans for their typically unkind natures. Mercenary spends his days travelling from place to place with the hopes of someday opening his own tavern.

One day while on the run from a witch, Mercenary stumbles across a young girl who uses magic to trap his pursuer. The girl reveals herself to be a witch called Zero – and promptly faints from hunger. Mercenary reluctantly feeds Zero, and in her gratitude she tells him that she’s hunting down the ‘Grimoire of Zero’, a book of magic that she wrote. Zero suddenly mentions that she’d like to employ Mercenary as her bodyguard, with the promise of ridding him of the Beastfallen curse once they find the Grimoire. With an end to his lifelong suffering in sight, Mercenary agrees to the conditions and the two set out on their quest.

The nice thing about Grimoire of Zero is that it’s a fairly traditional fantasy series rather than being an isekai or game-like world. There is both sorcery and magic in this series, the latter being something learnt from the Grimoire of Zero. Sorcery is performed with the use of magic circles, while magic is put into action through chants and keywords. It’s a surprisingly deep and well thought out portrayal and the series does a good job of explaining everything to the viewer. The same can be said of the concept of the Beastfallen, which could’ve easily been brushed aside but instead is explained straight away. Given how many other fantasy series completely neglect certain elements of the world in favour of the protagonist and (usually) a harem of love interests, it’s refreshing to see.

It’s not just the world that’s well thought out either. The characters have a lot going for them too. In a world where witches, Beastfallen and humans are fighting against one another (and Beastfallen are hunted by witches), it’s interesting to see things from the perspectives of various characters, who all come from different sides of the conflict. The interactions between Mercenary and Zero pave the way for understanding that not all witches are evil, which is also true of other witches Mercenary meets on his journey. As for Zero herself, we have someone who has no desire to hunt down Beastfallen nor harm humans; all she wants to do is find the missing Grimoire. It’s an interesting stance to take when her brethren are being burnt at the stake. This series spends a good deal of time on its character development and that definitely works in its favour.



Despite the fact that Grimoire of Zero is an anime adaption of a light novel series, it actually only adapts the very first volume of the series. For a twelve episode series it never feels as if the content is padded or being drawn out, and the ending is also fairly conclusive while leaving itself open for future seasons. It’s nice to see given just how many anime based on light novels end up having unsatisfying conclusions when there may never be future adaptations. This is especially important in a case like Grimoire of Zero’s where the original light novels have not yet been licensed for an English release.

Animation for Grimoire of Zero has been handled by studio White Fox (Re:Zero, Steins;Gate) and looks great overall. It’s perhaps not as captivating as their work on Re:Zero and other action series, but it certainly doesn’t do anything particularly wrong. I especially like the fact that there isn’t a lot of fanservice on display, and instead of Mercenary being a ‘cutesy’ beast he’s much more realistic as to how a human-turned-beast should look in my mind. The action scenes for their part are well done, they just didn’t grip me and draw me into the situations as much as I’d hoped. Overall not a bad job for the studio, though.



Where music is concerned, the score is by Akito Matsuda (Sound! Euphonium; Love Chuunibyou & Other Delusions!) and works well for the series. While I was disappointed to find that there isn’t a great deal of variety in the music on offer, what is there is used sparingly enough that it doesn’t become repetitive and it blends into the show to offer an upbeat and happy soundtrack. The opening theme for the series is “Hakken-sha wa Watashi” by Tapimiru and is an incredibly catchy pop song, while the ending is “Hajimari no Shirushi” by Chima, which is a softer balled that depicts some very cute scenes of Mercenary and Zero travelling together.



The voice actors for the show all do a wonderful job in their roles, and I was especially fond of Yumiri Hanamori (Evileye in Overlord, Nozomi Kusaka in Seven Senses of the Re’Union) who played Zero. Originally I mistook Hanamori for voice actor Ikue Otani (Pikachu in Pokémon, Morgana in Persona 5) because of the particular accent the two seem to share. Hanamori’s performance really brought a lot of life and mischief to Zero and made her a very likable character. Mercenary’s voice actor Tsuyoshi Koyama (Miles Meyer in Gangsta, Basil in Dragon Ball Super) also does a good job in his role and gives Mercenary a gruff but kindhearted personality.



There is also an English dub on offer here and although I chose to watch the series subbed, what I sampled of the English dub was entertaining and all-round great listen. In the dub, Zero is played by Amanda Lee (Miou Suguri in Anonymous Noise, Akiho Shinomoto in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card), who does a fantastic job of conveying the same sense of excitement and bubbly personality of Zero that we see for the Japanese side. Mercenary is played by Jason Douglas (Joe Buttataki in Soul Eater, Miche Zacharius in Attack on Titan) and, like with Lee, does a good job of conveying a similar performance to what we hear in Japanese. Dub viewers shouldn’t be disappointed.



As previously mentioned, this release comes to the UK thanks to MVM Entertainment and is available as a Blu-ray/DVD collector’s combi edition, with a standard release set to follow in December (at the time of writing). The Collector’s Edition includes a 96 page artbook and six art cards.

Overall Grimoire of Zero offers a solid fantasy outing that will please both new fans and hardened veterans of the genre. With a likable cast of characters, strong, conclusive story, and brilliant English dub, this is a release not to be missed! I’ll certainly be keen to watch more of the anime if it gets a second series or to read the light novels/manga if they get licensed for the West.","The latest of these is a series from last year’s spring season, Grimoire of Zero, which is being brought to the UK thanks to MVM Entertainment.

145,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/re-zero-starting-life-in-another-world-memory-snow/ova/.138920,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Anime News Network,Re:ZERO Memory Snow OVA,"Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- is one of the better “transported to another world” light novel adaptations in recent memory. I'd go far enough to say that it's my favorite series in this subgenre, and I wouldn't be alone in saying that.

One of the main reasons Re:Zero was so memorable is that it never pulled any punches with its drama. In a genre filled with overpowered protagonists and half-cooked conflicts, Re:Zero 's Subaru constantly struggled in the face of death to get anything done. When the fans talk about what was so great about Re:Zero , it's the drama that they remember most.

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow has none of that. It is a side story set between the second and third arcs, not long after Subaru has gotten settled in at Roswaal's mansion. The OVA represents the side of Re:Zero that's easy to overlook when looking back on the series as a whole: the comedy.

There's a reason why the relatively comedic first half of Re:Zero isn't as fondly remembered as the second half: the jokes were repetitive. Subaru would banter with the other characters and inadvertently reveal something unflattering about himself, and the punchline would almost always be at his expense. The series could be pretty amusing at times, but the jokes were generally “chuckle-worthy” rather than gut-busting.

The OVA also has the downside of only focusing on a small handful of characters. Re:Zero has a very likable extended cast that could have been used for comedic fodder, but they only appear in brief cameo roles and have no spoken lines.

By narrowing its focus to only a very small slice of the series's appeal, Memory Snow was never going to be a satisfying continuation of Re:Zero in anime form. Based on several stories in the Re:Zero Short Story Collection, Memory Snow is the very definition of “filler.” It works as an appetizer for fans of the anime, but it's also a tease, especially when only a small fraction of the main story has actually been adapted so far.

Don't take Memory Snow too lightly, however. What this OVA may lack in substance it more than makes up for with laughs. Memory Snow is not only considerably funnier than the original series was, it's also a damn great comedy in general.

This time, the substance and delivery of the jokes have been changed up significantly. A large portion of the comedy is still in the rapid-fire banter, but Subaru is no longer the butt of every joke - the other characters get to be named and shamed, too. There's also a greater variety of jokes, from a KONOSUBA cameo to a hilarious extended sequence of deliberately terrible Engrish.

What makes Memory Snow shine as a comedy is how much care it puts into its timing and visual presentation. The characters deliver their lines with a snappy pace, and the pauses are well-timed to build up to each punchline. There's also a stronger focus on visual gags and creative set designs, perhaps to make up for the lack of action scenes in the OVA . My favorite sequence is modelled exactly like a Japanese variety show, showing character reactions in the corner of the screen while something ridiculous happens in the foreground. The visual execution of this OVA is so strong, in fact, that despite having read the short stories that formed the basis of Memory Snow, every single joke felt fresh to me.

It's also worth pointing out that despite featuring a scene where the female characters get drunk, the OVA still stays wholesome. It would have been completely expected of stories in Re:Zero 's genre to use this opportunity to make introduce some sexy-style fanservice , but there's only some light girl-on-girl skinship and nothing remotely racy. This is a positive or a negative depending on your perspective.

If there's one area Memory Snow definitely does slip up on, it's the music. Generally, the OVA repeats the tracks from the TV series, and the lack of versatility in the soundtrack for comedic scenes becomes evident in a 50-long minute OVA that focuses on nothing but comedy. That might explain why so much of the OVA has no background music and relies almost entirely on voice acting and sound effects to convey humor. There's also an awkwardly timed insert song partway through the OVA , which gives the impression that the story is wrapping up with a heartwarming conclusion, only it turns out there's at least another 15 minutes and one more insert song to go. I can't deny that some parts of Memory Snow feel awkwardly paced and lacking in focus, even considering that it's a filler story with little connection to the overarching plot.

Some of Memory Snow's structural problems may be related to how it adapts parts of multiple short stories into a single story. The OVA begins with Subaru and Emilia's aborted first date, a skit told in an Animate -exclusive store bonus short story, before moving abruptly into Subaru's discovery of an alcohol storage (from the “Alcohol Panic” short story). Then it tells the entirety of the “Some Like it Cold” story before returning to the “Alcohol Panic” storyline. As a single, cohesive story, this OVA worked better than it had any right to, but there's still some noticeable jumps between plot points, even for anime-only viewers.","Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow has none of that.

This is according to projected baseline targets outlined in the action plan, which is being coordinated by a Technical Working Group comprising of more than 15 government agencies, a release stated.

Dr Elizabeth Ward , chair of the Violence Prevention Alliance (VPA) made the disclosure while presenting on the NPVAC at the 27th Annual Research Conference Workshop organised by the Faculty of Medical Sciences in collaboration with the VPA at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus on November 8 -11 .

“Our aim in the plan is to reduce by 15 per cent the number of cases of violence against children reported in targeted communities,” she said, adding that the Jamaica Injury Surveillance System in hospitals (JISS) would be able to track some of these figures.

Giving a breakdown of the projections, Dr Ward said this would mean a reduction of cases by three per cent every year over the next 12 years.

“We have already signed on to the Sustainable Development Goals that says by 2030 we would have zero cases of child abuse. Wouldn't that be wonderful?” she asked.

She said that for this to be achieved, the NPACV has recommended the strengthening of policies, legal and regulatory framework to ensure the protection of children from all forms of violence and exploitation.

“These are laws that we are looking at that need to be updated and re-enacted such as the Child Care and Protection Act. Every year there is legislation that we are targeting that by the end of five years, these changes are implemented,” she explained.

The NPACV is currently being reviewed and is to be submitted to Cabinet and then tabled in Parliament.","KINGSTON, Jamaica — If the National Plan of Action for an Integrated Response to Children and Violence (NPACV) is implemented, Jamaica should see the number of incidents of violence against children drastically reduced to zero per cent by 2030.

149,https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/thai-blogger-slammed-encouraging-zero-baht-travel/,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Coconuts,Thai blogger slammed for encouraging ‘zero baht’ travel,"It’s been a few years since the “begpacking” trend first emerged among Westerners, so maybe it’s not all that surprising that a version of it is taking root among folks here at home — albeit in a slightly more upscale fashion.

Meet Bangkok travel blogger Theerat Wattanakijrungroj, who is being roundly criticized for promoting the concept of “zero-baht” travel, which essentially means asking businesses for food and hotel stays in exchange for his “talent.”

Theerat, who identifies himself as a freelance graphic designer in his social media profile, got people talking this past week while promoting his #NoPlanNoMoneyTrip lifestyle, after boasting about how he stayed at a comfortable hotel in northern Lampang province for free on his Facebook page “Unless You Try.”

“Who says you can’t stay in a comfortable room when you don’t have money?” he wrote on Nov. 15.

“I proved that the fact I don’t have a single baht, I could sleep in on a comfortable bed, in an air-conditioned room that costs THB1,600 (US$50) a night.”

He recalled his conversation with the hotel’s owner: “Hi folks, we traveled from Bangkok and have zero baht. We’re looking for a place to sleep tonight. Is there any area for us to catch some sleep without being bitten by mosquitoes? I’ll do some labor work in exchange for the accommodation.”

He ended the post emphasizing it’s all about being “daring,” but the post received backlash from several netizens who view his act as simply “begging.”

“You call it ‘daring’, others call it ‘burden” one comment said.

From a quick look at the page, Unless You Try was started in June 2016, and Theerat has shared photos and fun stories of him while visiting several countries.

On the page, Theerat mentioned that he would sometimes draw or teach swing dancing in exchange for money of accommodation.

He responded to the drama in a post last week, saying some people simply misunderstand his concept: “I’m not trying to prove that I can beg for food and comfortable life — that’s why I always carry paper and watercolors to exchange for food and accommodation. I’ve learned guitar just enough to perform in exchange for support of my travel. I always ask what I can do in exchange for what they give me.

“I’m simply trying to prove money is not the biggest limitation for your travel if you have enough talent and boldness.”

Well. I guess we all have different opinions.

After all, he got a little more than the necessities.

“I walked out of my house with no money, but I got to sip some wine. Haha,” he wrote on Nov. 19.

https://www.facebook.com/unlessyoutry/photos/a.812902672195708/1223676764451628/?type=3&theater

The post gained mostly negative responses: “It’s great that this sort of people is the minority of our country. Otherwise, our economy would go down.”

“Parasite,” another said.

There’s more.

“When you don’t eat vegetables and have no money, but fate led you to stay in a vegetarian hotel. #UnlessYouTry.”

Netizens responded: “Some day when you start a hotel or any business, I hope you have people begging for free food.”

“#BeggingTour #ShamelessTour #ParasiteTour I’m adding hashtags for ya,” another wrote.

However, Theerat still has his suppporters, who say they admire him for staying true to himself and enjoy reading about his unexpected journeys.

“It’s a good concept. Although it annoys some people, but I understand and I will support you,” user “Kim Jong Un” wrote. (Ed: We’re like 99.9% it’s not the one you’re thinking of.)

Most, however, say he should traveling the traditional way — you know, working to earn money then paying businesses for their services.

Just leave the begging to the farangs, one user suggested.

“There are so many farangs who travel this way … There are so many who come to Thailand and work illegally. They don’t benefit our society at all. And now us locals have the same idea? Don’t be like them [the foreigners].”

Just yesterday we got our hands on a brand new promo of the Shah Rukh Khan film which revealed a few new dialogues. Today, the makers, Red Chillies Entertainment, have released a new behind the scenes video which is quite cool. We get a look at all the how fun and games the making of the film was. While the BTS video mainly focusses on director Aanand L Rai's aggressive eating habits, it also shows us some other interesting things. For instance, we see SRK's Suhana Khan chilling on the sets with him.

Amongst all the things we get to see in the video, including Katrina Kaif chilling in a hybrid of bridal wear and pyjamas, its Suhana's few seconds long cameo that is the most delightful. Watch the Zero BTS video titled Mera Samosa Waapis Karo below:

We are hoping more BTS videos are posted by the makers because it's these things that will satiate our hunger until the movie comes out. In two days time, we will also have the first song from Zero on the internet. The makers have confirmed that the full-fledged version of the romantic track we hear in the trailer of the film will release on November 23.

Zero, directed by Aanand, also stars Anushka Sharma alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif. The VFX-heavy performance-driven movie is slated to release on December 21. The movie will feature SRK essaying the role of a dwarf. You can see in the video that the actor had to apply special makeup, while filming, which will help the CGI department give his look finishing touches.

India is not on track to achieve any of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) nine nutrition goals--reduce child overweight, wasting and stunting, diabetes among women and men, anaemia in women of reproductive age and obesity among women and men, and increase exclusive breastfeeding--by 2025, says the report.

The nine goals were adopted by WHO member countries in 2012 and 2013 to reduce all forms of malnutrition by 2025.

The fifth such report, compiled by GNR’s Independent Expert Group comprising academics, researchers and government representatives, was released at the ‘Accelerating the End of Hunger and Malnutrition’ conference in Bangkok, Thailand on November 29, 2018. The conference was jointly organised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

India has shown improvement in reducing child stunting but with 46.6 million stunted children, according to the report, the country is home to over 30.9% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world.

India, however, has shown no progress or declining parameters related to six other global nutrition goals (information on two goals is not available).

Only 94 of 194 countries are on track to achieve at least one of the nine global nutrition targets, says the report. “While [globally] there has been progress in reduction of stunting, there has been slow reduction of anaemia and underweight in women while overweight and obesity is getting worse,” said Corinna Hawkes, co-chair of the report and Director of the Centre for Food Policy, at the release of the report.

India reduces numbers of undernourished, but still bears 23.8% of the global burden of malnourishment

India had 195.9 million undernourished people--or people with chronic nutritional deficiency--in 2015-17, down from 204.1 million in 2005-07, according to FAO data. The prevalence of undernourishment has also gone down from 20.7% in 2005-07 to 14.8% in 2015-17.

India, however, still accounts for 23.8% of the global burden of malnourishment, and has the second-highest estimated number of undernourished people in the world after China, according to FAO.

In 2015, all WHO members including India adopted the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which include achieving zero hunger--or zero undernourished population--by 2030.

IndiaSpend’s analysis shows that to achieve zero hunger by 2030, India will have to lift 48,370 people out of hunger everyday. India’s reduction in undernourished population from 2015 to 2017 was 3.9 million, which is about 10,685 people per day--less than one-fourth needed to meet the target by 2030. Even at its highest reduction of undernourished population--15.2 million in 2006-2008--India could lift only 41,644 people per day out of hunger.

Globally, hunger is rising

With almost 821 million people malnourished in 2017--up from 804 million in 2016 and equal to levels eight years ago--the goal of ending global malnutrition is under threat, said FAO and IFPRI at a joint press conference on November 27, 2018, in Bangkok.

“This is the third consecutive year that progress in ending hunger has stalled and now has actually reversed,” said Shenggen Fan, Director General, IFPRI.

While Africa has the highest number of people with undernourishment--21% of the total population--the situation in South America is also worsening, while the decreasing trend in Asia has slowed down, according to FAO’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2018.

Conflict, climate change and economic slowdown were the main causes for the increasing global trend of undernourishment, said the FAO report.

“Business as usual cannot be the way to go,” said Kostas Stamoulis, FAO Assistant Director-General, at the press conference. “There are only 12 years to achieve the target of zero hunger (by 2030) and it will mean lifting 185,000 people out of hunger every day, which is why we have to go faster,” said Stamoulis.

India’s many challenges in reducing malnutrition

Malnutrition was the top cause of death and disability in India in 2017, followed by dietary risks including poor diet choices, according to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study by the University of Washington. Obesity and overweight increased by 9.6 and 8 percentage points in men and women, respectively, in 2015-16 compared to a decade ago, while non-communicable diseases were responsible for 61% of all deaths in 2016.

One of the earliest interventions to prevent malnutrition and disease in children is breast feeding; yet, only 54.9% of Indian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 41.6% of babies are breastfed in the first hour of birth, according to the ministry of health and family welfare’s National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16). Further, less than 10% of children receive adequate nutrition in the country, said the survey.

Also, while India is slated to become the third largest market for packaged food by 2020, only 12% of beverages and 16% of foods sold by nine leading Indian food and beverage companies were of “high nutritional quality”, according to the Access to Nutrition Index India Spotlight, 2016.

India has made efforts to counter the trend of slowing decline in malnutrition rates. The Poshan Abhiyan--National Nutrition Mission--aimed at reducing malnutrition in women and children was launched in March 2018. India also became one of 59 countries to impose a sugar tax on sweetened beverages, according to GNR 2018. The Goods and Services Tax on soft drinks was increased from 32% to 40% in 2017.

However, to speed up progress on both reducing all forms of malnutrition by 2025 and achieving zero hunger by 2030, India can learn from successes elsewhere.

Lessons from Bangladesh, Brazil and China

A combination of public policies, agricultural research and economic growth has led to reduction in malnutrition in several countries. The GNR 2018 cited progress made by China, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Brazil in reducing hunger and malnutrition. “Those successes hold important lessons for the places currently struggling to make significant progress,” said Fan.

Bangladesh has seen the fastest reduction in child underweight and stunting in history. Stunting in children under five, which was 55.5% in 2004, has been reduced to 36.1% in 2014, “largely by using innovative public policies to improve agriculture and nutrition”, said a statement by IFPRI and FAO. While agriculture growth was spurred by supportive policies, other policies such as family planning, stronger health services, growing school attendance, access to drinking water and sanitation and women’s empowerment also played a role.

In China, it was high economic growth (per capita income rose from $5,060 in 2005 to $16,760 in 2017) that lifted millions out of both hunger and poverty.

Brazil and Ethiopia transformed their food systems and diminished the threat of hunger through targeted investments in agricultural research and development and social protection programmes, according to FAO.

“Starting in the mid-1980s and continuing over two decades, crop production in Brazil grew by 77% and that--combined with the country’s Fome Zero programme [Zero Hunger], established in 2003 to provide beneficiaries a wide range of social services--saw hunger and undernutrition nearly eradicated in just ten years,” said the statement.

With food waste in Australia becoming a bigger issue every day, and the government beginning to invest millions in their 2030 target of halving Australia’s US$14 billion dollar waste bill, more eyes than ever are on new and inventive food waste reducing tactics. These bloggers are ahead of the game, with inspiring strategies and ideas to cut down on your food waste. So, here are five zero food waste bloggers to inspire you on your journey towards sustainable living.

Trash is for Tossers

Lauren Singer started her zero waste lifestyle journey back in 2012 and has since produced very little garbage, as she shows on her blog Trash is for Tossers. She posts about how best to compost, how to make zero waste dog treats, and even general cooking tips, like “How To Cook and Bake with Common Kitchen Waste Items.” Her aim is to diligently recycle and compost everything and send nothing to the landfill. She’s gained support on social media with over 115K followers on Facebook, more than 17K followers on Twitter, and over 265K followers on Instagram.

“I believe that if I am going to take nutrients from the earth (through consuming food) that I should put them back (by diligently composting).”

And she doesn’t stop there—Lauren’s zero waste policy extends to other areas, as she runs the Package Free Shop, which sells products that help people reduce their waste. The online store sells anything and everything from Zero Waste Oral Hygiene and Shave kits to Cleaning and Shopping Market kits. She also posts blog articles about recycling clothes and zero waste beauty routines.

Treading My Own Path

Lindsay Miles’ blog Treading My Own Path is a rich smorgasbord of eco-friendly how-tos; with blog posts about decluttering and minimalism, as well as recipes for treats like almond butter and roasted chickpeas. She also offers shopping how-tos, like how to bulk-shop properly and how to eliminate plastic from the shopping process. She includes personal experience stories to help inspire people who are struggling with cutting down on waste and admits she’s not perfect in her goal to live sustainably (she doesn’t enjoy recycling and she had a journey from being a hoarder to a minimalist).

Lindsay extends her zero food waste goals beyond the online world, as she offers workshops and courses that help people in her community take action to reduce their waste. She has also spoken about living with less waste at TEDx Events and wrote a free eBook that is a beginners guide to living with less plastic.

Going Zero Waste

Going Zero Waste aims to inspire people to live as sustainably as they can, not just by minimizing food waste, but in all facets of their life. Kathryn Kellogg provides tips on her blog from large-scale tactics, like rejigging all of your kitchen utensils to being eco-friendly and going plastic-free when you shop, all the way down to bringing a handkerchief with you everywhere you go so that you’ll never need a tissue. She says people often don’t think enough about the cost of convenience.

“Zero waste isn’t just about fighting to keep this stuff out of landfills. And, it definitely isn’t about recycling. It’s fighting to reduce our need and dependence for these types of conveniences.”

Kathryn is also one of the few eco-bloggers who has taken on the challenge of producing only a small mason jar’s worth of trash in a year. She writes across many areas, including topics like how to go zero waste with roommates or when you’re living with parents and how to live a more sustainable lifestyle while still being able to order takeout and dine at restaurants. She’s also delved into more niche topics like zero waste holidays, zero waste weddings, and owning a zero waste dog. In the way of food, her recipes section is extensive, with zero waste recipes for iced tea, brownie bliss balls, smoothies, tacos, and wraps; as well as entire meal plans so you can take your whole diet into the zero waste zone.

The Zero-Waste Chef

This zero food waste blogger is all about amazing food that doesn’t cost the earth. Anne Marie Bonneau is the name behind The Zero-Waste Chef. Her recipes page is diverse with a focus on fermentation recipes and she is a big fan of home-made sourdough. Her more popular recipes include Use-It-Up Vegan Apple Crumble, Tomato Paste from Scratch, and a Waste Nothing Beet Pickles recipes.

She posts articles about how to live life more sustainably, like this piece about going plastic free. Anne is also realistic about her impact on the environment. Despite her zero-waste efforts, she recognizes that until she ‘buys that farm’ there are some things she simply can’t cook without buying some cooking products that require a little packaging. “While zero waste may be possible to reach in my home, my activities will still produce waste indirectly elsewhere.”

Litterless

Founder of Litterless, Celia Ristow, is all about the utensils you need to achieve a zero waste status. With everything from reusable cloths, mesh produce bags, reusable ziplocs, and wooden dish brushes to menstrual cups, bamboo toothbrushes, sustainable makeup products, and compostable dental floss; Littlerless is a product guide for living the zero-waste life. She also provides a hub for eBook resources and local workshops.

Ultimately, if you are struggling to work more ethical and sustainable foods into your diet, there’s always room to compromise by investing in sustainable utensils and durable containers, jars, and bottles, so that you never find yourself buying single-use plastics. There are some great recipes that require ingredients with very little packaging, or reusable packaging if you’re looking for something cheap, simple, and tasty that doesn’t wreak havoc on the planet!

Tigmanshu Dhulia plays Shah Rukh Khan’s father in Zero.

Actor-writer-director Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is now playing the role of Shah Rukh Khan’s father in Zero, feels that even big budget films need a good script now. He also emphasised that after 1960s the respect for a content writer went down significantly and that must change now.

“Big budget films have started to face this challenge of just being big budget and loaded with stars. But even big budget films need a good script now. Look at ‘Thugs of Hindostan’. The stars delivered what they promised because the first day collections were phenomenal. So people went to see Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, but from the second day the collections sank,” he said.

“So, whether it’s a big budget film or not, content is the king. The audience is smart and the type of things that are coming up online has given a good exposure to the audience to quality content,” Timangshu added.

“I think after 1960’s the respect for a content writer went down significantly and that must change now,” Dhulia told IANS said when asked that how one should take care of both commercial imperatives and creative ambition in today’s time of filmmaking?

Having grown up in Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, the filmmaker says he tries to incorporate his small-town experience in his cinematic presentation. His films including Haasil, Charas and Shagird, though did an average business at the box- office, but is still alive in the minds of moviegoers inspite of having no big stars in it.

When asked if Indian cinema was moving away from the fascination of Khan era with new faces taking the lead, he said cinema is now addressing a larger audience.

“Earlier, multiplexes were present only in big cities, but we see them now in smaller towns as well. Hence, cinema is also addressing characters from small towns. Look at Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao — their characters are from small towns,” he said.

“The Khans of the industry typically played glamorous roles and not these roles. Also, these smaller towns are contributing significantly to the revenues hence that is also another reason these characters from small towns are considered,” said Dhulia.

Directed by Anand L Rai, Zero was released on Friday and got a mixed reaction at the box-office with some critics calling the narrative weak, while some tagging the film as best coming from King Khan. The film also stars Anushka Sharma, Katrina Kaif, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, Abhay Deol, Sheeba Chaddha and Bijendra Kala.

So what made Dhulia say yes to the film and how was it working with Shah Rukh?

“Shah Rukh and I worked together during Dil Se for which I had written the dialogues. Our friendship goes way back. In terms of ‘Zero’, there were twoo or three reasons for me to take it up. One — The role was really different and unique and not like what I played in Ganges of Wasseypur,” he said.

“Secondly Anand L. Rai is a dear friend who was making this technically heavy film with special effects. I was curious to see how he was making the film and learn more on the sets. And thirdly, one is always excited to work with Shah Rukh,” he said.

Dhulia, who feeds his creative hunger through newspaper, books, travel and meeting new people, can see the future of entertainment moving to web.

“Most content would move to the web and the cinema theatres would only see big movies like Baahubali playing,” he said.","Tigmanshu Dhulia plays Shah Rukh Khan’s father in Zero.

154,https://www.dailyo.in/arts/zero-movie-review-rating-shah-rukh-khan-katrina-kaif-anushka-sharma-aanand-l-rai/story/1/28447.html,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",DailyO,Zero movie review: Why 'Zero' stands out as a misfit,"Zero movie review: If it’s a Shah Rukh Khan film, it has to have a love story at the heart of it. Because there’s no other way we’d rather see Shah Rukh than spreading his arms, dimpling his cheeks and making us question the choice of our respective partners, probably sitting next to us right now.

It’s not that Bollywood has a dearth of love stories, but then, there’s no such thing as too romantic or too mushy.

Therefore, Aanand L Rai decided to jump into the pit, dirty his hands in the process if need be, and whip one up. Perfect casting — the king of romance, flanked by two of India’s prettiest women (since that’s a requirement in Bollywood) Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, heartwarming songs — aur kya chahiye?

But, in its hunger to make it bigger and grander in scale than anything that’s been done before — in order to stand out, to be different, to be the first of its kind — Rai and Shah Rukh simply end up trying to master the impossible task of mixing water and oil. No matter how rigorously you stir, it’s not happening.

That’s exactly where Zero finds itself stuck.

The first half starts off like a gush of fresh air. Writer Himanshu Sharma’s wit and Shah Rukh’s impeccable comic timing is a deadly combination. The film establishes very early that this ‘bauna’ Bauua Singh from Meerut is not one to brood in a corner withering under taunts. You make a jibe at him — he will come back sharper, piercing through your heart, because he is certain that God's already dealt him a foul hand and it cannot get worse. But it always gets worse, doesn’t it?

At 38, he resorts to a matrimonial site and a marriage broker, hoping to find himself a bride. He finds his match in Aafia Bhinder (Anushka), and it’s the start of a love story like no other. A little bit about Aafia is important — she is a wheelchair-bound female scientist from NASA who’s just discovered water on the surface of Mars. She is sharp, she is an asset, but she (obviously) feels incomplete at heart because, you know, she is wheelchair-bound. In Bauua’s casual acceptance of his shortcomings (pun intended), she finds hope and finally stops feeling sorry for herself.

Katrina is no scientist. Neither is she a ‘dwarf’. She is a super-successful movie star, Babita Kumari, who has the whole of the nation literally chasing her through the streets, but who still finds herself incomplete, because, and wait for this, a bitter break-up with Abhay Deol. A chance encounter with Bauua helps her realise her own worth, and she finally moves on. In slow motion, teary-eyed, leaving Abhay wondering now that his role in this film is over, what's next for him?

We're all, apparently, incomplete, until we find love! (Source: Zero Movie Poster/Red Chillies Entertainment/Twitter)

So, you see, there's a pattern. Wherever Bauua goes, he wins hearts. And brings with him a happy realisation that if this 'dwarf' can rise above (pun intended) his challenges, why can't we? If you think that in this aspect alone, SRK's Bauua is reduced to just a circus clown, a show monkey who jumps hoops and makes others feel good about themselves, then welcome to the club.

Popcorn?

But in his heart, this 'bauna' is not okay. Soon his facade fades away, baring his bleeding heart, rotting self-esteem and moth-eaten confidence. The armour that protects this ugly sight is built and fortified with insults — that's where he gets his kick from. And the superpowers too that enable him to count down to zero and make intergalactic balls of burning fire and gas — stars — fall. But then, we know that Shah Rukh and 'toot-ta tara' are old friends.

And then comes the second half.

And poof goes logic.

That's us, looking for logic in the second half! (Source: Zero Movie Poster/Red Chillies Entertainment/Twitter)

Now, we've already used words like 'ambitious' to describe films like Thugs Of Hindostan and Kedarnath in the recent past that have heavily relied on CGI, and mostly failed where it mattered most. So what does one call Zero, a film that leaves Meerut and straight up camps in NASA in the second half?

Oh, I know, reverse Swades!

Without giving out spoilers, that I'm actually holding in with great difficulty, let's just say that the rocket we see in the last leg of the Zero trailer is real. And you'd wish you were under it when it fired off.

Bollywood, and especially this charming man called Shah Rukh Khan, has taught me that if someone doesn't chase you down to the airport, railway station, or the metro station, at the very least, is it even love?

God knows how many times I ran just in the hope that I will be chased — not in a creepy way, duh — and that my name will be shouted across terminals in a dramatic, but befitting, expression of that mushy thing called love. But I've turned around to only find myself living this dream.

This time, Bollywood and Shah Rukh Khan outdo themselves by chasing love up to another planet altogether!

On hindsight, this was perhaps Rai's way of saying that men are truly from Mars and therefore, they should just be left there. If that's the case, I get it.

157,https://greennews.ie/zero-waste-movement-dublin-catching-on/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Green News,Zero waste movement catching on in the capital city,"December 20th, 2018

Just a few years ago, handing a reusable container to a server in any shop or restaurant would most likely have resulted in a quizzical stare.

Today, using a Keep Cup has become an ever-growing trend, with new ‘zero waste lifestyle’ blogs taking over the Internet.

While plenty of cafes across the city have started offering discounts to customers who bring their own cups, Small Changes Wholefoods Store in Drumcondra have been encouraging customers to reduce their waste for years.

The owner Peadar Rice opened his first shop in Gorey, Co. Wexford in 2010 before moving to Drumcondra in 2015. From the beginning, waste reduction was integral to the operation of the business.

“It’s something I’ve always believed in, something I’ve always practised,” he told The Green News. “When I first began to formulate the plans to open the first shop it was always going to be at the forefront, the business was going to be built around that.”

While he felt that he lacked the power to tackle such issues in his previous work in the construction industry, running his own business gave Peadar the freedom to move it in the direction he wanted.

Apart from spinach leaves, no fresh produce is sold in plastic packaging and where possible is sourced from local suppliers and producers. Customers are encouraged to bring their own containers for refilling with household goods such as washing up liquid, dry goods such as beans and rice, and for drinks from the juice bar.

Loose organic fruit & veg and not a bit of packing in sight Posted by Small Changes Wholefoods Store on Thursday, 7 December 2017

Tide has turned

The shop sends no waste to landfill and works closely with a restaurant next door to minimize food waste. Any produce that can’t be sold or used in the restaurant or juice bar is instead used as compost for the shop’s garden, Peadar says.

The garden is also used both to grow food that is sold in store and is also used as an educational resource for children from the local primary school who participate in gardening and healthy eating workshops.

Peader says that in recent years there has been a drastic change in public attitudes towards the zero waste movement, a change which he attributes to the availability of information. “I think the tide has definitely turned, in that everybody is becoming aware in the power of the individual, the power of the consumer.

“People come in here and see what we’re doing and then that might inspire them to look at the bigger supermarkets and say, well you know if these guys can do it, why can’t you,” he says.

While the problem of waste and pollution may appear overwhelming from a global perspective, he stresses the importance of not underestimating the power of the individual.

“This is why the business is called small changes. To expect everybody to radically overhaul their life overnight is not practical, not sustainable. So, the approach that we would like to get across is that one small change will lead to another change which will, in turn, lead to a bigger change.”

The Minimal Waste Grocery

Jennie Jacques de Cisneros, owner of the online Minimal Waste Grocery is of a similar conviction.

She started the business – that also trades every Saturday at a market in St. Anne’s Park – in May 2017 after she noticed how much plastic packaging ended up in her trolley during her weekly grocery shop, and how little of the packaging was recyclable.

After making the decision to try to reduce her waste, she realized how difficult it was to find plastic-free packaging in regular grocery stores.

“I joined the zero waste Ireland Facebook group and realised there were loads of people like me and we were all really frustrated. There was just nothing there for us. So I thought ‘what I’m going to do it for myself’, and that’s when I started the Minimal Waste Grocery.”

The concept of zero waste still wasn’t really “mainstream” when Jennie started. This soon changed, she says, just after the release of David Attenborough’s Blue Planet 2. “That’s when it really started gaining traction. And the lots of waste-free lifestyle shops started popping up.”

She stresses, however, that simple purchasing such lifestyle products is not enough. “If you buy someone a keep cup and they never use it then that’s just more waste.”

She suggests that people instead start with “baby steps” and try swapping out alternatives for the plastic they’re already buying. The first step, she says, could be to buy a reusable water bottle instead of buying single-use plastic bottles in shops.

“Once that’s done,” she says, you will “start noticing all the plastics you use and pick up things you use all the time and find a plastic-free alternative and then just keep going in small steps”.

Zero waste misconceptions

Molly Ayelsbury of Bare Necessities believes that what may be holding a lot of people back from reducing their waste is the misconception that to do so is both expensive and inconvenient. People who are unsure about how to shop zero waste repeatedly return to the safety and security the supermarket offers, she says,

When Molly returned home after spending a year studying in Sweden for her Masters, she suddenly realised how far behind Ireland was lagging when it came to sustainable infrastructure. She says it felt like she purchased more plastic packaging in just three weeks back in Ireland than during her entire year in Sweden.

“In terms of the environment, they’re so far ahead of us. I was a foreign student and part of my integration training was how to recycle. It was just drilled into us.” She says that people in Ireland may feel awkward bringing their own containers to shops and restaurants and become discouraged when businesses aren’t cooperative.

Molly still has high hopes for the future of the zero-waste movement in Ireland and believes that someday soon we will be on par with other European countries such as Sweden

“There’s a hunger for change right now and if there’s ever a time where it’s going to get like that now is the time to do it.

“Landfills are closing all over the country and it’s only a matter of time before it starts impacting on people’s pockets. And when that happens there’s going to be even more of a demand for no packaging.”

Ever feel like becoming a big-brained general (you, the player) leading a ragamuffin band of mutants through tactical turn-based combat, strategizing for success against the inhabitants of a post-apocalyptic Earth? Then a niche might just be filled with a little game that fits the bill, no pun intended. Thinking is the game in Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden; with some quick wit and careful planning, your whole mutant squad might just survive the hostile world of The Zone.

Game Name: Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden

Platform(s): PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC

Publisher(s): Funcom

Developer(s): The Bearded Ladies Consulting

Release Date: December 4, 2018

Price: $34.99 (USD)

Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a fun time all the way through from start to finish, engaging your brain with mutations the whole time that’ll keep your game plan fresh and adaptable. Those who are a bit analytical-minded or are in the habit of meticulously planning things will definitely find this game to be right up you’re neural pathways. Imagine playing a thinking game, perhaps chess, but all your pieces are mutants including a humanoid duck and a humanoid boar armed with guns… Maybe a somewhat crude description, but you get the idea.

I’m actually a newcomer to the whole tactical strategy genre, though I found my first experience with this type of game to be very enjoyable. Devising various schemes to deal with different situations that suit my squad of characters and seeing the plan executed emphatically without a hitch is just too satisfying. It’s also incredibly gratifying to force the enemies’ hand with thoughtful planning. Cutting off supports, incapacitating problem enemies, or sweeping a whole group Ghouls under the silent guise of stealth is where it’s at. Pulling off any of these maneuvers will have you feeling like a grizzled commander boasting a 900 IQ, which feels good, at least for me.

Gameplay:

Players will be given control of up to three squad members at a time, controlling their movement, positioning, and also actions once engaged in combat. Managing just three characters is a breeze and you’ll never feel overwhelmed with commanding your team, but you may definitely be overwhelmed by swarms of enemy numbers at times. That’s when you’ve gotta implore some thinking and make use of the different abilities that your mutants bring to a fight.

Introducing the RPG elements found within the progression of your character’s skill tree, where unlocking mutations via level ups will surely aid in turning the tide of battle. The mutations are fun gimmicks that further the potential for creative strategy. Consider the ability or mutation “Moth Wings”, which enables a character to fly to an upper layer of the playable grid to gain higher ground for more sure-shot accuracy; perfect for enemies well-hidden behind cover. Or even mutations that hinder enemy movement by locking them into a fixed position for a few turns like Thelma’s Tree Hugger ability which summons roots to the surface which entangle and bind targets.

Approaching an enemy encounter with precision planning and execution is where all the satisfying fun comes into play. There are many possible paths to take during a firefight, such as different routes, character placement, ability usage, weapons, and target priority which all offer a multitude of different scenarios to work with. So…get crafty with your strategizing and mutate your way of thinking to make the most of Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden.

And there’s more to the battlefield than just merciless bloodshed, why, there’s also loot to scavenge for too! Staying on the lookout for scrap metal or weapon parts is essential if you want your mutants armed to the teeth with best of the best in regards to guns and items. And you might also stumble upon weapons and armor accessories to dress your squad to best suit the situation at hand. On the topic of exploring the dangerous landscape for loot within The Zone…

Graphics:

Advertisement

Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden’s visuals and presentation do a fine job of capturing an apocalyptic world wrought by plague and desertion. The various environments don’t really vary all too much, but the settings certainly create a general feeling of traversing a raw and gritty place indifferent to your survival. Overgrown plant life, abandoned buildings, decaying relics of modern civilization, and dangerous locals wanting your head on a plate. Everything needed for an apocalyptic Earth is here and accounted for.

And while the visuals most certainly get the job done, they seem a bit cut and dry. The quality of the graphics isn’t really an issue, but the art style comes off as somewhat lackluster; nothing really jumps off the screen in a visual manner. I’d just like some more oomph to the overall look of the game in terms of the art direction. Again, I personally think the game looks good, it’s just missing that edge, that flavoring that makes a game visually pop.

What does look great are some of the playable character designs, specifically referring to the anthropomorphic Dux, Bormin, and Farrow. These humanoid, animals have lovely designs that stand out even more than the other cast members because of how much they contrast with the realistic look to Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden. I’d say they’re probably the most colorful characters in the game in thanks to their personalities and animal traits, which compliment their looks to a tee I might add.

Sound:

The sound design within Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden does what it needs to do. Impacts from gunfire, grenades, mutant abilities, and the works all produce suitable sounds that one would expect to hear. There’s nothing to really write home about here, but there’s also nothing to really write home about either.

And as for music, it’s mainly just atmospheric. I personally need some bangin’ tracks in my video games to really vibe with, but Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden gets on well enough without that. Not a huge detractor mind you, but some noticeable tunes to accompany the various regions or specific enemy types would be great. Music can really do a lot for a game, setting the tone for the player, punctuating a scene or event, and just building up general excitement while playing.

Value:

Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is a fundamentally solid game, the gameplay elements are absolutely fantastic, and the playable characters are fun as well with their mutant quirks and designs. Everything else within the game is fine, not amazing, but good enough to hold this title together.

I was engaged the whole time, captivated by the gameplay mechanics; the gameplay coupled with your selection of playable mutants truly carries the game. Not to mention a story that remains interesting enough to tickle your curiosity now and again. Overall, this title is worth a buy if you’re looking to wet your palette with a turn-based, tactical strategy game. This was my first ever go into the genre mind you, and I had a great time playing it. So, I can and will recommend this title to anyone who might be considering giving Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden a go.

Happy mutations everyone!

159,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/20181219/no-title,"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",wknd.,Zero won’t be a hero without Katrina-Anushka: Shah Rukh Khan,"Though Shah Rukh Khan made a solo visit to Dubai to talk up Zero, citing his co-actors' busy schedule to explain their absence from the GCC leg of the movie's promotion, he was very vocal about his ""dear friends"" Katrina and Anushka.



""I am extremely grateful to them for having trusted that they should be a part of the film, because this is a film that takes you flying.



""Zero is an expensive film, perhaps one of the most expensive from India, and it is a difficult film,"" Khan told us



""One night, 8-9 months back we (Himanshu Sharma, Aanand L. Rai and I) were sitting together and at around 4 in the morning, we said, should we take the difficult way and just fly? At that point in time you have other co-actors - they don't know where they are going, it's a two heroine film, whose role is going to be better - all these small considerations by these small actors are always there but these two had such largeness of hearts - they said, 'wherever you want to go, it's your dream, the three of you. just have fun.' So the trust is there.""

Anushka's sensitivity

Over the years Shah Rukh Khan has shown himself to be an extremely generous actor, allowing his co-stars to take the lead, when required, unlike certain of his male counterparts, who are known to hog the screen space at the expense of the film and their co-actors. In Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, where Khan acted alongside a debutant Anushka Sharma, there was none of that superstar-newbie vibe - and the credit goes equally to Khan and Sharma. The actor echoes this when he tells us of his long association with his Zero co-star.



""Anushka is extremely conscientious; I've seen her from her first film. To just take your own and be your own (like she did in our first film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi) requires actually not technique but sensitivity and Anushka is extremely sensitive.



""I love her for her sensitivity, she understands things and she is also extremely correct and strict, so to do a role of a person who is affected with cerebral palsy - it required training. she had trainers 6 months before we started shooting, so it is not depicted wrongly. When you see the film, there is such consistency in the way she's done it. Its marvellous.""

SRK's bet with Katrina

Any other actress would have jumped at the offer to share screen space with Bollywood's King of Romance, but if we are to believe Khan, he had a tough time convincing Katrina to sign Zero.""



You know Katrina as this glamorous, beautiful lady but what she's done in the film is contrary to what she's done in any other film. And I don't want to talk about it because I have a challenge with Katrina.



""It was in Dubai and we were chatting in a hotel room and I said,' do this film', and she said, 'I don't know where is this film going', so I challenged her saying on the 22nd it will be one of her finest works if she trusts and if she works hard.



""Katrina is nothing if not the most hardworking person in the world. We only get to see the exterior of it. She worked really hard. So I don't want to say much because I want to win the bet from Katrina first! Like, look wasn't it the best thing you have done?"" Khan might be playing a challenging role in Zero, but he is quick to share credits with his leading ladies. ""People might think that I'm taking the chance with this film. Cause I'm playing a vertically challenged person called Zero and all that. But I think the real chance and support has been taken by Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, they are fantastic - if it wasn't for them I think Zero would never become a hero.""

SRK reveals his Tweet spot

In this age of social media, rare is the celebrity who hasn’t made his presence felt in the virtual world. For SRK, whose Twitter account was voted one of the most ‘Talked about Bollywood celeb accounts in 2018’ by the social media platform, it is all about personal connections.

“I have a very personal relationship with social media,” he tells us. “I don’t tweet anything that I don’t wish to or I don’t do myself (with few exceptions like movie promos).

“I don’t promote goods commercially on my Twitter account. Instagram follows from what I Tweet. I really have not seen a Facebook Page! My team does that for me, I have to be honest.

“What I write on Twitter is extremely personal. And I like to keep it that way. If I want to share something personal, I do it though that.”

Photo: Getty Images

Simon Zebo is in the appropriate city when he invokes the ""no regrets"" refrain of the Parisian songwriter to assess his move to the French capital in the summer, a switch that caused him to miss out on Ireland's groundbreaking victory over world champions New Zealand.

Zebo watched from afar, exiled from Joe Schmidt's selection plans but wholly at ease with his decision to leave his native Munster for high-rolling Racing 92, the glitzy, rock-and-roll artists of the French scene with their cosmopolitan squad and purpose-built indoor U-Arena where they are looking to consolidate their unbeaten start to Pool 4 against Leicester tomorrow.

Zebo, true to his wandering inclinations, is completely at home in his new surroundings, even if it does effectively remove him from international consideration.

""I have absolutely zero regrets and I am so, so happy that I made the decision,"" said Zebo. ""One 80-minute match [Ireland v New Zealand] would not make any difference to that, delighted as I was for the Irish lads.

""It has been an incredible adventure here. I wouldn't be holding my breath about Ireland prospects and there has not been much contact. Of course, it would be nice to go to the World Cup but it is what it is. I'm not at all hopeful or expectant and it is no big deal for me.""

Ireland have no exclusion policy as regards picking players from outside the country. In fact, Schmidt selected fly-half Johnny Sexton when he was with Racing three years ago.

Zebo, who won the last of his 35 caps in 2017, is committed to a fresh challenge, buoyed no doubt by a salary of around £600,000, an offer Munster and the IRFU could not match. There is a real sense, however, that the 27-year-old was eager to fly the nest and make his own distinctive way in the world.

With a father, Arthur, from Martinique, Zebo was already a partial French speaker and has settled easily into Parisian life with his partner, Elvira, and young children, Jacob and Sofia. Even the protests of recent weekends have not proved too troublesome, although Champions Cup officials are monitoring events in Paris ahead of tomorrow's match.

""There's been a bit of trouble, cars burned out and a few fights with the police everywhere,"" said Zebo. ""But as for the rugby set-up, it's out of this world. Great environment, fabulous stadium with its 4G pitch and reliable conditions, and world-class players. There is blunt force as well as massive subtlety. It's all gone like a dream.""

As it has for Racing team-mate, Scotland fly-half Finn Russell, a kindred spirit in terms of his outlook on the game. The pair have added significantly to the Parisians' prowess as they set their sights on a two-pronged attack on the Top 14 and Champions Cup. Racing have been losing European finalists in two of the last three years, to Saracens in 2016 and Leinster in Bilbao seven months ago.

Zebo knows only too well that feeling of what some call near-achievement and others, with a competitive zeal, term failure. Zebo reached the semi-final four times with Munster and lost on each occasion, latterly and tellingly to Racing 92 in Bordeaux in April.

""It is real goal of mine to try and win the Champions Cup,"" said Zebo. ""The Racing boys have a hunger to go all the way. We've got a deep enough squad to compete on two fronts and the ambition is to be double champions.

""It's been great with Finn. We clicked from the get-go. We both like to try things no matter where we are on the pitch. It's a matter of staying close to him. Things tend to happen around him.""

A chastened Tigers travel to Paris, on their uppers after a humiliating 41-10 defeat at Bristol last weekend. The match has a make-or-break feel about it.

""This is a big fixture for both teams,"" said Zebo. ""Leicester will come here as a wounded beast and that can make them dangerous. But we want to build on what we have done so far in Europe. Another win would put us in great stead and that's what we are striving for."" (© Daily Telegraph, London)
