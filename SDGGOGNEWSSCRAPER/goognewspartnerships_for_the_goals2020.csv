Bleacher Report have crunched the stats for the best attackers this year and it's the Bayern Munich duo who lead the way with 41 goals and 10 assists between them.

There are also three English sides which is the most from a single league, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool all featuring.

Check out the full list below.

Bayern have had a disappointing season in the Bundesliga and are currently third.

Despite this, Lewandowski has had an incredible year and has scored 30 goals in all competitions.

Former Arsenal winger Gnabry has contributed 11 goals, with three of them coming against Tottenham Hotspur in their 7-2 drubbing last year.

The highest Premier League club is Manchester City with Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling leading the line.

Aguero and Sterling are often played alongside Leroy Sane but he's yet to play this season following injury in the Community Shield.

But the duo have coped admirably, scoring a combined 38 goals.

Aguero's hat-trick against Aston Villa last weekend saw him become the highest scoring overseas player in Premier League history.

Manchester United's academy tandem of Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood also take their place on the list.

Alongside Anthony Martial, they have managed to keep United's top four hopes alive domestically while helping them ease to Europa League qualification.

Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez obviously make it onto the list but a surprise striking partnership is Lautaro Martinez and Romelu Lukaku.

Lukaku joined Inter this summer and many assumed he'd lead the line at the San Siro alone.

However, he's struck up a partnership with the Argentine in a 3-5-2 formation that's seen them wreck havoc domestically.

Another shock inclusion is RB Leipzig's Timo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer.

Leipzig are currently top of the Bundesliga by five points and they have Werner and Sabitzer to thank for that.

In the summer of 1999, a small and little-known think tank attached to the United Nations Development Programme published a book that transformed the global development discourse: Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century. Runaway globalization had created a “global public domain,” the authors argued. A shared pool of resources was being either undersupplied or overexploited. In a globalized world, advancing sustainable development became more than a moral obligation; it was in everybody’s enlightened self-interest. If the world has a glut of cheap palm oil but no forests, nobody thrives in the long term.

The idea of a global public domain caught the zeitgeist in an era of falling walls and regimes. At the beginning of the 1990s, the collapse of communism stigmatized big government, but then breakneck liberalization, privatization, and deregulation ended in a series of financial crises, humbling market maximalists, too. The experience of both government and market failure gave rise to a core pillar of the new narrative for international cooperation: Neither states nor markets had the means to build a functioning global public domain on their own; only a combined effort of all stakeholders would make a difference.

Public-private partnerships—already extensively used at the national level by governments in their quest for better public services at lower cost—became the new mantra for meeting the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. Yet, two decades into the new millennium, public-private partnerships still have not broken through into the mainstream. They are needed more than ever at a time where international cooperation is in crisis.

As U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres put it in his opening address to the General Assembly in 2018, the world is suffering from “trust deficit disorder”: Within countries, people are losing faith in political establishments, and polarization is on the rise; among countries, cooperation is ever less certain and more difficult. National interests are dictating foreign diplomacy, and at the grassroots level, young activists have little confidence in large corporations as a force for positive change.

In the early 2000s, public-private partnerships emerged as a potential win-win combination; they gave business a higher purpose and equipped advocacy organizations with business excellence. They were the centrist architecture of choice for fixing the trust deficit disorder of the hyperglobalization era. As Hillary Clinton explained in her farewell address as U.S. secretary of state, “Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, today we need a dynamic mix of materials and structures.”

Today, public-private partnerships have lost some of their luster. The technocratic and top-down nature of many initiatives is seen by vocal critics as marginalizing their alleged benefactors, raising questions about their true intent. The mixed track record of the mechanism raises doubts about its effectiveness. According to the Sustainable Development Goals partnerships platform, only 290 of 3,900 initiatives currently registered—less than 8 percent—report being on track to reach their goals. Poor intervention strategies, failure to include key actors, and a lack of mandates and clear goals that could be monitored and governed have all been cited as reasons why many of these first-wave partnerships tended to fail.

Emboldened by rapid technological progress and financed by the entrepreneurs behind the digital revolution of the early 21st century, first-wave partnerships deliberately pivoted from a systems paradigm that was seen by economists like Jeffrey Sachs as bureaucratic and ineffective toward more targeted interventions.

The first wave of partnerships was characterized by a move away from existing national and international institutions toward bespoke bodies with narrow issue-specific mandates. The idea was to break a complex challenge (such as public health) into its component parts; single out specific parts (such as children dying of malaria); define clear, measurable metrics of success (such as reducing infection rates); identify means to improve on these metrics (by using insecticide-treated bed nets, for example); and assemble the right experts and resources to tackle the problem.

Issue-centered approaches did deliver impressive results in confronting complicated problems such as the development of drugs or vaccines through organizations like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, these kinds of partnerships have not been able to solve more complex challenges such as strengthening the effectiveness and inclusiveness of health care systems.

For a new generation of public-private partnerships to become more effective, the mechanism needs to rebalance from an approach that focuses on issues in isolation toward a more systemic approach that looks at the global public domain as a complex web of political, social, institutional, and technological factors and not just as a complicated engineering challenge. First and foremost, this will require a paradigm shift from a rigid top-down project architecture toward platforms and protocols. In a project paradigm, problem-solving is centralized. In a platform paradigm, actors unite behind a shared purpose and a joint mission but operate independently.

In the corporate world, the platform approach is well established. The online retailer Alibaba, for instance, does not own any warehouses, and the room-booking service Airbnb does not rent or own any real estate. Both focus on enabling the interaction between the components of the system without owning them.

An illustrative platform partnership example is the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), co-chaired by the CEO of the Global Environment Facility, Naoko Ishii, and the CEO of the electronics manufacturer Philips, Frans van Houten. It brings together more than 50 partners and related initiatives under the common vision of creating a circular economy, in which waste and pollution are minimized and products and resources are recycled and regenerated. Though still nascent, platforms and protocols like PACE could help overcome the ideological divide between technocratic supply-side approaches to sustainable development and bottom-up demand-side strategies.

In a protocol paradigm, decision-making is even more decentralized. Protocols merely create a common means for otherwise unrelated efforts to interact, the way traffic signs help drivers move without bumping into one another. The so-called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), for instance, is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web without any prescription on who should apply it or to what end.

The first generation of partnerships emerged in an era when global government was considered by many a feasible option and when big supranational organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the European Union were equipped with powers that limited and transcended the sovereignty of nation-states. Today, the WTO is facing imminent crisis; the dominant narrative of the European Union has been one of fragmentation, with large portions of electorates backing anti-EU policies; and since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the number of physical barriers delineating international borders has grown from 15 to 77. As a result, partnerships today inevitably must grapple with a more disjointed political landscape and with global challenges that have grown in severity and complexity, making the turn-of-the-century brand of technocratic top-down transnationalism neither feasible nor practical.

In the transition toward a more decentralized model of public-private partnerships, technology will play an important role, too. First-generation partnerships emerged at a time when the internet was slow, smartphones did not exist, and artificial intelligence was merely science fiction. Their solutions were shaped by the possibilities of their time.

Today’s global public domain is more than a theoretical concept. It is something citizens can increasingly see and measure in real time with smart sensors, big data, and AI, while technologies like blockchain allow people to establish trust in all this data without creating large third-party organizations. While such technologies are already playing a pivotal role in commercial settings, their massive potential for solving global challenges is yet to be realized.

Global problems have proliferated, but the spectrum of solutions has vastly expanded, too. The world is facing overwhelming transnational challenges, and hence there is no choice but to find effective transnational solutions. Public-private partnerships that are enabled by platforms and protocols can bend the disruptive power of technological innovations toward positive ends.

The club is offering access to its top players, in-house production assets and distribution channels to brands keen to make an impact without the cost and commitment of a long-term deal.

Multi-year contracts are currently favoured in football and while there is still a place for these top-tier packages that deliver long-term brand alignment, the club's top marketer believes his new model can attract new spend from agile marketing departments with lower budgets than the Premier League's going rate.

The London-based football club believes the opportunity has ""gone begging"" to date, according to Gary Twelvetree who leads marketing at the club.

He has built the sponsorship products he would have wanted from sports organisations in his previous roles, handling marketing for the Barclays, which was aligned with the Premier League for years, and Visa during the World Cup and Olympics.

Twelvetree is offering up Chelsea's players, platforms and power, once reserved for top tier partners, to a new slate of brands. Videos are conceived and produced in-house before being distributed across its owned channels and ad inventory in digital, social and in-stadium.

Duracell was the first brand to embrace this ""end-to-end solution"". It ran tests in December, coinciding with Amazon’s festive football coverage digital coverage. Two Circles helped deliver on a partnership bartered by HK Strategies.

Premier League stars Mason Mount, Michy Batshuayi and Callum Hudson-Odoi fronted the video. In a simple gym scene, Hudson-Odoi talked up his Duracell battery charger as he watched highlights of his top goals, much to the amusement of his teammates. The video ran on Facebook and Instagram where it has mustered a few million views across Duracell and Chelsea accounts (more than 200m followers), in addition to shares from fans and the starring players.

The spots also ran on the clubs website and app (more than four million downloads) in display and pre-roll formats.

Duracell has since reported “significant uplift” in Power Bank sales during that week-long campaign. Twelvetree said the campaign “over-achieved” as social video views reached over 2m and social engagement was 28% above the target.

Chris Townsend, commercial director at Chelsea FC, noted that the product is a keen way to quickly activate around ""new campaigns and at peak sales moments”. Chelsea also performed a brand study to ensure the campaign hit the KPIs required by the top marketers, a rigour which may be lacking at rival clubs.

Twelvetree believes that Chelsea is the ""only club in the market thinking differently about partnerships"". It hopes to attract money spent in influencing, branded content and with other publishers.

""Although it's early days, the response we're getting in the market is exceptionally positive. We have got more brands lined up that are going to work with us in the next month or two.

He concluded: ""It is an ideal time to offer this, maybe it hasn’t been done in the past due to the type of people who have held marketing roles at clubs. Now clubs have to generate revenue every way they can. To be winners on the pitch, we have to be winners off the pitch.""

Tatiana Wijeyaratne, marketing manager at Duracell UK told Sports Business: “Live streaming is one of the biggest drains on the battery life of mobile devices.” The clever placement in the mobile-first channels during Christmas appears to have paid off.

Going forward, however, Chelsea will have to ensure there are no conflicts with its top tier partners.

On the other hand, this package lets it meet a whole host of new brands, granting the club a short-term financial advantage and even chance to upsell partners into longer-lived deals down the line.","Chelsea FC is the first English Premier League club to introduce a short-term brand partnership product, which it hopes will bite into budgets currently allocated to influencer marketing and publisher partnerships.

Surprise Economic Development Director Jeanine Jerkovic can envision Surprise on a growth path much like Gilbert, only a few decades later.



“I believe Surprise is on a Gilbert trajectory,” Ms. Jerkovic recently told the City Council during a presentation on public-private partnerships.



That’s because downtown Gilbert’s mix of restaurants, bars, entertainment and shopping establishments on more than 60 acres of land is what she calls “30 years in the making.”



“It’s easy to become jealous about what Gilbert’s been doing over there,” Ms. Jerkovic warned the Council. “But they’ve been at it a long time. We’re the new kid on the block. We’re still at the starting gate for the potential for the City of Surprise.”



But one of the secrets that helped Gilbert grow over the last 30 years, Surprise is taking a hold of, too, with the public-private partnerships to help get things done.



Surprise officials are defining a “public-private partnerships” as one that involve collaboration between a government agency and a private-sector company to finance, build and operate projects.



The city is hoping the partnerships will continue to be win-win for all sides, and help the city advance its own goals.



Some of the biggest partnerships the city already has established are with schools and sports teams.



The city shares facilities with the new OUAZ campus, has agreements with the Dysart Unified School District to share facilities and, of course, partners with Major League Baseball to bring spring training to the city each year with the Texas Rangers and Kansas City Royals calling Surprise their spring home.



For the OUAZ deal, the city has available 8,000 hours of use of the university’s facilities each year. That includes the O’Dell Athletic Center, competition fields and meeting space.



O’Dell is a 30,000-square-foot gym with four basketball courts and includes Faith Arena, where OUAZ plays basketball and volleyball currently.



Councilman David Sanders called the presentation Ms. Jerkovic and Surprise Sports and Tourism Director Kendra Pettis gave the Council last month “very informative.” He asked city staff how they go about valuating the 8,000 hours it receives from the OUAZ deal.



“It’s really simple. We would look at how would we assess the value of our hours and what would that cost be and what is their give?” Ms. Jerkovic said.



“There are a lot of direct benefits that Ottawa brings from a capital and an employment perspective.”



She added OUAZ also was a benefit by helping with the cost of construction as well as bringing “premiere education” to Surprise.

Partnerships can also bring in new revenues, Ms. Pettis told the Council. That money include sales tax generation, program revenue and employment opportunities.



It also helps brand recognition for the city. Those who don’t believe most people across the nation who have heard of Surprise did so because of spring training baseball has just been living in Surprise too long.



That brand recognition with the city’s partnership with the Texas Rangers and Kansas City Royals goes deep into advertising into those cities during the spring training season, drawing in thousands of fans from the midwest and southwest every year.

Ms. Pettis called the partnership with the Rangers and Royals “20 years in the making.”



“It helped transform Surprise’s identity,” she said.



Plus, thanks to the Royals and Rangers’ presence, the Surprise Recreation Campus was built in the first place. The Surprise Recreation Campus includes Surprise Stadium and 12 practice fields.



More than 200,000 fans visit the area each year for spring training games. That’s not expected to change for the 30 games that are on the schedule for this spring.



Ms. Pettis said the Cactus League has an economic impact to the Valley’s economy of about $644 million.



For potential future deals, Ms. Jerkovic said the city first tests out if the partnership is of good value to the city.



“Is there a public benefit? We need to look at that carefully,” Ms. Jerkovic said. “Is this a risk that’s worth the opportunity?”

We ask, ‘would that project happen without the city’s assistance?’.”



Added Ms. Pettis: “We go through all those different projects a litte bit differently and what aligns for each partner and what aligns for the city at that time.”



The City Council indicated it liked what it’s hearing about Surprise’s partnerships and one councilman said the city already has built-in reasons for business to want to partner with Surprise.



“Infrastructure changes that we’re making are going to be attractive all by themselves as an incentive for these companies to come here,” District 4 Councilman Ken Remley said. “And they can see that we have a railplex, that we do have a road that 18-wheelers can get down from the freeway that can access the rest of the nation.”



“I don’t know how you put a dollar amount on that but that’s an incentive in itself.”



It’s also important to note Surprise also needs help with partnerships in the City Center especially since it doesn’t own the land of the remaining 200 acres left to be developed.



“it’s a lot easier to control our own destiny and offer things when we have land in our portfolio,” District 6 Councilman Chris Judd said. “It’s not something that happens overnight. We have to plan.”



Mr. Remley said the city just has to be careful to not offer too much with incentives.



“People say, ‘why can’t you just give things away to get a Costco?’” Mr. Remley said. “We forget some of the other cities have really gone overboard with what they have offered.”

The Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center recently launched a survey to find opportunities for public-private partnerships, according to a posting in the Federal Register.

The survey, which will be conducted by the RAND Corp., will be used as a “sensing tool” to learn about ways the DOD can partner with private companies on AI, JAIC spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson told FedScoop. The targeted respondents of the survey are private tech workers, a group that the JAIC wants to work more closely with to “accelerating AI solutions for the Department of Defense at-scale.”

The survey is not related to a recent RAND study that found shortfalls in the JAIC’s structure and ability to grow to meet its broad goals of enabling AI for the department.

The Federal Register notice estimates around survey 5,210 responses and says that RAND will conduct focus groups with engineers on civilian-military AI applications. The notice is open to public responses through March 16.

The development of the survey remains ongoing and the Federal Register notice lacks any detail of what will be asked of respondents. But Abrahamson added that JAIC wants to “better understand our stakeholders in the defense and commercial tech industry and maximize the potential for partnerships that enable the JAIC’s mission.”","Written by Jackson BarnettThe Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center recently launched a survey to find opportunities for public-private partnerships, according to a posting in the Federal Register.

Equifax recently made another move to give its auto-finance company clients a more vivid picture of what their applicants’ credit background truly might be.

The Automotive Intelligence Council member announced new direct-to-consumer partnerships with Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo that Equifax said will help develop a more complete picture of a consumer’s financial profile.

Equifax explained in a news release that it wants to offer real solutions that can meet people wherever they are on their personal finance journey. The rent-reporting platforms can enable consumers to opt-in to include rental payment data as part of their respective credit report to allow a more complete picture of financial history.

All three companies, as part of their credit education initiatives, will also present their users with a free weekly or monthly VantageScore credit score so they can track score changes over time.

Equifax acknowledged most renters’ on-time housing payments are not reflected on their credit reports — even though it is often one of the largest and recurring bills consumers pay. Having little to no credit can impact a consumer’s ability to qualify for a mortgage, finance a car or take out college loans.

These direct-to-consumer Equifax partnerships with Zingo, Esusu and MoCaFi continue to give the underserved population an opportunity to add additional payment depth to their credit histories.

Esusu can enable tenants to build and establish their credit scores while helping property owners reduce turnover and missed payments to increase their operating income.

“Esusu’s partnership with Equifax will help accelerate our growth,” said Abbey Wemimo and Samir Goel, co-chief executive officers of Esusu. “It will also help in creating more financial opportunities and access for millions of Americans.”

MoCaFi, short for Mobility Capital Finance, is a platform that seeks to provide banking services to the underbanked, while helping them build credit and improve their economic mobility.

“MoCaFi’s partnership with Equifax represents a new paradigm of what’s possible when two organizations come together to drive financial inclusion,” said Wole Caxum, founder and CEO of Mobility Capital Finance. “Our work is already allowing people, especially communities of color, to see the benefits of using rent reporting to impact their credit scores. These are exciting times for us as our work is just getting started.”

The Zingo platform collects, verifies and reports rental payments initiated by the consumer, thus enhancing their credit profile when consistent payment history is reported.

“The Zingo automated rent reporting platform puts the consumer in control,” Zingo CEO Maria Gallegos said. “Our mission to empower consumer-initiated rent-reporting to Equifax supports their goal to help consumers live their best financial lives.”

Tom Madison, senior vice president and general manager at Equifax Global Consumer Solutions, elaborated about what collaborating with Zingo, Esusu and MoCaFi means

“Our partnership with these market leading rent-reporting agencies reaffirms our commitment to become a more consumer friendly data and credit reporting agency,” Madison said. “This will help provide a more comprehensive view of consumers’ payment histories and help people in the pivotal moments in their financial lives, such as applying for their first mortgage or buying a car.

“Everyone, regardless of their income or living situation, deserves the chance to reach their financial goals. Through these partnerships and continued efforts, Equifax aims to help consumers live their financial best by understanding their credit throughout their lifetime,” Madison added.","The Automotive Intelligence Council member announced new direct-to-consumer partnerships with Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo that Equifax said will help develop a more complete picture of a consumer’s financial profile.

USA TODAY

Working out could help you pay down your Apple Watch or gym membership.

Apple is launching an incentive program called Apple Watch Connected, in partnership with select gyms and health clubs. Among other benefits, club members can earn discounts off their Apple Watch or receive gift cards to Apple, Nike, and other brands by meeting designated workout goals, both in or out of the gym.

For example, at two Crunch Fitness clubs in New York (with other Crunch locations to follow), people who work out at least three times a week while wearing the watch can shave $12 monthly off the $98 cost of membership. But you’ll also get credit for running or other exercises you do outside the club, so long as such activities close the fitness rings on the watch face or meet other fitness challenges.

Algorithms based on your age, weight and so on will decide what those challenges are and, depending on your circumstances, could be ratcheted up over time.

Crunch Signature CEO Keith Worts believes he has ready-made customers; more than 75% of the club’s members already use an iOS device.

If you don't already have an Apple Watch, Anytime Fitness-owned Basecamp Fitness in California, Wisconsin and Minnesota will give you an Apple Watch Series 5 (GPS version) if you pay $33.25 a month on top of the regular $179.99 monthly tab. (It's more for the cellular version.) But you can actually totally wipe out the extra watch charge if you attend three classes a week at Basecamp.

The other launch partners are the YMCA in the Greater Twin Cities area of Minnesota and Orangetheory Fitness at two New York locations, with the balance of the company’s studios around the country joining throughout 2020. Other YMCAs across the country are expected to follow.

To participate in the program, the Connected partners all must have custom apps that let you use the watch to check in to the club, sign up for classes, receive notifications, and so on. The clubs also all accept Apple Pay, meaning you can buy water, socks, personal training sessions or make other purchases with the watch.

'Chicken of the trees': People are really selling iguana meat on Facebook

The facilities also have GymKit-capable cardio or other equipment where applicable, referring to the Apple platform that lets you tap the Apple Watch against the machine to share data in both directions.

For example, tapping a GymKit-enabled StairMaster means you won’t have to enter your age, weight other parameters when starting a workout on that machine – such vitals will be added automatically. Meanwhile, the StairMaster can report to the Apple Workout app on your wrist how many stairs you “climbed,” during the session, since the Apple Watch wouldn’t otherwise be able to record such elevation metrics.

The so-called “Earn With Watch” benefit differs by fitness facility.

Orangetheory will issue Nike and Apple gift cards for meeting various goals and will also let you connect a small OTBeat Link device on the Apple Watch band that can display heart rate measurements taken off the watch on screens inside Orangetheory’s studios.

Separate from the new Connected program, Orangetheory created an iOS and Apple Watch app for coaches; you may earn praise from them for achieving personal records.

Meeting digital health goals at the YMCA will help you do good for others.

“Members who participate in ‘Move for Good’ during monthly challenges with their Apple Watch not only benefit their health, but also help send kids to life-changing programs at the Y like swimming lessons, camp, sports and the Y’s signature Youth in Government program,” said Nathan Maehren, senior vice president of digital at the YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities.

Questions about privacy

8,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/equifax-expands-partnerships-with-rent-reporting-service-providers-300981852.html,"Wed, 08 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",PRNewswire,Equifax Expands Partnerships with Rent Reporting Service Providers,"ATLANTA, Jan. 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX), today announced new direct-to-consumer partnerships with Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo that will help develop a more complete picture of a consumer's financial profile. Equifax wants to offer real solutions that meet people wherever they are on their personal finance journey. The rent-reporting platforms enable consumers to opt-in to include rental payment data as part of their respective credit report to allow a more complete picture of financial history. All three companies, as part of their credit education initiatives, will also present their users with a free weekly or monthly VantageScore® credit score so they can track score changes over time.

Most renters' on-time housing payments are not reflected on their credit reports — even though it is often one of the largest and recurring bills consumers pay. Having little to no credit can impact a consumer's ability to qualify for a mortgage, finance a car or take out college loans. These direct-to-consumer Equifax partnerships with Zingo, Esusu and MoCaFi continue to give the underserved population an opportunity to add additional payment depth to their credit histories.

Esusu has been at the forefront of the technology integration of rent reporting and partners with leading public and private sector housing developers to report rent payment data to credit bureaus. It enables tenants to build and establish their credit scores while helping property owners reduce turnover and missed payments to increase their operating income. ""Esusu's partnership with Equifax will help accelerate our growth,"" said Abbey Wemimo and Samir Goel, Co-CEOs, Esusu. ""It will also help in creating more financial opportunities and access for millions of Americans.""

MoCaFi , short for Mobility Capital Finance, Inc., is a platform that seeks to provide banking services to the underbanked, while helping them build credit and improve their economic mobility. ""MoCaFi's partnership with Equifax represents a new paradigm of what's possible when two organizations come together to drive financial inclusion,"" said Wole Caxum, Founder and CEO, Mobility Capital Finance, Inc. ""Our work is already allowing people, especially communities of color, to see the benefits of using rent reporting to impact their credit scores. These are exciting times for us as our work is just getting started.""

The Zingo platform collects, verifies and reports rental payments initiated by the consumer, thus enhancing their credit profile when consistent payment history is reported. ""The Zingo automated rent reporting platform puts the consumer in control,"" said Maria Gallegos, CEO for Zingo. ""Our mission to empower consumer-initiated rent-reporting to Equifax supports their goal to help consumers live their best financial lives.""

""Our partnership with these market leading rent-reporting agencies reaffirms our commitment to become a more consumer friendly data and credit reporting agency,"" said Tom Madison, SVP and General Manager at Equifax Global Consumer Solutions. ""This will help provide a more comprehensive view of consumers' payment histories and help people in the pivotal moments in their financial lives, such as applying for their first mortgage or buying a car.""

""Everyone, regardless of their income or living situation, deserves the chance to reach their financial goals. Through these partnerships and continued efforts, Equifax aims to help consumers live their financial best by understanding their credit throughout their lifetime,"" Madison added

Over four days, he will participate with university collaborators in meetings, events, tours, and other activities to build and strengthen Yale’s research and educational partnerships across the continent.

“In a world that is growing in complexity and becoming more interrelated, successful universities will embrace global networks and exchanges,” Salovey said as he arrived in Lagos, Nigeria’s biggest city, with a delegation of Yale faculty and staff members. “While in Nigeria, home to the continent’s largest economy, I am looking forward to meeting with some truly extraordinary people. With this visit I hope to build on Yale’s robust relationships in Nigeria and other nations in Africa to strengthen education, research, and scholarship in the global community.”

Women’s leadership

The Yale Women’s Leadership Forum, a major program of the Yale Africa Initiative, takes place Saturday, Jan. 18. Salovey and Emma Sky, director of Yale’s Maurice R. Greenberg World Fellows Program and a senior fellow of the Yale Jackson Institute, will offer welcoming remarks and participate in the forum. The event will also feature remarks from María Teresa Fernández De La Vega, president of the Spanish Council of State and president of Fundación Mujeres por África (Women for Africa Foundation).

The forum is part of a flagship program established in 2015 and sponsored by Yale in partnership with Fundación Mujeres por África and Banco Santander. It aims to amplify the effectiveness and influence of women in African governments by serving as a catalyst for open dialogue and fostering mentoring relationships between one generation of African women leaders and the next.

The forum will feature personal leadership testimonials from a panel of program alumni. They include Obiageli Ezekwesili (from Nigeria), N’Diaye Ramatoulaye Diallo (Mali), Maria Kiwanuka (Uganda), Remi Sonaiya (Nigeria), and Nana Oye Lithur (Ghana). The discussion will be moderated by Olabosipo Sawyerr-Bassey, SOM 2007, from Nigeria, and Stephanie Busari, a journalist and editor at CNN International, based in Nigeria. A special session of the program will focus on reaffirming the commitment to and developing leadership approaches toward the achievement of the UN sustainable development goals.

The forum will conclude with remarks from Obiageli Ezekwesili, Richard von Weizsäcker Fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin, presidential candidate in Nigeria’s 2019 election, and former vice president for the World Bank’s Africa Region.

Salovey lecture and HAPPINESS Project

Salovey’s trip also includes a visit to the Lagos campus of Pan Atlantic University, where he will meet with Enase Okonedo, dean of Lagos Business School, and members of the school’s leadership team. Salovey will deliver a lecture to students, faculty, and invited guests on the topic of “Emotional Intelligence and Leadership in Business.” Following his talk, Salovey will participate in a question-and-answer session with audience members.

The Lagos Business School, along with three other schools in Africa, is a member of the Global Network for Advanced Management, a network of over 30 business schools around the world launched in 2012 by Yale and other institutions.

While in Lagos, Salovey also will meet with officials to finalize plans to expand the HAPPINESS Project (Health Action for Psychiatric Problems In Nigeria including Epilepsy and Substances), an ongoing Yale partnership with the government of Imo State, Nigeria. This pioneering program aims to increase access to effective, evidence-based treatments for mental and neurological disorders in underserved areas of the country, using technology and existing care infrastructure.

The HAPPINESS project oversees the training of primary care workers in rural communities to screen for, assess, and manage these disorders in their communities. Initiated in 2018, the project is a collaboration between Yale School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Imo State University Teaching Hospital. It is supported by the Yale Global Mental Health Program, CBM International, and the Imo State Primary Health Care Development Agency.

Yale Club of Nigeria

Yale has three alumni clubs across Africa — in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa. During Salovey’s visit, he will participate in a networking reception with officials and members of the Yale Club of Nigeria. The event will include Haroun Adamu (Yale College Class of 1970) and Lawrence Fubara Anga (Yale College Class of 1980), the president and vice president, respectively, of the Yale Club of Nigeria.

Early in his trip, Salovey will visit Heirs Holding, a family owned investment company committed to improving lives and transforming Africa, where he will meet with the CEO of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu. Salovey will also visit Techpoint, the largest tech media agency in Africa, where he will participate in a town hall-style meeting and interactive discussion with key leaders in the Lagos technology entrepreneurship ecosystem.

Back in New Haven, plans are underway for a 2021 exhibition at the Yale University Art Gallery dedicated to the work of the 20th-century Nigerian sculptor Bámgbóyè. It will feature a number of works on loan from Nigeria’s National Museum, which Salovey will tour with Edith Ekunke, head of museums for the National Commission for Museums and Monuments; Omotayo Adeboye, curator at the National Museum; and James Green, assistant curator of African art at Yale University Art Gallery. The group will discuss a planned collaborative research and conservation project, in partnership with Yale's Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, which will involve in-depth research into the works on loan along with the training of National Museum conservation staff in Lagos and New Haven.

The Yale Africa Initiative is a commitment announced by Salovey in his inaugural remarks in 2013 to foster new directions in research on Africa, and to identify new partnerships and deepen current ones, all while transforming the educational experiences and career opportunities of students at Yale and in Africa. Through the Yale Africa Initiative, Yale continues to leverage the power of partnerships and global networks across the continent to create new knowledge in science, public health, business, and other disciplines — and to improve lives around the globe.","Yale University President Peter Salovey arrived in Nigeria Jan. 15 to continue his leadership of the Yale Africa Initiative, a long-term, university-wide commitment to enhance Yale’s ongoing bilateral engagement with African institutions and to bring African scholarship, research, and education at Yale into sharper focus.

Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich all prefer a 4-3-3 system where attackers are afforded the luxury of floating across the front line, aiming to disrupt opposition defenders, throw them off the scent.

In Italy, the game is more considered, a greater emphasis placed on tactics. Simply banking on a lone striker, as they did last season under Luciano Spalletti with Mauro Icardi, is not enough to dethrone Juventus. So under Antonio Conte, Inter are taking it right back.

Lautaro Martinez (left) and Romelu Lukaku (right) are thriving as an old-school partnership

Deployed up top together in Antonio Conte's 3-5-2 system, Inter Milan are reaping the rewards

It is not as if Lautaro Martinez and Romelu Lukaku have had years to foster an understanding to the point where they now appear to be as close to telepathic as players can be.

They have been together a matter of months. Since August 8, to be precise, when Lukaku sealed a £75million switch from Manchester United to the San Siro.

United fans were thrilled that a player many derided was gone and the focus of their attack was now on Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. They may be forgiven for wondering if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's decision was a bit premature.

Lukaku has 14 league goals and is second in the race for the capocannoniere (top-scorer) award, behind Lazio's Ciro Immobile, who has 19. Martinez has nine, with three assists in 17 league games.

Their 23 total goals equals the output of title rivals Juventus with Cristiano Ronaldo (13), Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain (both with five) all combining for the same amount.

Lukaku and Martinez, with 30 between them in all competitions, conjure up memories of some of the great partnerships: Thierry Henry and Denis Bergkamp, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole, Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton among others.

Lukaku is a fine finisher and has got his mojo back since leaving Manchester United in August

Arguing their individual qualities against those other duos is one for another day but as a pairing, their effectiveness is central to Inter's hopes of stopping Juventus from winning a ninth consecutive Serie A title.

Not since Jose Mourinho was in the dugout during their Treble-winning season in 2009-10, have Inter got their hands on the prized Scudetto.

With Conte delivering a blast from the past with two up top, this is their best chance in a decade to dethrone their bitter rivals over in Turin.

Deploying Nicolo Barella and Stefano Sensi behind Martinez and Lukaku is incredibly smart management. The creativity is overflowing in a side that has fallen flat just once, when they got stage fright against Juventus at the San Siro on October 6 and they lost 2-1.

When the sides meet again on Conte's return to Turin on March 1 all eyes will be on him, but also on the strikers at both ends of the pitch. A potentially destructive front three of Dybala, Ronaldo and Higuain against a strike partnership for the ages in blue and black.

Conte is attempting to dethrone Juventus with a strike duo that are the envy of Europe's elite

Close on and off the pitch, the two strikers are developing an incredible level of understanding

Italian newspapers have wasted no time in fawning over the Inter pair as they continue to show no signs of slowing down, no signs of rolling over to a Juventus side used to getting their own way.

Gazzetta dello Sport have hailed their 'extraordinary understanding' while Corriere dello Sport described them as 'Giants' at the midway point in the season, with Inter top of the league on goal difference.

'I always say it doesn't matter who scores, as long as the team gets the goal and wins,' Lautaro told Sky Sport Italia recently.

'We work every day to help create that unity off the field and on it. Romelu is a great guy and we really get along, we both care more about the team than our own goals.

At Manchester United, Lukaku was tasked with things beyond his skill-set. At Inter, Conte has partnered his star summer signing with a player who can do all the running and the link-up needed. Lukaku can focus on finishing.

And there does not appear, on the face of it at least, to be a jealousy between the pair of them. If anything, they are growing as close off the pitch as they are on it.

They are perfect foil for each other with the pace of Martinez complimenting Lukaku's strength

After a recent victory, having returned to the dressing room to get changed and get home, it emerged the two of them were wearing the exact same dog jumper - cue a perfect photo opportunity that left fans in stitches.

They are perfect foil for one another. While Lukaku has more goals and is taking more of the headlines, those who make the case for Martinez being the more important player would have a strong argument.

There is a reason why Manchester United, Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid are keeping tabs on the 22-year-old Argentine. Assertions that he could take the attacking load for club and country once Lionel Messi or Sergio Aguero retires is not to be underestimated.

He is tireless, a famished dog of a player that is a dream forward for someone like Conte, particularly when partnered by a physical powerhouse like Lukaku.

Talk of a potential exit has, strangely, not been dismissed as ridiculous by Inter, fueling the possibility that this burgeoning partnership could be ripped apart in the summer.

'If Lautaro wants to leave we will evaluate the situation,' Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta told Italian outlet Sports Mediaset.

Juventus are banking on Paulo Dybala (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) to win them the title

'We are Inter and we don't necessarily have to sell to anyone. We want to grow up with important young players like Lautaro and Romelu Lukaku. If Lautaro wants to continue with us, we will be happy. He is with us right now.'

Unfortunately for Juventus, they do not look set to be dismantled before then as they face their biggest threat to a title in years.

Maurizio Sarri's side have lost just once in the league this season, away to Lazio, and will remain confident they have the psychological edge after that first win over Inter.

But goal difference could play a factor and even with Ronaldo hotting up - he scored his 56th career hat-trick in a win over Cagliari last time out - no one is looking beyond those wearing black and blue in Milan.

Forget the summer and a potential exit for Martinez, if this 'bromance', as they call it, ends Juventus' dominance and delivers Inter's first league title in a decade, they may well convince rivals that strike partnerships are firmly back in fashion.","Lautaro Martinez (left) and Romelu Lukaku (right) are thriving as an old-school partnershipDeployed up top together in Antonio Conte's 3-5-2 system, Inter Milan are reaping the rewardsIt is not as if Lautaro Martinez and Romelu Lukaku have had years to foster an understanding to the point where they now appear to be as close to telepathic as players can be.

“Only 23% of young refugees, for example, have any access to secondary education”

“Empowering education across social divides is needed to address the global risks spelt out in the WEF Global Risks Report 2020,” Waltermann said.

“The recently published report Schools of the Future by the WEF puts a strong emphasis on public-private partnerships and action in education, which are critical to preparing our young citizens for the new realities.”

UWC is a collective of international high schools across four continents that aims to unite “people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future” focusing on students between the ages of 16 to 19.

Having students across 18 schools, UWC greatly welcomes students from a vast diversity of backgrounds and aids students from lower socio-economic backgrounds by providing partial and full scholarships to those in need.

“Only when we have citizens who can work across boundaries to come up with shared solutions to shared problems are we on the path to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals,” Waltermann stated.

UWC provides access to secondary education to young refugees from war-torn regions and prides itself on being one of the few international high schools to do so.

“Only 23% of young refugees, for example, have any access to secondary education. Yet at UWC you see what happens when local students, privileged and less privileged learn together with young refugees.”

Waltermann further stated that young refugees can often be examples to the “privileged” and by mixing students that are from diverse backgrounds they can learn from one another about conflict and come together to create a change to global risks.","“Only 23% of young refugees, for example, have any access to secondary education”“Empowering education across social divides is needed to address the global risks spelt out in the WEF Global Risks Report 2020,” Waltermann said.

Q&A talks to Gregory Woodward, president of the University of Hartford, about the major issues facing higher ed in 2020.

What will be the most prominent issues in higher education over the next year?

The public thinks college is for gaining specific skills to be able to acquire and perform a specific job.

Employers actually think differently; they want to employ college graduates who have a reasonable skillset, but who have an equally powerful education in a broader range of abilities such as working in a diverse group, solving problems, being able to communicate effectively, data management and analysis, etc. This very real divide between what the public thinks college is for and what employers generally desire, needs to be understood.

A college degree is more important than ever in our society and students are getting employed, but providing a narrow-minded, career-training education does not allow for the best college experience, or most powerful career path.

What role should Greater Hartford colleges play to revitalize the economy?

Colleges and universities are partnering more and more with businesses to produce very well-prepared graduates for employment. The University of Hartford has several powerful partnerships with area enterprises, including Pratt & Whitney, Stanley Black & Decker, and Cigna, to name a few.

Universities must remain nimble in their degree offerings, and remain vigilant to the needs of the region — an ability often found more readily at private institutions.

At UHart, we have developed new programs in health professions, engineering, business and technology to directly address employer needs for growth and development in Connecticut. While only about 35 percent of our students come from Connecticut, last year, 64 percent of our graduates were employed in the state and stayed to reside here.

A longstanding complaint in Connecticut is that students come here for college, and then leave. What can colleges and state and local governments do to change this trend?

Most of our undergraduates have internships and work experience before they graduate. These local internships provide real partnerships between the university and local businesses. Almost 85 percent off these internships become actual job offers, keeping these great, young people in the state.

Regional businesses, nonprofits, government and other professional services should look to colleges to find interns and future employees, provide scholarships where appropriate — as Pratt & Whitney does for UHart engineers — and help educate universities as to their specific workforce needs and future trends in their businesses.

College leaders and faculty are more than happy to move towards these goals if the communication between sectors is vibrant and timely. UHart routinely asks employers these questions and develops programs towards these ends, perhaps the primary reason why our graduates stay in the state of Connecticut for employment at one of the highest rates in the state.

What can smaller liberal-arts institutions in Connecticut do over the next year to increase admissions and remain relevant?

Colleges and universities need to stop being all things to all students. If we were to each strategically choose our strengths and program concentrations we could share the prospective students and their majors in a more intentional and effective way.

More powerfully, however, is the simple fact that students going to college are a different group than just a short time ago. Forty-one percent of our incoming class this year are first-generation college students, the most diverse student body in history, and the smartest.

Colleges should reach out to these audiences and create support programs to make them successful, as first-gens are the least likely to graduate even after enrolling.","The public thinks college is for gaining specific skills to be able to acquire and perform a specific job.

15,https://www.fox5ny.com/news/christopher-mcdougall-running-with-sherman-donkey,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",FOX 5 NY,Running with a donkey opened Christopher McDougall's eyes about partnerships with animals,"article

Christopher McDougall is a former foreign correspondent who has reported from warzones. So he knows how to spin a yarn. But he goes much further than that by weaving that first narrative thread into a richly textured tapestry.

His first book, Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen (Alfred A. Knopf, 2009), is about the phenomenal long-distance runners from the Tarahumara tribe of Mexico's Copper Canyon. The monster best-seller became hugely influential both in and beyond the running community by helping make running barefoot (or in sandals or other minimalistic shoes) a mainstream phenomenon. (If you blame McDougall for some of the backlash to barefoot running—or even your own injuries—you probably didn’t pay close enough attention.)

Then Natural Born Heroes: Mastering the Lost Secrets of Strength and Endurance (Knopf, 2015) recounts a World War II mystery in which resistance fighters (most of whom were not professional soldiers) on the Greek island of Crete kidnapped a Nazi general and then outran and outfoxed thousands of German troops in the wilderness. Through this story, McDougall explores how strength, bravery, and endurance are linked to natural human movement, nutritional efficiency, and more.

McDougall’s latest book, his most personal, tells a story set in his backyard, literally. Running with Sherman: The Donkey with a Heart of a Hero (Knopf, 2019) chronicles his journey of rescuing a severely ill and injured donkey (the aforementioned ""Sherman"") from an animal hoarder, helping to nurse him back to health, and teaching the beast how to run—together. As they trained for a long-distance human-and-donkey footrace (a.k.a. pack burro race), McDougall discovered some things about the nature of human-animal partnerships—and himself. (Story continues)

Chris and Sherman run through the woods. (Matt Roth | Courtesy of Alfred A. Knopf)

Although I wasn’t recovered in time from foot surgery to join McDougall on a group run he led in Brooklyn during his book tour last fall, I did speak to him by phone about this delightful tale. Here is our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity.

How did you realize that this story, Sherman's story, was, in fact, a book?

CHRISTOPHER MCDOUGALL: This is a weird story that found me rather than me finding the story. My daughter had this idea that she wanted a donkey for her 10th birthday. And when I started asking around, one of our neighbors out here in rural Pennsylvania said, yeah, he knew someone that had a donkey and is actually in a bad situation. And so we ended up adopting a rescue donkey and discovering that we needed to rehabilitate it by teaching it how to run because he'd been immobile for so long. So he needed a way to get out and get moving. And it was because of that that I started looking at this whole world of the lost art of animal-human partnerships. And that's basically what the whole story became—this adventure story examining how humans used to partner one-on-one with teammates that were animals. (Story continues)

What are some of the things that surprised you to learn that? I loved how you weaved in stories that weren't even about Sherman but were about these other ways in which humans and animals were partners.

CHRISTOPHER: Like most people, I always sort of took this animal companionship for granted and I assumed that animals were these pets, these furry accessories that we kept in our back bedrooms and took out for walks while we check our phones. What I didn't really comprehend was how crucial this partnership with animals has been for much of human existence.

And not only did we learn from animals but we really relied on them for so many crucial aspects of human development. It was an animal that taught us how to hunt, how to navigate, how to adapt to different terrains. Without domesticated packs and horses, we would not have expanded and explored as much as we have as a species. And the key to that, though, is learning how to empathize and communicate with the nonverbal creature. (Story continues)

What was one of the things that frustrated you the most when you were rehabbing Sherman and learning to run with him? And what do you think he was frustrated most with you about, if you could discern that?

CHRISTOPHER: I came into this with the conception that donkeys are stubborn. And early in the process, I realized I'm sure donkeys look at us and feel the same way about us, that we were the stubborn ones. Because the thing about donkeys and humans is that as species, we're actually surprisingly similar. We are both species that like to think and make logic-based conclusions for ourselves.

And that's why donkeys have this reputation of being stubborn. They don't want to be forced to do anything. They want to think and contemplate and make a reasoned decision on their own. And that's what really separates them from horses. Horses have a flight instinct; when a horse is afraid, it'll try to run away. But donkeys are different. When a donkey's afraid, it will lock down and freeze up and assess the situation before it makes a move, which I think is actually similar to most humans.

That's kind of what we do. And so when you have two creatures that are both trying to make their own decisions, that can lead to a good bit of frustration on both sides.

Besides the human-animal partnership in terms of working together, what would you say is its mental health aspect? I'm not trying to pry into your own business but did you find that you got something out of this that was beyond just the physical?

CHRISTOPHER: I don't think it's any coincidence is that if you bring an animal into any hospital setting—if you bring a dog, for instance, into a cancer ward, you'll automatically find that the need for pain medication, for instance, drops in half, that your stress and anxiety levels drop in half.

I think we are physiologically hardwired to respond positively to any kind of animal contact, which makes sense, of course. If we relied on animals for our survival for so long then our brains would evolve to encourage this kind of behavior, this kind of relationship, because it was good for the species. And so that's why if a dog shows up in any room, the dog is suddenly the focus of everyone's attention. Say, with a cat: everyone wants to touch it and pet it. For a reason: because we physiologically had a positive response to that.

And that's basically what happened with me—I found two things. One was I had to shelve my own frustrations, expectations, my own demands because you just can't do that with nonverbal creatures. If you're going to partner with them, you got to learn to watch it think and empathize. And the second thing was, I was getting this daily dose of calming endorphin surges just by having contact with creatures for two or three hours a day. It was almost like a natural, holistic burst of healing medication every day. (Story continues)

Kip, Chris and Sherman on a pre-race run. (Mika McDougall)

You're a bigger character in this book than you are in your prior two books. In Born to Run and Natural Born Heroes, you wove yourself into the narrative but this one is very much more about you. Was that scary? Was that fun? Was that just a natural progression of your writing?

CHRISTOPHER: It was a little of all of those. It was a natural progression in two senses. My editor at Knopf has been pushing me to do this since we started working together on Born to Run. Even for Born to Run, I'm a much more visible presence in that book only because my editor really pushed me. I have a hard-news tradition where there is no first-person pronoun; you never say the word ""I.""

So I pushed back saying, ""Look, I'm the least interesting guy in these stories."" And he said, ""That's the point. You're the access point. You're the reader's proxy and that's why you need to be there.""

The second thing was that when you do a book, you have so much ground to cover. You got to decide on page 1 whose story is this? Who are we tracking? In Running with Sherman, it's me. So it's kind of unavoidable.

What's been the response so far?

CHRISTOPHER: It's been crazy. People are so passionate about the story. A lot of people who come [to public events] who don't really know what the book's about are so excited about a positive, feelgood story about an animal. Even before they've read it, they're excited. [Then there are] people who've read it and feel so personally attached. They really want to share that. Everyone at these events has been emotional—much more emotional and energetic than any other events I've ever done. (Story continues)

Sherman the donkey on his first morning in Colorado. (Christopher McDougall)

I've been reading the book while listening to your narration in the audiobook version. It's kind of awesome to hear you personally narrate this book. Has anyone given you feedback about the audiobook?

CHRISTOPHER: I've been getting a lot of feedback about that. And I'm really curious because not only did I not narrate either the other two books, but for Natural Born Heroes, I picked a British narrator because I knew his work from all the books he's done. I thought, ""This guy's really, really good."" But the audio editor said, ""Hey, but he's British and you're not."" I said, ""I know—he's really good.""

So that's how far removed I've been from it. So this is the first time I tried it and I'm really kind of curious to hear what the responses are. So far, people have been extraordinarily complimentary. But I still have not knuckled down and listened to it myself. I'm kind of waiting for that moment to listen to myself.

Your readers and fans have come to know your voice, literally, because of podcasts, radio interviews, TV interviews, and in-person appearances. So people who follow you know how you sound. This seems like a natural progression, especially since this is the most personal of your three books so far.

CHRISTOPHER: Which also made it difficult because it was hard to do. I found myself getting emotional, really kind of choking up as I was reliving some of these parts.

Any final thoughts about your experiences with Sherman?

CHRISTOPHER: One thing that kept coming up with me as we were trying to both train the donkeys and train ourselves for this race: people are too hard on themselves. We set these standards for what we have to be doing in terms of our training and our obligations in life.

What I found with the donkeys is, you're going make mistakes all the time and so you just get over them and move on. But a lot of times I talk to people about their own running. They're always apologizing. ""I didn't train enough."" ""I'm not going fast enough."" ""I didn't meet my goals.""

And that's the one thought I took away from this adventure with the donkeys is: Just stop apologizing, stop feeling bad. And what you do and what you get—that's the best to be hoped for.

Business Bureau, Gulf Today

The Abu Dhabi Global Markets organised the second Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Forum (ADSFF) during Abu Dhabi’s Sustainability Week (ADSW), which was held recently and attended by some of the world’s most prominent finance professionals.



The forum was addressed by Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi, Chief Financial Officer of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) where he highlighted the company’s longstanding commitment to environmental stewardship through a set of new and comprehensive sustainability goals and initiatives.



Earlier this week, Adnoc announced its 2030 Sustainability Strategy, as it extends its legacy of responsible oil and gas production and reinforces its commitment to accelerating sustainable development in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The announcement was made by Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and Adnoc Group CEO while speaking at the opening ceremony of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week.



Speaking at the ADSFF, Ahmed Al Zaabi highlighted the integral role of sustainable financing in Adnoc’s vision to become a best-in-class leader in sustainability and a benchmark for safety and asset integrity in the global energy industry.



“Building on fifty years of responsible production, Adnoc will continue to prioritise sustainability and make significant investments in new and innovative technologies and partnerships to improve our environmental performance. It is our clear aim to not just follow the guidelines and principles declared today but for Adnoc to be a leading contributor to the UAE’s efforts in promoting a sustainable agenda,” Al Zaabi said.



Inspired by the legacy of the late Sheikh Zayed, who laid the foundation for the UAE to become one of the least carbon-intensive oil and gas producers in the world and as part of its 2030 Sustainability Strategy, Adnoc plans to decrease its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 25 per cent by 2030. This will strengthen Adnoc’s position as one of the least carbon-intensive oil and gas companies in the world. According to the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), Adnoc currently ranks in the top five lowest GHG emitters in the oil and gas industry and has one of the lowest methane intensitites of 0.01 per cent.



Adnoc is also making further investments to expand the capacity of the region’s first commercial-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage facility in Al Reyadah six-fold. By capturing CO2 from its own gas plants, Adnoc aims to reach 5 million tonnes of CO2 every year by 2030 – the equivalent of the annual carbon capture capacity of over 5 million acres of forest or forest over twice the size of the UAE.



Other key initiatives of Adnoc’s sustainability agenda include limiting freshwater consumption ratio to below half a per cent of total water use. Today, over 99 per cent of the water Adnoc uses for cooling purposes is extracted seawater which is discharged back to sea after undergoing treatment to ensure compliance with Adnoc’s strict discharge standards.”



Adnoc’s sustainability goals underscore its strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance as the company responds to rising global energy demand and delivers its 2030 smart growth strategy. These goals are also aligned with the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development Goals on responsible consumption and production, climate action, protecting biodiversity, enhancing economic opportunity and promoting gender equality.



To achieve its ambitious environmental agenda, Al Zaabi explained, Adnoc is exploring a multitude of financing options and strategic partnerships. These new investors can help Adnoc diversify its current financing while opening new doors in the sustainability arena. By tapping private capital sources for financing to optimize its capital structure, the firm is working to ensure a steady supply of funding in support of its smart growth strategy.



The forum was attended by Sheikha Shamma Bint Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, CEO of Alliances for Global Sustainability, Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, Minister of State and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Cabinet Member and Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Laurent Fabius, President of COP 21, The Lord Mayor of the City of London, Alderman William Russel and a group of senior global finance professionals. ADSFF served as a launchpad for the unveiling of the UAE Sustainable Finance Guidelines and the second round of signatories of the Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Declaration.



It may be mentioned Adnoc is one of the world’s leading diversified energy and petrochemicals groups with a daily output of about 3 million barrels of oil and 10.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas. With 14 specialist subsidiary and joint venture companies, ADNOC is a primary catalyst for the UAE’s growth and diversification.","Ahmad Jasem Al Zaabi speaks during the forum.

On a cool January morning, a small group gathered in Clubhouse Visalia to discuss another week of their Bible study: ""Anxious for Nothing: Finding Calm in a Chaotic World"" by Max Lucado.

It's one of several groups 21-year-old Kayla Whatley attends at the volunteer-run community center that focuses on supporting people with mental illnesses and connecting them to resources.

Founders Gwen Schrank and her daughter, Brittany Schrank, opened the clubhouse in late October at 206 E. Oak St. above Jack & Charlie's restaurant.

Whatley already sees the center as ""a second home"" where she feels less alone in handling her depression and anxiety.

""I always felt like having a mental illness, you're labeled as crazy and not to be paid attention to,"" she said. ""It made me feel alienated. That's why when I found out about the clubhouse, I just had this feeling of hope inside me that there was a place where people could go and not feel alienated.""

Since Clubhouse Visalia's opening a few months ago, Schrank said that more than 110 members have come through its doors.

The clubhouse is partnered with Clubhouse International, an organization that has more than 300 locations worldwide and seeks to destigmatize mental illness and advocate for those affected by it.

Clubhouses look to involve people in their own recovery plans, and the people leading the groups and programs are often also handling their own mental illnesses or addictions.

Membership is free and open to adults struggling with their mental health who don't have a history of violence within the past year. The Clubhouse recently added a youth program for those ages 12 to 17 who are struggling with social anxiety or having other problems in school.

""We're wanting to get them involved in every aspect, not just telling them, 'Do this, do that and then you'll be fine,'"" Schrank said. ""Let's problem-solve this thing together. Let's experiment; let's figure this out together and build relationships together as well.""

Prospective members take a tour and then sit down with Schrank or a volunteer to talk about goals. Members play a big role in what programs are offered at the Clubhouse. If the new member has a need not met by an existing program or an accessible community resource, Schrank will look to add a new program to the schedule.

'She's just like us'

Across the hall from the Bible study, two women in recovery prepared to lead the day's Double Trouble in Recovery meeting, a 12-step, self-help group for people who have a drug or alcohol addiction, as well as a mental health disorder.

Members identify with clubhouse founder Gwen Schrank, who is on her own mental health journey, having attempted suicide less than eight months before the clubhouse opened.

""She's just like us,"" said Brenda Baxter, 38, who co-led the Double Trouble meeting. ""She suffers from the same thing we do but has been able to overcome and then lead for the ones who are trying to overcome.""

Schrank has struggled with depression and anxiety since she was a teenager. In February, her suicidal thoughts were overwhelming, and she tried to kill herself.

Schrank wrote about what led to her attempt in the first issue of ""Breathe Magazine,"" a quarterly magazine focused on mental health that was distributed to about 350 locations across Tulare County this month.

""My three children were adults and living their own lives, my husband and I were having marital problems and discussing divorce, and my employers decided they no longer needed me,"" she wrote. ""...I was devastated and felt I had nothing left to give.""

About a month after being released from the psychiatric hospital, Schrank interviewed for a job at Community Research Foundation in San Diego, an organization that operates clubhouses throughout San Diego County.

Inspired, she decided to turn down the job offer and return to Visalia to open her own clubhouse in her community.

While Schrank still struggles with her mental health, she said the clubhouse is ""a breath of fresh air.""

""One day at a time, one day at a time, I'm striving to live,"" she said. ""I'm looking for life instead of death right now, so I've noticed a change in that. In the past, I would gravitate toward, 'I don't want to live anymore.' Now I gravitate toward, 'I need to find the things I love. I need to explore, and I want to explore.'""

'Promoting mental wellness'

The magazine, which runs articles submitted by community members, is one example of the rapid growth and warm response since the clubhouse's opening.

Among other community groups, the clubhouse has partnered with New Life Ministries of Tulare County.

""New Life Community Church is a predominantly black church,"" Schrank said. ""New Life is looking to find ways to connect to provide resources needed in the African American community, so we'll be partnering with them.""

As part of the connection with New Life, Schrank spoke about mental health and wellness in Tulare on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, following the community march. She quoted King, saying, “Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.”

The clubhouse will also start doing mental health awareness events at local Starbucks around the county, starting with an event from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Feb. 1, at 5103 W. Goshen Ave. in Visalia.

""What Starbucks is doing for the first time in their history is promoting mental wellness for not only their staff but for their customers, too,"" Schrank said.

Schrank is planning to lead the Feb. 1 event, along with someone from the Tulare County Suicide Prevention Task Force, she said.

'They come back every day'

While the clubhouse doesn't have formal security, only one incident has necessitated a call to police, Schrank said. The call was made after a member tried to bring drugs into the building in December. The person was suspended for two weeks.

""We want people to feel like they're always welcome here — everyone makes mistakes, but there are always consequences to our mistakes,"" Schrank said. ""But you're always still going to be loved, valued and respected, regardless.""

When the suspension expired, the member returned to the clubhouse and has continued to participate in programs without further incident, Schrank said.

""They come back every day, actually,"" she said. ""They come back every single day and help out and volunteer.""

As the weekly Bible study wrapped up, a couple people lingered, chatting and sipping coffee while an episode of ""The Office"" played on the TV in the large meeting space. An anxiety and depression support group will meet here later in the day, but the clubhouse stays open in the meantime, with a hand-drawn ""Come in, we are awesome"" sign in the window.

""We want to be that place that people go to when they don't have the answers to anything else,"" Schrank said. ""We want to be that place they think of where they know they have the love and the support to figure out the answers, whether it's about mental health or not.""

Liverpool today announced their switch of kit supplier from New Balance to Nike.

Despite the club never claiming Nike kit sponsorship before, Liverpool players have a long affiliation with the brand.

We look a look at Liverpool players past, present and possible who have represented Nike.

Virgil Van Dijk

The Dutch colossus is one of the biggest names in world football at the moment.

He has transformed the Liverpool defence, narrowly missing out on the Premier League but leading his team to a historic Champions League victory.

The £75m man featured in a short film for Nike (Virgil van Dijk: Birthplace of Dreams) and fronts an impressive list of players sponsored by the brand.

Ian Rush

Legendary goal-scorer Ian Rush became the brand’s first Nike Football Athlete.

The striker remains Liverpool’s record goal scorer with 346 goals across all competitions between 1980 and 1996 and is widely regarded as one of the all-time greats.

He also was Wales’ top scorer with 28 until 2018, when his record was broken by Gareth Bale.

Fernando Torres

Torres established himself as one of Liverpool’s most popular number nines during his time on Merseyside, enjoying his peak years at Anfield.

He broke the record for Liverpool’s fastest player to 50 goals – a record since surpassed by Salah – and remains his country’s third highest scorer.

He starred in one of Nike’s most famous adverts when he arrived from Atletico Madrid, featuring the star’s Spanish roots mingling with aspects of scouse culture.

Not a popular name on Merseyside nowadays, but the English superstar gained his Nike sponsorship in 2012 when he sealed a switch the Liverpool.

He broke onto the scene alongside a strike force of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge as Liverpool fell at the final hurdle when challenging for the 2013/14 Premier League.

In 2015 he secured a hugely unpopular move to Manchester City. He featured in Nike’s Dream For The Next You in December 2019, exploring his origins in Brent, London.

Kylian Mbappe

Mbappe is the odd one out on this list, but gets an inclusion based on his Liverpool links.

While a transfer has been ruled out for the moment, you never know. In fact, Liverpool’s switch to Nike has been cited as a reason for a possible switch in the future.

Despite being only 21 years old, the French international is currently one of the world’s best players. He was a huge part of 2018’s World Cup win and has one the Ligue One title in both his full year’s at PSG.

Picture: SNS

Half way through the first half at the Global Energy Stadium and Ross County were on the attack again. Andy Irving had been dispossessed as Hearts tried to play out from the back and within two passes Josh Mullin was haring through the middle, between Ben Garuccio and John Souttar.

It looked like the home side were finally going to open the scoring after a couple of promising opportunities had been passed up previously. But just as Mullin was set to pull the trigger, Souttar made an excellent recovery to slide in and push the ball from the toes of the winger. Danger averted.

It was a common occurrence throughout the match. Hearts losing the ball, County springing forward to take advantage of gaps and Souttar making a crucial interception or intervention. It wasn't just the club's vice captain, his centre-back partner Craig Halkett and right-back Clevid Dikamona also had to step in to block, intercept or tackle at key moments.

Souttar will be looking to build a solid partnership with Craig Halkett. Picture: SNS

It was, however, the 23-year-old former Dundee United defender who was Hearts' star performer on the night.

Primarily, Souttar and Halkett were having to put out a number of fires, especially in the first half, as they were left exposed due to team-mates' positioning or inability to keep the ball. Time and again, County were able to waltz through the centre of the pitch or down the wings after winning possession. The centre-back duo stood strong.

Stat attack

On the night no player recovered the ball more times than Halkett (26) and Souttar (22), while the latter won the most aerial duels for the visitors, as well as making the most clearances and interceptions.

It is the latter which stands out. Throughput his career he has averaged 5.94 interceptions per match. Against County it was 12, the highest he has achieved in 16 months. What it shows is how much he is suited to Daniel Stendel's game plan and style, and how Hearts fans should be hugely encouraged by a partnership which is likely to develop with Halkett - if both players stay fit.

If it wasn't for injury, there is every chance Christophe Berra would have been sidelined long before the new manager decided to lessen his role significantly.

Souttar and Halkett had started just one match as a pair in a back four prior to the Scottish Cup game against Airdrieonians on Saturday. The duo eased through that encounter but Ross County offered up a far tougher assessment of their qualities.

The Staggies' defence hasn't been great but they have been dangerous in attack. Hearts did their best to put their centre-backs in situations where the would be truly tested, and they passed with flying colours.

Risk

Stendel has the perfect duo for carrying out his requirements of a high line. Both are fine at dealing with long balls over their head, forcing them to defend when facing their own goal. The are more than able at defending one-v-one situations, and dealing with being exposed due to players ahead of them taking risks.

As their deputy Clevid Dikamona revealed, it is something they will have to get used to: ""Before, we had a style of play where there was no risk taking, and the objective was just to get one goal more than the opposition. While nowadays the message we have is to take more risks in order to score goals.

""Even if this might give the opposition more chances to score, generally by taking risks we are the ones who create more chances.""

Souttar's return from injury and Halkett's return to form has brought Stendel a key piece of his jigsaw as he pieces together a spine to the Hearts team.","Picture: SNSHalf way through the first half at the Global Energy Stadium and Ross County were on the attack again.

Every team needs a player who creates chances and another who can finish them. If these two players click, there’s little that defences can do to stop them.

Liverpool may be such a well-oiled machine that the combinations can be different for every goal, but not every side has that luxury.

We’ve looked at the players who have combined to score the most Premier League goals so far this season.

Heung-min Son > Harry Kane – 3 goals

Son has stepped up in Kane’s recent absence but the pair are both at their best when they can combine on the pitch.

As well as being a great goalscorer, the South Korean can also create chances for his team-mates and has set set up three goals for the England striker.

Riyad Mahrez > Sergio Aguero – 3 goals

Djibril Sidibe > Richarlison – 3 goals

Kevin de Bruyne > Gabriel Jesus – 3 goals

Jesus has scored 9 goals this season, but let’s be honest, when you have someone like De Bruyne in your side, it really can’t be that hard. I mean come on, just look at that pass.

Kevin De Bruyne's assist to Gabriel Jesus this week was a thing of beauty. Easily the best midfielder in the world. 😍🔥pic.twitter.com/KT6drPEwvS — Football HQ (@FootbaII_HQ) January 13, 2020

Ashley Westwood > Chris Wood – 3 goals

Andreas Pereira > Anthony Martial – 3 goals

Teemu Pukki > Todd Cantwell – 3 goals

Even if Norwich end up getting relegated, two players that will surely stay in the Premier League or move to another top flight are Cantwell and Pukki.

The striker has scored 11 goals this season and has also assisted Cantwell against Chelsea, Man City and Everton. Given how well they play together, we can only hope they end up in the same team wherever that may be.

Norwich actually outclassed Manchester City Todd Cantwell's dance-celebration tells it all 👌pic.twitter.com/BxYb11cemA — Airtel UG Football (@AirtelUFootball) September 16, 2019

Robero Firmino > Mohamed Salah – 3 goals

David Silva > Sergio Aguero – 3 goals

Trent Alexander-Arnold > Virgil Van Dijk – 3 goals

Alexander-Arnold’s crossing abilities and Van Dijk’s prowess in the air mean that it won’t surprise anybody to see this combination on this list.

The centre-back has headed home three of Alexander-Arnold’s set pieces so far this season, including the opening goal in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Manchester United.

Lys Mousett > John Lundstram – 3 goals

Dwight McNeil > Chris Wood – 3 goals

Raul Jimenez > Adama Traore – 3 goals

Traore and Jimenez have been two of the brightest sparks in what has been an excellent season for Wolves. The former has seven assists and the latter has 11 goals in the league, making them their club’s top provided and scorer respectively.

The pair have linked up for eight goals in total, with Jimenez assisting Traore for three of them, including the opener in their 2-0 win against Manchester City. The winger’s pace and the striker’s finishing may well be a combo that gets them European football again.

Harvey Barnes > Jamie Vardy – 3 goals

Kevin de Bruyne > Raheem Sterling – 4 goals

Dan James > Marcus Rashford – 4 goals

To say it’s been a mixed season for Man Utd would be an understatement, but one positive has been the attacking football displayed by their two young stars, Marcus Rashford and Dan James.

The pair are two of the quickest players in the league, and when they’re in their stride, few backlines can keep up with them. Oh, and James has a helluva cross on him too, which helps.

Emiliano Buendia > Teemu Pukki – 4 goals

Adama Traore > Raul Jimenez – 5 goals

Kevin de Bruyne > Sergio Aguero – 6 goals

Yep, De Bruyne’s so good that he shows up in this list on three separate occasions.

One is the league’s best playmaker while the other is one of its best-ever goalscorers. Add in the fact that they’ve played together for nearly five seasons and it should come as no surprise that this is the most regular combination for goals.

While their team have failed to reach the dizzy heights of the previous two seasons, De Bruyne and Aguero have both continued to play their best, and when they’re doing so on the same pitch, there’s a good chance they’ll link up.

Already deprived of Harry Kane by a long-term hamstring injury, Spurs announced on Tuesday that Son faces “a number of weeks” out after surgery on a fracture to his right arm.

The pair have combined for over 100 Premier League goals when on the field together and average almost 1.3 goals per game – a better rate than any other pair of players who have played more than 5,000 minutes together.

Here, the PA news agency looks at the most reliable duos of the Premier League era.

Harry Kane and Son Heung-min

Tottenham, 102 goals

Kane has scored 67 goals to Son’s 35 when they have shared the pitch in the league. Having played 7,113 minutes together, that equates to 1.29 goals every 90 minutes.

Midfielders Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen have also thrived when on the field with Kane, scoring 37 and 36 respectively and each combining with the England captain for a record of more than a goal a game. Son, though, is his most-successful partner – and has also stepped up his game when Kane has been absent, improving his scoring record from a goal every other game to two goals every three games.

Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane

Mohamed Salah (left) and Sadio Mane have fired Liverpool to glory (Peter Byrne/PA)

Liverpool, 89 goals

Not far behind, with a combined record of 1.26 goals per 90 minutes, are Liverpool’s free-wheeling inverted wingers – Salah has a half-century of goals when on the field alongside Mane, who has added 39.

Roberto Firmino, the third member of Jurgen Klopp’s feared front three, has also dovetailed effectively with Salah for 91 goals in partnership at 1.17 per 90 minutes, while he and Mane average 0.89 together.

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling

Sergio Aguero (left) and Raheem Sterling have combined for 100 goals (Martin Rickett/PA)

Manchester City, 100 goals

Aguero is City’s all-time record scorer, as well as the Premier League’s top-scoring overseas player, and has found a perfect foil in Sterling – the pair have combined for 100 goals at 1.22 per 90 minutes, with the Argentinian scoring 65 to Sterling’s 35.

Aguero also enjoys goal-a-game combinations with midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva, but has dominated the scoring to such an extent that they cannot be viewed as goalscoring partnerships in the traditional sense.

Thierry Henry and Robert Pires

Arsenal, 162 goals

The longest-serving and overall highest-scoring partnership on the list, Henry and Pires played over 12,000 minutes together and shared 162 goals, with Henry’s 108 exactly doubling the winger’s tally.

Another fellow Frenchman, Sylvain Wiltord, was also an effective partner for Henry in a shorter period, sharing 67 goals at better than one per 90 minutes, while Dennis Bergkamp was a long-standing creative foil to him but was left in the shade in terms of goalscoring.

Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard

Liverpool, 81 goals

Like Henry and Pires, the Liverpool duo were not a traditional strike pairing with Gerrard playing in midfield but weighing in with an impressive share of goals – including 29 with Torres on the pitch, adding to the Spaniard’s 52 at a combined 1.13 per game.

After Torres’ departure, Gerrard enjoyed an almost-identically successful partnership with Luis Suarez – 26 goals to the Uruguayan’s 55 in 6,497 minutes, just 35 more than he played with Torres.","Son Heung-min’s injury leaves Tottenham facing a long period without either member of arguably the Premier League’s most effective ever strike partnership.

It may be strikers who get most of the praise for putting the ball into the net, but their job would be nearly impossible without the 10 men behind them.

Sometimes though, we get to witness two players forming a fierce partnership that leaves defenders quaking in their boots.

If a duo are on the same wavelength, they can both score goals while simultaneously assisting each other.

That really is a manager's dream. Just think Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, or Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, for example.

But have you ever wondered who the deadliest partnerships in Premier League history are?

Well, wonder no more, because The Sun have worked out just that.

The newspaper has based its rankings on the number of goals each duo averages every 90 minutes, rather than the total number of goals scored.

It also only takes into account partnerships that have spent over 5,000 minutes on the pitch together.

So without further ado, check out the top five below:

5) Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard | Liverpool | 81 goals | 1.13 goals per 90 minutes

4) Thierry Henry and Robert Pires | Arsenal | 162 goals | 1.21 goals per 90 minutes

3) Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling | Man City | 100 goals | 1.22 goals per 90 minutes

2) Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane | Liverpool | 89 goals | 1.26 goals per 90 minutes

1) Harry Kane and Son Heung-min | Tottenham | 102 goals | 1.29 goals per 90 minutes

Be honest - did you really expect to see the Spurs duo of Son and Kane named as the Premier League's greatest ever?

But the stats don't lie, those two have an incredible goal output when they're on the pitch together.

Jose Mourinho will be very thankful the coronavirus crisis halted this season and he has his two stars back fit for the resumption.

Will Kane and Son be able to fire Spurs to a top-four finish? We'll find out very soon.

News Now - Sport News","Sometimes though, we get to witness two players forming a fierce partnership that leaves defenders quaking in their boots.
If a duo are on the same wavelength, they can both score goals while simultaneously assisting each other.
But have you ever wondered who the deadliest partnerships in Premier League history are?
The newspaper has based its rankings on the number of goals each duo averages every 90 minutes, rather than the total number of goals scored.
It also only takes into account partnerships that have spent over 5,000 minutes on the pitch together."

Walker County Schools Superintendent Dr. Joel Hagood gave what he referred to as a ""state of the school system"" address at a recent meeting of the board of education.

The Walker County BOE developed a strategic plan last year that involved a number of goals to strengthen the school system. Hagood took an opportunity at a board meeting on Feb. 13 to update those in attendance on the system's progress in meeting those goals.

""When we walked in, we kind of felt like we were operating more from a perspective of a system of schools, instead of being all together as a school system,"" Hagood said of when he officially went to work as superintendent in January 2019.

He said the strategic plan served to bring the school communities together through five common goals: ensuring safe facilities, aiming for effective instruction and leadership, focusing on early childhood education, seeking academic growth and striving for students to be college and career ready.

School leaders and BOE officials have celebrated many goal-related achievements over the past several months.

To enhance school safety, school resource officers have been put in place at schools without a municipal police department or those with limited resources, thanks to a partnership with the Walker County Sheriff's Office.

A number of programs have been incorporated to serve students with mental health needs, including a trauma-informed program to help students who are experiencing emotional or physical trauma at a young age. A Peer Helpers program has also been implemented at all schools for students to support one another, and other mental health partnerships have resulted in students getting therapy for mental health needs.

The school system also hired a mental health coordinator to oversee all mental health programs.

To carry out goal two of effective instruction and leadership, the district hired a math coach to assist math teachers at county schools, and other programs have been incorporated to improve reading and other academic skills.

A decision was also made in January that Hagood says will strengthen early childhood education opportunities for students. On Jan. 16, the school board voted to relinquish a Head Start grant at the conclusion of fiscal year 2020 and, in turn, expand First Class Pre-K in Walker County Schools. He said the decision could eventually result in the Walker County school system having over 20 First Class Pre-K classrooms.

When addressing the school system's fourth goal of academic growth, Hagood said he is proud Walker County Schools went from a 78 to an 83 score recently on the state report card.

Schools are working on the expansion of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) activities to strengthen academics, and some schools are striving toward STEM certification. In December, Bankhead Middle School was the first school in the Walker County school system to become a Cognia Internationally Certified STEM School — one of the highest distinctions a school can receive.

A major announcement recently came to benefit the school system's fifth goal of making more students college and career ready. Bevill State Community College has partnered with Walker County Schools to expand dual enrollment opportunities, which will allow some students to eventually receive their high school diploma and a two-year degree at the same time.

Overall, Hagood said many of the school system's accomplishments in the past year would not have been possible without partnerships.

""We are very, very blessed in this county to have the foundation [of partnerships],"" Hagood said. ""It takes all of us working together. We're very blessed to have these people working with us.""

The board of education has established partnerships with the Walker Area Community Foundation, Northwest Alabama Mental Health Center, Jasper Area Family Services Center, Walker County Arts Alliance, Health Connect America, the Walker County Sheriff's Office, Bevill State Community College, the University of Alabama, Capstone Rural Health, Youth Advocate Programs, Raising Arrows and the City of Lights Dream Center.

Hagood also thanked all employees of the Walker County Board of Education and the school board itself for supporting the vision of the strategic plan.

""We have people here that, every day, walk in the door to wear multiple hats and are striving to improve the school system,"" Hagood said, adding, ""I thank this board because they have been so cooperative in helping us put that together and achieve those things. I applaud you and appreciate you for all of your help.""","The Walker County BOE developed a strategic plan last year that involved a number of goals to strengthen the school system.

Salah, Henry","The five most lethal partnerships in Premier League history, ft. Salah, Henry

The Premier League has witnessed some prolific partnerships – but which pair score the most goals when they are on the pitch together?

Football is a team game but some players often play better and score more goals when they are playing alongside another world class player.

We’ve looked at the pairs who have played over 5000 minutes together in the Premier League and scored the most goals per 90 minutes.

5. Fernando Torres & Steven Gerrard

Torres and Gerrard were Liverpool’s standout players between 2007 and 2011 and their outstanding link-up play gave opponents nightmares.

The pair scored 81 goals (Torres 52, Gerrard 29) when they were on the pitch together at a rate of 1.13 goals per 90 and they certainly enjoyed being on the same team.

“I always say the best player I played with is Steven Gerrard,” Torres said in 2019. “I found he was the player who completed my game. I think my level got into a different dimension when I was on the pitch with him.

“It was an amazing three-and-a-half years playing alongside Steven and I would love to go back to those days – even for one minute.”

4. Thierry Henry & Robert Pires

The two Frenchmen were an excellent double act during their successful time at Arsenal with Henry up front and Pires playing on the wing.

Henry (108) and Pires (54) scored an incredible total of 162 league goals when they were on the pitch together at a rate of 1.21 goals per 90 minutes.

But it probably should’ve been 163…

Throwback to the worst penalty of all time by Pires and Henry. 😂 pic.twitter.com/NcJ34CGXRZ — Aubazettes (@Aubazettes) October 22, 2018

3. Sergio Aguero & Raheem Sterling

It won’t surprise anybody to see these two on the list.

Aguero and Sterling are both guaranteed starters in a Manchester City team that has scored over 250 goals since the start of the 2017-18 season.

When they’ve played together in the league for City, Aguero has notched 65 goals and Sterling has 35 so that brings their tally to 100 at 1.22 goals per 90 minutes.

2. Mohamed Salah & Sadio Mane

They are two of the best goal-scoring wingers in the Premier League and the pair shared the Golden Boot with Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in 2018-19.

Salah has scored 50 goals when Mane has been on the pitch and Mane has scored 39 while playing alongside Salah, so they average 1.26 goals per 90 minutes.

“I always say it is very easy to work together,” Mane told the official Liverpool FC magazine in 2019. “Personally, I just think myself very lucky to play alongside these great players.

“Every single player who plays alongside them would enjoy it because they are very good players and they make everything easy, so I just enjoy playing alongside them.”

1. Harry Kane & Heung-min Son

The Tottenham forwards clearly bring the best out of each other as they are the most deadly duo in Premier League history.

They have scored 102 goals between them while playing alongside each other with Kane scoring 67 and Son making up the other 36 at a rate of 1.29 goals per 90.

Unfortunately for Spurs, they are both currently sidelined by injury problems and may have to wait until 20120-21 to add to that tally.

Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have scored 49% (33/68) of Tottenham's goals in all competitions this season. When you add assists the pair have been directly involved in 63% (43/68) of Spurs' goals. Miss. #COYS pic.twitter.com/JB0jX5E62b — The Stat Man (@hotspurstat) February 21, 2020

31,https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200221.672385/full/,"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Health Affairs,Addressing Social Determinants: Scaling Up Partnerships With Community-Based Organization Networks,"As health care payment models become more value-based, health care systems are increasingly interested in approaches that address both medical needs and social determinants of health.

This isn’t surprising. Services delivered in the home and in the community that prevent falls, address food insecurity and transportation issues, manage chronic disease, support employment and economic independence, reduce social isolation, and address other non-medical risk factors have been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce the cost of care. This is particularly true for “high-need, high-cost” people who have complex health conditions and social risk factors and who often have significant functional limitations.

Integrating these services into health care requires robust planning and assessment, expert knowledge and navigation of a complicated social service system, ongoing case management, and accountability for service delivery and outcomes. Incorporating these services requires health care payers and providers to “build” internal organizational capacity or “buy” it from existing service providers. When making that decision, there are many factors for health care organizations to take into consideration, not the least of which are local factors in the communities and markets they serve.

For many organizations, however, partnering with the existing infrastructure of community-based organizations (CBOs) in the aging and disability network—buying rather than building—is the more cost-effective strategy for delivering the full continuum of quality care and support for their most high-risk and high-need patient populations. Federal and state governments have made significant investments in this network, which includes over 20,000 CBOs. Since 1965, the network has been a trusted resource, delivering home- and community-based care to one in five of America’s older adults, as well as people of all ages with disabilities.

As described below, partnerships between CBO networks and health care organizations have produced great progress in addressing the social needs of patients. We believe the next step is to scale these partnerships across the country, with shared investment from both health care and social services. We envision collaborations between CBO networks and health care organizations within and across states, organized by health care markets. We discuss how this expansion would work, and conclude by calling on stakeholders to work with the Administration for Community Living on a nationwide approach for integrating medical and social care.

CBOs And Social Determinants: Where We Are Now

CBOs in the aging and disability network are present in every community across the U.S. and have unmatched expertise in local culture and needs; service coordination and delivery; and securing benefits, services and supports that maximize independence and functioning. With extensive reach into peoples’ homes, the network also has a unique ability to identify risks and connect people to interventions before their situations reach crisis levels. These unique capabilities can and should be strategically leveraged by health care organizations through partnerships with CBOs in the aging and disability network.

Health care systems tend to focus on chronic conditions as the guidepost for targeting high-cost, high-needs adults, but the data are clear: this view is too myopic. Per capita Medicare spending roughly doubles for adults with two or more functional limitations, regardless of the number of chronic conditions they have.

CBOs are critical partners in responding to these challenges and are increasingly contracting with health care systems and plans, including Medicare Accountable Care Organizations, to provide direct services, like meal delivery; care and services coordination; and care transitions as people return home from hospitals and avoid further institutional care. These contractual relationships seek to cost-effectively help adults with complex needs thrive in the community.

These partnerships are succeeding. Collaboration between health care organizations and social service networks in the community have been associated with higher performance and reduced health care costs, and some partnerships have substantially improved workforce shortages. For example:

VAAACares,® a statewide one-stop coalition providing care coordination, care transitions, and other services, reduced the 30-day readmission rate from 18.2 to 8.9 percent through their partnership with four health systems, 69 skilled nursing facilities, and 3 health plans .

. Elder Services of the Merrimack Valley, an Area Agency on Aging (AAA) in northeast Massachusetts, and their network of community partners have shown an 11 percent reduction in total cost of care through their collaboration with health care organizations.

The Veterans Health Administration, through the Veteran Directed Care program, has had purchasing agreements over the last decade with CBO network organizations across 37 states to provide nursing-home-eligible veterans with a counselor and a monthly budget to obtain the long-term services and supports they need to live in the community—at about one-third of the cost of a nursing home .

. Ability360, a center for independent living in Arizona, has contracted with Medicaid and managed care organizations to serve individuals across the state by providing home modifications, state-of-the-art exercise facilities, and 2,300 personal care assistants to support independent living in the home and community of each person’s choice.

A rural Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO partnered with local faith-based organizations to establish a “buddy” program. Volunteers visit regularly with beneficiaries who opt into the program, which is offered by primary care practices to older patients who had high emergency department (ED) use. Though small, the program has reduced unnecessary visits to EDs by 50 percent for elderly patients who are lonely or anxious but do not have emergent medical conditions. Based on these results, the ACO plans to expand the program.

Those are just a few examples, and leaders across the aging and disability network are actively increasing capacity and creating new models to meet the needs of health care organizations. For example, many CBOs have formed cohesive networks with “hubs” or “network brokers” that manage referrals and maintain relationships with many different community providers. These hubs act as a single point of accountability for health care systems and plans, increasingly across entire states or multi-state regions.

We also are excited about the combination of innovation and policy changes in Medicare that address social needs. For example, Medicare Advantage plans now can test value-based insurance design and offer supplemental benefits that are not primarily medical in nature for chronically ill beneficiaries, which gives them flexibility to offer social services and supports to qualified beneficiaries. In addition, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation’s Accountable Health Communities Model is formally testing the extent to which health care costs and utilization can be reduced by systematically identifying and addressing the health-related social needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries’ through screening, referral, and community navigation services. These initiatives will yield ongoing insights that can inform future policy and practice.

What’s Next?

The greatest opportunity lies in partnerships that go beyond individual health care organizations and individual CBOs or CBO networks. We believe that the future lies in scaling the CBO network model across the country, organized to correspond to markets for health care delivery and payment. This means establishing a system of CBO networks, with hubs at local, state and multi-state levels. Each CBO network hub could individually contract with multiple health plans and health systems in a given geographic region, as well as partner with other CBO network hubs to contract with health care organizations that have a broader geographic footprint. This would provide a single point of accountability for health care partners, whether local hospital systems, state-level managed care organizations, or multi-state or national health plans and health systems.

The Administration for Community Living is working with CBO leaders, states, philanthropies, and health care organizations to accelerate the development of this nationwide CBO network model. To that end, ACL is collaborating with stakeholders to 1) clarify the role of the CBO network hub at each level and 2) define the core competencies to coordinate with health care partners and perform in-person centered planning and assessments, referrals, activation, service delivery, data driven improvement, and financial management.

One thing is clear: strategic collaboration and shared investment between the health and social service sectors is needed. A collective effort would bring together the different expertise found in these sectors, allow for innovation to be replicated and scaled, enable efficient investment in technology that can integrate workflows, and support expansion of the workforce needed to support older adults and people with disabilities. It would also avoid using scarce resources to duplicate efforts.

Fleshing Out The Way Forward

Replicate CBO Networks With Hubs

CBOs are well-positioned and uniquely skilled to act as the hubs that curate and manage networks of community service providers, given their expertise in service navigation and their existing relationships in their communities. In fact, a recent study found that AAAs (one type of CBO), are consistently the most centrally positioned organization in a network, leading the authors to conclude that ""as policy makers and health care managers engage in efforts to foster cross-sector partnerships, the AAAs could be leveraged as brokers.""

ACL is supporting replication of CBO networks through a learning collaborative for network hubs and will be administering grants to support their enhancement and expansion. As these networks are replicated and scaled, maintaining their trust in the community, flexibility to evolve, and ability to implement evidence-based interventions to achieve performance benchmarks will be essential.

Shared Investment In CBO Networks And Services

CBO networks and their hubs will strengthen as there is predictable payment for their services. Experience to date has shown individual contracts between CBOs and health care organizations don't provide enough referral volume to justify the hiring of the new staff that would be dedicated to contracted services. As network hubs contract with health plans and health systems at local, state and regional levels, they'll secure payment that will build and sustain their operations along with the workforce needed at the hub and CBO levels. Over time, health systems and plans will have a go-to, reliable resource to integrate social care into health care delivery.

Establish A Shared Technology Infrastructure

Without deliberate collaboration, we risk proliferation of siloed, technology systems that only connect individual health systems and health plans with their CBO partners and create walled gardens within communities. There are growing number of examples of health systems and health plans in the same market implementing different referral management platforms that create complexity and burden for the CBO partners that must accommodate them all. North Carolina, Virginia, Oregon and Pennsylvania are in various stages of planning and implementing statewide solutions to avoid this complexity.

A multi-stakeholder, standards-based approach to financing and implementing information technology to integrate medical and social care will enable efficient adoption of referral management, case management and analytic platforms that can interoperate with the existing health IT infrastructure across payers, health care providers and CBO networks. CBO network hubs can work with their state and community stakeholders to plan for collaborative technology investments that can scale across CBO networks and the health care organizations they serve.

A Call To Action

Of course, there are unanswered questions we’ll need to address as we proceed. We need transparency around the cost of providing community-based services and better measurement of the health and economic impacts of various services. Given the competing demands on primary care clinicians’ time, we also need to determine who is best positioned to screen for social risks and refer to community services. We need to find ways to expand access to affordable housing and transportation, and to benchmark our progress over time, so that all stakeholders can gauge our progress towards integrating medical and social care nationwide.

In the coming months, ACL will be meeting with key stakeholders to work on shared goals, principles and strategies that we can all embrace and that can guide us as we work across sectors to improve outcomes for the people we serve. We are calling on health care system and health plan executives to partner with us to develop business models for social care through CBO networks, evaluate what works best, and incorporate private sector innovation. Together, we can achieve a sustainable, integrated system of social service and health care delivery.","As health care payment models become more value-based, health care systems are increasingly interested in approaches that address both medical needs and social determinants of health.

At least 500 million are living in Africa without access to electricity. The continent needs billions for clean energy projects. One idea is to form a creditworthy intermediary that supports regional market integration and that creates scale to bring down green energy prices.

One of the reasons why sub-Saharan Africa has so many without power is because the utilities there lack the ability to get loans or investment, meaning they cannot finance an expansion of infrastructure — either the transmission and distribution or the electric generators. But the AfricaGreenCo. is now an intermediary, becoming the creditworthy entity that is used to draw-in financing. Can it be effective?

“What can we offer up in this dawn of the new decade is a unique approach through public-private partnerships that can systematically develop a pipeline of projects,” says Ian de Cruz, who is the global director for the Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030. “The projects must be sustainable, environmental and economic. This is a way that civil society, corporate investors and government can work together to achieve multiple impacts.”

Cruz spoke with this writer by phone and explained that his group — P4G for short — is the catalyst that brings together the disparate parties and that finds the financing for projects: the enterprise acts more like “angel investors” that are the first-in and that provide credibility to a given deal. It is different from the traditional approach of using multilateral or development finance institutions such as the World Bank, which provide loans and which require governments to provide guarantees. In the case of P4G, investors are at risk.

P4G is working with Africa GreenCo., which has received a $45 million guarantee from the French Development Agency that is backed by the European Fund for Sustainable Development. That provides capital protection to commercial lenders. The Development Bank of South Africa, the Rockefeller Foundation, Green Climate Fund, Industrial Development Corporation of Zambia and InfraCo Africa are also participating.

Within a dozen years, Africa GreenCo wants to build 3,000 megawatts of renewable energy generation on an investment of $5.6 billion. Its first projects will be in Zambia before starting them in South Africa, Namibia and Eswatini.

The World Bank’s Way

“We are bringing private sector investment to Africa that has not existed before,” says Cruz. “Utilities have challenges to be creditworthy. We are independent and have financial creditworthiness. We create a finance model through coalitions and partnerships. It is a high risk, high impact finance model. We would like to stimulate that market. We combine venture capital with growth, sustainable energy and climate goals. Our ideas can be replicated and ramped up at speed and scale.”

P4G has its sights set beyond Africa, helping to finance electric buses in Mexico City as well as Chile, Colombia and Brazil. It is also promoting energy efficiency in the steel, automotive, engineering, textile, chemical and food processing sectors.

P4G’s investment approach is promising. But it is thus far limited. Overall, $2.8 billion was spent on renewables in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, excluding South Africa, says Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That is $600 million more than what was invested in 2017. Notably, 1,200 megawatts of rooftop solar photovoltaic energy is expected to rev up in 2021 — more than twice the amount commissioned in 2018.

Multilateral financial institutions remain a key source of finance and have helped roll out renewable energy auction programs, it adds. The World Bank’s Scaling Solar program, for example, helped finance a 400-megawatt solar rooftop deal between 2015 and 2018. That’s was 39% of the region’s total installed capacity during that period, all done for as little as $0.04 per kilowatt/hour.

And like P4G, BloombergNEF says that developing regional power markets is paramount — a move that would facilitate trade and allow countries to exchange surplus electricity across their borders. But hurdles stand in the way, namely the lack of private investment in both transmission infrastructure and small generation fleets — assets that would work to electrify the continent while providing good jobs, better medical care and food security.

“More renewables investment flowing to sub-Saharan African countries than ever before is a testament to how cheaper technology, investor familiarity and subsidy schemes are helping clean energy spread across the continent,” says BloombergNEF. “Developers having access to guarantees and hard currency lowers barriers to investment, but risk perceptions are such that access to local financing for large-scale renewables remains a distant prospect.”

Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is modest. But the region needs to attract investment — billions of dollars. While the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions have been the primary source of capital, newer financing models are in the offing — much like PG4’s concept of forming partnerships among business, government and civil society. In all cases, the goal is to bring power and prosperity to the continent and to do so in a sustainable way.","CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA - APRIL 20: Isaac Molelelu and Thabisa Siyokwana, installs and checks solar ...

33,https://thefinancialbrand.com/92859/marketing-strategies-fintech-bank-partnerships-data/,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Financial Brand,Essential Marketing Strategies for Fintech-Bank Partnerships,"In an effort to compete more effectively and meet changing consumer demands, many banks and credit unions are exploring partnerships with fintech companies, other organizations — including, in a few cases, even big technology firms — to deliver better value to their customers.

The emergence of new partnerships is customer-driven, not technology-driven. It is caused by customers seeking new experiences, rewards, transparency, and choice from their banking providers. Partnerships can extend products and platforms into new markets, expose brands to new customer segments and create scale.

Partnering has been a component of banking for many years under various guises including co-branded credit card programs. But partnering has taken on a new urgency in the digital age as a means for traditional financial institutions to more quickly upgrade their capabilities, enabling them to provide a more robust set of products and services that Millennials and even older consumers now expect.

The partnership structures being created today shift the relationships between the participants from competitors to collaborators. Change like that requires financial institutions to relinquish old ways of operating and establish new practices. An important part of this change, is that both sides will need to rethink and effectively integrate marketing, sales and service activities to achieve their common goals and meet customer expectations.

Successful growth of partnerships with fintechs or others will focus on delivering value to the customer. This is where a new coupling of marketing capabilities will come into play. This should create meaningful synergies for each partner and more importantly a completely new customer experience — an experience they are expecting.

Big Tech Partners and Ecosystems

The new model of partnering is not only with fintechs that are increasingly willing to work with financial institutions or other more traditional players. Already we have seen partnerships between traditional institutions and big technology companies. The announcement of the partnership between Google, Citibank and Stanford Federal Credit Union in November of 2019 — and which may include other financial institutions — is a notable example.

Such partnerships raise many questions for banks and credit unions. But one thing is known: In the face of rising consumer expectations for a flexible, intuitive and personalized service across many platforms, there will be a disaggregation of manufacturing the products and the ownership of the customer relationship. When that happens who owns the customer?

From shopping for services to originating the account to servicing the relationship, there are important experiences that financial institutions want to shape and deliver. Clearly such banking/technology combinations create both challenges and opportunities for the banking industry.

Another new development is the non-traditional network of alternative financial services providers working together in an ecosystem to compete with incumbent banks and credit unions. As these niche providers continue to mature and become more reliable, we can expect to see them creating bi- or multi-lateral partnerships.

Five Ways to Reimagine Marketing for Partnerships

Given the fast changes taking place in banking, partnerships need to redesign their marketing programs in a way that can deliver more value to consumers and improve the partners’ financial success. By doing so, the partnerships can begin to realize their full potential.

We have found that even in the best circumstances partners are missing opportunities to create better engagement with customers. Navigating the transformation that is required by changing consumer behaviors and the complex marketing and media environment is difficult. Our recommendation is for banks and credit unions to engage with their partners — whether fintechs or more traditional players — to address challenges all are facing. Now is the time to build a response to future risk and take advantage of the opportunities that exist.

Reinventing the marketing function within partnerships will support the delivery of next-generation services that enable and engender loyalty. Although marketing and CRM capabilities exist within single companies, not many financial institution partnerships have established a joint structure that is customer-driven and takes full advantage of the partnership’s potential.

While our views on proposed changes are heavily dependent on technology, this is not a technology project. The five recommendations below are about how financial institutions that work together can offer services that demonstrate they are listening to, understand, and communicate with consumers in a unique way.

1. Customer Information Exchange. Exchanging information is a critical component to a successful collaborative marketing strategy and is also dependent on managing privacy constraints. This entails acquiring and continuously updating knowledge of customers’ needs, motivations, and behaviors over the lifetime of the relationship. Consolidating customer databases can be very complex and requires the ability to create unique customer ID and matching algorithms to create the single view of the customer across all data points.

2. Establishing Customer Knowledge. It is critical to apply customer knowledge to continuously improve performance through learning from successes and failures. Creating loyalty in banking is becoming far more customer-centric, addressing pain points, creating improved experiences, and engaging the customer as an individual. Sharing data within partnership provides greater potential for the parties to make smarter suggestions and decisions that work for their customers.

The new approach to managing marketing and CRM functions will require a tighter collaboration between partners. This will change partnership agreements and require a more customer-focused view that drives value for both partners. This will be more than incremental changes. It will feel like a complete reinvention to many.

Collaborative marketing and CRM systems manage and synchronize customer interaction points and communication channels (telephone, direct mail, email, and digital). These efforts are often fragmented across partnerships and not well structured. Their performance is hampered by the limited knowledge of products, markets, and customers. Integration of these services should focus on a common goal that includes a focus on customer needs in order to generate maximum revenue and profit.

4. Data Privacy. Privacy constraints are a significant issue in partnerships where data is being shared. Because customers own their personal data, customer data is essentially bound to the institution or company that collects it and can only be used for the stated purposes. Therefore, it is important to have a declaration of data sharing in “general terms and conditions” to obtain permission to use data for each new purpose. Well-designed policies and procedures need to be implemented to ensure data is managed in a privacy-compliant and ethical manner.

5. Creating a Collaboration Strategy. Partners must establish a business strategy with a clear understanding and appreciation of each other’s objectives, strengths and competitive advantages. Many partnerships in banking do not establish a thoughtful strategy, but those that do this well benefit greatly from the leverage partnerships bring. Taking a partnership-first mindset requires financial institutions to rethink the way they do business and potentially to disrupt their traditional practices.

Now is the time for financial institutions to think creatively about existing or potential partnerships and to implement capabilities that have a customer focus that leverages data. This development will create more value in rewards and loyalty programs and make partnerships a much richer proposition.","Change like that requires financial institutions to relinquish old ways of operating and establish new practices.
Reinventing the marketing function within partnerships will support the delivery of next-generation services that enable and engender loyalty.
Although marketing and CRM capabilities exist within single companies, not many financial institution partnerships have established a joint structure that is customer-driven and takes full advantage of the partnership’s potential.
Because customers own their personal data, customer data is essentially bound to the institution or company that collects it and can only be used for the stated purposes.
Taking a partnership-first mindset requires financial institutions to rethink the way they do business and potentially to disrupt their traditional practices."

Hospices and hospitals are increasingly joining forces to provide goal concordant care, reduce costs and prevent readmissions, while supporting growth for the hospice.



While most people wish to live their final moments at home, nearly 700,000 deaths still occur in hospitals, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.



Hospitals often are interested in collaborating with hospice organizations to improve patient satisfaction and quality metrics, such as decreased mortality, hospital readmissions, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. An integrated model positions a health care system well for a transition to the reimbursement model of bundled payments and accountable care organizations (ACO), according to Brian Bell, M.D., vice president and chief medical officer of Arkansas Hospice in Little Rock, Ark.

Hospices and hospital systems for the most part have been building three types of collaborations, including independent contracts, extensive contracts and contracts or agreements to support the development of end-of-life services.



“Joining the house of medicine is important because people are still dying in hospitals,” Todd Cote, M.D., chief medical officer with Bluegrass Care Navigators in Lexington, Ky., told Hospice News. “Acute care hasn’t always done a great job in end-of-life (EOL) care and hospice care is a continuum of care in America that hospitals can benefit from.” According to Cote, there are three hospice/hospital collaboration strategies that have proven successful.



The most common contract of this type is the traditional independent contract with the hospital to support the general inpatient level of care within the hospital while strictly following the conditions of participation mandated by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the Medicare hospice benefit. Other kinds of independent contracts may involve a hospital-embedded hospice liaison to help patients transitioning out of acute care.

Extensive contracts for hospice and palliative care services within the hospital include inpatient hospice and/or palliative care units, small scale comfort suites, or palliative care consultation teams. While being within a health care system may be advantageous, often the hospice organization must develop a strategy to approach hospital administration.



Cote recommends hospice organizations begin with the health care system’s C-Suite and work to familiarize them with the Medicare hospice benefit if they are not already aware. He recommends entering the meeting ready to do the following:

Ask what they need when it comes to caring for end-of-life patients

Tell them you will let them know if you can help them and how – meet them on their terms, for hospitals, measurement is important. Let them know you can provide that.

Discuss ways that you can collaborate toward patient and family satisfaction.

Contracts or agreements to support the development of end-of-life services is often an important first step toward collaboration. Traditionally, end-of-life education programs have been an effective vehicle by which a hospice can contribute expertise. Other possibilities include membership on the hospital ethics committee and/or palliative care advisory committee, ongoing conversations with hospital case management, or provision assistance in the development of an advanced directive program within the hospital.



Nurse practitioner Jaqueline Fournier, with Androscoggin Home Health and Hospice in Lewiston, Maine, said that the partnership between palliative care and acute care hospitals can be paramount. From her vantage point, Fournier said that the benefits to hospitals seeking a partnership like this go beyond statistics into real patient satisfaction. She noted that some of the most important work her organization does is providing education to patients, families, and other providers. Some of the other services organizations like hers provide include:

Clarifying goals of care

Symptom management

Caring for the whole patient: working with pastoral care, social workers, therapy, nurses

Code status clarification

Completing advanced directives

Helping patients with provider orders for life-sustaining treatment

Education of patients, physicians, and health care teams

“There are a lot of misunderstandings out there. We may not get provider referrals or a patient or their family may not understand palliative care,” she said. “We need to break through these barriers with a true partnership and education for the patients and their families. We advocate for the patients and work to get them where they need to be.”



Cote echoed that there are sometimes barriers to true collaboration. “The larger the hospice, the more financial mobility,” he said. “Smaller hospices don’t always have that. Hiring a dedicated team to be embedded inside a hospital can be costly, however, those costs can sometimes be negotiated and split with the hospital system.”

Cote explained that it can sometimes be difficult for hospices to increase staff due to nursing shortages and nurses that are hired need to understand how to work well within a hospital hierarchy. Another barrier can be changes in hospital administration. “You may have a champion in the hospital that moves on and leaves you starting over with an administration that isn’t as willing to collaborate with your organization,” said Cote.



In the end, relationship building and quality patient care are key.

“Some patients can’t leave hospitals because of fragility of health or financial concerns,” said Cote. “While some hospitals are concerned with things like mortality rates, that should not be the primary motivator for this type of collaboration. Quality care and family satisfaction at the end of the patient’s life should be.”

Photo by: © UN-Habitat / Julius Mwelu

BARCELONA — The Global Resilient Cities Network was announced Tuesday at the 10th session of the World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, after months of negotiations.

The network is an evolution of 100 Resilient Cities after The Rockefeller Foundation made the decision to stop funding for the program. Chief resilience officers — high-level advisors appointed by a city’s mayor, and partially paid by the 100 Resilient Cities program — have been involved in the design of the network, which will take a fundamentally different approach to partnerships.

“Make no mistake, 100 Resilient Cities, as a program, is closed but this new organization carries on its legacy by continuing the work with cities and between cities,” said Lauren Sorkin, acting executive director with the Global Resilient Cities Network, speaking at the event.

With unprecedented urbanization and a global climate crisis, networks that enable collaboration and inclusion at scale are more critical now than ever, Sorkin said. The organization will leverage the tools and expertise of its membership team and former 100RC experts to support its global community of practitioners and drive urban resilience action to protect vulnerable communities from climate change.

While maintaining the “closely knit alliance” of cities and chief resilience officers, the organization is looking to welcome 10 new member cities by the end of 2020. Cities from across all regions have expressed an interest in joining the network as they look for ways to address the global challenges they are facing.

UNDP fielding 'complex asks' from cities on environment, policy director says (Pro) Broader partnerships will be required as cities grapple with climate change and urbanization, according to Haoliang Xu, U.N. assistant secretary-general and director of UNDP's Bureau for Policy and Programme Support.

“As complex systems, cities need to anchor their future through the transformative power of resilience planning,” Sorkin said. The network will continue with the current model which provides funding to cover the first two years of the chief resilience officers’ salary but cities are being encouraged to come with their own funding and partnerships.

The organization is also looking to develop strategic partnerships where there is a common interest from members and a partner willing to help deliver projects on the ground.

“We’ve been ... looking at the demand and then curating thematic action areas and partnerships around them,” Sorkin told Devex after the announcement.

The multiyear partnership with Visa is an example of this new approach. The financial corporation is supporting an initiative on urban mobility and the role of digital payments and technology in streamlining urban transport in Latin America. Several other partners, including the World Resources Institute, The Circulate Initiative, and the Ocean Conservancy, are already on board and will provide funding, knowledge or implementation support to the network.

Piero Pelizzaro, chief resilience officer for the City of Milan, also spoke of the critical role of partnerships as the organization moves into the implementation phase and looks to scale its impact. This can only be achieved by working with a range of different partners, including the private sector, he explained, and collaborating not just on funding but also on technical aspects of urban resilience solutions.

Sorkin gave no indication of the organization’s budget going forward but said that no one funder can determine the future of the network as it belongs to its member cities. The Rockefeller Foundation did provide a “seed grant” to support the transition of the network and there is already a “pipeline of partnerships that will allow us to continue this work for at least five years.”

The organization will not be as large as the former program though, she added. A newly established global steering committee, that has two representatives from each region, will weigh in on decisions about the direction of the organization, meanwhile, working groups will co-design new projects, thematic partnerships, and tools for knowledge dissemination. Current priority areas are around resilience infrastructure, nature-based solutions, water and sanitation, and circular economy.

If we work in silos in trying to address issues — such as fires, floods, and disease — then we don’t have a chance, Sorkin said, so the network is designed to facilitate mass collaboration. There will be a renewed focus on doing this in a results-driven way and chief resilience officers will set targets and hold each other accountable.

“We're at a time where we need to be able to show results for our communities ... and also communicate that work at a scale that responds to the urgency of our global goals, Sorkin said.

The Alliance was one of several new or expanded initiatives announced at a press conference at the offices of the Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness Thursday.

“We are excited about the progress of this collective effort as we work towards a Dane County where Black infants are born healthy. The investments we share today are powerful steps in the right direction, and will continue to center around the voices and needs of Black women and their families” said Lisa-Peyton Caire, founding CEO and President of the Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness, in a statement.

The mission of the Black Maternal and Child Health Alliance (BMCHA) is to work to transform birth outcomes in Dane County by identifying, informing and advancing strategies and approaches that improve reproductive, maternal and newborn health of Dane County’s African American population.

A roundtable discussion with the BMCHA and the Dane County Health Council is scheduled for April ,where key stakeholders will identify priorities and goals. The first annual Wisconsin Black Maternal & Child Health Summit is scheduled for 2021.

The BMCHA has also committed up to $25,000 per year to train and hire more doulas to assist in Black maternity and infant care.

“Investments in the expansion in the Black doula system is an imperative in combating racial disparities,” said Tia Murray of Harambe Village, the local organization that trains and coordinates doulas in Dane and Milwaukee Counties.

Babies born to African-American mothers in Dane County are two times more likely than white infants to be born with low birth weights, a fact which puts them at risk of significant health challenges and higher infant-mortality rates, but assitance from a doula can dramatically reduce those disparities.

“Infant health is a true measure of a community, a county, a state. We can do better by investing in doulas as a starting point. We aren’t the whole solution but we are part of the solution,” Murray said. “It will create a ripple effect across the social and ecological spectrum, if done in collaboration with those closest to the issue.”

Peyton-Caire said a primary concern of the Alliance will be outreach — through low-tech means.’

“A big part of our engine is our community-based neighborhood relationships,” she said. “A lot of people ask how we’re able to get Black women to come out to events. That’s not just through technology. It’s through word of mouth, it’s from relationships, through churches, it’s from community centers. Building up that complex web of communication and information dissemination is part of what we’re constructing together, which is new.”

Another new initiative announced Thursday is the Care Coordination project, funded through a $1 million Wisconsin Partnership Program grant. It is a collaboration with Epic Systems to develop a technology system that will identify needs during prenatal appointments and connect families with agencies that can provide resources like stable housing, employment and child care assistance.

Peyton-Caire also announced the hiring of Ariel Robbins to coordinate the project.

Dane County Health Council is a coalition of health care providers, government and non-profits with a mission to eliminate gaps and barriers to optimal health and reduce disparities in health outcomes in Dane County.

Council members include: Access Community Health Centers, Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin, Madison Metropolitan School District, Public Health Madison & Dane County, SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital, United Way of Dane County, UnityPoint Health-Meriter, and UW Health.

In 2018, The Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness and EQT by Design led a nine-month long collective community engagement effort in partnership with the Health Council to identify sustainable solutions to low birthweight babies born to African-American mothers in Dane County. They announced their findings in an April 2019 report.","A new Black Maternal and Child Health Alliance will coordinate resources to support the health of Black mothers, infants and families.

The projects funded by Qatar being were valued at $12 million, while the projects implemented by Qatar Charity, with the funding from international organizations were estimated at more than $4 million.

Cooperation Agreements

Qatar Charity has signed 11 cooperation agreements with international organizations and United Nations agencies to fund several international projects, including six cooperation agreements with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

The agreements came to support the rehabilitation of long-term accommodation centers for internally displaced people (IDP) in Iraq, contribute to providing basic assistance to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, help internally displaced returnee families in Yemen, provide drinking water, improve the standards of living of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and extend multipurpose cash assistance to internally displaced Iraqi families.

Qatar Charity has also signed two cooperation agreements with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to fund comprehensive relief projects in Malawi in response to the Cyclone Idai, as well as, to improve access to health care services for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.

Qatar Charity has also signed an agreement with the World Food Program (WFP) to implement a child and women nutrition project in two provinces of Yemen, which was jointly funded by the Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) and Qatar Charity. It has also signed two memorandums of understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

UN Agencies

The value of funding international organizations by Qatar Charity amounted to more than $4 million in 2019 to implement relief projects in Turkey, Niger, Pakistan and Somalia. These international organizations include the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the START NETWORK.

Qatar Charity has implemented several projects funded by FAO, WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR, and other international organizations.

Strategic Cooperation

It is worth noting that Qatar Charity’s cooperation with UN and international organizations started as of 1997, and it enhanced this collaboration by signing 77 cooperation agreements in many fields over the past 22 years, with a total value exceeding 76 million US dollars.

These agreements included strategic cooperation and collaboration in various fields of humanitarian and development work, such as relief, resettlement of the displaced, livelihoods, water, sanitation, logistic cooperation, food, agriculture, food security, health, social welfare, exchange of experts, and resource mobilization.

Many countries including Palestine, Somalia, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan, Yemen, Niger, Syria, and Bangladesh, benefited from these projects implemented under this cooperation.

The partnership between UNHCR and Qatar Charity has witnessed the signing of the largest number of agreements, as Qatar Charity has signed 32 cooperation and partnership pacts with UNHCR to finance humanitarian projects for the benefit of the displaced and refugees.

The QC4HCR, a collaborative initiative, is one of the most significant agreements, which was signed in 2018 to co-ordinate partnership and co-operation between Qatar Charity and UNHCR to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian action with a view to achieving their common humanitarian goals.

This cooperation included several projects for the displaced and refugees in Iraq and Yemen, in addition to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.","The cooperation and partnership agreements signed during 2019 between Qatar Charity, international humanitarian organizations, and the United Nations agencies amounted to more than 60 million Qatari riyals.

The Cardano delegation, which included the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo, said that several partnerships and collaborations are currently in the works, with many more letters of intent and contacts made along the way.

The Cardano delegation reaps huge success at the World Economic Forum

As part of its effort to commercialize Cardano, the Cardano Foundation has been knee-deep in promoting the ambitious blockchain project at its biggest stage yet—the World Economic Forum at Davos.

This year saw the largest Cardano delegation ever—IOHK, EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation all participated in the forum. According to Bakyt Azimkanov, the director of PR and communication at the Cardano Foundation, the visit was extremely successful.

In a video update posted on the foundation’s YouTube channel, Azimkanov said that the 10- strong delegation had the opportunity to exchange ideas and share insights at one of the most important gatherings on the planet.

The delegation met with leading academics, top executives, and politicians from all around the world, participating in multiple roundtables. Both Nathan Kaiser, a chairman at the Cardano Foundation, and Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, spoke of the evolution and future of fintech, discussing everything from financial markets to concrete solutions for security token exchanges.

Significant partnerships in the works for Cardano

However, the Cardano delegation wasn’t all talk. Significant and meaningful results were seen even before the forum officially ended, Azimkanov said. The meetings the delegation held throughout the duration of the event resulted in letters of intent, collaborations, and agreements.

The project’s strong science background and research-first approach made the delegation an important contributor to academic roundtables. At one of those roundtables, which were attended by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, the meeting resulted in the approval of a research grant request from Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center to study blockchain governance.

While Azimkanov didn’t reveal details about all the letters of intent the delegation received, he announced several new partnerships with concrete goals. A collaboration has been established with DUST Identity, a tech company focused on developing diamond dust identification technology, which will lead to greater transparency and accountability for global organizations, he said.

The delegation also established a relationship with Finka, a Swiss-based non-profit organization, to apply blockchain technology to cattle farming and make cattle a viable asset class.

LO3 Energy, a US-based provider of local energy solutions platform, could be one of Cardano’s launch partners for Goguen, the smart-contract era of the blockchain. The following months could also see Cardano Connector being developed. According to a blog post from Cardano, the blockchain-enabled product and authenticity tool will be an integration of ScanTrust’s Proof-of-Concept.

When it comes to ADA issuance, Cardano is set to work alongside GenTwo to bring ADA-denominated structured finance products to the market.

This article, the third in a four-part series, examines China’s continental ambitions in Africa and their impact on militarisation, infrastructure, technology, and governance models.

Part one of the series focused on the strategic logic of China’s western expansion, the growth of security ties with Bangladesh, and new China-brokered integration platforms linking Bangladesh with Southeast Asia. Part two turned to the impact of Beijing’s ‘march West’ strategy on the regional security architecture in Pakistan and Central Asia.

Part Three: Concerns of a New Cold War

Africa is geographically, culturally, and politically divided into numerous sub-regions. The idea of an ‘African’ region can be challenging to establish beyond abstract ideas of shared post-colonial experience. Within the structures and concepts of international strategy, however, Africa is treated as a coherent object of relationship-building. China’s security strategy is no exception. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), inaugurated in 2006, and China-Africa Defense and Security Forum, first hosted in Beijing in 2019, both take a continental approach to security that mimics the logic of the region’s dominant intergovernmental organisation, the African Union (AU).

China’s profile in Africa has grown steadily with time. Support for United Nations (UN) peacekeeping includes a standby force totalling 8,000 personnel as well as permanent police squads. According to June 2019 data, roughly 2,000 personnel actively serve in UN peacekeeping missions in DR Congo, Mali, Sudan, South Sudan, and Western Sahara. A new military base adjacent to the Port of Doraleh, Djibouti was officially opened in August 2017, extending the reach of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces beyond UN command. Announced missions undertaken by Djibouti-stationed PLA forces include counterpiracy, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and peacekeeping; also, the base appears capable of supporting other deterrence operations and holding strategic economic corridors. Construction on a new pier capable of berthing at least four ships began in June 2018.

Beijing’s increased military presence in Africa has elicited observations that a new cold war may be developing on the continent as well. United States concerns over the growing influence financial and political influence of both China and Russia led in early 2019 to the drafting of a “New Africa Strategy” by security advisors. Rumours also persist that China is constructing new bases and military installations in other African countries. In 2018, Spotlight Zimbabwe reported that China was installing HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) in the country, identical to those deployed on Woody Island in the South China Sea. In 2019, Spotlight Zimbabwe published further unconfirmed details concerning the deployment of PLA special forces and construction of an underground military base to protect mines and other economic interests.

The expanding BeiDou Navigation Satellite (BDS) system increasingly covers Africa through the China-Arab States BDS/GNNS Centre, established in Tunis in 2018, as well as bilateral cooperation mechanisms such as technical assistance and training. From the perspective of China’s leaders and foreign affairs commentators, building a military presence and “external security system” is an essential extension of national goals to project power globally, particularly in those regions where PRC citizens work and live. According to Brookings, China’s investment-, trade-, and culture-based soft power have already enhanced soft power in North Africa, while its policy of noninterference in other countries’ affairs has so far enhanced local perceptions that China’s power, as opposed to that of the U.S., is predominantly non-coercive. However, a December 2019 Pew Research poll on perceptions of China in Africa and MENA shows that opinion can vary widely by country depending on national wealth, while views of China’s economic growth as beneficial are also mixed with suspicion toward investment and military growth.

China’s African Interests

China’s interests in Africa are varied but primarily focused on resources. Africa is vital to China’s oil supply. After Russia and Saudia Arabia, Angola is the third-largest source of imported crude, with Congo the twelfth-largest. Libya (first), and Congo (fourth) are among China’s fastest-growing suppliers. The Sub-Saharan region is among those with the highest likelihood of undiscovered resources in the world.

Africa also figures into China’s plans to feed its population by buying and leasing agricultural land in developing nations. Considerable confusion exists surrounding the scale and location of land acquisition, as well as its efficacy in supplying domestic markets. China’s impact on African agriculture can be most clearly seen in the establishment, by 2016, of a network of twenty-three Chinese Agricultural Technology Development Centres run by Chinese companies across the continent. Other investment and informal migrant labour also contribute to exports, as well as to feeding China’s growing diasporic population within Africa.

China’s One Belt, One Road (BRI) strategy treats Africa as a critical market for overseas investment and technology. Whereas the US and the European Union are investment leaders, China is the continent’s trade leader. The estimated value of China’s African investments and construction contracts in the Sub-Saharan region between 2005 and 2019 is approximately $300 billion USD, with another $190 billion flowing into North Africa and the Arab Middle East. Also, China has become Sub-Saharan Africa’s top supplier of weapons. Telecommunications and e-commerce represent additional frontiers for economic expansion, with national champion Huawei offering new ICT training in Uganda and South Africa.

Advancing China’s Pan-African Security Concept

China’s comprehensive, pan-African security approach corresponds to the geographic diversity of its interests. Multilateral engagement with Africa across multiple levels, including security deals, centres on FOCAC and related mechanisms, such as the China-Africa Joint Business Council, China-Africa Business Council, and successive action plans. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, pan-African security commitments have formally increased through the China-Africa Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, a “systematic, pan-African approach to security on the continent” through which China exports military and technical expertise as a partner to the AU.

In 2015, Xi announced that $100 million in aid would be transferred to the AU over 5 years; a 2017 update to this announcement indicated that the funding would be used for the development of an African Standby Force and rapid-response force.

Public statements by official representatives emphasise China’s contributions to the peacekeeping mission of the UN and the development of African force capacity. Other evidence suggests a far more expansive concept of security. The PLA’s Djibouti base has provided opportunities for live-fire exercises and has become a centre for joint activities with non-African countries. PLA Navy anti-piracy escort mission has visited several African ports. The inaugural China-Africa Defense and Security Forum, held in mid-2018, has spurred predictions that China seeks to build a new regional security platform, as well as boost arms sales. Superficially, such developments signal militarization and the possibility of future Chinese engagement in African conflicts. However, their immediate impact may be minimized due to the low quality of equipment and training that China provides, which still falls short of African countries’ military needs.

The FOCAC Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021), also announced in 2018, includes numerous security-related provisions, including use of ICT and China-built “smart cities,” counter-terrorism, policing, food security, maritime security, cybersecurity, energy security, and “operationalization of the African Peace and Security Architecture” in areas ranging from governance to fighting piracy. China has also pledged support for anti-corruption training, intelligence sharing, and police cooperation.

The effect of these efforts is to position China as a pan-African security provider at both the continental and national levels, with strong political and commercial interests underpinning a growing network of military relationships. The PRC government’s official spokespeople refer to strengthening the “China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership” as a key goal of China’s relations with African states – a phrase that accompanied the launching of the Ministry of Defense-hosted China-Africa Peace and Security Forum in July 2019.

Representatives of 50 African countries and the African Union attended the event, which focused on potential areas of cooperation such as bilateral peace and security, regional maritime security, and militaries as peacekeepers. China’s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, was reportedly busy on the sidelines meeting with counterparts from African countries according to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) news outlet Xinhua. Official CCP sources have also portrayed African leaders as accepting of China’s “active role” as a participant in peace and stability operations in the Horn of Africa region.

From Strategic Interests to Strategic Hub

China’s impact on Africa’s security architecture goes beyond military and peacekeeping dimensions. China Merchants Port Holdings has seen considerable growth in Lomé Container Terminal operations in Togo; the company is also in negotiations to invest in a new port project in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. China Communications Construction Company berth construction in Kenya’s Lamu Port represents another instance of transportation integration. Port investments reflect China’s demonstrable potential for establishing linkages between infrastructure and force mobility, including in West Africa.

In Cameroon, China has cancelled approximately $80 million USD in debt as a goodwill gesture, further solidifying relations with a country that represents a critical foothold around the strategically important Gulf of Guinea. Senegal, Mali, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso have all increased ties with China in recent years. Connecting these disparate investment projects would impact regional geopolitics by creating overland links between the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, or Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean.

West Africa increasingly figures into China’s strategic vision marks a departure from more traditional PLA peacekeeping in the Horn of Africa to the east. Construction projects in Cameroon include roads, dams, hydroelectric facilities, and expansion of the Kribi deepwater port. China engages in defence cooperation and training with Equatorial Guinea on a bilateral basis. Senegal, currently co-chair of FOCAC, support China “One Belt, One Road” initiative, while China has pledged support in the areas of counter-terrorism and social stability.

China’s grand strategy toward Africa, however, remains consistently pan-African. Libya is among the top destinations of China’s African investments. Digital connections between China and the Arab world are being expanded to connect with the African continent. China has established a Beidou navigation satellite system centre in Tunisia meant to foster cooperation with both the Arab and African Middle East. In South Africa, China has become an astronomy partner in agreements linked to the Square Kilometre Array. The militarization of these widespread partnerships is another notable facet of China’s engagement.

Of 46 Sub-Saharan African ports with financial, construction, or operational involvement by Chinese entities, at least six were visited by Chinese military vessels or are dual-use military-civil ports. Seven ports operated by Chinese entities are located on Africa’s western coast, raising the potential for military power projection into the Atlantic Ocean.

China’s Regime Security Paradigm

The militarization of the South China Sea has driven analysts to conclude that the fullest expression of China’s global influence will be a network of military bases linking Hainan with Djibouti as part of a seamless whole. From this perspective, Africa represents the western edge of a continuous process of expansion. Djibouti aside, however, militarization has not yet arrived, and a multipolar struggle between China, Europe, the United States, and now Russia for security partnerships on the continent continues.

Because Africa, unlike Southeast Asia, is more of a distant laboratory for China’s great power ambitions rather than a true litmus test, China-Africa security relations have proceeded according to a “regime security” paradigm by which China wins access to resources and investment fields in exchange for support for governance by African parties and leaders. This long-term support plan undoubtedly has a military dimension. China’s military leaders have expressed ambitious plans to become providers of world peace and stability in concert with Russia.

In the more immediate term, China’s regime-centred security focus in Africa is buttressed by mechanisms of authoritarian state capacity building. The China International Press Communication Center (CIPCC) provides training for African journalists which is based on China’s own domestic opinion guidance experience. Chinese ICT champion Huawei’s Africa programs, coupled with Beidou satellite cooperation, offer governments the option of increased control over their information and control environments. While more traditional mediation efforts spearheaded by China have largely failed, China is instead exporting political technologies and advising derived from Xi Jinping’s ruling party governance model.

There is no guarantee that countries whose governance systems incorporate China-derived elements will favour China in their foreign policy. China’s infrastructure investments may offer political and logistical network advantages, but China’s presence in Africa has yet to create exclusive zones of influence. Public blowback against debt-financed infrastructure projects, Chinese MNC and diasporic advantages within foreign economies (often linked to state backing), technology-aided repression, and allegations of spying and other instances of internal interference may drive African leaders into more conflictual relationships with China.

Likewise, China’s Africa ambitions in the military-security realm may be unexpectedly curtailed by the return of new state actors and private security forces to the continent. Such developments will also have an impact on Africa’s security environment, though not necessarily one that promotes stability. Security ties and defence-related lending may increase. Still, Africa’s long history of regionalism and independence-focused political movements suggests that China’s pan-African vision will require a more localised and nuanced approach to gain new adherents.","China’s security strategy is no exception.

In recent years, the aviation industry has been increasingly investing in transforming its operational model for the benefit of its stakeholders and customers alike. To celebrate this, FTE has launched the FTE Innovate Awards, which will recognise and celebrate the best air transport industry innovations from across the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The finalists will pitch onstage during FTE EMEA 2020 (3-4 June, Dublin) and the winners will be announced during the Closing Party.

This week, FTE spoke to Amy Burr, Managing Director, Operations and Partnerships, JetBlue Technology Ventures (JTV) & FTE Innovate Awards judge, who shared tips and advice for airports, airlines, vendors and startups as they prepare their awards entries.

FTE: As one of the judges for the FTE Innovate Awards, what are you looking for among the entries?

Amy Burr: “I’m looking for ideas that seek to solve common, real-world problems in travel — there are many niche opportunities for improving the industry, but entrants should be considering the bigger picture. I would love to see an idea that touches multiple parts of the travel ribbon: if an entry is able to connect currently disjointed pieces of the travel experience and offers benefits to not just their category, but others as well, that would be a game-changer.”

What criteria will you use to judge innovation?

“The companies should present solutions that are creative, yet feasible given current industry infrastructure and regulations. An idea may work really well for a specific airport or airline, but it’d be great to take it one step further and scale that idea across multiple locations and providers.

For startups specifically, their idea should encompass technology that can be easily integrated into a potential operating company, and I’d like to see a well-thought-out business plan for that integration. Even if an entry isn’t necessarily ready to trial their product at this level yet, it would be beneficial for them to have an operations strategy and potential process already in place for when they do reach that stage.”

What advice would you give companies and individuals who are thinking of entering the awards?

“You can never get too much practice! For people who are debating on whether or not to enter this competition, my advice is to do it for the sole purpose of practicing your elevator pitch. It’s a great opportunity to receive feedback, brand exposure, and network with like-minded individuals in the industry.

One thing in particular – your presentation should clearly state the problem you’ve addressed, and how your innovation solves it. It’s especially helpful for judges to see quantitative data that supports your project’s impact. For startups in particular, it’s important to lay out the company business plan or financial model.”

What steps do you feel airports and airlines should take to spearhead innovation?

“One of our key goals at JetBlue Technology Ventures is to encourage and support JetBlue and its ecosystem of partners to continue to trial new types of innovation as effectively as possible. Large corporations can often get caught up in the idea of formalised contracts and locking in business partners, losing sight of the ‘art of the possible’. Great improvement and innovation comes from trial and error and having a proof of concept process for new technology allows the travel industry to think outside the box.

JTV also launched an international partnership programme which includes peers like Air New Zealand and Vantage Airport Group. Innovation can happen more quickly and impactfully when different industry stakeholders work together to improve efficiencies in shared infrastructure and processes.”

Can you share some of the initiatives you are undertaking to drive innovation within JetBlue?

“To help drive innovation within JetBlue, JTV organises educational events to conduct a deep dive on trending topics in the industry and connect with important stakeholders in the space. These events include both JetBlue Crewmembers (employees) as well as external topic experts and practitioners. Our goal is to understand the most pressing business opportunities. We also run 12-week “Innovation Sprints” with different workgroups at JetBlue to expose our colleagues to startups that might suit their business needs and be solutions to challenges they’re currently facing. It is our way of helping JetBlue workgroups understand what the future of their sector looks like. We do all this as well for our many partners, ultimately helping connect them to new and relevant startups like we do for JetBlue Airways.”

Amy Burr will judge the FTE Innovate Awards alongside Satyaki Raghunath, Chief Strategy & Development Officer, Bengaluru International Airport; Rohit Talwar, CEO, Fast Future; and Bert van der Stege, Head of Commercial, Swoop.","To celebrate this, FTE has launched the FTE Innovate Awards, which will recognise and celebrate the best air transport industry innovations from across the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.

42,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-revival-of-general-partnerships-in-the-age-of-tokenomics-part-2,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Cointelegraph,"The Revival of General Partnerships in the Age of Tokenomics, Part 2","What should be written in a partnership agreement, and how should a general partnership be run? How can an agreement be concluded remotely using the blockchain? Four business models to manage cryptocurrency and cash flows are outlined below.

Relations between partners

To draft a partnership agreement, partners should identify themselves, their shares and membership interests. They need to define the project and its goals as well as key tasks. Furthermore, attaching the business plan, presentations, and technical requirements or specifications for the project are also a necessary part of this step.

An important decision is determining whether all or several partners are going to act on behalf of the general partnership, or if a managing partner will be assigned. Whether alternatively or additionally, partners may wish to hire a CEO. A legal entity can also be the managing representative.

If the agreement does not specify such, all partners may act on behalf of the general partnership independently, thus being able to acquire new rights and duties for the general partnership. The managing partner(s) may be restricted to certain rules and conditions, such as which transaction amounts require a collective decision, the size of a deal that the managing partner can enter on behalf of the general partnership at his or her sole discretion, and so on. For instance, the managing partner may not close supply contracts for over $10,000 without the consent of the other partners.

As mentioned in the first article of this series, a general partnership can act as a business entity. However, many people are unaware of them, which can cause some issues when dealing with external counterparties.

Therefore, I recommend finding a friendly legal entity in order to present your project to other business entities and individuals. In the beginning, partners may choose a trustworthy company that serves as an authorized representative of the general partnership with the right to enter into agreements with third parties for the convenience of the general partnership. Such relations are governed by an agency agreement between the general partnership (the appointor) and the legal entity (the authorized representative).

In my case, my partners and I decided the following: I was chosen to be a managing partner and had the right to conduct business relations with other entities in the market.

All deals of more than $30,000 had to be approved by a remote simple majority voting of partners. In order for partners to communicate with each other, we created a channel on Telegram messenger and agreed that all discussion within that chat is legally binding on the partners — one of whom is a legal entity.

This entity represents our business project in deals with external counterparties, and has a written agent agreement and power of attorney for situations in which the legal entity must confirm its authorization. The agent acts on behalf of our general partnership (the appointor), and all acquired assets belong to the general partnership, including money, intellectual rights and other properties. By doing so, we were able to solve bank-related issues. The authorized representative as a legal entity had a bank account, so the partnership could send or receive money through this agent.

At the same time, this is not the only possible model. The following chart represents other types of interactions between partners, clients and agents.

Business models with fiat and crypto

In reality, all types of relations can be developed based on specific financial flows. The diagram above consists of four figures which may be applied solely or in combination with each other:

Model 1. An individual as the managing partner

An individual can manage the project, but there is almost no possibility that the individual will be able to open a bank account for entrepreneurial activities. From a financial point of view, such a partner will only be able to work with cryptocurrency. This method can be used as a single financial tool only in the case when all revenue is generated in cryptocurrency. Otherwise, one needs to combine it with other solutions and methods.

The managing partner distributes cryptocurrency profits between the partners, while they have to declare it and pay taxes in accordance with the legislation of their residency.

Model 2. An agent company owned by partners

Partners incorporate a legal entity — for example, a limited liability company, or LLC — that will act as an agent of the general partnership.

In this case, a general partnership is not needed. However, one could prove useful as an additional element of the model, when a general partnership works with cryptocurrencies and its partners do not want to show it in the accounts of the legal entity.

Furthermore, partners of a company dealing with crypto will face problems in many countries, as banks are likely to refuse dealing with tokens and cryptocurrencies. Hence why combining this model with Model 1 is inevitable in such cases.

Model 3. An agent company co-owned with a local partner

Partners incorporate their company, which includes all members of the general partnership plus their local partner, in one chosen jurisdiction. Let’s call it a regional representative model. Such a legal entity will work with the general partnership on the basis of an agent agreement. This is a great choice if partners need to create a local presence for their business. The local partner will be the head of the company and develop the business in the designated area. It also solves all financial problems, as the company can now open bank accounts and distribute profit among its partners.

Model 4. Independent agent

A legal entity or an individual entrepreneur appointed as an agent of the general partnership. This option is also useful, because both the legal entity and individual entrepreneur can open a business account in a bank to receive payments from clients. According to the agent agreement, agents in such cases receive company revenue that they are authorized to use to pay off current expenses and debts on behalf of the general partnership. Agents take a fee from this money for their services, and eventually distribute the rest among partners.

How to sign a partnership agreement using blockchain technology

This is an alternative manner of establishing a business partnership, as there are many different ways to enter into such an agreement. In our case, all partners were located in different countries and it was difficult to meet each other in one location.

We decided to use modern technology. In fact, we drafted the text of the agreement on an electronic form. We wrote the cryptocurrency addresses of each partner, indicating that the agreement will become effective when each partner publishes the hash sum (checksum) of the agreement file in the blockchain from the mentioned addresses.

We decided to use the Emercoin blockchain and the “carousel” method for contract signing: The first signatory creates an NVS record (short for Name-Value storage, a kind of token in Emercoin) with the hash sum of the contract, and sends it to the next signatory. The record needs to be sent one-by-one to all the partners in the circle, and the contract becomes effective when the NVS returns to the wallet of the first signatory. Partners (and all viewers of the file) are able to verify addresses in the carousel. If they correspond with the announced addresses, the contract is considered duly signed by all parties. In our case, we use the same addresses to distribute profit.

Conclusions

Relationships between partners and managing partners are regulated by the partnership agreement (general partnership) in the chosen jurisdiction.

English common law is a better solution if partners are located in different countries.

The company’s CEO can be a third party. Partners may wish to authorize one among themselves to sign a contract with a CEO — otherwise, all partners must sign it.

The managing partner or a hired CEO is allowed to make decisions related to the project with a clearly defined maximum amount of the deal. However, all other decisions must be made collectively. Mutual consensus is also needed in the following cases: changing the list of partners, changing the number of investments, goals and key tasks of the project, and the share of each partner in investments, profit, voting power, and others.

Relations with an agent are governed by the agent agreement. When the agent is a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur, they may control the general partnership’s fiat money.

A general partnership may be useful when partners work with cryptocurrencies and tokens but local banks refuse to do so.

If partners make their decisions remotely, they should legitimize this condition in their agreement, for instance, by agreeing that all decisions made in their chat are legally binding. The project can be transformed into a legal entity at any given moment, e.g., when it becomes profitable.

The business model of a general partnership has both advantages and disadvantages — some people may think that it will not protect their interests, and it may not suit everyone’s needs. However, based on my own long-term experience in legal practice, I can say that there are no 100% safe legal instruments.

In conducting their business, partners may face a huge number of legal actions and courts, which require a significant amount of time and resources. And even then, one could come away with nothing after winning the case, because the debtor simply has no assets (they could sell them, re-register them in their grandmother’s name or simply disappear). Common sense dictates that the main issue is not the legal model, but trustworthiness of partners. One needs to remember the following: Reputation is the most important asset.

Nowadays, when information is distributed at the speed of light, a scammer can face serious consequences such as nobody wanting to deal with them after a couple of bad cases. And that’s why we need an agreement — not for court (although it can be used there), but as a guarantee of good behavior lest partners become bad actors and are not held accountable.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the importance of partnerships as follows: “Global health partnerships, networks and alliances, and initiatives have been established to raise visibility of an unmet need, support coordination, provide financial support to countries, and/or provide common platforms for working together by combining the relative strengths of different stakeholders including the public sector, private sector entities, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic foundations and academic institutions.”

Pfizer Upjohn (“Upjohn” thereafter) has established two important private-public partnerships via collaborations within the Emerging Markets to harness the power of an abundance of data to advance non-communicable disease (NCD) awareness, to improve integrated care, and to assure that the solutions for NCD care are piloted and achieved. First, the New York University Abu Dhabi and Upjohn launched a pioneering multi-sectoral partnership to drive advances in the management of non-communicable diseases.

The Devastation of Noncommunicable Diseases

This year, approximately 41 Million people will die from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and other chronic conditions collectively known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The leading cause of mortality and disability globally, an alarming 30% of NCD deaths are premature, occurring in people under the age of 70. The result is a devastating impact on patients, families, communities and global economies. Much of this mortality and disability is preventable. Yet, effective, sustainable intervention requires a groundswell of integrated action across multiple sectors - action on a level yet to be reached.

More than half of the NCD burden could be avoided through health promotion and prevention initiatives. In addition, modifiable behaviors, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and the harmful use of alcohol increase the risk of NCDs. These behaviors are, in part, a result of complex circumstances, including social and economic status, that impact a person’s health.

What action has been taken so far? The past seven years have witnessed an unprecedented global political commitment to NCD prevention and control, culminating in the inclusion of NCD targets in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, country targets have been issued to reduce global NCD-related mortality by 30% by 2030. While there has been significant progress and the reduction targets are on track to be achieved in more than 15% of countries, there is still much work ahead of us.

Upjohn recognizes the critical importance of healthcare partnerships to drive lasting progress in society. We believe that working together can achieve the greatest impact in public health. To effectively catalyze action around challenges of the scale and complexity of NCDs, we need greater collaboration across sectors of healthcare. Observation data are abundant but often siloed in Emerging Markets, such as Africa and the Middle East (AfME) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Therefore, it is important to find ways to harness real world data more effectively to generate actional real world evidence (RWE) and insights.

Partnership in AfME

The New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) and Upjohn have announced a pioneering new collaboration to bring the private sector and academia together to launch a Center of Excellence to harness RWD. The center will be based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and will contribute scientific insights that can impact patients locally, and across the region and world. This collaboration resonates strongly our commitment for long term investment with the government and for public-awareness of NCDs.

The NYUAD-Upjohn partnership includes two further initiatives. The first is the development of a capability-enhancement module to train local talent for evidence-generation, hence investing and training the next level of new local researchers. The second is the collaboration as one of the critical partners in the UAE Health Future study, one of the largest observational NCD-studies of its kind in the Middle East.","First, the New York University Abu Dhabi and Upjohn launched a pioneering multi-sectoral partnership to drive advances in the management of non-communicable diseases.

By Kris Wallace

In 2008, a small group of determined supporters set out to champion a critical neighbourhood resource: Mount Saint Joseph Hospital (MSJ). They found a like-minded partner in Scotiabank and launched the very first Scotiabank Feast of Fortune with an informal dinner at a local Chinese restaurant. The fledgling fundraisers brought in an impressive $90,000. This year, that same partnership raised more than $1 million.

Over the last 13 years, Scotiabank Feast of Fortune has grown into a formidable presence on Vancouver’s fundraising calendar – raising $7.7 million for an array of vital medical and surgical equipment at MSJ including a digital mammography machine, an echocardiography machine, a 3D ultrasound breast scanner, and a CT scanner.

Yet, even as the event grows and evolves, its hallmark remains people fundraising in the community, for the community.

Dick Vollet, President and CEO of St. Paul’s Foundation, praises the collaboration between the Foundation, Scotiabank, and its other community partners for the event’s longevity and success.

“St. Paul’s Foundation is proud to have fostered strong, longstanding connections with our attendees, volunteers, and sponsors.” Vollet points to Scotiabank as a prime example of the value partnerships can bring to the partners as well as the wider community.

Women’s health affects us all

This year, in keeping with that holistic community spirit, the fundraiser was dedicated to supporting women’s health across three critical portfolios: heart, breast, and maternity care. And for the first time, the proceeds will benefit patients at both MSJ and St. Paul’s Hospital.

Women’s cardiac health will get a significant boost with funding for Dr. Karen Humphries and her world-class research into how we diagnose, treat, and care for women at risk of heart disease.

The Maternity Centre at St. Paul’s will get new wireless fetal monitors so women can be more comfortable and more mobile during their labour.

And the Providence Breast Centre at MSJ will get a SPY-PHI imaging machine. This revolutionary device is used during post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. It has been likened to giving surgeons X-ray vision.

“We’re proud to support the largest breast reconstruction centre in the province; to care for the most complex, high-risk pregnancies in BC; and to transform women’s heart health with life-changing research,” says Dr. Janet Kow, Scotiabank Feast of Fortune 2020 Gala Committee Co-Chair and a geriatrician with Providence Health Care (PHC). “With the expanded scope of this year’s fundraising goals, our donors and sponsors have never had a greater impact – or helped more people.”

The company we keep

Scotiabank has partnered with St. Paul’s Foundation for the last 33 years, improving care for countless patients, residents, and caregivers right across PHC.

“Scotiabank is committed to supporting the communities in which we live and work. And this partnership truly fulfils that mandate,” says Lesly Tayles, Senior Vice President, BC & Yukon Region, Scotiabank.

46,https://sciencebusiness.net/news/eu-strengthen-green-energy-rd-partnerships-africa,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 11:21:35 GMT",Science Business,EU to strengthen green energy R&D partnerships with Africa,"The European Commission is actively seeking ways to collaborate with countries in Africa to develop and implement green energy technologies.

The aim is to “strengthen our international partnerships with Africa and work closely with the African Union countries on energy issues and the green transition,” said Ditte Juul-Jørgensen, director general for energy at the European Commission, speaking at a Science|Business conference on Monday.

Commission president Ursula von der Leyen kick-started her mandate in December with a visit to Ethiopia, underlining the EU’s geopolitical ambitions in Africa, where it hopes to collaborate on developing technologies needed for a transition to a carbon neutral economy by 2050.

In partnering with other countries, the commission hopes the outputs of its investment in the science and the technologies needed to become carbon neutral will spill over to other regions of the world. The partnership with Africa in green technologies “is very much a part of the Green Deal,” Juul-Jørgensen said.

Some countries in Africa are about to shift towards greener energy production and consumption, and have the potential to leapfrog fossil-based technologies Europe is relying on. “They are going straight to more renewable sources,” said Juul-Jørgensen.

Carbon neutrality is the main driver behind the European Green Deal, a new push by the EU to introduce green technologies into all sectors of the economy.

Clara de la Torre, deputy director general for climate action at the European Commission, said if the EU is to achieve these goals, it has to “invest in climate science”, including biofuels, bioeconomy and sustainable agriculture, but also in social and economic research.

Policy makers in South Africa are keen to pick up on the positive signals from the EU and jump on the green deal bandwagon. Daan du Toit, deputy director-general at South Africa’s department of science and innovation said there is a consensus in his country about the impact of climate change on poverty, inequality and unemployment. “Our policy responses need to interrogate the climate dimension,” Du Toit said. “We live the impact of climate change on a daily basis.”

For South Africa, the EU has been “a policy laboratory”, said Du Toit. As African countries are moving closer towards deeper regional integration, South Africa is looking at what it can learn from EU policies and how can they be applied in the local context.

“We are delighted to see the prominent cross-cutting role of science and innovation in the Green Deal and the cooperation that it entails,” said Du Toit.

South Africa is, “deeply committed to multilateralism,” Du Toit said. The move by the European Commission to begin investments under the Green Deal has been duly noted by policy makers. “When an important partner such as Europe makes an important policy announcement, we do take notice,” he said.","The European Commission is actively seeking ways to collaborate with countries in Africa to develop and implement green energy technologies.

Qualcomm leads the charge when it comes to XR chipsets, and the XR2 is the company’s latest. We covered the XR2 announcement back at Qualcomm Tech Summit in December and mentioned how important it would be for the industry to have access to all these new capabilities and technologies. Now, we’re starting to enter the next phase of development. Today Qualcomm’s announced a new set of reference designs and partnerships for the chipset, including, surprisingly, a long time competitor in the mobile space. Let’s take a closer look.

The reference design’s capabilities

Qualcomm’s first announcement was the finalization of its XR2 reference design for OEMs building their own XR2-based headsets. The XR2 reference design is designed to help developers get access to XR2 hardware before it comes to market so that they can optimize their applications and experiences for the chipset before headsets commercialize. The XR2 is also the first XR chipset from Qualcomm to include 5G support (thanks to its optional X55 5G modem). This will enable OEMs to build 5G connectivity, mmWave and Sub-6, into their headsets. In fact, Qualcomm already tested and validated the reference design with the world leader in 5G infrastructure, Ericsson, with both Sub-6 and mmWave 5G connectivity and end-to-end boundless XR. Boundless XR is a terminology Qualcomm uses to describe XR experiences that utilize 5G to take advantage of additional computing in the Edge cloud with MEC (Multi-Access Edge Computing). The result is low latency, high performance computing.

XR Car Customization Over 5G

Building on this partnership with Ericsson, Qualcomm also announced a complete 5G and XR retail experience powered by ZeroLight, with help from NVIDIA. This boundless XR experience utilizes 6-DoF VR to allow consumers to customize and configure their own Pagani vehicles. Users can explore the full range of Pagani vehicles and customize the paint colors, alloys and interior trims to their own liking—walking around the virtual car as they customize it. This experience is powered by the XR2 reference design, with advanced reprojection augmented with NVIDIA-powered CloudXR edge compute servers (sent back over a 5G network). The ZeroLight XR configurator is streamed in real-time using NVIDIA’s CloudXR edge compute server, through a 5G network powered by Ericsson, to the XR2 headset. The headset then processes and displays the high-quality imagery, reporting user inputs and movement back at a very low latency. To further improve the experience, the headset utilizes an enhanced re-projection technique that utilizes the cloud-rendered experience data within the headset to ensure it matches the user’s current position. This is one of the ways of dealing with the fact that it takes time (milliseconds) to send and receive user input data. The difference needs to imperceptible between running on the headset or through the cloud compute.

Cloud-rendered VR over 5G Qualcomm

XR Event Planning With IHG and Accenture

The company has also announced a partnership with Accenture to help InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) pilot an XR solution to help with event planning at its InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. The XR Event Planner will allow IHG to plan event layouts and see how they look without moving a single thing. This means being able to change the layout, lighting, carpet design, table settings and even fabric patterns before a single thing is ordered by the customer. The interesting angle is that IHG utilizes both Nreal AR glasses and HTC Vive Focus Plus VR headsets. We have seen other companies use VR in event planning—BMW uses it to help plan out its booth space at major industry events. This is only a natural evolution of that idea. While this announcement doesn’t explicitly mention the XR2, one can assume that the XR2 reference headset is included in this partnership.

More XR2 Features

The XR2 reference design also includes an IR emitter for hand tracking. Companies like TrinamiX, which just recently announced a partnership with Qualcomm, are helping to enable this with their Beam Profile Analysis algorithms. The inclusion of an IR emitter and the world-facing cameras for SLAM[WP1] (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) allows for both SLAM and hand-tracking to coexist on the same device without significantly increased cost or computational load. The XR2 reference design headset features 2K x 2K per-eye resolution LCD displays, which should significantly reduce the SDE (screen door effect), when pixels are visible to the user. Additionally, the design’s embedded support for Atraxa electromagnetic tracking technology from Northern Digital Inc. enables a low-latency 6-DoF controller—something that didn’t quite make it into the last generation. The headset will also come with Tobii eye-tracking compatibility, including its Spotlight Technology for foveating rendering. This technology can help developers and OEMs deliver higher quality experiences without taking the performance penalty.

Wrapping Up

In addition to helping build Qualcomm’s own design, GoerTek, one of the leading VR headset ODMs in the world, designed two of its own reference prototype XR headsets that leverage the Snapdragon XR2. In addition to the main Qualcomm reference design, GoerTek has an ID prototype for VR and another for VR that OEMs can leverage to their liking. GoerTek is not one to release designs of things that it cannot manufacture for its customers with its many years of manufacturing headsets for many big names in the industry. I am excited by some of these sleek design prototypes and I hope to see more headsets like them in the future.

The XR2 reference design is not meant to be a consumer or commercial product, but rather a guide and an early access platform for OEMs and developers. It’s a good thing that Qualcomm made it available this early in the year—many XR2 headsets are expected to come to market later in the year so the timing is just right. I’ll continue to watch with interest.

Kristen Raber, corporate director of the Cloud Innovation Lab at Christiana Care Health System, uses emerging technologies to tackle problems for the benefit of the bottom line and the organization's goals.

""I think culture is a big part of it. It's about changing the way we're thinking,"" Raber said. ""If we're moving towards a population health perspective, culture change can't be understated.""

The Cloud Innovation Lab creates partnerships with core vendors around such areas as patient records and billing to solve problems within those systems. It brings together people, technologies, and skills, both internally and externally.

""This innovation lab is about forming deeper relationships to bring problems forward,"" Raber said.

One of the big ones is around the time it takes to hire and credential personnel.

""It takes us six months to bring a physician onboard,"" she said. ""Three months of that is used for us to go through 37 pieces of information and validate it. Meanwhile that physician is basically sidelined.""

It takes another three months of validating the same information to credential the new physician with each insurer.

The Cloud Innovation Lab is working with a vendor for an instant credentialing process using blockchain technology. The credentialing is instantly available digitally through a wallet app, like the one that holds credit card information. It will make for the timely hiring of resources when the app goes live.

The lab doesn't so much present a solution, as listen to what's needed not just within the health system but across the entire industry, Raber said. Emphasis is placed on process redesign, coordination improvement initiatives and incubating new ideas for integrating IT into healthcare delivery.

Raber has been leading innovation technology for the past 13 years.

""We look at innovation as a core competency,"" she said, ""and something that truly needs to be the responsibility of everybody.""

Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Rumbalara Football Netball Club and Lendlease construction company at the start of the build, up to 17 local young indigenous workers have been employed at the GV Health site as general workers, apprentice plumbers, carpenters and electricians or fully qualified tradespeople.

Currently there are nine indigenous people working at the Graham St site.

Lendlease construction site manager Michael Roberts said the company had exceeded its target of ensuring 2.5 per cent of site workers were indigenous.

“We managed to meet that target and go beyond — the total is now three per cent,” Mr Roberts said.

Mr Roberts said a “very positive” relationship with Rumbalara had been developed over the past two years.

“This will provide a skillset to go forward and take to other employers,” he said.

Kaiela Institute business development manager Daniel Briggs said the idea was to build skills and aspiration within the indigenous community.

“We wanted to have diversity within the building project, and to help improve the wellbeing of indigenous people through skill improvements and job prospects,” Mr Briggs said.

Kaiela Institute executive director Paul Briggs said next month's RumbaFest at the sports club would celebrate indigenous culture and showcase the successful partnerships and achievements led by the club.

“The dark days of 80 per cent unemployment and workplace insecurity of the past 20 years are being addressed,” Mr Briggs said.

“We see this as an important day to celebrate the shift in engagement between community and the business sector, highlighting those employers that signed a pledge to deliver a two per cent indigenous workforce,” Mr Briggs said.

RumbaFest will include family entertainment, live music, an American-style barbecue, a pre-season practice footy match and a Jobs Expo with business luncheon.

The Rumba Progress Festival is at Rumbalara Football Netball Club, Mercury Dve, Shepparton, on Saturday, March 21 from 11 am to 5 pm.

52,https://performancein.com/news/2020/02/05/best-practices-better-influencer-partnerships/,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",PerformanceIN,Best Practices for Better Influencer Partnerships,"Influencer growth is gathering momentum and is expected to grow at a great pace in the coming years. As a consequence, the focus should now shift to how to get the best from your influencers and collaborate throughout the partnership life cycle.

Your active engagement will not only increase the effectiveness of your influencer campaigns — but it will also strengthen your relationship with the influencers you choose. But finding the right influencer is only the beginning; in order to achieve the aim of laying the foundation for successful influencer marketing, brands need to leverage other features to enhance the influencer management process and ensure influencers deliver on their potential.

Worryingly, 80% of influencer marketers have no idea what the actual ROI is in their programmes and brands need to be able to look at the rich consumer journey insights to deliver the full picture; from awareness to purchase, even when it’s across multiple devices.

Given the reality of increasing time spent on social media platforms, influencer marketing is more popular than ever. In fact, brands are now ready to make an even greater investment in their influencer campaigns and programmes – by 2022, spending on influencers will surpass $10B annually.

This will put global influencer spend on par with global affiliate spend so it is essential to look at best practices to deliver successful influencer partnerships.

So how do you get the most out of your influencer partnerships? Here are a few tips to optimise your programmes:

1. Don’t try to make one size fit all

Influencer partnerships are not set-it-and-forget-it. Like any relationship, they require communication, collaboration, and nurturing to thrive and grow. Yet too many organisations focus all their energy on finding high-profile influencers and think their work is over. Customise and adapt content and assets to suit each influencer, their audience, and their market and constantly communicate with your influencers in the same way that you would with any successful partnership.

2. Be hands-on

Given the investment enterprises are making in their influencer programmes, the degree to which they are hands-off is somewhat shocking. Only 18% of companies feel able to measure the ROI of influencer campaigns, and 86% don’t even understand how influencers calculate their fees. Be clear on what metrics will give you an accurate picture of your campaigns based on your objectives, and use the right tools to track the full customer journey across devices.

3. Nurture your relationships

Drive authentic relationships by creating a smooth onboarding process that will help each influencer to feel connected to the brand and provide them with the tools they need to create powerful content. Good communication is important to maintain influencer partnerships; keep them in the loop at every step of the way with customised and relevant updates.

4. Build to grow

You need to understand what works and what doesn’t in order to ensure that your partnerships deliver to the maximum potential. Of course, managing and optimising an influencer partnership programme requires good tools, workflows, and processes, but there are also some very basic actions for growth that can point you in the right direction. Don’t just focus on finding influencers — have a clear workflow for each stage of the lifecycle so you know what to do with them once you find them. Once you’ve found them, get automated to give you an end-to-end view of the full partnership lifecycle. After all, manual influencer campaign management is exceedingly time-consuming, inefficient, and often inaccurate, so invest in tools that will automate the process and give you an end-to-end view of the full partnership lifecycle.

5. Diversify and scale up— or down

Implement a mix of micro- and macro-influencers to make sure your impact is both targeted and wide-reaching. Starting with simple elements such as audience size, geographical location, and promotional channel, but also including sophisticated metrics on engagement rates and fake followers,

This is where Influencer Partnerships shines and gives marketers actionable insights into the KPIs that matter, whether it’s branding, revenue, new customers or more. Rich consumer journey insights deliver the full picture — from awareness to purchase, even when it’s across multiple devices.

However, the institution now has 400 pupils on roll.

This challenge is further compounded by the fact that the designated play area is asphalted, which is hazardous to both students and teachers as they sometimes fall and hurt themselves.

The playing field, located at the back of the school, would have been ideal, except that it has no perimeter fencing and is too close to the road, making it off limits for students unless they are properly supervised.

There are other pressing problems at the school, such as the need for additional classrooms, a library, and a reading room.

Special projects committee

Cognisant of these needs and the fact that the Ministry of Education can only do so much, a special projects committee was formed at the school to see how best the institution could supplement what it was getting from the ministry. The committee comprises principal Denise Moodie, vice-principal Jacqueline Hunter, some teachers, and a member of the office staff.

Moodie said that there are several things at the school that need to be done and that the limited financing received from the ministry can barely take them to the end of the term.

“We realised that we needed to find ways and means to help ourselves, so we formed a special project committee to get some things done,” she said. The school has already completed a project that saw whiteboards being bought and installed in all the classrooms.

With blackboards once serving as partitions for classrooms, the school is thankful that the Digicel Foundation came on board and gave them proper partitions.

The team also has high praises for ‘old faithful’ Amalya Auto Solution, whose owner, it said, is always helpful.

Another benefactor, Dr Bradley Edwards, senior medical doctor at the May Pen Hospital, is always looking for ways to assist the institution, Moodie said.

However, the school still has two pressing needs. One is to reclaim the library that had to be converted into a classroom to accommodate the growing number of students, and the other is for a resource centre.

Moodie told The Gleaner that a parent has donated a container that can be retrofitted and used as the resource centre.

“However, we don’t have the funds to have it delivered, and we will also need to have a base built for it,” she shared.

Looking ahead, Moodie said that it is her hope that there will be partnerships so that the school can realise its goals and the children can learn in a more comfortable environment.","The Free Town Primary School in Clarendon was built to accommodate 200 students.

Dale Stratton Takes Helm as New President; Council Joins Forces with Nielsen for Significant New Consumer Research Study

Napa Valley, CA, February 10, 2020 – Wine Market Council, a key source of data-driven wine consumer insights, has named Dale Stratton as its new president and announced a strategic new partnership for 2020 research endeavors.

“This is an incredibly exciting time for Wine Market Council. The slate of research projects scheduled for the coming years will provide our members with consumer insights that will shape their strategic goals and make a real difference in the marketplace,” said Dale Stratton, the newly appointed president of Wine Market Council. “As a former Wine Market Council board member, I know first-hand the real-life importance of our work; I’m honored to now lead the team as we continue to grow our membership, develop new partnerships and chart a path for 2020 and beyond.”

A long-time member of the Wine Market Council board of directors, Stratton served as board chair from 2015 to 2017. He replaces outgoing president Steve Burns, who stepped down in January. Stratton brings more than 35 years of alcohol beverage industry experience to his new role. Most recently an independent consultant, he was formerly vice president, commercial insights at Constellation Brands, and also spent 22 years at E&J Gallo, leading distributor management, account management and strategic insights.

Also new this year, Wine Market Council will collaborate for the first time with consumer data analytics company Nielsen Global Connect to collaborate on a far-reaching Wine & Wellness study. Collectively, this comprehensive survey will chart wine consumption habits of U.S. consumers at the intersection of health and wellness.

“By leveraging Nielsen Global Connect’s depth of shopper data and our industry-specific expertise, we have a unique opportunity to dive more deeply into what consumers consider a ‘healthy’ lifestyle and derive wine-related insights that will benefit our industry,” said Jennifer Pagano, director of research, Wine Market Council. “This is a powerful relationship that will shed light on the ever-changing factors that influence consumer choice.”

“We know consumers have a huge array of beverage choices, and are searching for convenience, a great experience, and healthy options,” said Danny Brager, senior vice president, beverage alcohol practice, Nielsen Global Connect. “We want to better understand where wine fits into these new trends and how the category can adapt.”

The study will be an extension of many themes shared at Wine Data 2020, the annual presentation of critical wine industry research. More than 250 wine producers, growers, importers, wholesalers and retailers attended this year’s event to hear updates on the DTC consumer, new “beyond the core” alcohol products, the impact of tariffs and more.

Any minute from now, there will be a call to get onto the plane.

She is containing her excitement as the business class voyage to Kenya’s capital city, Nairobi, is her maiden flight. She looks forward to sights of a new kind of world from the economy class, the nervous feeling of the airplane’s wings slicing through the immaculate clouds but most importantly to the reason for which she is taking three days off actively running her company, Val Media Consultancy, to participate in the Rising Woman training.

Mentors businesswomen

The Rising Woman initiative, coordinated by Monitor Publications Limited, Dfcu bank and Uganda Investment Authority recognises, celebrates and promotes a culture of mentorship among businesswomen in Uganda.

“I expect to network with the various women in business that have made it to a level I am yet to reach. I am excited to visit their sites. I expect to learn from their experience and get skills that I will apply in my business, to take it to another level,” she says.

There are other nine businesswomen with similar expectations as Nassolo’s. They were part of a business proposal writing competition and they were awarded in November last year. Part of the reward is an all-expenses paid trip to Nairobi for a three-day business training. The morning of the Rising Woman conference is an occasion to tap into the expertise and personal experiences of celebrated African entrepreneurs.

Cooperation

Kezzy Mukiri, an entrepreneur and executive director of Ignite Trade Africa, says the buzzwords for her today are cooperation, linkages among governments, private sector and development partners. She insists businesswomen should spread their wings beyond Uganda.

“Understand the relevance of your brand to the world in a bid to get market and establish partnerships,” she says in her first remarks before delving into how she has built a reputable events management firm across East and Central Africa.

The subject of women working solely crops up and the entrepreneurs believe culture, mistrust and low self-esteem can be blamed for the habit.

Build partnerships

Mukiri challenges women to collaborate in order to increase productivity. “Be clear with your vision, have clarity on your purpose and you will know what partnerships you need. Write your vision down and speak it out. Be deliberate on choosing your associations to match your goals. Map out your personal development and build your visibility by determining the story you want the world to associate your brand with,” she advises.

The subject of leveraging digital platforms to cross borders was part of the conversation and women businesses can now compete with global firms, especially if they utilise social media channels.

Chico Amadou, the founder of Chico’s Innovators Limited, has spent his recent years identifying, coaching and investing in Africa’s most impact-driven innovators. He uses his 60 minutes to talk business growth and sustaining that success for the next 100 years. It feels more interactive and hands-on as the women plot goals they wanted to achieve in five to 10 years.

Three goals in 100 days

“The goal is not to make a big leap in one year. You will get exhausted, frustrated and get into associations with people who think like you but do not have the resources. Give yourself three simple goals to achieve every 100 days and ensure they align with each other,” Amadou says.

But there is no way these rising businesswomen will achieve their goals without proper internal processes, delegating business operations to workers, hiring thought provoking teams, recognising the weaknesses and strengths of their businesses.

“If you want to build a brand that will change people’s lives, by five years, you should put systems in place. We hire friends, family, some who know how to sell our vision better than us but cannot execute it. If you cannot put internal systems in place, pay consultants to do it in the early years of your business,” Amadou adds.

Anne Gaitha’s experience as founder of Regal Africa and executive director of Organisation of Women in International Trade (OWIT) stirs the belief they can handle international trade hurdles.

She probes businesswomen on whether they have done their market research on global trade policies, have communication strategies that effectively tell stories of their brands, if they have a competitive edge, are using technology to automate processes and keeping proper records. But also, closing financial gaps such as using equity, investment club funds, government funds, invoice discounts or debt because capital is key for one to compete globally.

Why you are borrowing?

“The main thing here for you to know how much you are borrowing and what you are going to do with the funds. Building a relationship with your banker is very important. They need to understand your business,” she says, emphasising there is money out there.

Mumbi Gichuni, managing director of Epilson Publishers, hardly borrowed in the early years of her business. She says a big part of her business has relied on social capital to survive and hints on transacting on goodwill. For most part of the training, the facilitators got the rising women’s thoughts in several directions. Nassolo admits her expectations are exceeded.

“When I am away, my business must run. I have been away for three days and my business has been at a standstill. I have to hire someone to do the work while I am away. I will concentrate on building partnerships and securing a mentor in the field,” she says.","Mentors businesswomenThe Rising Woman initiative, coordinated by Monitor Publications Limited, Dfcu bank and Uganda Investment Authority recognises, celebrates and promotes a culture of mentorship among businesswomen in Uganda.

This advice has resonated with companies and resulted in a wave of new joint venture activity between large, mid-tier and junior miners across the industry, according to Deloitte’s 2020 Tracking the Trends report.

Read a summary of this year’s top 10 trends.

On a global scale, for example, former Kalgoorlie Super Pit partners Barrick Gold and Newmont have taken their relationship to another level by combining Tier 1 assets in Nevada, United States as a way to accelerate growth.

Locally, several of Australia’s leading operators have increased investment or ramped up activity to identify the next generation of deposits in metals such as gold, copper and nickel.

They are commonly working with junior companies by providing crucial funding that would have otherwise been difficult to source.

As is the case in Nevada, gold has been central to a number of joint ventures (JV), with Newmont and Newcrest Mining teaming up with junior companies to advance exploration opportunities in northern Australia.

Rio Tinto, meanwhile, has been progressing its future copper potential in the Paterson Province in Western Australia through a JV with Antipa Minerals.

Recognising these moves, Deloitte has identified ‘getting partnerships and joint ventures right’ as a key trend for mining companies in the 2020 Tracking the Trends report.

According to Tracking the Trends, mining companies have looked back on partnerships and JVs they have formed and realised that many have failed to deliver the value originally envisaged.

Deloitte Australia mining and metals leader Ian Sanders believes a solid foundation, selection of the right partners and key performance indicators (KPIs) are the major factors of a successful JV or partnership.

“The majors are looking at diversifying some of their risk, whether that means taking a stake in a mid-tier operation or it being a stepping stone to a future acquisition,” Sanders told Australian Mining.

“I think we are going to see more of it as industrial metals like copper and nickel continue to face supply issues.

“Mining companies in particular currently have strong balance sheets relative to four or five years ago and need to find a good home for their cash flow that sustainably grows the business.”

The need for better partnerships goes beyond joining forces with junior and mid-tier explorers; METS (mining equipment, technology and services) companies also have a role to play in today’s collaborations.

Mining companies require effective partnerships that enable them to drive social value, deliver technology projects or shape the makeup of their future workforce – all key themes of the 2020 Tracking the Trends.

The so-called ‘social investor’ and their demands for mining companies to deliver more social value through initiatives such as decarbonisation is a trend that is pushing for collaboration within the supply chain.

“Sustainability teams within our mining organisations do not have the bandwidth or depth to be able to achieve their stated objectives,” Sanders said.

“That’s not because they don’t want to, but because those objectives are so significant and vast, i.e. different examples of mining companies talking about their decarbonation footprint to 2050.

“To get there they are going to need to be talking right through the supply chain on scope one and two emissions and what can be done.”

Deloitte regards decarbonisation as a priority in 2020 that will elevate Australian miners in the eyes of the social investor.

Sanders also believes this focus is changing how mining companies are working with their supply chain partners to achieve their goals.

He said companies were being proactive in how they approached the supply chain to meet their social targets.

“What does that mean? … You as a supplier of (a mining company) will have ethical sourcing including the people that you use and the suppliers you use, first and foremost,” Sanders said.

“Secondly, how can we work collaboratively together to create a greater product that is going to satisfy environmental stewardship and carbon emissions for both of us and ultimately then help us with our customers.”

From a technology perspective, Deloitte highlighted ‘the road towards intelligent mining’ by taking advantage of digital technologies, artificial intelligence and analytics solutions.

The report reinforced the need for mining companies to modernise core technologies, while also understanding the impact digital initiatives can have on their workforce, leadership and the communities in which they operate.

“Digital investment alone isn’t enough to achieve the step changes,” Sanders said. “What’s really needed is where you conceptually focus across broader transformation, coupled with digital investments and innovation, along with people skills.

“Without people you are not going to get the change and efficiency you are looking for, or the engagement of those people.

“Some companies have therefore left some opportunity on the table because they have not put all of that together.”

Getting partnerships right is, again, a way for mining companies to ensure their technology projects and initiatives reach their potential.

Deloitte identified an emerging partnership model is to allocate project assets and liabilities across a full ecosystem of partners, including mining companies, original equipment manufacturers and service providers, to local communities and governments.

Sanders said the creation of trust and collaboration between organisations would lead to unique insights into what might be possible.

“I think those barriers that may have existed in the past are slowly coming down where organisations are seeing the competitive advantage they are going to get when they collaborate and work together,” Sanders concluded.","For many years mining companies have been urged to improve how they collaborate in the industry and their supply chain through joint ventures and partnerships.

63,https://chennai.citizenmatters.in/non-profit-programmes-to-empower-girl-students-in-corporation-schools-14300,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT","Citizen Matters, Chennai",Empowering girls from Corporation schools through partnerships,"‘Ambition’ sounds a rather lofty and serious word for 16-year-old S Harika*, a student of Class XI of the Corporation School, New Washermanpet. Hailing from a low-income family, Harika saw no point in nurturing ambitions, for she was almost sure that they would not be fulfilled. Today, however, she aims to become a doctor and is working hard to achieve the goal.

The change in Harika and many others like her can be attributed to a pilot project by an organisation called EngenderedCo, which is trying to improve labour force participation rates among women in India. The organisation works with two Corporation schools of North Chennai, trying to develop a mindset focused on career-building among girl students here and educating them about various aspects of empowerment.

“The number of educated women entering the workforce and sticking to their career is decreasing in India. Through this pilot project, we want to extend the Beti Bachao, Beti Padao to Beti Kamao,” said Prajakta Kuwalekar, founder and CEO of EngenderedCo.

The fact is that while we continue to talk of women empowerment and safety in cities, even a metro like Chennai has a long way to go before it can ensure that its young girls are effectively trained in life skills, self reliant and equipped to fight social taboos. In Corporation schools, for example, the focus is only on academics and one rarely hears talk of career guidance, emotional training or life skills.

“We teamed up with various organisations to conduct sessions on disease prevention and control. But, except in a few rare cases, sessions focussing on the girl child are not usually conducted in Corporation schools,” admitted Dr T G Srinivasan, Health Education Officer, Chennai Corporation. Thankfully, organisations such as Engendered Co are now stepping in to fill that gap.

The Inner Wheel of Club of Madras, for example, conducts sessions in Corporation Schools with a view to sensitising all stakeholders — children, parents and teachers — about sexual violence so that child sexual abuse can be fought head on. “About 285 Heads across Corporation Schools have participated in an interactive workshop conducted to sensitise their teachers. Police, lawyers and child helpline persons addressed various queries on abuse and routes to redress,” said Subha Srikanth, President of Inner Wheel Club of Madras.

The changes that such sessions bring about in the girls are significant and multifarious. For example, Saritha K* who studies in the Korrukupet Corporation School where EngenderedCo runs its programme, is using a menstrual cup, probably the first to do so in her school. Another girl mustered the courage to speak to her father about her interest in playing kho kho.

In one of the sessions, girls and teachers opened up about the stigma faced during menstruation: restricted entry into the house, restriction to touch anyone or anything and living with a feeling that they are ‘impure.’ Those taboos were busted and many girls actually spoke to their parents. One of them objected when asked to sleep alone in a dingy room when she was on her period and spoke to her mother about her right to dignity.

“My daughter made me speak to a social worker who explained about the irrational stigma attached to menstruation and the advantages of a menstrual cup. I cannot give up on all those practices, but I have started using a cup,” said Srikala, mother of a student. Thus, the chain of positive events goes on. “We will have sessions with other parents too, to change the way they look at menstruation,” said a teacher.

In some sessions, women with successful careers in various fields talked to the girls. A loco pilot from Chennai suburban rail, an international sailor, a pilot, an environmentalist and a social entrepreneur talked about the challenges they faced in achieving their goals and how they overcame these. Their insights will now help EngenderedCo design a full-time training programme in Corporation schools of North Chennai.

The Inner Wheel sessions exposed the lack of knowledge among stakeholders: many students are not even aware of the name of the body parts. Parents and teachers rarely communicate with children about the different types of touch or what types of behaviour they should guard against. “It’s difficult for a child to speak up. Parents and teachers have the responsibility to observe and help a child in distress,” said a teacher.

Through storytelling, role play and games, the club members teach children about good touch and bad touch and the ways to seek help if they face any form of abuse.

Experts across the board agree that it is important to engender ideas of safety and empowerment among girls from a tender age. Chennai Corporation should therefore find a way to expand the ongoing projects.

Every kid dreams of growing up to be a number 10, banging in the goals for their favourite club.

But very few of us will ever make it to the top - let alone establish ourselves as one of the greatest scorers of all-time.

With the football season on hold, we think now is a perfect time to look back on those who have achieved great things on the pitch - but not by themselves.

Instead, we want to look at some of the deadliest strike partnerships ever formed, taking into account the goals each pair scored and the things they achieved with their respective teams.

So, here are 10 of the greatest goalscoring duos the game has ever seen.

10) Thierry Henry & Dennis Bergkamp - Arsenal - 34 goals in 2003/04

Are there two more iconic Arsenal forwards than Henry and Bergkamp? The pair were mercurial during the 'Invincibles' season and their goals helped the Gunners go unbeaten.

They make the list not just for an impressive haul of 34 Premier League strikes between them, but because of what they achieved as part of that remarkable Arsenal team.

9) Ian Rush & Kenny Dalglish - Liverpool - 47 goals in 1983/84

Perhaps two of Liverpool's most iconic forwards, Dalglish and Rush formed a deadly partnership at Anfield.

The 1983/84 season saw the pair at their peak, with Rush netting 32 league goals, while his partner added 15 more.

Their joint haul was enough to secure the First Division title, as well as the European Cup and League Cup.

8) Alan Shearer & Chris Sutton - Blackburn - 49 goals in 1994/95

It's so strange to think that Championship side Blackburn Rovers actually WON the Premier league - but it really happened in 1995!

Most of their goals came from the incredible duo of English strikers - Shearer and Sutton. They netted 34 and 15 times respectively en-route to a famous title win.

Shearer, of course, is still the top-flight's record goalscorer to this date.

7) Luis Suarez & Daniel Sturridge - Liverpool - 52 goals in 2013/14

Seriously, how didn't Liverpool win the league in 2014? The Suarez and Sturridge partnership was absolutely unreal.

The Uruguayan won the Golden Boot with 31 goals before jumping ship to Barcelona and he was complimented well by another 21 strikes from Sturridge.

That's a quite ridiculous haul - bettered by only one other Premier League strike partnership - Newcastle's Andy Cole and Peter Beardsley, who netted 55 together in 1993/94.

6) Andy Cole & Dwight Yorke - Manchester Utd - 53 goals in 1998/99

Now, this is where our list gets a little bit different. All the other partnerships have been based on league goals, but we have to mention Man United's treble-winning team.

Across the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, Cole and Yorke scored 53 times, helping the Red Devils to a truly remarkable season.

5) Sergio Aguero & Diego Forlan - Atletico Madrid - 56 goals in 2008/09

During their five years together at Atletico, Aguero and Forlan scored a remarkable 190 goals between them.

Their best one-off campaign came in 2008/09, striking 56 goals in all competitions.

It's just a shame they finished with no silverware, but Atletico did pick up a famous 4-3 victory against Barcelona in La Liga, which will live long in the memory of many fans.

4) Grafite & Edin Dzeko - Wolfsberg - 71 goals in 2008/09

Yes, you read that right - 71 goals between TWO players! Absolutely remarkable. What's perhaps even more incredible, is that Grafite and Dzeko's goals secured Wolfsberg the Bundesliga title.

They finished two points ahead of Bayern Munich, with their strikers scoring 54 league goals between them.

Grafite netted 35 times in all competitions, while Dzeko went one better, scoring 36. Absolutely incredible.

3) Hulk & Radamel Falcao - Porto - 73 goals in 2010/11

Hulk and Falcao were lethal together for three years at Porto and the pair were especially unstoppable in 2010/11.

They managed no less than 73 goals and completed a famous treble, winning the Primeira Liga, Portuguese Cup and the Europa League.

Falcao may often be ridiculed for his disappointing spells at Chelsea and Man United, but it's important to remember the time he was one of Europe's top strikers.

2) Alfredo Di Stefano & Ferenc Puskas - Real Madrid - 74 goals in 1960/61

We're going way back with this one.

The second-greatest partnership in history was formed at Real Madrid between 1958 and 1964 when Di Stefano and Puskas scored a remarkable 302 goals together.

Their best season together was 1960/61, when they netted 74 goals between them, whilst winning La Liga ahead of rivals Atletico Madrid, who came second.

1) Luis Suarez & Lionel Messi - Barcelona - 100 goals in 2015/16

So here we are, did you expect anything else? Messi and Suarez have been mercurial at Barcelona, with a frankly ridiculous 464 goals between them since 2014.

Their greatest one-off campaign will surely never be matched. The duo scored 100 - yes, 100 - goals between them in 2015/16.

Messi got 41 of them, while Suarez scored 59 - that's enough to better most other partnerships on this list by himself. We may never see a duo as deadly as this again.

There are plenty of massive names on this list.

From Henry and Bergkamp inspiring Arsenal's invincibles season to Messi and Suarez scoring for fun at Barca.

Each partnership certainly deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest ever, but will the number one ever be topped? It's hard to see, but you never know.

The role of the private sector in attaining the objectives of the health sector is gaining increasing recognition, especially in low income countries. Arguably, the private sector is not a new player in health. Indeed, the World Bank has advanced the ideology of private sector provision of health services as far back as the days of structural adjustment policies in the mid- 80s. Of late though, we are witnessing renewed emphasis on embracing the private for-profit sector at global, continental and national levels.

The role of the private sector in universal health coverage (UHC) has been advanced at the UN High Level Political Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals; within the UHC 2030 partnership and during the World Economic forum; and in relation to SDG3 during WHO deliberations at the Executive board level. Strong support for embracing the private sector has also been garnered from the UN Economic commission for Africa and Harmonisation for Health in Africa (HHA). On the African continent, we have witnessed the birth of the Africa Healthcare federation with similar structures at the country level – national federations currently in 18 countries. These organizations provide platforms for the private for-profit and public sector to effectively engage.

Furthermore, the advance in innovation, development of new products – diagnostics, medical devices, digital solutions, medicines; efficient options in the distribution of medicines – by the private sector is fascinating. These developments present both opportunities and challenges. While the former relates to improving access to quality services the latter relates to irrational introduction of innovations with financial implications, potential distortion to service delivery and fragmentation of national health system.

Why the renewed focus?

We recap on recent advances that seem to have provided impetus for strengthening public private partnerships – the Universal health coverage agenda, the commitment to integrated people-centered care, and attaining the sustainable development goals targets which necessitate having a healthy and productive population. Do these aspirations challenge the public sector beyond its capacity to deliver? Inadequate funding for health coupled with fiscal space constraints and weak health systems, inadequate and inequitably distributed human resources are an old story plaguing service delivery in low income countries. Indeed, of late statements like “the public sector cannot go it alone” are resounding.

The private sector is perceived to be more efficient, more innovative and offer better quality services than the public sector. In as much they are a potential resource, the lengthy licensing processes and the weak regulatory capacity of governments limits the extent to which their potential can be harnessed. Statements like “systems must be in place”, “we must cultivate the market place” are common in several dialogues. At present, the partnership is fraught with mistrust and divergent objectives with a sense of being stuck in the rhetoric phase. Although some feel that it is more of a mindset issue, especially of public sector officials, as opposed to divergent objectives. Some have referred to this phase as “deepening the dialogue” whatever this means.

The symposium organized by the Africa Health Business Forum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 7th – 9th October 2019 engaged in a frank dialogue. The symposium was attended by over 35 private health enterprises active in Africa, ministers of health, multilateral agencies, the African Union and civil society. The spirit of partnership was evident in the dialogue as remarked by participants “in partnership, we will not only go far, but we will make sure we leave no one behind”, “the dialogue is becoming robust”. Frustrations were also echoed regarding the several dialogues with no concrete results, private sector being labeled as profiteers and the varied appreciation of who is actually private sector in the different contexts.

Can countries foster a meaningful public private partnership?

Trust and ensuring a win-win situation in strengthening public private partnership cannot be over emphasized. The patient should be the center where the public sector fulfils its commitment to the population and the private sector contributes to the objectives of the health sector and realize some profit. These win-win options need to be identified and fostered.

Are conditions favorable for the private for-profit sector to flourish? Can African countries guarantee sizeable markets for private manufactures of medicines and medical products? Certainly not, but the ongoing discussions regarding pooled procurement around regional economic blocks and small Island states offer a favorable option. While this will stimulate the interest of private investors with possible job creation on one hand, countries will be able to negotiate fair prices on the other. The recent ratification of the free trade agreement by 25-member states of the African Union offers an additional opportunity.

Opportunities not-withstanding, innovations from the private sector are numerous and good as they are, not everything that is good is needed or is affordable. In the face of weak enforcement of standards, countries have witnessed an enormous amount of pilot projects that have not been scaled up. Some have referred to this phenomenon as “pilotitis”

The role of the private for-profit sector in fragile and conflict settings has been debated with more inclination towards the negative. However, as we learn from Somalia, some participants in the Africa Health Business forum stated that “such settings do not present impossible situations, but just call for doing things differently”. Although in the case of Somalia, the solidarity culture might explain the realized contribution of the private sector where health care costs are a communal responsibility.

Partnerships in achieving SDGs in general and UHC are inevitable and we argue that in as much as the public sector is challenged beyond capacity, the timing is right.","Of late though, we are witnessing renewed emphasis on embracing the private for-profit sector at global, continental and national levels.

Not that Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez failed to live up to their standards this season, but various injury setbacks have prevented both of them from performing consistently throughout 2019/20.

Meanwhile, no one at the Santiago Bernabeu has managed to keep up with Karim Benzema's high tempo, with Gareth Bale, Luka Jovic, Vinicius Junior, and Rodrygo all underperforming for the majority of the campaign.

While the Spanish giants entered somewhat of a downturn, new, exciting partnerships were born across the continent, with the one between Josip Ilicic and Alejandro 'Papu Gomez' probably being the highlight of the season. The aging duo has guided Atalanta all the way through to the Champions League quarter-finals in their first-ever season in Europe's top-tier competition.

In Germany, Timo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer had managed to bring RB Leipzig to the top of the Bundesliga and keep them there for quite a while before Bayern Munich finally toppled them. In Ligue 1, Wissam Ben Yedder and Islam Slimani have escorted Monaco from the relegation zone to Europe's doorstep.

But, here, we will take a look at the five most intriguing attacking partnerships that fascinated football lovers across the globe so far in 2019/20.

Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero celebration against Watford

Liverpool's fierce Premier League rivals, Manchester City, also possess intimidating firepower in the shape of Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne. The duo has played an instrumental part in City's back-to-back Premier League titles under Pep Guardiola and has continued to demonstrate their superiority this season, too.

Almost a quarter (23.53%) of Manchester City's 68 league goals bagged this campaign required Aguero's final touch. The best foreign goalscorer in the Premier League history (180), the Argentinean has been tearing apart the opposition defenses during his nine-year stint at the Etihad. Yet, this season has not been straightforward for the 31-year-old, who has had to battle Gabriel Jesus for a place in the starting XI. Despite being limited to 17 Premier League starts, Aguero has scored 16 times, which now means he has surpassed a 10-goal landmark in each season since arriving from Atletico Madrid in 2011.

While Guardiola entrusted 'Kun' with the goalscoring task, De Bruyne is in charge of ‘feeding’ his attacking teammates and creating scoring opportunities. The Belgium international has provided 16 assists in the Premier League so far this season, becoming the first player ever to pick up 15 or more assists in the English top-flight three years in a row. Notably, the 28-year-old has created 23 clear-cut chances this term (more than any other player in the Premier League), with only Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller (24) and PSG’s Angel Di Maria (32) bettering that record of all players featuring in Europe’s top-five leagues.

According to WhoScored.com, no player in Europe has managed more key passes than De Bruyne (72) this season, which makes him the most creative midfielder by a mile. As per the same source, Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi is not among the top-six in that category, which is probably the best illustration of how important De Bruyne's qualities are to Guardiola's side.

Let's put it this way - the former Chelsea outcast makes an assist every 134 minutes he spends on the field. His closest competitor, Trent Alexander-Arnold of Liverpool, has 12 league assists this season, although it takes him 212 minutes on the pitch per an assist.

#4 Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah

Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah

With all due to respect to the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Roberto Firmino, but Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are the twin pillars upon which Liverpool’s success rests. It is beyond doubt that Van Dijk has almost single-handedly shored up the Reds’ immense defensive problems, while the Brazilian notched up some important goals over the past couple of years. However, the African duo remains the foundation stone of Jurgen Klopp’s revolution.

Mane and Salah have orchestrated Liverpool’s inexorable march towards their first Premier League title in history in remarkable fashion. The Senegal international has clocked up 14 goals and nine assists in 26 league outings so far this season and is only one assist short of becoming the first Premier League player to hit double figures. In the meantime, his partner in-crime has 16 goals and six assists to his name and remains in contention to become the league’s top-scorer, with Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy, who tops the scoring chart, netting three more.

The extent of their significance in Klopp's set-up can be fully grasped only by taking off their numbers from the Merseysiders' account. The Senegalese forward and his Egyptian teammate have participated in 68.18% (45) of the total 66 goals Liverpool have scored in the Premier League this term. In turn, they have contributed to 59 goals across all competitions this campaign, either scoring or assisting.

Indeed, Mane and Salah, both 27, form one of the most prolific partnerships in Europe, let alone the Premier League. The former Roma man is Liverpool’s joint-best overseas scorer in the Premier League, and it took him only two-and-a-half seasons to establish himself as a record-breaker. Additionally, Salah struck 20 goals in all competitions for the third year running, while Mane came two short of reaching the same milestone before the coronavirus pandemic halted the club season in Europe.

#3 Kylian Mbappe and Neymar

Neymar and Mbappe warming up

'The most exciting partnerships in football' list can't not include Mbappe and Neymar. Let's face it - these two form the most enjoyable attacking couple in Europe, and even though many would say they play in a 'less competitive' league, no one can overlook their ridiculous numbers.

They are blessed with talent, pace, technique, lethal goalscoring instinct, and an audaciousness that merges all those qualities into one superior entity. Apart from being an enjoyable pair to watch, the Frenchman and the Brazilian really drive PSG forward in every sense of the phrase. With 75 Ligue 1 goals scored this season, the Parisians are the most prolific team in Europe’s top-five leagues, and that’s mainly thanks to Neymar and Mbappe. Indeed, the all-star duo has been involved in 58.67% of PSG’s total league goals this campaign (44).

Take their goals away from the equation, and PSG become an average side in France. Indeed, without their goals, the perennial Ligue 1 champions would have 44 in their account, which would put them on a pair with Monaco and just two clear of Lyon and three of Marseille and Nice.

Often accused of being selfish, Mbappe has 17 assists in all competitions to his name (5 in the Champions League) and can still surpass Ajax's Hakim Ziyech (5) in the competition’s assist standings now that the Lancers aren't involved anymore. Although tied with Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder (18) at the top of the Ligue 1 scoring table, the 21-year-old is enjoying his second-best senior season and is nine short of equaling his 2018/19 tally of 39 goals in all competitions.

Meanwhile, an injury-hit start to the season has not prevented Neymar from showcasing his class. The Brazilian dynamo has netted 13 goals in 15 league outings for PSG this term, adding six assists in the process. It means a goal or an assist for Neymar every 70 minutes he’s on the field in Ligue 1, which makes him the most effective player in the French top tier.

#2 Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller

Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller

The attacking partnership between Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller has been nothing short of outstanding this season. In fact, these two are the main reasons why Bayern Munich managed to overthrow RB Leipzig at the top of the Bundesliga table. Philippe Coutinho, Serge Gnabry, and Kingsley Coman (when fit) have all contributed to the Bavarians’ rise under Hansi Flick, but Lewandowski and Muller have singled out as Bayern’s driving force this season.

Widely regarded as the best No 9 in Europe, the Poland international has been in blistering form this term, scoring 25 of Bayern’s 73 league goals (34.25%), as he sits four clear of his closest rival Timo Werner of RB Leipzig at the top of the goalscoring standings. Speaking of his video-game performances, Lewandowski has failed to find the net in just two of 23 Bundesliga appearances this year.

By extension, free-scoring Lewandowski has transferred his out-of-this-world digits to the Champions League, too. He tops the scoring chart in Europe’s most prestigious club competition in Europe with 11 goals, which came from just 20 attempts on target! With Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland now out of the picture, the 31-year-old is likely to finish the season as the competition’s best scorer.

Many have thought that Muller was past his prime after a torrid 2018/19, but the German has silenced his critics by producing an astonishing 2019/20 campaign. The best assist-maker in Bundesliga history, the 30-year-old has registered 16 assists this term, taking his overall tally to 115. Muller, therefore, average one assist every 97 minutes he's on the pitch, which puts him streets ahead of his closest followers.

Although he has become more of a playmaker this season, the famous German has still netted ten goals in all competitions, as he remains one of just two Bayern players to reach double figures in 2019/20.

#1 Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez

Nicolo Barella, Lautaro Martinez and Romelu Lukaku

Last but not the least, Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez have been a truly remarkable duo this year exceeding all expectations and receiving praise from all football fans in Europe.

Although they may not have been as productive as the other duos on this list, these two deserved their place on this list for everything they've done this season. Lukaku and Martinez are a perfect mix of a robust target man and a fox-in-the-box forward that has been keeping the Milanese giants in contention for the title for the majority of 2019/20.

Lukaku's decision to swap Manchester United for Inter turned out to be a career-saver for the Belgian striker, who has flourished in Serie A under Antonio Conte. Seventeen goals in 25 league appearances for the Nerazzurri have propelled the 26-year-old back to Europe's elite and earned him plaudits across the ‘Old Continent.' From being the Old Trafford scapegoat, Lukaku has turned into the Giuseppe Meazza hero, being directly involved in 38.78% of Inter's 49 league goals this term.

As for his companion Lautaro Martinez, he has scored 11 and set up three to his teammates, which means he is directly responsible for 28.57% of Inter's Serie A goals. Impressively, the Argentinean has found the back of the net in all but two of his six Champions League appearances this year, managing a total of five on an average of one goal scored per 104 minutes of Champions League action played.","The aging duo has guided Atalanta all the way through to the Champions League quarter-finals in their first-ever season in Europe's top-tier competition.

As higher education and the academic library environment evolves, librarians at many of these independent institutions are identifying priorities that include not only collaborating with educational stakeholders, enhancing teaching and learning, and connecting to the institution’s mission, but also positioning themselves as active and creative partners in increasingly digital learning and scholarship. An international environment is both a challenge and an opportunity for these priorities.

Library Partnerships in International Liberal Arts Education explores these challenges and opportunities through perspectives that are inherently international and intercultural because of the authors’ own backgrounds, and in particular because of their institutional environments. The authors are librarians, faculty, and technologists at institutions that belong to the AMICAL Consortium, a consortium of American-modeled international liberal arts institutions working together on common goals for libraries, technology, and learning. The chapters describe library-anchored collaborations that demonstrate struggles, but also successes and rich possibilities, in these thoroughly international—and increasingly digital—liberal arts institutions. They provide cumulative knowledge, reference points, and aspirational targets for planning future library-related collaborations in similar environments.

Thanks to the MIT Global Seed Funds (GSF) program, managed by the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI), more of these faculty members will be able to build on these relationships to develop ideas and create new projects.

“This MISTI fund was extremely helpful in consolidating our collaboration and has been the start of a long-term interaction between the two teams,” says 2017 GSF awardee Mehrdad Jazayeri, associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. “We have already submitted multiple abstracts to conferences together, mapped out several ongoing projects, and secured international funding thanks to the preliminary progress this seed fund enabled.”

This year, the 28 funds that comprise MISTI GSF received 232 MIT applications. Over $2.3 million was awarded to 107 projects from 23 departments across the entire Institute. This brings the amount awarded to $22 million over the 12-year life of the program. Besides supporting faculty, these funds also provide meaningful educational opportunities for students. The majority of GSF teams include students from MIT and international collaborators, bolstering both their research portfolios and global experience.

“This project has had important impact on my grad student’s education and development. She was able to apply techniques she has learned to a new and challenging system, mentor an international student, participate in a major international meeting, and visit CEA,” says Professor of Chemistry Elizabeth Nolan, a 2017 GSF awardee.

On top of these academic and research goals, students are actively broadening their cultural experience and scope. “The environment at CEA differs enormously from MIT because it is a national lab and because lab structure and graduate education in France is markedly different than at MIT,” Nolan continues. “At CEA, she had the opportunity to present research to distinguished international colleagues.”

These impactful partnerships unite faculty teams behind common goals to tackle worldwide challenges, helping to develop solutions that would not be possible without international collaboration. 2017 GSF winner Emilio Bizzi, professor emeritus of brain and cognitive sciences and emeritus investigator at the McGovern Institute, articulated the advantage of combining these individual skills within a high-level team. “The collaboration among researchers was valuable in sharing knowledge, experience, skills and techniques … as well as offering the probability of future development of systems to aid in rehabilitation of patients suffering TBI.”

The research opportunities that grow from these seed funds often lead to published papers and additional funding leveraged from early results. The next call for proposals will be in mid-May.

MISTI creates applied international learning opportunities for MIT students that increase their ability to understand and address real-world problems. MISTI collaborates with partners at MIT and beyond, serving as a vital nexus of international activity and bolstering the Institute’s research mission by promoting collaborations between MIT faculty members and their counterparts abroad.","MIT faculty share their creative and technical talent on campus as well as across the globe, compounding the Institute’s impact through strong international partnerships.

A new approach, based on effective collaboration, is essential to the successful implementation of public policy priorities.

At the recent national Human Settlements Indaba, held on 6 March 2020, Minister Lindiwe Sisulu asked those present to commit to a declaration of collaboration. In this regard, the minister was reinforcing the message from President Cyril Ramaphosa that we need a whole-of-society approach in order to achieve our developmental goals. Ramaphosa emphasised in the recent State of the Nation Address that government cannot solve societal challenges on its own: “It is through partnership and cooperation that we progress.”

The president has asked South Africans to work more collaboratively and to do development differently.

This is not a new call. It’s not the first time we are talking about partnerships and collaboration. Concepts like “cooperative governance” and “integrated development planning” have been around for a long time. Why have these approaches not always produced positive results?

Based on an evaluation of 20 years of partnering practice in South Africa – what works and what doesn’t – here are 10 steps towards a new partnering approach which, in our experience, results in more successful implementation of public policy objectives:

Partnering is about stepping into action. This is why it is helpful to focus on “partnering” (the verb), an action word, rather than “partnerships” (the noun), which tends to get bogged down with protracted discussions about governance structures. Partnering is not about setting up more structures for coordination and more forums for dialogue; rather, it’s about organising better delivery systems and accelerating implementation by being clear with every plan or commitment we make: who needs to work together to make this happen, and, how are we going to work better together in practice? Partnerships don’t work well if they are vague and non-specific. Trying to partner with everyone on everything is not effective. Partnerships work best if they focus on specific issues and targeted spaces where people and institutions are required to work together. Spatial transformation and human settlements development, for example, make up a complex system with multiple components, situated in government, the market and society. There are many interdependencies within the system. It follows that improving the relationships in the system is critical for success. A new partnering approach needs to unblock barriers to implementation, specifically by addressing relationships that have become dysfunctional or toxic, transforming non-collaborative attitudes, behaviours and mindsets, and overcoming the diabolical combination of silos and egos. Partnering is not only about building relationships between government and non-government stakeholders. A new partnering approach also needs to focus on getting the government to work better together with government, transversely – across silos, sector departments and entities, and inter-governmentally – between spheres of government and across political and administrative boundaries. Without an effective “whole of government” approach, a “whole of society” approach will be elusive. Specifically, for example, in terms of delivering human settlements priorities, we need to find better ways to manage concurrent powers, and functions between national and provincial governments. Doing development differently requires us to shift our approach in three ways: From weak coordination and nominal or token cooperation to active collaboration.

From non-responsive planning and inflexible implementation systems to adaptive planning and implementation, for example, get the starter conditions in place and step into action, rather than wait for the perfect plan, and before too long, reflect, learn, adjust and adapt the plan. This will mean continuing to reform our inflexible public sector compliance frameworks.

From command and control attitudes to collaborative leadership. It’s important to embrace the difference. Partners don’t have to agree on everything in order to be able to work together. In a partnering process, stakeholders can have different and even competing interests. An effective partnering process is able to identify overlapping interests, bring these together into a common agenda and turn this into joint action. The optimal goal of a new partnering approach is to be able to combine collaboration in the “top-down” mandating and authorising environment of government – politics, policies, powers, plans, people and budgets, with collaboration in the “bottom-up” mobilising environment of business and civil society – activism, volunteerism, self-help, impact investment, entrepreneurs, local knowledge and ideas. Aligning the relationships between the “top-down” and “bottom-up” environments can generate the extra energy needed to drive implementation. John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961 inspired people to see the importance of civic action and public service. His historic words, “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country,” challenged citizens to contribute in some way to the public good. Similarly, a partnership cannot be based only on what the government must do to empower its partners, but how each and every partner is contributing to the common good. A genuine partnership exists when there is shared risk and reward, and mutual accountability, between the partners. If only one of the partners is taking the risks, or reaping the rewards, then this is not a partnership. Non-government stakeholders, such as NGOs, community-based organisations, faith-based organisations, youth and women’s groups et cetera, operate most effectively at the local level. National partnering agreements are important for setting the right tone, but need to be turned into collective impact at the precinct and neighbourhood level. Municipalities, supported by provinces and national government, need to be encouraged and empowered to initiate, and participate in local partnering processes. Those working in a system such as human settlements development need to be able to both manage the things they control directly, and influence institutions and behaviours that they don’t control. You can’t influence other people and institutions in the system if you are not in trusted relationships with them. Relationship building is sometimes characterised as a soft issue, needing soft skills. Relationships are in fact the hardest, but most essential part of the system to get right. This is why building collaborative leadership capabilities, and challenging non-collaborative attitudes, behaviours and mindsets, is central to implementing a new partnering strategy. DM

Power Africa / Xaume Olleros Power Africa helps provide first-time electricity access to homes and businesses in Africa. Here, a young boy studies under a solar lantern at his home in Senegal in October 2017.

“Se fue la luz!” (The power went out!) was the first Spanish phrase I learned as a 16-year-old exchange student in the Dominican Republic in 1987. Power outages were frequent and unpredictable. Of course, lack of electricity was not the only challenge for Dominicans at the time: They also endured weak education and health care systems, a large gap between the wealthy and the poor, and an absence of critical infrastructure throughout the country, among other things.

My experiences in the Dominican Republic—more than 30 years ago, and living with the minister of public works’ family no less—sparked my lifelong interest in economic development. I realized then that access to electricity is fundamental to the social and economic development of any country. Power provides light for children to study into the night. Power gives farmers tools to increase and improve agricultural output. And in the Dominican Republic, it lets Presidente beers chill to just above freezing while merengue and bachata blare over loudspeakers until the morning hours, keeping thousands of small businesses thriving.

Power is life and a cornerstone of economic development.

Answering the Call

Power Africa Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at left, and Power Africa Coordinator Andrew Herscowitz sign an MOU in Jerusalem in December 2017 for increased cooperation between the government of Israel and Power Africa to increase access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa.

What I didn’t know then was that, years later, power would be at the core of my work. After a career with a law firm, I joined the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2001 and a year later found myself back in the Dominican Republic, working as a Foreign Service officer. Given my earlier experience with electricity outages there, I was thrilled to work on a project with the National Rural Electrification Cooperative Association to expand rural electrification, introduce modern metering, and attract private sector financing for the metering project.

My work with USAID took me from the Dominican Republic to Peru and, in 2013, to Ecuador, where I served as the mission director. There, as I visited a project in the Galapagos Islands one sunny day, I received a phone call. The proposal was immense: Help develop and lead an ambitious initiative to bring the U.S. government’s collective resources to bear to increase electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa. Days later, I was on a plane to begin what has been an incredible journey, working with more than 170 public and private-sector partners to help bring first-time electricity to more than 74 million people through “Power Africa.”

Power Africa aims to double access to electricity in sub- Saharan Africa to improve lives, strengthen economies, and help people emerge from poverty with self-reliance and dignity. More than 570 million people in Africa are without access to electricity. Power Africa’s goal is to drive power projects that will provide more than 30,000 megawatts (MW) of new power generation and help create 60 million new electricity connections for homes and businesses by 2030. If you estimate that there are, on average, five people per household, reaching Power Africa’s goal means turning lights on for approximately 300 million people.

This great challenge held great opportunity, so in August 2013 my family and I moved to Nairobi, Kenya, home to Power Africa’s first headquarters and the first-ever U.S. presidential initiative to be headquartered outside of Washington, D.C.

The Power Africa Model: An Interagency Approach

Though the U.S. government has advised countries on electricity access for years, Power Africa’s approach is different. Flipping the traditional development model on its head, we have taken a demand-driven, transactional approach. We look at actual transactions between the private-sector entities working in the energy sector—such as investors, local entrepreneurs and manufacturers—and governments to identify obstacles, from environmental to regulatory, that prevent these transactions from moving forward. And we use the power of diplomacy to level the playing field for U.S. investments in the energy sector.

The program is field-driven and has a broad geographic scope. Led by USAID, the 12 U.S. government agencies that implement Power Africa activities have provided financing and technical assistance to support the power sector in 40 countries over the past six years. We maintain a robust “boots on the ground” presence with hundreds of dedicated power experts situated around the continent. In short, we are a team of roving diplomats, bankers, and technical experts, all focused on the same mission—increasing access to electricity.

Power Africa aims to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa so as to improve lives, strengthen economies, and help people emerge from poverty with self-reliance and dignity.

The key to success is effective coordination across multiple U.S. government agencies. The Power Africa Coordinator’s Office established and leads a regular interagency working group where we discuss openly the challenges and opportunities to reach our shared mission. While each agency has its own resources to support Power Africa’s mission, some agency resources are limited, and USAID frequently works through the Coordinator’s Office to help different agencies step up their efforts. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, for example, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on power compacts in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the Coordinator’s Office funded two deal teams that helped the Overseas Private Investment Corporation far exceed its initial commitment of financing $2 billion, with a current deal pipeline of more than $2.5 billion.

The Coordinator’s Office has staff dedicated to liaise full time with agencies to ensure we have the best information and tools available to help partner countries and private-sector developers overcome obstacles and get power project deals done. Businesses and governments can knock on one door to draw on an array of tools from across the U.S. government. Assistance ranges from mitigating risk and promoting exports to designing new policies and regulations, and even teaching households how to read an electricity meter. If there’s a tool out there that can help a project move forward, we find it, learn about it, and inform businesses and governments about it. We want to get deals across the finish line and turn lights on for people and businesses as quickly as possible.

Early on, we recognized that even the U.S. government does not have all the tools and resources necessary to achieve our ambitious goals, so we reached out to international partners for help. After our first year, Sweden committed $1 billion to Power Africa’s efforts and even established its own Swedish interagency Power Africa team. The World Bank committed $5 billion, and the African Development Bank committed $3 billion—and both entities have already exceeded their original commitments. Our partners also include the governments of Israel, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Canada, the U.K., France, Japan and the European Union.

Power Africa actively recruits private-sector partners to help achieve our goals. These partners are required to commit to supporting Power Africa goals by adding new megawatts, new connections, or financing essential energy infrastructure. Currently, Power Africa counts more than 150 companies and nongovernmental organizations among its partners, of which 75 are U.S. companies.

The dedication of the extended U.S. government Power Africa team and its partners is palpable, because we all recognize that access to electricity underpins development efforts across all sectors and advances economic prosperity and self-reliance.

One significant obstacle to advancing power projects is the absence of enforced laws and regulations that support transparent practices. Power Africa works closely with governments and regulators to institute reforms and create the right conditions to attract investment, and it’s succeeding.

In Nigeria, for example, a major gas project poised to bring power to a million people was stalled due to a legal position taken by the country’s previous attorney general. He wanted any disputes to be resolved in Nigeria, rather than via an international tribunal; but no lenders would invest with this condition. In response, Power Africa rallied our partners to elevate the issue and focused efforts on a state visit by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari to the United States. A week after President Buhari returned to Nigeria, the attorney general changed his position. That decision allowed the private sector to commit to the project. Phase 1 of the project was commissioned in May 2018 and is now delivering reliable electricity to Nigeria’s national grid.

What’s important to note here is that our intervention on this one particular deal in one particular country helped many other power projects across the continent. Our work to facilitate this reform created a legal model for other deals, making them attractive to private-sector investment. When we overcome an obstacle to one deal, it is not uncommon that other deals will benefit from Power Africa’s work.

As China becomes an increasingly important player in African infrastructure, including in the energy sector, Power Africa is rallying the tools of the U.S. government to improve the business climate for American companies and investors, help African public and private partners develop energy plans and procurement policies that account for critical factors beyond lowest cost, and streamline collaboration between like-minded partners. With the recent launch of Prosper Africa, another U.S. government initiative coordinated by USAID to advance two-way trade between the United States and the African continent, Power Africa can further its progress by working hand in hand with the private sector and African partners to achieve lasting development outcomes and expand investment opportunities.

The Power Africa model is producing results and attracting public and private investment commitments to the African energy sector. Through Power Africa, the United States has mobilized more than $56 billion in commitments from the public and private sectors, of which more than $40 billion comes from private companies.

Progress Across Many Sectors

We recently met a man in Kenya, Morris, whose life has markedly improved because of Power Africa. Morris owns a barbershop on Ndeda Island in Lake Victoria. In 2018 the American company Renewvia Energy, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and USAID finalized a wind and solar mini-grid project on the island. Nearly 10,000 residents and businesses now have a safe and reliable source of power. Morris’ profits have increased by more than 50 percent, and his ability to support his family has improved greatly—so much so that he is able to sponsor two of his brothers in their education. Morris told us that he hopes his brothers will use their education to make better lives for themselves. He says that more Kenyans are visiting the island, and predicts that the village will grow and add many more shops, services and jobs to the local economy.

We know that energy solutions save lives. When the Ebola epidemic hit Liberia in 2014, Power Africa deployed emergency generators that allowed health clinics to provide 24-hour care, which helped treat patients and stem the outbreak. One of our projects in rural Liberia powered approximately 200 households, streetlights, and public facilities, including a school, clinic, community center and cooperative office. Electrification strengthened the rural community’s resilience and ability to bounce back after the devastating losses from Ebola.

Power Africa’s approach is different. Flipping the traditional development model on its head, we have taken a demand-driven, transactional approach.

Power Africa also creates political and economic opportunities for Americans. Access to reliable sources of electricity helps people, businesses and countries emerge from poverty and create more stable economies; and this, in turn, opens trade opportunities for U.S. businesses. It is estimated, for example, that General Electric has exported more than $250 million worth of equipment from the United States since Power Africa’s launch, helping secure 1,500 American jobs. A small company in Ohio, Rickly Hydro, estimates that 40 percent of its 25-person workforce was dedicated to filling an equipment order for a Power Africa project in Tanzania.

Power Africa is making a difference across all sectors—from health and education to gender and agriculture. To date, we have helped close 126 deals that will generate more than 10,000 MW of new and critically needed electricity, nearly half of which (4,000 MW) is already operational and turning lights on across the continent. Collectively, these 126 transactions that have reached financial close are worth more than $20 billion, real money from the private sector disbursed in support of our development goals.

Power Africa has a number of important achievements to its credit. The program:

established nearly 16 million new electricity connections for homes and businesses that provide first-time access for roughly 74 million people. With every new connection, comes dignity, self-reliance and economic promise.

facilitated the first-ever independent power producer transactions in Malawi, Ethiopia and Senegal, paving the way for enterprise-driven development in those countries.

helped electricity distribution companies in Nigeria dramatically reduce their losses and increase revenues, which strengthens power delivery and improves the health of the entire energy sector.

created the Power Africa Tracking Tool, a mobile app that monitors power project deals across sub-Saharan Africa. With a simple tap, our partners, potential investors and the general public can find details on more than 900 deals representing upwards of 80,000 MW of installed electric power.

Our most important partners are African governments, particularly those committed to advancing energy sector reforms. Together, we are reducing barriers to investment and moving projects from financial close to production of electricity, lighting up homes and strengthening economies. Power Africa represents American economic diplomacy and development policy at its best, working across U.S. agencies, public and private-sector partners and African governments to promote a shared mission that has the potential to change millions of lives for the better.

Our team is proud that the U.S. government is replicating or adapting the Power Africa model to shape new initiatives, such as the administration’s USAID-led Prosper Africa and Department of State–led Asia EDGE initiatives. As the new U.S. Development Finance Corporation is launched, lessons are being drawn from Power Africa’s experience to ensure seamless interagency collaboration. We have accomplished much to date, but have a long way to go. Our model is working, and we look forward to hearing the chorus “lights on” in every language across Africa.

""Government and public clients are long-term, stable and responsible, and we have decades of a successful track record serving them.""

In 2009, Swinerton formalized a joint venture with Griffin Structures, a development and program management firm, to focus wholly on public-private partnerships. The resulting entity, Griffin|Swinerton, has rapidly become a leader in designing, developing and delivering P3 projects across California, from libraries to community centers to arenas to entire civic districts. The group has more than $600M worth of projects in its pipeline.

For its employees, the projects that Griffin|Swinerton completes are especially meaningful because of the public benefits they bring to a whole city or county.

The midcentury modern feel is typical of the Italian furniture maker and its design collaborator, renowned French visionary Philippe Starck. But that sleek matte finish hides a secret: a unique partnership between human and machine.

The so-called AI Chair was created using generative design, a form of artificial intelligence that can devise hundreds of design alternatives from a single idea.

Developed by U.S. tech giant Autodesk, generative design uses simulation analysis to explore all possible solutions to a given challenge. In Kartell's case, that challenge was creating a desirable piece of furniture made solely from the scraps of its own industrial production.

“It’s not a question of simply creating a product that seems green, but of generating an industrial strategy that involves the entire manufacturing process,” Claudio Luti, chairman of Kartell, said in a statement.

The 100 percent recycled piece is a first for a company that's been a household name in contemporary furniture since the 1960s. And what is one small step for Kartell may prove to be one giant leap for the product design field, as companies from the auto sector to the architecture space eye generative design as a means of improving performance and sustainability.

Today's product design process goes something like this: Designers get a brief from their client, outlining the goals, timing and budget for a given project, and they mock up a handful of concepts. One or two ideas move on to physical testing, and the team continues to iterate on those concepts until it's time to go to production.

""With generative design, you can start right from the brief, input your goals and constraints, and arrive at hundreds of design options within minutes,"" Arthur Harsuvanakit, a senior designer on Autodesk’s industry research team, told TriplePundit.

""The biggest benefit is to quickly validate a design intention and a designer's assumptions of how things will perform. You get to more optimal designs faster without having to do physical testing,"" he explained. ""It speeds things up. It saves on material. And it saves on prototype time.""

The ability to speed up the design process has huge benefits for sustainability, Harsuvanakit added. ""You can cover much more possibilities from the very beginning, and that allows you to consider things you might not have been able to consider using the traditional approach.""

The wide variety of options afforded by generative design allow engineers and designers to eliminate excess material, consolidate parts and components, and create the possibility for more uniform materials, which can ease recyclability at end of life. ""If a product is multi-material or too complex to disassemble, it's usually going to end up in the trash. If it’s mono-material, there’s a higher possibility for recyclability,"" Harsuvanakit explained.

Additionally, as new sustainable and recycled-content materials come to market every day, the ability to test their performance in a virtual environment can help them get into products faster, he said. ""There's definitely a stigma of recycled plastics being not as high-performing in both structure and aesthetics compared to virgin plastics, for example. The more data we can gather about those recycled materials, the more we can bring truth to those assumptions.""

From car parts to buildings: Unlocking the potential of generative design

After more than five years of incubation and study within Autodesk's industry research department, generative design is now on the open market as part of the Fusion 360 platform for designers and engineers.

A recent collaboration with General Motors further tested its potential. “Generative design is a way for us to explore different design solutions for parts and components of our vehicles by using the cloud and artificial intelligence to combine the engineer and the computer,” Kevin Quinn, GM's director of additive design and manufacturing, told Autodesk. “By getting them to work together, we can come up with part-design solutions that would be impossible to generate with either the computer or the engineer working on their own.”

In one example, GM engineers used the AI-driven platform to create an optimized seat bracket, which secures seatbelt fasteners to car seats and seats to floors, reducing eight individual pieces down to one. In another, they created a new stabilizer component that combined 27 pieces into a single piece, cutting weight by 42 percent.

The motivation to cut down on individual components is twofold, Quinn said. “One, we can optimize for mass. But another ancillary benefit is that you’re reducing all the supply-chain costs associated with having many different parts that may be made by many different suppliers, which then have to all be joined together.""

(Image: Using generative design, GM engineers reduced eight components in a vehicle seat bracket down to a single piece.)

Further, the new parts were created in-house using industrial-scale 3D printing (known in the industry as additive manufacturing), again cutting supply-chain costs. And with weight reduction potential of 40 percent or more, it's easy to see how generative design could aid in GM's plans to roll out more electric and fuel-efficient vehicles.

“If we can use generative design and additive manufacturing to give another mile per gallon of fuel economy or to extend by 10 miles the range of our electric vehicles, that can be a huge competitive advantage for General Motors going forward,” Quinn said.

Volkswagen also used generative design to develop an all-electric doppelgänger of its 1962 Microbus. And Stamhuis, a Dutch firm specializing in retail shop construction and renovations, put the system to the test on an even larger scale. Using Project Refinery, an Autodesk generative design beta for the architecture, engineering and construction industry, Stamhuis engineers created 40 design options for a retail liquor store in only 15 minutes.

The best may be yet to come

Generative design is still in the very early phases, and the functionality is still growing, Harsuvanakit said. But, as case studies like GM and Stamhuis demonstrate, engineers and designers already have a lot of options in terms of leveraging AI to speed up their work, improve performance and lessen environmental impact.

""There's very relevant information that exists today to make sustainable choices using generative design, and I think it's also a matter of communicating to the designer what is a sustainable choice,"" Harsuvanakit told us. ""There's always a tradeoff: What happens to cost when you change a material? What is the environmental impact? To get metrics on those things and bring them to the stakeholders who are producing the product, that’s a really powerful way to tackle these challenges that hasn’t been done before.""

It aims to shed light on the varying roles and companies across the buzzing industry.

This week we speak to Partnerize partnerships director APAC Kieryn Cowan.

Time at the company:

I joined Partnerize in early 2019 to lead our Asia Pacific partnership strategy across publishers, technology companies and agency partners.

How would you describe what the company does?

Partnerize is a SaaS partner automation platform. We help brands and retailers form and grow all partnerships, from affiliates to influencers and strategic brand partners. By using automation to streamline partner management and applying AI to challenges like optimization, forecasting and fraud, we help brands get more revenue and profit from partner relationships. What makes us different is this idea of intelligent partner automation.

An example of the sort of feature that sets us apart in this way is Intelligent Partner Discovery. Companies can find their “best next” business partners with the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It’s a breakthrough technology for smarter partner recruitment.

What do you do day-to-day?

My day-to-day focus is across APAC as a whole. And the range of things I do in a day is often just as broad. To give you some insight, I can spend my morning running a workshop with our technology partners on a go-to-market strategy, then an onboarding and training webinar with one of our key agency partners, and then I might finish my day working with publishers across the region, ensuring everything is running smoothly and providing product updates.

Define your job in one word:

Diverse.

I got into martech because:

The whole reason I got into martech is because it’s driven so much by data and insights. It about applying lessons and learnings from data and helping people get the very best results from those insights. These days, martech shapes the decisions we make. What brought me into Partnerize specifically is that the partnership channel is going through a dramatic growth period, and I wanted to be a part of the journey.

What’s the biggest challenge you face in your role?

I work across three partner channels, across eight different countries, and each market has its own different nuances. Although that’s my biggest challenge, It’s also one of the things I enjoy most about the role, because it is truly diverse. It’s never the same day twice.

What’s the biggest industry-wide challenge you’d like to see tackled?

There are so many challenges to address - fraud, attribution - just to name a couple. But for me, automation is the most important because that’s what truly enables growth. The more you can automate your day-to-day work, the more you can focus on strategy and creating powerful new partnerships—that’s where true growth comes from.

Previous industry related companies you have worked at:

I’ve got a bit of a different introduction to the corporate world than most. I spent my earlier years travelling the globe with an ice hockey team, and then navigating it as a professional sailor. It was on a Sydney-to-Hobart race that I first mentioned my passion for tech, and the owner of the boat told me to take a leap (not literally) and go for it. Seven years later and I’ve worked for incredible tech brands including dataxu, Domain.com.au, and Snakk Media.

Who has been a great mentor to you and why?

I’m lucky to have always had great mentors around me. I always learned a lot from my dad growing up about making smart business decisions and being adaptable. I’m now lucky to have our global SVP Partnerships Anshu Khurana, who is not only commercially a great mentor, but also always looking for what’s next.

Words of advice for someone wanting a job like yours?

Don’t necessarily think your expertise is only relevant to one industry. You can always bring business concepts and learnings to multiple different channels.As you learn, think about the lessons and how they can help guide you in other, broader areas.

For the partnerships industry specifically, you’re in luck because there are many different kinds of companies and ways to be involved. Brands, partners, and solutions providers are just three of the key roles in our space. Agencies, related tech, influencers—they all play important and unique roles. Even if you haven’t directly worked in partnerships, if you’re people-first and strategically-minded, you can succeed.

If I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd be:

Exploring ways to achieve my goals and pursue my own company.

My mantra is:

As a Kiwi, this has always stuck with me… “Do the mahi, get the treats.”

My favourite advert is:

It’s not one advert specifically, but I loved the advertising for the RUOK campaign. For me, something with such a powerful message is the most important.

Music and TV streaming habits. What do you subscribe to?

I’m really big on podcasts. I’m currently listening to a great start-up podcast series by Gimlet Media. I also love some good kiwi music such as Six60.

Tell us one thing people at work don’t know about you?

I’ve travelled the world representing New Zealand in ice hockey. My last championship was in Bulgaria and I was named MVP.

In five years’ time I'll be:

To be honest, the industry is so fast-paced, I’m excited to not know where I’ll be. All I do know is I’ll definitely still be a part of the tech industry.

This was stated by Chairman HEC Tariq Banuri while addressing a networking get-together with a delegation of the charity-based UK-Pakistan Science Innovation Global Network (UPSIGN) and United Kingdom Research & Innovation (UKRI) held at the Commission Secretariat.

The UPSGISN and UKRI are jointly holding three global development workshops in Islamabad. The third of this series of workshops is being held tomorrow, March 12, 2020. Over 150 academics from the UK, Pakistan and across the region have travelled to Islamabad to take part in the workshops, addressing sustainable development challenges linked to Food Security, Agriculture & Nutrition; Affordable Healthcare; and, Clean and Affordable Energy/Water in Pakistan and the Region. The workshops are aimed at creating and fostering new relationships and developing new networks to address challenges aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Chairman HEC stressed the need for efforts to bring people together, stating that education is the main vehicle to bring people together. He observed that the world has now realized that the problems prevailing all over, including terrorism, COVID-19, and poverty etc, are of similar nature and they need to be tackled through mutual collaboration. “The world is witnessing the growing trend of efforts for global peace, as there is awareness that the fundamental and central goal should be peace.” He noted that war used to be considered the greatest source of glory in the past, however it is now seen as an evil.

He welcomed UPSIGN workshops in Pakistan. He maintained that the workshop themes are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which have been outlined after a long process of thinking. Pakistan and the United Kingdom have a lot of potential for collaboration. He urged the UPSIGN delegation to consider triangular partnerships with Pakistan, involving any third country to help resolve its problems. He said the triangular partnerships have greater potential under budget constraints. “Solving their problems may help us learn how to solve our problems,” he added. He said HEC is keen to benefit the ability to imitate those who resolve their problems.

The first workshop of the series called “Food Security, Agriculture & Nutrition”, focused on the issues related to food security and challenges faced by food production in Pakistan, e.g. development of system solutions to address malnutrition through maximized dietary diversity and quality. The workshop also discussed strategies to tackle the spread of diseases from livestock to humans (Zoonotic Disease) and the overuse of antibiotics for livestock in Pakistan. The workshop also explored the development of integrated pest management strategies for the control of insect pests of economic and health importance.

The workshop on Affordable Healthcare covered topics on Health, Gender and Mental Health and Reproductive Health, in addition to issues experienced by children and adolescents and their impact in mental health. Other topics within the scope included bio-materials and regenerative medicine for developing low-cost healthcare solutions for the management of wounds and injuries.

The third workshop on Clean and Affordable Energy/Water will discuss issues and solutions to Pakistan’s key challenges as a water-stressed but heavily water-dependent economy. Surface water supplies are variable and have been declining over the past decade. Pakistan is home to the world’s second most over-stressed aquifer, yet it is the world’s top groundwater exporting country.

Chairman UPSIGN Prof Jawwad Dar shed light on the role of UPSIGN as a bridge between Pakistan and the UK higher education sectors. He said UPSIGN, structured as an executive group and academics, is a registered charity entity working on partnerships for mutual benefit. He said the UPSIGN seeks to improve ‘’Communication, Coordination and Cooperation’’ between the Pakistan and UK academics and institutions on all levels from universities, public and private organisations, business sector, and Non-Government Organisations. It has aligned its efforts to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

UKRI Lead Prof Nicola said, “UKRI is excited to work in Pakistan to address challenges aligned to the UNSDGs (UNSDGs (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals), indeed, UKRI has allocated a total of £1.5b for research in partnership with low and middle income countries to address such challenges through the Global Challenges Research Fund.” UKRI is investing up to £200k (PKR. 40 million) on these workshops alone.

Co-Founder UPSIGN Dr Khalid Mahmood said, “this is an exciting time where top universities and research institutes are taking part in the workshops. This includes researchers from more than 30 UK universities and research Institutes.”","Education is the vanguard of international collaboration and the Higher Education Commission (HEC) is fully committed to solution-oriented academic and research partnerships with foreign entities.

The emergence of the ISL as the premier league in India, rewarded with a place in the prestigious AFC Champions League group stage for the first time, has coincided with some inspiring performances from youngsters and some striking partnerships, both on and off the field. (More Football News)

First for the youngsters. Let's start with Sumit Rathi. The 20-year-old central defender for ATK has made a place in Antonio Habas' starting XI his own, ever since he came into the team with his fearless defending.

In a star-studded team, he made 11 appearances and started 10 of them as part of a stingy ATK defence that conceded just 18 goals in 20 matches.

Bengaluru FC's Suresh Wangjam is yet another youngster who earned rave reviews for his performances. He was blooded in by Carles Cuadrat midway through the season and the 19-year-old has since become a regular fixture.

""He (Suresh) has been helping us a lot. He is doing a wonderful job. He was creating chances in attack and helping in defence. He is having an impressive season. I am sure that he will soon have an opportunity in the national team as well,"" said Cuadrat, lavish in his praise for the youngster.

FC Goa's Manvir Singh, Jeakson Thounaojam, Mohammad Rakip (Kerala Blasters) Redeem Tlang (NorthEast United FC), Shubham Sarangi (Odisha FC) are few other examples of youngsters catching the eye.

The foreign imports, too, have been of high quality with several of them striking up partnerships that have illuminated the ISL.

Roy Krishna and David Williams have been absolutely brilliant for one of the finalists, ATK. The Fiji-Aussie combo has fired when ATK needed them, most recently in the play-offs against Bengaluru FC where Krishna scored one and Williams struck two. Krishna has contributed 15 goals and five assists while Williams has seven goals and four assists to his name.

""It is good for us to have top strikers like Krishna and Williams. They are in good form and that is a big advantage for us,"" said ATK coach Antonio Habas.

Then there is Rafael Crivellaro and Nerijus Valskis for the other finalists, Chennaiyin FC. The duo was instrumental in their dream run to the final. While Valskis has 14 goals and six assists, Crivellaro has seven goals and eight assists.

Who can forget Hugo Boumous (11 goals, 10 assists) and Ferran Corominas (14 goals, 4 assists)? Their telepathic understanding helped FC Goa top the league stages. The partnership between Bartholomew Ogbeche (15 goals) and Raphael Messi Bouli (8 goals) also produced dividends for Kerala Blasters, although they could not make it to the play-offs.

However, it is not just on-field partnerships that have sparkled. Several key off-field agreements have illustrated the league as well. The City Football Group, who own Manchester City, bought a majority stake in Mumbai City FC, a landmark deal in the progress it would bring to Indian football.

""We believe that this investment will deliver transformative benefits to Mumbai City FC, to City Football Group and to Indian football as a whole. City Football Group is committed to the future of football in India and to the potential for Mumbai City FC within that future,"" said Chairman of City Football Group Khaldoon Al Mubarak.

Then ATK joined hands with Mohun Bagan which will see the century-old club ply its trade in the ISL next season.

All in all, it has been an exciting and eventful season. All it requires is a fitting finale in Goa on Saturday.

Huawei Technologies and Russian banking giant Sberbank announced on Tuesday a new strategic partnership on providing cloud computing services for Russian businesses.

Yevgeny Kolbin, SberCloud CEO, said that the ""exclusive offer"" consisted of complementary cloud services to provide clients with a ""unified convenient approach of using these services"".

Wang Wei, Huawei's general director, said that the partnership was ""really important"".

""Huawei provides SberCloud with not only most progressive comprehensive cloud technology, but also transfer international expertise. We are sure that businesspersons will appreciate this solution and it will become a great contribution to the digital transformation of Russia,” he added.

The news comes as Sberbank, which also has partnerships with Russian internet giants Yandex and Mail.ru, transitions from banking to online services to meet its digital goals, according to German Gref, Sberbank CEO.

International Partnerships With Huawei Grow Amid US Trade War on China

Huawei has inked several deals with partner nations in recent years, namely after launching a research and development centre in Canada in response to restrictions from Washington, as well as an 'Innovation and Experience' centre in the United Kingdom.

British and Irish app developers have also received a boost in investments from the Chinese telecoms giant after the company pledged £20m to help coders upload their apps to Huawei's Mobile Services platform, among other incentives.

​Huawei also joined Spanish renewable energy firm X-Elio to build 11 projects projects across the European country, with the Chinese firm providing end-to-end technologies to help monitor solar plant systems, representing a major milestone in the Spanish renewable energy industry, Huawei announced in late February.

Lluis Noguera, CEO of X-Elio, said at the time: ""We are very satisfied with the cooperation. This joint innovation project with Huawei is a result of X-Elio's commitment to bringing on-line eco-friendly solar energy projects. This new solution with Huawei will enhance the sustainable development of Spanish electricity system.""

The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government, which both Huawei and Beijing have sharply and repeatedly denied. The news comes as US officials press international partners with the Chinese telecoms giant to use alternatives such as Ericsson and Nokia to curb Huawei's influence, despite recent revelations that the US used a Swiss encryption firm to spy on 120 nations for decades using backdoor technologies.","Huawei Technologies and Russian banking giant Sberbank announced on Tuesday a new strategic partnership on providing cloud computing services for Russian businesses.

They were meant to be together forever? Partnerships, regardless of the type and depth of the relationship, fail for many different reasons. People engage in partnerships because multiples are most often better than singular. Partnerships start out very optimistic and ambitions; few envision failure. Knowing the top reasons why many partnerships fail might prepare you to avoid a partnership failure in future. There are many different types and levels of partnerships including business, short-term, marital, political and non-profit.

Why Do Once Upon A Time Perfect Partnerships Fail?

No Strategy or Poor Strategy . This is usually caused by intense excitement in the early stages of the partnership. So intense is the excitement that it doesn’t matter where or how they’re moving as long as they’re moving together at that point in time. Overtime, once the excitement dwindles, lack of direction and mixed input and output leads to a failing partnership.

Many fail to keep up with the brand promises they established early in the partnership. They promoted perfection but deep within, there was little to be happy or perfect about.

87,https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/top-10-strike-partnerships/179446,"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Sportinglife.com,Who are the best striker partnerships? We look at the Top 10 best goal-scoring combinations in Premier League history,"Playing two up front may have gone out of fashion, but there were some devastating partnerships down the years. We look at the top 10.

Whether it’s the classic big man-little man combination, the finisher and the runner, the number 10 and the number nine, everybody loved the two-man forward line that seems to have drifted out of the game now – let’s look back at some of the best. The advancement of football tactics, the changing of the guard in football coaches has seen the formation 4-4-2 seem like a dirty word these days. A Mike Bassett of a formation in a world of intricate Pep Guardiola-like ideals of playing out from the back, false nines, front threes and inverted full-backs. The formations are yielding plenty of goals – Aguero, Sterling and De Bruyne score plenty, with Salah, Mane and Firmino scoring even more, so we may have seen the last of playing two up front. It’s not so long ago though that a top-class combination of two players up front could be just as thrilling, so I’ve picked out ten of the best in the Premier League. Now, not everything is decided on pure goals, there are combinations of players that have scored more than this lot, such as Henry and Pires sticking in 44 and Lampard and Drogba combing for an amazing 51 in 1999/2000. You’d never really class them as strike partnerships though, as you would with the following. As ever though, if you’ve any beef with the selections or want to add your own ideas please get in touch on Twitter @SportingLifeFC or email us here.

Andy Cole & Peter Beardsley (Newcastle 93/94) 55 goals These two could be the ultimate number ten and number nine combo, the supplier and the finisher, as Newcastle became everyone’s second team. The Magpies came third this season in their first campaign back in the top flight, Cole grabbed the Golden Boot with 34 and even Beardsley netted 21 despite mainly setting up Cole. It was a 42-game season, but still a fantastic effort and the way the two combined was glorious. Beardsley could spot a through-ball, and play it, from almost anywhere. While Cole was an ice-cold finisher. The perfect recipe for goals. Luis Suarez & Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool 13/14) 52 goals The year Liverpool almost won the title under Brendan Rodgers came thanks to these two providing a goal-scoring explosion at Anfield – Suarez bagged 31 even though he missed the first five games of the season! Had they had more time together who knows what the Reds could have achieved, but Suarez’s itchy feet and Sturridge’s injury problems limited them.

🏃‍♂️ 160 appearances

⚽️ 68 goals

🔁 26 assists

🤝 SAS - formed THAT partnership with Luis Suarez



Injuries have arguably hampered his time at Anfield, but on his day Daniel Sturridge was brilliant for Liverpool 👏 #LFCpic.twitter.com/Dj7ohGVEAU — Sporting Life Football (@SportingLifeFC) June 4, 2019

That one glorious season, though, everything clicked. Suarez has technical gifts very few can match, and Sturridge back then was one of the best strikers around. Pace, finesse and finishing combined with a real hunger – these two destroyed almost everyone in the league this season. Alan Shearer & Chris Sutton (Blackburn 94/95) 49 goals The original SAS, these two only played together for one season, but that was enough to give Blackburn that memorable title triumph under Kenny Dalglish. There were huge question marks about whether two out-and-out centre forwards could play together, but they prospered when feeding off each other. Shearer bagged 34 and Sutton 15, but plenty of assists too as they proved just too much to handle for many defences. Stopping one of them was hard enough but stopping two proved almost impossible. Alan Shearer & Les Ferdinand (Newcastle 96/97) 49 goals There’s no surprise Shearer’s in here more than once, and there are striking similarities between his combination with Sutton and Ferdinand, as both were questionable fits. ‘Sir Les’ was another proven goalscorer and many wondered if he’d make way when club record signing Shearer arrived in the summer, but they emphatically answered doubts over their suitability. These goals came in tough circumstances as well, with Kevin Keegan quitting in January, still feeling tortured after blowing the league the season before. The Magpies finished second again, and Ferdinand was sold to Spurs before getting another go at enhancing this partnership. Kevin Phillips & Niall Quinn (Sunderland 99/00) 44 goals The big man-little man partnership by which all other big man-little man partnerships would be measured in the Premier League.

🙌 What about @SunderlandAFC big man/little man combo of Quinn & Phillips



🔟 Would they make your Top 10 strike partnerships?pic.twitter.com/R1gt3upxAc — Sporting Life Football (@SportingLifeFC) April 26, 2020

Phillips bagged 30 goals and the Golden Boot in his first ever Premier League season, with many of them coming when feeding off Quinn’s aerial dominance. There was plenty of skill involved, not just knock it down and finish it off – although Peter Reid’s advice to Phillips was reasonably straightforward. “It was one of those partnerships that just happened. We never worked on it in training. All Peter Reid would ever say was just: ‘Work off Quinny, get around Quinny’,” Phillips recalls of the manager’s tactical masterclass. Robbie Fowler & Stan Collymore (Liverpool 95/96) 42 goals This is another partnership that just seemed to click, and just shows you what options up front England had during this spell as in terms of both talent and production you’d think this could have been a brilliant combination for the Three Lions. Both scored twice in the 4-3 Newcastle game that defined this era, and with just a bit more discipline at the back this Liverpool team would have won the league. Collymore is one of those players that perhaps did not achieve everything he could given his natural talents. We know all about Fowler but Stan had everything, a strong, powerful, direct runner, great in the air with two great feet. His crossing ability was also magnificent. Dwight Yorke & Andy Cole (Man Utd 99/00) 41 goals You can’t have a list of striker combinations without Yorke and Cole being involved now can you? Their numbers here aren’t amazing but when you think of the options Man Utd had they’re pretty good. And it wasn’t just Yorke’s 22 goals or Cole’s 19 this season, but their wonderful interplay that made them a joy to watch. The old dummy and one-two finish became a ‘Yorke and Cole special’ in school playgrounds and Sunday league pitches as strikers tried to emulate this most dangerous of attacks. Jurgen Klinsmann & Teddy Sheringham (Tottenham 94/95) 39 goals This is another pairing that was perhaps more easy on the eye than it was devastating in terms of sheer weight of goals, but they meshed so well together they deserve their spot. The Germany bagged 21 and Sheringham 18, but it was more about how they went about their business that was so good to watch. They scored 60 percent of Tottenham’s goals that season as Sheringham showed his creative side while Klinsmann his clinical eye for finishing. Eidur Gudjohnsen & Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (Chelsea 01/02) 37 goals Very much in the Sheringham/Klinsmann mould – Gudjohnsen was superb technically, always had time on the ball and rarely chose the wrong option. Hasselbaink was a powerhouse who would almost take the net off with minimal back lift, making him so tough to handle inside the box. Gudjohnsen was a better finisher, and an all round better player than many gave him credit for while Hasselbaink was a proven goal scorer. Wayne Rooney & Ruud van Nistelrooy (Man Utd 05/06) 37 goals Van Nistelrooy is one of the most natural goalscorers I’ve ever seen, as 95 goals in 150 Premier League games tells you – and this combination with a Rooney able to drop deep was pure perfection.

💕 Best striker partnerships in Premier League history??

88,https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/covid-19-opportunity-reimagine-international-partnerships,"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Times Higher Education (THE),Covid-19 is an opportunity to reimagine international partnerships,"Can impact measures capture the true value of a university? It is a difficult task given that universities are, by their very nature, multifaceted: communities of academics, students and practitioners connected through research, teaching and learning, and outreach.

All of us in the sector are familiar with league tables. Times Higher Education’s Impact Rankings are an attempt to bring in a different emphasis – one that incentivises research that has applied benefit on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), rather than publications in high impact journals.

While impact measures are useful in highlighting universities’ work to create a positive impact on society, it is worth remembering that the work itself is not new. Higher education has always played a critical role in the development of communities and nations. Research produces the knowledge and innovation needed to solve problems and support evidence-based policymaking. Universities strengthen policy and practice at all levels of the education ecosystem from cradle to grave, as well as driving social and economic development. And the third mission sees universities building civic and community engagement with a wide range of partners.

The SDGs are an intergovernmental, legal framework – a set of 17 goals and 150 associated targets for every government to aspire to achieve, and the best chance we have of solving the world’s most pressing problems.

Three global networks – the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), working in partnership with the International Association of Universities and the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie – are at the forefront of promoting the role of higher education in the SDGs at the highest levels, including the UN.

Universities are increasingly using the SDG framework not only to measure their own impact, but also to excite the imagination of their communities about how they can become directly involved. Universities are integrating sustainable development into their operations, incorporating the SDGs into their teaching and curricula, and developing SDG-focused strategies.

The SDGs also provide a mechanism to develop new kinds of partnership to achieve the ambitious targets – embodied by SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Partnerships are key to overcoming barriers to impact, and to addressing the challenges faced within the higher education sector itself.

Higher education is essential to building strong societies. The good news that more people than ever want to go to university is tempered by a lack of qualified staff to meet the massive rise in demand. In Kenya, for example, student enrolment increased eleven-fold in 12 years. Across our diverse network, we see that access to quality higher education is still limited by geography and wealth.

The Partnership for Enhanced and Blended Learning (PEBL) aims to address this issue by enabling universities in east Africa to share scarce teaching resources through quality-assured, credit-bearing modules delivered through blended learning. This successful model could be scaled up to provide the skills needed to transfer teaching to a virtual environment. As the coronavirus pandemic has seen universities switch to online teaching at unprecedented pace and scale globally, blended learning may well become standard practice in Africa and elsewhere and such skills will be in demand.

More than 17,000 students across Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania are currently benefiting from PEBL modules on topics such as numerical analysis and business research methodology and design, and over 150 academics from 24 institutions have been trained in effective blended learning delivery techniques. The project, funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and led by the ACU, is an international collaboration of universities based in the four African countries, drawing on the online learning expertise of other partners.

Research holds the key to solutions to the current crisis – from disease modelling to vaccine development – and again partnerships are a critical element. There are encouraging reports that international collaboration has increased during this time of great need. We need strong domestic and research capacity in order to develop local solutions for global challenges.

The CIRCLE (Climate Impacts Research Capacity and Leadership Enhancement) project, also funded by the DFID and led by the ACU, is strengthening climate change research within sub-Saharan Africa by supporting individual academics as well as working with universities.

All universities and funders have a responsibility to build fair and equitable research collaborations in which benefits and accountability are mutually shared. Equitable partnerships – ones that respond to locally contextualised needs while building the capacity of all those involved – are a key element in ensuring that universities are fully equipped to respond to the SDG agenda.

We are already talking about the long-lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our societies, economies and the higher education sector itself, although the specifics are far from clear. Through all this, we shouldn’t lose sight of the importance of international collaboration.

While we will need to find new ways of working together, in the short term and beyond, we also have an opportunity – to reimagine internationalisation, to strengthen existing partnerships, and to build new ones that have equity as a core principle.

Rankings have a role to play in drawing attention to the work of a diverse range of universities – not just the most research intensive. In this way, we can truly harness the sector’s potential to create meaningful change.

Joanna Newman is chief executive and secretary general of the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

Cruise ships are docked, beaches are closed, and flights are grounded. Thankfully, with a little creativity, that hasn't stopped the School of Diplomacy from virtually bringing students to Geneva and building new programs along the way.

As a result of a recent Memorandum of Understanding, Diplomacy students, alumni, and young professionals preparing for graduate school have been learning directly from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) over the last few weeks. Traditionally offered as a training program designed for new UN staff and diplomats, this behind the scenes opportunity was originally planned as one of the School's immersive international study seminars. When the outbreak of COVID-19 threatened to cancel the program, the two institutions remained dedicated to their initial goals — offering a unique educational experience with benefits for all participants, regardless of their career goals.

""Our collaboration with UNITAR,"" reflects Dean Courtney Smith, ""is giving our students access to the same training that is provided to newly appointed United Nations staff members and member state delegates. This will allow them to build on the knowledge and skills of their School of Diplomacy experience and prepare them to be diplomatic professionals ready to meet the challenges of addressing global problems cooperatively.""

Ms. Silvia Vacchi of UNITAR's Division of Multilateral Diplomacy is equally enthusiastic and forward looking. ""At UNITAR,"" says Vacchi, ""students remain a central focus of our work as they largely represent the current and future generations who will be operating in our societies and use the tools of Diplomacy to conduct work in their respective sectors.""

""This is why,"" she continues,

UNITAR is particularly grateful for the partnership with Seton Hall's School of Diplomacy and International Relations: I truly believe that the synergies that exist between our Division for Multilateral Diplomacy and the highly passionate and motivated students who are attending the course are remarkable. My hope is that these students will benefit greatly from having access to knowledge and skills which are normally only reserved for practitioners, and I am certain that our Institute will benefit from spreading this knowledge outside of the ""elite"" of diplomats and other insiders to achieve the higher goal of engaging stakeholders from all professional, personal, and other backgrounds.

Over the course of four weeks, students will participate in workshops on protocol and etiquette at the United Nations (UN), types and functions of multilateral conferences, cultural and public diplomacy, and negotiation and decision-making through four online modules. As a complement to their online training, participants have the opportunity to hear from additional practitioners and UNITAR officials through a series of weekly webinars on topics such as the Sustainable Development Goals and career development.

Participants will also learn from each other by utilizing discussion forums to not only reflect on their coursework but to relate it to their personal experiences. Upon completion of the four modules, each student will earn an official Certificate of Participation signed by the head of UNITAR, Mr. Nikhil Seth, whose career with the UN spans over 20 years.

""I think that this program is really great,"" notes undergraduate student Jarrett Dang, ""especially because it allows us to interact directly with experts in international relations."" Dang says that he was inspired to participate because he has been working as an intern at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, located across the street from UNHQ. ""Having the opportunity to attend some meetings and events at the UN has been a great privilege,"" he says, ""and I wanted more. I was excited to gain an inside the UN perspective.""

Dang views the material as particularly relevant for all students of Diplomacy, because of its strong applicability. ""The course touches upon crucial aspects of diplomacy that can be applied anywhere,"" he asserts. ""Personally, I hope to apply this knowledge in other internships and throughout my career, whether I pursue work with the U.S. government, the UN system, or at an NGO.""

For those who were energized by their UNITAR training experience, were disappointed to miss it or the cultural aspects in country, fear not - further opportunities for Diplomacy students to study in Geneva lie ahead. Another exciting new partnership, this one with The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies lays the groundwork for a 5-year B.S./M.A. program offered jointly with the Institute.

""Our new B.S./M.A. program with the Graduate Institute,"" says Smith, ""will allow our students to have the best of both worlds. They get to benefit from an undergraduate education located in close proximity to the UN headquarters in New York City and the experience of graduate study in the heart of the UN's social and humanitarian work in Geneva. This combination will prepare them well for their future international careers.""

While in Geneva, Diplomacy students will have the opportunity to live on campus with peers from over 100 countries and enjoy activities like water sports, skiing, museums, and more while pursuing their studies. They will be encouraged to connect through a variety of student organizations, such as Geneva International Model United Nations or the Environmental Committee, all of which fall under the Graduate Institute Student Association. Between practitioner dialogues, alumni panels, and professional development workshops, students will have access to a variety of career enhancement experiences outside the classroom.

Upon completion of the program, students will earn a bachelor's degree from Seton Hall and a master's degree from the Graduate Institute. Similar to the School of Diplomacy's existing 5-year B.S./M.A. program, students will apply for admission to this new program in the fall of their junior year. Program participants spend the fall of their senior year pursuing both undergraduate and graduate studies in Geneva at the Graduate Institute. These credits earned abroad apply towards both the completion of their undergraduate program at Seton Hall and also their graduate program at the Graduate Institute. Students return to Seton Hall in the spring to finish their senior year and then spend all of their fifth year in Geneva.

Smith notes that students don't have long to wait for this program to become a reality. ""We hope to begin accepting applications in the fall of 2020,"" he says, ""and send our first cohort to Geneva in fall 2021. It promises to be an excellent program, and we couldn't be more excited to get started.""

Introduction and summary

Americans face a host of challenges navigating their careers in the 21st century. Corporations increasingly eschew workforce investments that fostered economic stability in previous generations, failing to provide health and retirement benefits as well as on-the-job training. Meanwhile, global competition, app-based technology, and the potential for accelerated automation and the rise of artificial intelligence threaten workers’ ability to stay in a single field over the course of their careers. Yet women and people of color face the greatest obstacles navigating the labor market, as steep gender and racial pay gaps as well as occupational segregation persist, making it difficult for them to find good jobs.

Subscribe to InProgress Subscribe

Policymakers, workforce intermediaries, employers, and worker advocates continue to debate how to correct existing labor market disparities and ensure that 21st century American workers are able to reach the middle class, successfully navigate their careers, and balance work with other responsibilities. Advocates across industries and ideological spectrums point to high-quality training and a nimble workforce investment system as essential components in ensuring that all workers across gender and racial lines are prepared for emerging jobs. Yet today’s public workforce system is ill-prepared to fill this role, and even in forward-looking conversations, the role of the workforce system is relegated to responding to the changing labor market rather than imagining a role for intermediaries in shaping the jobs of the future.

Policy proposals often lack details on how new investments in workforce development will differ from existing interventions that have failed to support equity or real advancement opportunities. Too often, job training programs put the onus on workers themselves to respond to the changing labor market and navigate the increasingly complex workforce system while ignoring the reality that the very training devoted to these fast-growing fields often results in low-paying jobs with poor working conditions.

Workers in many of the fastest-growing occupations in the United States earn poverty wages. Meanwhile, corporations frequently classify workers in emerging fields such as ride-sharing as independent contractors. While many of these workers are likely misclassified, independent contractors are not covered by workplace standards laws—laws that, for example, ensure that workers are both paid the minimum wage and are safe while on the job and not discriminated against—as well as broader protections such as the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Women and people of color account for a disproportionate share of workers in many of these low-wage occupations, and there is little guarantee that training opportunities in sectors with higher pay and better working conditions are accessible to workers across racial and gender lines. Racial and gender disparities exist in jobs, wages, benefits, and other measures of job quality.

Moreover, training alone will never be enough to ensure that all U.S. workers are successful, and especially not sufficient to achieve gender and racial equality for women workers and workers of color. Data analysis from the Economic Policy Institute shows that no matter their education level, African American women are paid less than white men. More precisely, two-thirds of African American women have some amount of postsecondary education but are nonetheless paid 67 percent of white men’s pay, on average. Yet the public workforce system—a network of training and employment services for workers and employers—is not even required to provide metrics that ensure that newly trained workers enter into family-supporting jobs. Assessing job quality would be a means to achieving racial and gender equity in the workplace.

In order to ensure that future jobs are good jobs with real pathways to economic mobility for all Americans, workforce intermediaries must not only react to changes in the market but also use their role to reshape labor markets to be more equitable for women and people of color. Indeed, a 2019 report from the Center for American Progress, “A Design for Workforce Equity: Workforce Redesign for Quality Training and Employment,” detailed essential policy reforms to achieve these goals.

Elements of successful partnerships between workforce intermediaries and employers Workforce intermediaries connect workers to jobs and require adherence to job quality standards—including wage standards—in their engagement with employer partners, as well as adherence to other mechanisms to shape labor market conditions and raise standards in the workplace. Workers and their representatives have a role in designing training and job quality standards to meet their current needs and support ongoing career development.

Workforce intermediaries intentionally build client-centered partnerships with employers that reshape industry practices based on the strengths of workers across racial and gender lines—as opposed to only responding to industry change.

Workforce intermediaries consistently engage in partnership development with their employers by providing trainees personalized support and strategies that help strengthen networking and other skills required for reaching individual professional goals after program completion.

This report examines two job training approaches in fast-growing sectors: The Per Scholas model in the information technology (IT) sector and the SEIU 775 Training Partnership model in the home-care industry. Using a case-study approach, the authors conducted interviews with staff at both organizations to help examine how particular features of institutional partnerships with employers can facilitate a process for quality training and ensure that all workers have fair access and the support they need to achieve upward mobility and economic security. Taken together, these two programs provide an ecosystem model that workforce intermediaries such as labor-management training partnerships, community-based training providers, and the public workforce system can adopt. Indeed, by centralizing equity and investing in job quality, policymakers, employers, and worker advocates can ensure that investments in workforce development shape 21st century labor markets in ways that lift all working Americans.

Fostering social and economic equity: The Per Scholas model

Per Scholas is a national provider of free employment and training in the IT sector, emphasizing relationships through accountability to its students and employer partners. At a time when diversity, inclusion, and retention of women and people of color remain some of the biggest challenges facing the industry, Per Scholas has helped bring equity and innovation into the tech ecosystem.

Equity Gaps in the IT sector

For all of the economic hype that technology jobs bring, only a select few are benefiting from the so-called tech boom. When looking at workforce composition in the tech industry, its fortunes are unevenly distributed. Representation of women, as well as Black and Latinx representation, remains especially poor. And despite some recent improvements in diversity rates, the sector continues to struggle with gender and racial equity.

For example, software developer jobs in the industry are among the fastest-growing occupations today. The average salary for software developers in 2017 was $109,309, well above the average national salary of $53,888. Yet white men are greatly overrepresented in this field: Of the 1.8 million workers employed as software developers, more than 80 percent are men and 54 percent are white.

Even entry-level IT jobs tend to pay better than the average entry-level U.S. job. But similarly, the overall workforce overwhelmingly comprises white and male workers. For example, opportunity gaps exist among computer support specialists despite a faster-than-average job outlook and a higher-than-average entry-level annual salary of $53,470 per year. Of the approximately 547,000 workers employed as computer support specialists, only about one-quarter are women. And in terms of racial distribution, Asian American and Pacific Islander workers make up just 12 percent of computer support specialists, while Black and Latinx workers combined account for approximately 11 percent of the workforce.

While the effects of this lack of diversity are numerous and beyond the scope of this report, increasing job quality for women and people of color as a practice of fostering workforce equity through skills training is central in this report’s focus on the Per Scholas model.

A brief history of Per Scholas

With an original mission to close the digital divide, Per Scholas was founded in 1995 as a social venture that refurbished “end-of-life” computers and donated them back to schools in the Bronx, New York, as well as offered digital literacy classes to unemployed and underemployed residents living in the South Bronx.

By the early 2000s, the organization had fully pivoted to a technology training organization that created opportunities for communities previously overlooked by business. Per Scholas is now a premier technology and placement organization, and as such, its model has evolved from providing computer repair and maintenance services to filling staffing needs for a growing number of businesses in need of tech talent.

Now a provider of high-quality technology training and career development services in 12 metropolitan areas across the United States, Per Scholas is a proven means of improving the career trajectories of workers and meeting the needs of industry. It is able to provide training and employment services to individuals at no cost through financial support from foundation and corporate philanthropy, industry, and the government, as well as revenue from a customized training model that directly partners with employers to build training solutions matched to business needs. Research confirms the model’s success: Per Scholas has notably undergone two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the first conducted by Public/Private Ventures in 2010 and the second conducted by MDRC in 2016. With a combined sample of 1,143 individuals, the two RCTs found that two to three years after graduating from Per Scholas training, individuals increased their annual earnings by $4,000 to $5,000 more than the control group—about a 30 percent increase. In a 2020 report, MDRC found increased average earnings in both follow-up years—2017 and 2018—reinforcing the body of evidence on the Per Scholas model’s effectiveness at increasing quality employment.

Whereas the design of these evaluations was randomized at the individual level, this case study aims to showcase in an organizational context how the model fosters social and economic mobility through a focus on developing mutually beneficial relationships between Per Scholas and its employer clients.

Per Scholas fosters equity with business solutions

Although Per Scholas has phased out its computer recycling operation, the organization continues to innovate in practice, not only adjusting and adapting its approach to meet IT industry staffing needs based on both market trends and specific customization, but also providing women and people of color with access to high-quality certification training, job placement, and career development services in the technology sector.

Throughout its 25-year evolution, Per Scholas has launched multiple workforce initiatives aimed at fostering workforce equity, including efforts to advance gender parity in the tech sector by committing to training more women to work in the field. In addition to expanding its training for entry-level IT jobs to other cities, the Per Scholas training module now includes courses aimed at preparing students for midcareer technology jobs.

To date, Per Scholas has trained more than 10,000 individuals nationwide—90 percent of whom are people of color and one-third of whom are women. The program boasts a graduation rate of 85 percent, and of those who graduate, 80 percent attain employment, with 75 percent of those individuals staying employed for at least one year. Graduates’ earnings have increased, nearly quadrupling after placement in IT jobs; after one year of employment, graduates saw their wages go up by 15 percent.

Per Scholas partnerships with major tech sector employers Per Scholas has partnered with Barclays, Capital One, TEKsystems, and numerous other employers to help supply well-qualified workers with skills customized to fit partner needs. Barclays: The evolution of Per Scholas in sustaining robust relationships with employers is evidenced by its strong partnership with Barclays, with which it has launched and invested in cybersecurity training programs in New York City and Newark, New Jersey. Specifically, Barclays helped create the curriculum—and has even provided some instruction. As a result of this partnership, Barclays has hired 55 graduates to date through full-time employment, apprenticeship, and internship opportunities.

Capital One: In the Washington, D.C., region, Capital One has made investments to support the building of its cybersecurity training facility and has even provided hands-on training at its Education Security Operations Center. The relationship between Capital One and Per Scholas signals an investment that produces needed quality training in a growing field.*

The relationship between Capital One and Per Scholas signals an investment that produces needed quality training in a growing field.* TEKsystems: Another type of national partnership is Per Scholas’ relationship with TEKsystems, a full-stack talent and technology provider that offers IT staffing solutions. At the beginning of 2019, TEKsystems had already hired more than 400 individuals from Per Scholas nationally. As part of the 2019 partnership agreement, Per Scholas has scaled training tracks across four markets tailored to meet the hiring demands of TEKsystems and its clients. Per Scholas develops types of training tracks specific to the employer partner, seeks the partner’s input on curriculum, determines the location for training, calculates enrollment rates and hiring needs, and outlines pay structure.

The success of the Per Scholas model largely depends on its ability to build and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with employers. In particular, Per Scholas specifically devotes staff resources to cultivating partnerships with employers, developing an industry network, and identifying new markets for its training and employment services.

In doing so, the Per Scholas Business Solutions team engages in three equity-enhancing practices to help break down barriers to IT employment for women and people of color, helping them secure well-paying jobs. These practices include integrating job quality metrics to guide partnership engagement, embedding awareness and prioritization of workplace culture early into the training curricula, and investing in professional development to improve training.

To make sure these relationships stick, Per Scholas applies rules to supply students with a good job match. It also employs a robust team of Business Solutions staff who develop and manage corporate engagement and hiring, helping establish standards and expectations for workers and employers.

Specifically, Per Scholas requires employer partners to pay a minimum initial wage of $18 per hour for occupations in its most entry-level tracks and a starting wage of $21 per hour to $25 per hour for its cyber or software engineering track. In addition, Business Solutions is structured so that each team and individual employee is required to meet a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as maintaining a job placement rate of 70 percent for its students within 120 days after graduation and placing 80 percent of all graduates in employment within six to nine months afterward.

Embedding awareness and prioritization of workplace culture early into the training curricula

The Per Scholas model engages students with employers early into the training module—as soon as three to four weeks after courses begin. Students gain experiences that help them develop a familiarity with and understanding of the norms, values, and beliefs of workplace culture. This mutually beneficial practice not only helps students but also provides a service to Per Scholas’ employer partners. The reason for such early engagement is to help expose employers to the type of student development that is taking place, which may benefit employers by giving them meaningful contact with students throughout their learning process. In other words, the Per Scholas approach offers students a glimpse of what they can expect in the workplace after completing their training, while employers get a chance to engage with students earlier in the training module. Because employers come to know the students by name, these relationships add to the students’ social capital and extend their social networks.

Investing in professional development to improve training

Per Scholas builds its capacity to mutually engage the employer by providing coaching to students during training and after graduation, including by helping students practice for job interviews as well as helping them problem-solve if they are experiencing challenges on the job. Here, the purpose of providing coaching for one to two years after students graduate from the program is to continue to develop graduates’ leadership skills while they are active in the workforce. This is another example of the types of services that benefit alumni—but perhaps more importantly, it is a useful innovation for employers.

Continued coaching for alumni has been so successful that Per Scholas is developing an alumni leadership academy focused on building its employer partners’ understanding of the uniqueness of the Per Scholas model, further developing these qualities rather than only focusing on increasing technical skills. Each of Per Scholas’ 11 training sites operates using this model, and their onsite career coaches work closely with the Business Solutions teams to match students with jobs based on their technical and professional skills.

Per Scholas leverages mutual benefits to advance equity

By building business teams into the model, the development of employer relationships is guided by job quality metrics. Emphasizing workplace culture and providing further professional development efforts help sustain these strong partnerships. Together, these practices characterize a unique partnership model that aims to both reduce the employment risk that individuals take on when participating in job training and respond to employers’ labor market needs.

For Per Scholas, it is important that employer partners not only feel invested in hiring but also deepen their engagement by helping the organization develop the actual training approach, including through curriculum development; engaging onsite visits; and employers’ participation in the training process in the form of guest teaching, lunch and learns, mock interviews, and even hiring fairs. Over time, employer partners have come to serve on Per Scholas’ local site advisory boards as well as its national board as a result of these deepening relationships.

These three strategic practices demonstrate how Per Scholas takes a more holistic, all-hands-on-deck approach with employer partners who are also invested. From C-suite executives to hiring managers who oversee the budget for their business operations, employer partners must be prepared to provide the necessary resources to help inform curriculum development, match training with actual hiring needs, and articulate a deep overall understanding of their own business goals to the training provider. Strong partnerships between the workforce intermediary and its employer partners—such as in the Per Scholas model—show that partnership performance increases accountability for generating good results and therefore adds value to the quality of the training program. For women and people of color, this means that quality partnerships lead to better training that is connected to good jobs.

Boosting job quality: The SEIU 775 Training Partnership model

The SEIU 775 Training Partnership—a partnership between Washington state, private sector employers, and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 775—is improving job quality and care outcomes in the fast-growing home-care industry. Home-care workers—the majority of whom are women of color—are typically paid low wages. The SEIU 775 Training Partnership, however, prioritizes training to help make home care a destination career, working in tandem with policymakers to raise pay, improve health and safety conditions, provide health care, secure retirement and job-matching benefits, and increase standards across the home-care industry.

Caregiving work—and particularly home care—is one of the largest and fastest-growing fields in the U.S. economy. While these jobs face little risk of being offshored or automated, they provide little opportunity for advancement. As a result, home-care workers are too often ignored in conversations on training and the future of work. Yet this innovative SEIU 775 training initiative is attracting thousands of well-qualified workers annually while raising standards across the state.

Home care is a high-skill, low-wage sector dominated by women and people of color

Home-care workers perform tasks that are essential to ensuring that aging clients and clients with disabilities can live independently in their communities. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that there were 3.3 million home health and personal care aides in 2018 and estimated that the number of jobs in the field would grow by 36 percent from 2018 to 2028. The largest portion of this sector is made up of home-care workers.

The need for direct-care workers is growing as Baby Boomers age and they and Americans with disabilities are increasingly able to exercise their choice to receive care at home. The population of adults who are ages 65 and older is projected to nearly double from 2016 to 2060, and nearly 90 percent of Americans in this age category report that they want to age in their current home, according to a 2014 AARP survey. Moreover, many of the 1 in 5 Americans who live with a disability rely on home care in order to live and work independently.

Yet despite this obvious demand for home care, the sector is experiencing a massive shortage of workers. As a result, more than 650,000 people with disabilities who qualify for Medicaid are stuck on waitlists to receive critical home- and community-based support services. And because traditional health insurance and Medicare typically do not pay for long-term services and supports, only 30 percent of noninstitutionalized seniors who require long-term services receive paid care; the rest rely on unpaid family caregivers. And while Medicaid does cover community-based care, Social Security Insurance limits eligibility to only Americans living in poverty who would have no means to pay for home-based care on their own. Research shows that in the next decade, as the Baby Boomer generation ages, the number of family caregivers available to provide unpaid care will fall sharply.

While rapidly increasing demand certainly contributes to caregiver shortfalls, the industry also has difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers due to the difficulty of the work and abysmal wages. In 2017, national wages for home-care workers were $11.52 per hour—and typically just $16,200 annually due to part-time and unstable scheduling. As a result, approximately half of all home-care workers rely on public assistance, with 1 in 5 living in poverty.

Home-care workers are predominately women and people of color: Nearly 90 percent are women, 28 percent are African American, and 23 percent are Hispanic or Latinx. In addition, approximately one-third of home-care workers are immigrants, and the workforce is almost evenly split between workers who have a high school degree or less—54 percent—and those who have at least some college education—46 percent.

Although home-care work is typically low wage, it is high skilled. On a daily basis, based on their clients’ individual needs, home-care workers perform physical labor—including personal hygiene care, moving and lifting, household cleaning, and meal preparation as well as higher-level critical thinking and interpersonal skills. This can include problem-solving to help shift client schedules to account for sudden illness, weather conditions, changing client preferences, and unexpected resource needs; conducting a range of informal to formal reporting tasks as well as acting as advocates with their clients by communicating their preferences to various health care and support providers; and assisting clients in staying socially connected. Increasingly, home health aides work with clients with more complex needs, including dementia complications, behavioral health issues, and other physical health issues such as diabetes.

Policymakers at all levels of government must intervene to ensure that these jobs are structured in ways that raise standards for workers and clients and that meet rapidly increasing demand.

The SEIU 775 Training Partnership creates conditions for improving job quality

In order to stabilize the workforce and raise care standards, the SEIU 775 Training Partnership is structured as a labor-management partnership, an independent organization that the union and employers jointly control. Through this structure, the partners collaboratively design and manage workforce training, professional learning, and apprenticeship opportunities that improve standards and safety for workers and increase the quality of care provided to clients.

The SEIU 775 Training Partnership was established in 2010, after the Washington state legislature enacted comprehensive legislation to expand the state’s long-term supports and services to meet the needs of all Washingtonians. These reforms included the creation of a task force charged with making occupational training recommendations as well as provisions to increase home-care workers’ wages and benefits.

Pairing training with job quality standards to professionalize the labor market

The SEIU 775 Training Partnership structured training standards to improve recruitment, retention, and professionalization in the state’s home-care industry. For these reasons, the partnership prioritizes training to help workers—84 percent of whom are women, 18 percent of whom are Asian /Pacific Islander, 9 percent of whom are Latinx, and 7 percent of whom are African American—who want to stay in the field, rather than programming to provide pathways to related occupations.

Home-care workers must complete 75 hours of training, pass the state’s Department of Health exam, and comply with ongoing continuing education requirements in order to become certified to provide care. The SEIU 775 Training Partnership trains about 50,000 workers annually—a level just below the number of students enrolled each year at the University of Washington. The training program has also created opportunities for career progression within the field, including an advanced home-care aid specialist course with tracks focused on behavioral and holistic health; a registered apprenticeship program; and peer mentorship opportunities.

In order to achieve its goals of raising standards and professionalizing the industry, the training partnership functions within a larger ecosystem of policies that support home-care workers. Since 2001, the state has recognized the right of home-care workers who are paid through state Medicaid funds to organize into unions and collectively bargain, which helps ensure that training is linked to wage differentials that encourage and reward growth and expertise. Additionally, collective bargaining ensures that workers have a voice in shaping the training to meet their needs; for example, workers employed by participating employers can attend training for free and receive pay while doing so, which allows these workers to focus on successfully completing the program.

In addition, the requirement that Medicaid-paid home-care workers become certified ensures that untrained workers cannot erode industry standards—and therefore helps attract more workers to the field since the training is helping raise standards throughout the industry. This sort of occupational credentialing has increasingly come under scrutiny. Among equity advocates in the public workforce space, there is growing concern that too many credential requirements do not translate to good jobs. In addition, several research and advocacy groups are advancing reforms to limit the use of occupational certification and licensure—arguing that the barriers to entry created by these sorts of requirements should be employed only when consumer health and welfare benefits outweigh consumer costs.

Yet in the home-care industry, occupational certification plays a central role in stabilizing wages, improving outcomes for workers and, as a result, providing meaningful benefits to consumers. Moreover, since the certification was developed by workers and employers in partnership, the credentials reflect the genuine needs and expertise of the industry. For example, the SEIU 775 Training Partnership delivers its certificate training in 11 different languages and the certification test itself in 13. More broadly, research has shown that these sorts of licensures or certifications can ensure that workers earn higher wages and enjoy longer job tenure—and even help foster entrepreneurship. At their best, they can reduce racial and gender wage gaps by helping signal high skill levels. A 2018 Brookings Institution paper found that occupational licensing provides a relatively small wage premium to white men—2 percent—when compared with women and people of color: 8 percent for Black men, about 11 percent for Hispanic men, 11 percent for white women, 6 percent for Black women, and 11 percent for Hispanic women.

Finally, the training partnership functions within the larger SEIU 775 Benefits Group, which provides additional benefits that help support workforce stability. This includes health and retirement benefits as well as occupation-specific benefits such as discounts on work shoes and Carina, an app-based hiring platform that matches workers with high-road employers. While it would be difficult for a single employer to offer this large menu of benefits to its employees, the partnership leverages economies of scale to reduce costs and improve benefits and supports. Moreover, it offers benefits portability for workers who may frequently migrate between employers.

Prioritizing client control and quality of care

Washington’s training and certification requirements for home-care workers have helped raise standards for workers while still affording clients sufficient control and independence to ensure that their specific needs are met. Although these workers are mainly paid through federal and state Medicaid funds, they are employed by clients who retain the ability to supervise, hire, and fire them. The partnership is successful, in large part, because it has raised care standards without limiting consumer control and therefore won the support of disability rights and worker advocates. Among states, Washington ranks highest in quality of long-term health care services and supports, according to a 2017 report from the AARP Public Policy Institute.

Similarly, California has experimented with advanced training models for home-care provision to ensure that workers in the industry receive specialized training to more fully integrate them with clients’ care teams. The program—which provided 60 hours of advanced training for home-care workers employed by Medicaid recipients—included clients in the training and covered topics such as symptoms of common health conditions; health and medication adherence monitoring and communication; health coaching; and health system navigation. One study found that the vast majority of home-care workers and clients reported high levels of satisfaction with the training. Moreover, emergency room and hospitalization visits had declined by approximately 40 percent two years after the training.

These examples suggest that when employed within an ecosystem of policies that work to improve job standards, home-care workers’ ability to obtain licensure or attain an educational credential serves as a job market signal for quality.

Centralizing worker outcomes through cooperative partnerships

By structuring training programs through joint labor-management partnerships, workforce advocates across the country have helped ensure that workers are empowered to design high-quality training to meet their needs. Indeed, studies confirm that not only are unionized workers more likely to receive training but that training is also more often of high quality and connected to good jobs.

Like the Washington state example, the California initiative discussed above provides training through a joint labor-management training partnership.

Moreover, a 2017 report from the Midwest Economic Policy Institute found that completion rates among construction apprentices trained through a joint labor-management partnership in Ohio were 21 percent higher than completion rates for those trained through nonunion programs. And a 2003 study examining five years of survey data found that unionized workers in Great Britain were not only more likely to get training and receive more days of training than nonunion workers but also had higher wage growth than those nonunion workers who received training.

This approach can be particularly powerful in raising standards and providing a voice to workers in industries dominated by women and workers of color. The SEIU 775 Training Partnership has been so successful that the state recently adopted a similar training partnership to improve the job standards and quality of state-supported child care. After the state enacted legislation to create an early care and education substitute pool, the state partnered with SEIU 925—another SEIU local representing 17,000 workers in education, local government, and non profits—to ensure that workers in the pool were well-qualified, offering training modules in English, Spanish, and Somali. Moreover, cities and states are increasingly supporting the creation of labor-management partnerships in other fast-growing fields—such as health care and IT—with a specific focus on boosting equity and ensuring that workers from diverse backgrounds are connected to relevant jobs.

While executing these sorts of strategies is difficult and requires partnership with worker organizations, doing so can help increase job quality across some of the largest and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy, support career advancement, and improve outcomes for consumers. Workforce advocates who want to ensure that equity and job quality are central to the future of work conversations must not only focus on ensuring that these workers are provided opportunities for career development that take them into higher-paying occupations but also support policies to ensure that work in caregiving professions and similarly fast-growing industries is good work.

Conclusion

Per Scholas and the SEIU 775 Training Partnership provide helpful lessons for workforce intermediaries seeking partnerships that foster equity and improve job quality. Both partnerships improve workplace conditions and fairness for women and people of color by implementing training designs that aim to meet the needs of all workers and employers. Furthermore, the partnership features between the workforce intermediary and its employer affirmatively mitigate unnecessary burdens linked to racial and gender bias against women, people of color, and other underrepresented voices. Put differently, these quality partnerships ensure all workers free job training and increase their earnings while continuing to provide them needed supports throughout their careers, which helps increase the representation of women and people of color in good jobs.

For policymakers, the two case studies showcase key design features and demonstrate how shared responsibilities between intermediaries and employers enable continuous learning and quality improvement are essential for improving workplace conditions and fostering equity in the labor market. These design features include:

Application of business development practices

Early integration of students into the work culture

Provision of on-the-job coaching for graduates

Joint cooperation between labor and employers

Linking workforce strategies to policies to raise industry standards

Quality partnerships structured in this way not only help workers access a job but also help restructure the entire labor market so that jobs of the future are good jobs for all workers.

Together, these practices for establishing quality partnerships have implications for education and skills training policy: Ensuring workforce equity for women, people of color, and other underrepresented voices in a changing world of work would improve industry behavior to ensure high-quality jobs are equally available to all workers. Placing greater emphasis on the role that quality partnerships play between intermediaries and employers by restructuring the public workforce system would not only help expand representation but would also provide policymakers with best practices to improve job quality and create a sustainable workforce equity structure.

At this stage in the game, you don’t need to be told that things are tough out there for media and marketing. Between furloughs, anxious employees, pay-cuts, budget-cutting and diminishing publishers, there is a lot to navigate.

All of which brings a tremendous amount of incremental pressure on marketers, who are being tasked with responding more quickly, more bravely and with more ingenuity than ever (and likely with less resources).

Clearly there are no silver bullets in this situation but there are some silver linings out there – one of which is partnerships.

While the proverb ‘a trouble shared is a trouble halved’ may not be empirically correct, there is a lot of value that can be created for brands via strategic and judicious partnerships to help navigate the new environment we find ourselves in.

Let’s look at how.

Leverage ‘community’ partnerships

Times of crisis can also bring out the best in people and businesses and the power of partnership and community is now more important than ever. Every company in adtech and martech now needs to focus on a continuation of service for advertisers and publishers – making sure they can still execute during this difficult time. Talk to your vendors and find out how their extended networks may also be able to help. For example, at Impact we’ve partnered with some fantastic independent speakers to launch a new series of ‘Create Impact’ webinars for our customers, partners and the wider industry all of which may help with up-skilling and boosting staff morale. We’ve also seen some great initiatives from brands and referring partners coming together to offer support to customers and the community. These include Network 10, MTV and Nickelodeon launching their ‘Together’ campaigns to focus on sharing health, safety and well-being messages during COVID-19. Another example is Woolworths working with Qantas to hire some of the workers laid off as a result of the crisis.

Deepen agency partnerships

Now is the time to realign on shared agency goals and incentives and ensure that the right strategies are in place to reflect the changing times. We know from past financial crises that consumer’s desires, wants and needs alter significantly – for example, consumers typically demonstrate a desire to return to simpler, more home and family orientated times. It has never been more important to understand and address the shifting needs of consumers and agency partners which will be critical to help track changing behaviours, develop and share insights and then recalibrate campaigns accordingly.

Deepen partnership with sales

If you haven’t deeply aligned marketing with sales, now is the moment to do so as securing revenue becomes paramount. Look at your pipeline through a realistic lens and develop a battle plan accordingly. Marketers should be working in tandem with sales to figure out the renewed market opportunity, where the next consumer might be, where the white space might be and how marketing can support this.

Extend (and optimise) commercial partnership programs

With consumers expected to more carefully weigh up purchase decisions as discretionary spend reduces, the old adage of ‘people buy from people’ will be more important than ever. This means there is an opportunity for brands to tap into the need for social bonding, togetherness and reassurance as people, more than ever, will want to minimise risk.

A good way to create this kind of trust and reassurance is through partnering with third parties – for example, with other brands with shared values, social influencers, publishers and charities. By partnering with those who have a trusted relationship with a customer or audience, new consumers can be reached which will drive significant incremental revenue. In fact, research from Forrester Consulting recently found that companies with the most mature partnership programs are growing overall company revenue nearly two times as fast as companies with less mature programs. This type of performance play is also attractive as it has a clear and accountable return on investment (ROI) – brands only pay partners that deliver real business outcomes. It also aligns well with the type of agile principles (daily meetings, rapid pivots and so on) that will be important to adopt as the market and conditions rapidly evolve. For optimal ROI and agility, brands can deploy partnership automation software to ensure they can effectively optimise all stages of a partnership, from discovery and recruitment, through contracting, attributing credit and payment.

There is no getting away from the fact that 2020 is going to be a challenging year for marketers, but by looking to lean on partners from across the media and marketing ecosystem brands can better build the skills, resilience and growth opportunities that will be essential for long term success.

This unique publication explores effective practices, collaborations, and ideas for the future being developed by librarians, library staff, and faculty at international, American-modeled institutions.

Internationalization continues to gain traction among US colleges and universities as overseas branch campuses now dot the globe alongside an established and growing group of independent American-modeled institutions of higher education, some founded as early as the 19th century. As higher education and the academic library environment evolves, librarians at many of these independent institutions are identifying priorities that include not only collaborating with educational stakeholders, enhancing teaching and learning, and connecting to the institution's mission, but also positioning themselves as active and creative partners in increasingly digital learning and scholarship. An international environment is both a challenge and an opportunity for these priorities.

""Library Partnerships in International Liberal Arts Education"" explores these challenges and opportunities through perspectives that are inherently international and intercultural because of the authors' own backgrounds, and in particular because of their institutional environments. The authors are librarians, faculty, and technologists at institutions that belong to the AMICAL Consortium, a consortium of American-modeled international liberal arts institutions working together on common goals for libraries, technology, and learning. The chapters describe library-anchored collaborations that demonstrate struggles, but also successes and rich possibilities, in these thoroughly international--and increasingly digital--liberal arts institutions. They provide cumulative knowledge, reference points, and aspirational targets for planning future library-related collaborations in similar environments.

While a fascinating look at new collaborative roles and digitally focused priority areas for academic librarians as they are being addressed within AMICAL's membership, the compelling ideas arising from these intercultural contexts have broad application and introduce opportunities to engage in international collaboration with the members of this unique consortium.

Telos’ partnership with Blockbastards will see the network host the company’s upcoming Qudo platform, along with providing marketing and technical support.

Qudo is a token-based reward mechanism revolving around proof-of-gameplay that can be integrated into any game built using the Unity platform. Users can be rewarded for achieving certain goals, or simply for racking up hours of play.

According to Unity’s own figures, over 3.3 billion devices have run games built on the platform in the past year, so Qudo could potentially see a massive audience exposed to cryptocurrency rewards.

The platform allows developers to focus on the gameplay experience, adding cryptocurrency rewards without a need for prior blockchain experience. According to Blockbastards managing director João Abrantes:

“In traditional gaming, we’ve seen that in-game credit systems tend to make the most money, and now we can offer this same experience on-chain with Qudo, running on the Telos network.”

Farm Game and Area X add a competitive element

The other two partnerships announced by Telos are with Farm Game and Area X.

The Farm Game platform enables betting on games such as Counter Strike, DOTA 2 and others on the Steam service. Sponsors can also create competition matches online by offering Telos (TLOS) tokens as prizes.

As of 2019, the Steam platform supported over 34,000 games and over 95 million monthly active users.

Area X is a social network of free HTML 5 games, built on the Telos blockchain and awarding prizes in TLOS and other tokens. Area X also holds tournaments whereby players pay a small entry fee in the hope of winning more tokens.

Telos Foundation CEO Suvi Rinkinen expressed the company’s desire to support the development of blockchain-based games, stating, “There are numerous benefits to integrating blockchain technology into games, and we look forward to working with Qudo, Area X, and Farm Game to ensure Telos helps them maximize their performance.”

However, Telos isn’t purely gaming-focused. As Cointelegraph reported, the company recently teamed up with Genobank to launch an app helping people to access anonymous COVID-19 testing.","The second most active blockchain, Telos, has announced partnerships with three gaming companies on April 28, bringing blockchain features to games on the Unity and Steam platforms.

It has always been Cisco’s mission to offer continuous support to partners so they can provide the best service to their customers; and this pandemic couldn’t be a better example of that. From the free offers, to the extensions on certifications to the financing options, Cisco’s support is unwavering for its partners. In an exclusive interaction with CRN India, Oliver Tuszik, Senior Vice President of Cisco’s Global Partner Organization shares more insights into the company’s efforts to ensure its partners feel limited impact to their businesses

How do you assess the current global crisis, and what are some of the learnings that can help partners?

While there is currently an incredible demand for IT and enabling people to work from home, including connectivity, remote collaboration and security, we are anticipating various challenges as a result of the global economic slowdown. However, our partners, including those in India, remain confident in Cisco’s positioning to manage through this.

Our partners recognise that Cisco is the only company which has been developing the capabilities needed to help customers in what will become the ‘new normal’. Intelligent networking, secure connections, and sophisticated collaboration will be even more vital, as we adjust to new ways of working and living. I believe we are going to see fewer in-person interactions in the near term, resulting in a greater reliance on secure connections and endpoints, an increasing appetite for managed services, and even greater IT agility. All of these play to Cisco’s and its partners’ strengths and, together, we are able to help our customers thrive in the new normal to come.

Tell us about Cisco’s preparedness to tackle such unprecedented situations

With our networking, security and collaboration portfolio, Cisco and its partners have been enabling customers to work virtually for many years. Hence, we were already prepared from day one.

At the onset of the pandemic, and as businesses began quickly transitioning their employees to work from home, Cisco provided free collaboration tools and security offerings, along with a suite of cloud-based services to get customers up and running quickly.

This March, we recorded nearly 14 billion meeting minutes, which is more than double from February. Additionally, in one day alone, Webex handled 4.2 million meetings, more than twice the average on a peak day before the pandemic. Cisco Security has added more than nine million security users since the start of the security offerings on March 10, and the number is growing exponentially every day.

Over the last month, many teams across Cisco have been working tirelessly to address this pandemic and meet the needs of our partners and customers. Our manufacturing, component suppliers, and logistics operations teams have been focused on re-routing orders, expediting alternate supplies, and adding manufacturing capabilities around the world. We are doing everything we can to ensure our partners have access to the equipment and connectivity they need to help their customers stay productive.

Like other verticals, the IT industry too will be hit hard by this prevailing condition. Since Cisco is a partner-centric company, what kind of impact do you anticipate on your partner ecosystem, and how do you plan to limit the impact on their business?

With about 60,000 partners around the world, the impact of this situation on their businesses will vary. For some partners, there is significant concern around cash flow and how long they can weather the storm when their sales and professional services have slowed. For others, it is the inability to have face-to-face meetings that’s causing them to scramble and adjust their pipeline and sales strategy. Whereas, some partners are anticipating consolidation and the potential of mergers and acquisitions.

Given the scope and impact of this pandemic, it is fair to say that most of our partners will see a direct impact from the expected economic downturn. At the same time, we believe that our partners will also benefit from the increasing demand for IT, as customers have to adapt to this changing environment. In fact, when the COVID-19 pandemic passes, we expect an even higher demand for digitisation of existing business models along with an ongoing shift to more agile work environments supported through an increased adoption of SaaS and managed services.

In addition to our free Webex and security offers, we have quickly ramped up a few of the initiatives that we believe will be of additional benefit to our partners. We also understand that partners may face increased financial burden. Here, Cisco Capital is committed to supporting them with a broad range of flexible payment solutions that can help them get paid promptly, manage their cash flow, finance the total solution, and pay over time.

We also recognise that partners may be impacted by travel restrictions and, hence, we want to assure them that their Cisco certifications, specialisations and authorisations will not be impacted due to their inability to complete a training or take an exam.

We also know our partners and their customers are dealing with urgent IT projects that were likely not planned or budgeted. As part of Cisco Refresh, we provide competitively priced and pre-owned solutions across all Cisco technologies, including both current and end-of-life products. Our remanufactured equipment is offered with a new warranty and made available in over 80 countries.

Has this called for re-alignment of your go-to-market strategy? Any changes/modifications being done in your partner programme, financing schemes, etc?

Our go-to-market strategy has not changed. The current situation is reinforcing our long-term strategy on a partner-focused go to market motion. In this fast-changing environment, we can adapt to the customers’ demands faster as we are able to scale with our partners. We are and will continue to be laser-focused on our number one priority – our partners’ profitability. Our partner strategy around ‘Perform and Transform’ remains unchanged, which is to help partners achieve their daily businesses goals while also building on new opportunities. In today’s climate, we are admittedly more focused on helping our partners perform and keep their businesses going, but our long-term strategy has not changed.

What kind of support is being extended to your partners so that they can provide round-the-clock service to their customers?

It has always been Cisco’s mission to offer continuous support to partners so they can provide the best service to their customers and this pandemic couldn’t be a better example of that. From the free offers, to the extensions on certifications to the financing options, Cisco’s support is unwavering for its partners. My personal commitment is that Cisco is here to support our partners and we will continue to work through these challenging times together as we serve our customers and communities.

Business models are expected to change. What kind of changes is Cisco expecting?

I believe there is going to be a ‘new normal’ that comes out of all of this. No one could have predicted a pandemic of this magnitude that would create such radical shifts in how we conduct business. However, there is no one better positioned than Cisco and our partners to serve this ‘new normal’ and ensure our customers’ success. Cisco is in a unique position to help companies, governments and communities. We make the technologies that power remote productivity and we have the global scale through our partners to effect change.

It is said that ‘challenges always lead to opportunities.’ In this context, how is Cisco transforming the current challenges into opportunities for growth, both for the organisation as well as the partner ecosystem?

I truly believe that our heritage around partnerships will help us get through this and we will emerge even stronger. The technology demands brought by the pandemic play directly to Cisco’s and our partners’ strengths. At Cisco’s Partner Summit last November, the theme of the event was ‘Own Your Edge’ and this is more important today than ever before. Cisco has the best partners in the world that have unique expertise, skills, and capabilities to help our customers and communities adapt to this new reality.

Rajeev Reddy joins the firm from Tatva Legal and will be JSA’s second partner-level appointee for its Hyderabad operations, JSA said in a statement. An alumnus of NALSAR University of Law, Reddy has over 16 years of experience in the corporate and commercial law field.

He has advised clients on transactional matters such as private equity investments, cross-border investments, acquisitions, joint ventures, operation set-ups, corporate restructuring, and debt funding, among others.

The companies and entities he has advised operate in sectors such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, mining, education, retail, infrastructure, and online gaming.

JSA says it has over 320 professionals operating out of offices in the country including in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Some of the sectors it practices include agriculture and forestry, education, environment, real estate, pharmaceuticals, startups, and energy.

Last month, the firm promoted three of its lawyers within its larger finance and corporate practices to equity partners. In February, the law firm appointed Shafaq Uraizee Sapre as a retained partner for its Mumbai office from Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan (L&S). In August 2019, JSA hired BDO Legal’s Manish Mishra as a partner to be based in its Gurugram office.

99,https://reneweconomy.com.au/raygen-edges-closer-to-solar-hydro-success-with-new-strategic-partnerships-13320/,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",RenewEconomy,RayGen edges closer to “solar hydro” success with new strategic partnerships,"Australian “solar hydro” technology hopeful RayGen has announced a raft of new strategic partnerships, as the Melbourne-based company works towards its big-picture plans to develop a huge 100MW/1,000MWh solar plus storage project.

RayGen’s “dispatchable” concentrated solar and hydro storage technology is currently on track to be tested at a 50MWh-scale in Victoria’s north-west, backed by $3 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and a key partnership with major gen-tailer AGL Energy.

Last week, however, the company aired some of its much bigger plans – including aspirations to develop a 200MW solar plant with around 100MW/1000MWh storage – off the back a deal with Photon Energy.

As reported here, that deal will see Photon take an unspecified equity stake in RayGen (believed to be less than 10%) and act as project developer and EPC contractor for the projects it plans to roll out in Australia and elsewhere.

This week, another four “strategic partnerships” were announced between RayGen and a range of specialist technology suppliers, ahead of the company’s pilot project in Carwarp, Victoria.

The new partners include Atlas CopCo Power and Gas and Egesim Group, for the supply of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems; NIRAS Australia, for pit thermal energy storage solutions; KMI Jiangyin, for the supply of slew drives for the solar hydro technology; and Azur Space for high efficiency, multi-junction solar cells.

In a series of statements from each of the companies, RayGen CEO Richard Payne said the new partnerships would set the company up to pursue large-scale deployment of its PV Ultra and solar hydro systems.

On the PV Ultra side of the equation, Payne said the “extraordinary power density” of RayGen’s modules using Azur Space’s CPV cells would underpin a “new economic model for manufacturing and deploying solar power systems worldwide.”

As RayGen’s Will Mosley explains, the company’s PV Ultra technology (pictured above) does something that “no one else in the world” is currently doing, by using mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto super-efficient PV modules that are raised on a tower.

These specialist panels convert roughly 30 per cent of the sunlight directly into energy, while also capturing roughly 60 per cent of excess heat energy.

On the storage side, the heat energy captured by the panel from the concentrated sunlight is stored as hot (92°C) water in one reservoir, while the electricity generated by the panel (and not sent directly to the grid) is used to chill water to 2°C, which is stored in a cold reservoir.

“The difference in temperature of about 90°C has a similar energy storage capacity as pumped hydro with a height of 1000 metres – so really, really big pumped hydro,” Mosley says.

Between the two tanks is the Organic Rankine Cycle system – or heat to power turbine – where the hot and cold water boil then condense an organic working fluid to drive the turbine and deliver power to the grid whenever it is needed.

This is where Atlas Copco and Egesim come in, to deliver the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) engine of RayGen’s pilot plant.

“We are thrilled to announce our strategic alliance with Egesim and their partner Atlas Copco, two leaders of heat-to-power applications globally,” said Payne.

“With Egesim and Atlas Copco’s ORC solution, RayGen is able to deliver the economics of pumped hydro and the flexibility of batteries.”

NIRAS, meanwhile, is on board to develop the hot and cold reservoirs, or pit thermal energy storage solutions, for the project. The companies said the nominal size of each of these pits was 15,000m3, or about six Olympic swimming pools.

Jiangyin Kinematics Manufacturing, or KMI, will supply the slew drives for the project, a key component of the RayGen’s sun-tracking technology.

“KMI (Jiangyin) has known and worked with RayGen for 10 years and believe they are world leaders in the field,” said KMI managing director Ray Lin in a statement.

“Our strategic alliance allows us to supply of highly accurate and highly reliable slew drives for large scale deployment of RayGen’s PV Ultra systems.

“We believe that this technology can be competitive with coal power, matching the reliability and cost at large scale.”","Australian “solar hydro” technology hopeful RayGen has announced a raft of new strategic partnerships, as the Melbourne-based company works towards its big-picture plans to develop a huge 100MW/1,000MWh solar plus storage project.

The CIES Football Observatory have calculated which clubs are the biggest feeders of the ‘Big Five’ leagues based on current squads, and it is no surprise to learn that Ajax top the list.

The Dutch club have supplied 22 players to the Bundesliga, La Liga, Premier League, Serie A, and Ligue Un.

The rest of the top five is made up of Benfica (21), RB Salzburg (20), Real Madrid Castilla (17), Sporting CP (17), and Genk (16) - although PSV Eindhoven (15) sneak into the top five if Real’s B team is discounted.

Tottenham Hotspur are one of the biggest clubs to have benefited from the excellent academies and scouting networks of Ajax and their Eredivisie rivals PSV.

Rafael van der Vaart and Edgar Davids are among the historical connections, but it is only in the last few years that Tottenham’s relationship with Dutch football has flourished.

Here, we take a look at the recent Spurs players who used these two clubs as a stepping stone, before predicting who might be next.

Spurs’ Ajax & PSV past

Toby Alderweireld

Spurs’ 31-year-old centre-back looks set to become a hugely important player for Jose Mourinho after signing a new contract in December.

The Belgian joined from Atletico Madrid in 2015 having previously come through the Ajax youth system, where he played 128 games.

Jan Vertonghen

Signed directly from Ajax in 2012, 32-year-old Vertonghen featured 155 times for the Dutch club before making a switch to the Premier League.

He looks likely to leave Tottenham in the summer after eight years of service.

Davinson Sanchez

Spurs yet again went back to Ajax for a centre-back in 2017, signing then 21-year-old Sanchez for a club record fee of £42 million.

He hasn’t quite reached the heights of Alderweireld or Vertonghen in a Spurs shirt, although there is plenty of time to turn that around.

Steven Bergwijn

The latest addition from one of the top feeder teams comes from PSV. Bergwijn has enjoyed an excellent start to life in North London, scoring twice in five games since his January arrival.

The 21-year-old was arguably the brightest talent in Dutch football when he joined, having scored five and assisted 10 in the first half of the 2019/20 Eredivisie season.

Christian Eriksen

Eriksen’s Tottenham career ended limply, shipped off to Inter Milan in January with six months remaining on his contract and after a poor first half of the season.

However, the former Ajax playmaker’s impact at Spurs should not be forgotten. He played more than 250 games for the club over a seven year period.

Spurs’ Ajax & PSV future

Donny van de Beek

Having made headlines with some outstanding performances in the Champions League last season, most notably against Real Madrid, Van der Beek is expected to join Zinedine Zidane’s side for a rumoured fee of around £47 million.

However, Spurs are reportedly interested in the Dutch midfielder and have made tentative enquiries over the last 12 months.

Andre Onana

Spurs are “very interested” in signing Ajax goalkeeper Onana, according to a report in Spanish newspaper Sport.

He is one of the most coveted goalies in the world at the moment, making a move to replace error-prone Hugo Lloris potentially fraught with difficulties.

Then again, Onana has previously admitted that England is an attractive option and only Chelsea and Spurs are looking for new number ones.

Donyel Malen

Plenty of Premier League clubs will be interested in making a move for PSV’s young striker this summer, and Spurs may have to battle rivals Arsenal for his £48 million signature.

The 21-year-old has scored 11 goals in 14 Eredivisie games this season, netting a further three in the Europa League to prove he has what it takes to make the step up.

Denzel Dumfries

Mourinho is known to be in the market for a right-back after a series of high-profile mistakes from Serge Aurier, and Dumfries could be just the player to fill the gap.

The 23-year-old is a dependable attacking player who is likely to leave PSV for one of the ‘Big Five’ leagues this year.

Dumfries has most recently been linked with Arsenal, although back in July 2019 Manchester United were reportedly keen on a £25 million deal.","Sign up to FREE email alerts from Football London - Spurs Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

102,https://chiefexecutive.net/creating-partnerships-to-navigate-covid-19/,"Thu, 07 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Chief Executive Group,Creating Partnerships To Navigate COVID-19,"Cross-sector collaborations are more complicated and therefore challenging to do well, but they enable companies to leverage invaluable new resources, expertise and networks.

As COVID-19 continues to rage across the globe, business executives are faced with the urgent challenge of how best to respond and contribute to the benefit of their employees, their customers, their communities and ultimately their businesses. The challenge is that the pandemic is what social scientists like to a call a truly “wicked problem”—an enormously complex challenge where no single solution exists.

Over the last decade or so, global business leaders have increasingly tackled these types of wicked problems through new, creative, non-traditional partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government agencies. Celebrated CEOs, such as former Unilever CEO Paul Polman, champion these cross-sector collaborations as critical for tackling issues ranging from climate change to the sustainable sourcing of inputs and materials. These partnerships enable companies to leverage new resources, expertise and networks.

But cross-sector partnerships differ from traditional business alliances that companies have with vendors or suppliers. You don’t simply hire an NGO or a UN agency and cut them a check, but rather start with building a shared understanding of the problem to be solved and develop common goals and a framework for sharing risks, responsibilities and rewards. In a cross-sector partnership, the value is created by partners leveraging the capabilities of the other partners to solve the problem.

For example, CPG companies, including Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive, partnered with development organizations such as Mercy Corps to improve handwashing in Africa and Asia through the Global Handwashing Partnership. For the CPG companies, the partnership is a great opportunity to build demand for soap and sanitation products by leveraging the expertise, funding and reach of the NGOs. For an NGO like Mercy Corps, the CPG companies bring enormous marketing capabilities—an incredible resource, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sounds great, right? The problem is that these cross-sector collaborations are very hard to do well. In fact, a recent study by the Hilton Foundation found that roughly 75% of these cross-sector partnerships fail to live up to expectations. Why are they so hard to get right? Here are three common reasons:

1. Different missions, cultures and time horizons. Businesses, governments and NGOs have very different organizational goals and corresponding cultures. Most companies are wired to deliver and report on a quarterly cycle that the stock market demands. Meanwhile, governments and NGOs work on longer time horizons and, as publicly-funded institutions, are accountable to taxpayers and citizens—not shareholders. These differences in mission, culture and time horizon can make it difficult for organizations to synch up.

2. Poor internal alignment. Believe it or not, a major cause of problems in these cross-sector partnerships is often the internal alignment within organizations. In companies, a CSR or sustainability team may develop a partnership with an NGO, but the sustainability team has to rely on other business units—operations, marketing, etc.—to deliver. If those business units are not incentivized or aligned properly, a company may fail to deliver on its commitments in a partnership. Lack of internal alignment is not unique to businesses—governments and NGOs often face similar internal alignment challenges.

3. Failure to select the right partners. Too often, companies will rush into a partnership with an NGO or agency with little or no due diligence. Perhaps, the CEOs met at a conference, hit it off and decided to work together. As they get into the details of how to work together, these partners often quickly discover that their capabilities and resources are not as complementary as their leaders originally thought.

While cross-sector partnerships are not easy, there are some simple steps business leaders can take to increase the odds of success:

1. Be very clear on the problem to be solved. Make sure that your team working on the partnership understands very clearly the business’s goals and motivations for engaging in a partnership. Those goals and motivations should be clearly communicated within your company and to your prospective partners. For example, when PepsiCo faced productivity issues in their agricultural supply chains in key markets in Asia, they thoroughly investigated the issue and determined that much of the productivity problem could be solved not through the use of new seeds or fertilizer, but rather by empowering women in decision-making on smallholder farms in their supply chain. By getting very clear on the nature of the problem to be solved, PepsiCo was then able to identify NGO and donor partners with the mission, resources and expertise needed to help address the needs of women on smallholder farms in Asia.

2. Align incentives. If a partnership is going to engage multiple business units within your company, you need to ensure that those business units are aligned with the goals of the partnership. In the PepsiCo case above, the company’s Asia subsidiaries will be critical to the success of the partnership. However, the subsidiaries may be primarily focused on their quarterly P/L goals and see a partnership—however beneficial in the long-term- as a distraction. Therefore, it is important that corporate leaders step up and work with business units to align incentives in support of a partnership.

3. Do your homework on potential partners. There are literally tens of thousands of NGOs and agencies out there. Companies need to do their due diligence on partners in terms of reputation, capabilities and resources to ensure they are the right fit.

The wicked problem of COVID-19 is making new, unprecedented demands on all facets of society, including businesses. As business leaders look to engage in solving COVID-19 related issues, they need to get creative and collaborate with NGOs and governments in new ways. By being thoughtful and intentional in how they approach these partnerships, CEOs greatly increase their chances of success in having a lasting impact on the pandemic.","But cross-sector partnerships differ from traditional business alliances that companies have with vendors or suppliers.
In a cross-sector partnership, the value is created by partners leveraging the capabilities of the other partners to solve the problem.
In fact, a recent study by the Hilton Foundation found that roughly 75% of these cross-sector partnerships fail to live up to expectations.
Believe it or not, a major cause of problems in these cross-sector partnerships is often the internal alignment within organizations.
While cross-sector partnerships are not easy, there are some simple steps business leaders can take to increase the odds of success:1."

The importance of leadership during times of crisis is often misunderstood. The most effective leaders are always operating in crisis mode, meaning they are planning for sustainability of operations and always looking around corners for the next opportunity and also for potential roadblocks.

The most effective leaders are always looking to develop and enhance partnerships. Partnerships can look different depending on the situation. For example, partnerships can be developed with a customer or vendor to develop new products or services as part of a broader strategic plan. There are countless examples of companies that have developed partnerships with clients and vendors that have resulted in a higher level of sustainability and resiliency when there is a downturn or crisis.

""Coopetition"" — cooperating with your competition — is the second form of partnership that many companies tend to avoid and overlook due to the inherent lack of trust that inhibits partnering with a competing organization. This type of partnership should focus on critical expansion and sustainability to enhance operations, provide new product or service lines and, ultimately, provide sustainability during a period of crisis.

The third form of partnerships, and perhaps one of the most important and effective, are cross-sector partnerships. These partnerships focus on the development of cross-sector engagement, which is often an afterthought. Cross-sector partnerships could include a sports team partnering with a food vendor to provide food for a community's homeless population or a technology company partnering with a health care provider to provide more efficient access to health care for consumers.

Partnerships from across sectors, in a coopetition format and simpler customer-vendor examples, enable a company to prepare for any type of disruption. In my many discussions and interviews with global leaders and luminaries, I have found a recurring theme: The most successful leaders focus on cultivating these three types of partnerships on an ongoing basis and embed this focus in their strategic planning at every level of operations.

Though some think that focusing on partnerships should not be part of a company's core mission, the following example illustrates why not prioritizing partnerships is a critical flaw when designing and operating a resilient company.

During the current global situation, companies that have an understanding of core capabilities, operations, services and products of their partners and have a mature relationship can quickly pivot to retool and recalibrate and create new products, services and operations in light of headwinds and changing economic conditions. Particularly relevant examples right now could be a car manufacturer that quickly retools a plant to develop respirators for hospitals and clinics or a distillery that quickly adapts and refocuses product production to hand sanitizer to assist communities and health professionals.

These examples highlight the importance of remaining flexible while always employing strategic foresight to develop partnerships when economic conditions are thriving. Prepare for the inevitable crisis moment by having a network effect plan for partnerships infusing the three key and critical elements: partnerships with vendors and clients, coopetition and cross-sector partnerships.","This type of partnership should focus on critical expansion and sustainability to enhance operations, provide new product or service lines and, ultimately, provide sustainability during a period of crisis.

By Amrote Abdella, Regional Director at Microsoft 4Afrika

The current global crisis has highlighted a number of areas, from the need of efficient information management to the need of accurate data gathering for faster medical response. In looking at the role of technology during this period, one area that has stood apart in driving meaningful change is the role of partnerships. Today, more than before, Microsoft 4Afrika is steadfast in supporting healthcare partners across the continent as they adapt their platforms and services to meet current needs.

Microsoft, through its 4Afrika initiative, has formed strategic partnerships with healthcare providers throughout Africa and beyond, providing them with technical support and business consultancy to help them achieve their goals. Each of these healthcare providers has had a significant impact in their sphere of influence, but with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, we’ve seen how our partners have used their existing platforms and programmes to pivot and adapt existing technologies to rapidly provide the much-needed response to address the challenges of the pandemic.

Healthcare powered by big data

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already used in healthcare, but in a rapidly evolving situation, these tools can significantly help boost response times and preparedness.

When Microsoft 4Afrika first partnered with BroadReach, they were striving to create and implement data-driven solutions to improve the management and delivery of health programmes in underserved regions around the world. Vantage, an integrated cloud platform powered by Microsoft solutions, delivers powerful analytics that helps development, health and human services organisations quickly identify risks and opportunities.

Using machine learning, AI, big data and cloud computing, the company has enabled significant health outcomes in supported districts, integrating data immediately from a wide range of sources, and delivering real-time data, actionable insights and step-by-step implementation guidelines to boost effectiveness. Their digital HIV Portfolio on Management Solution has helped an estimated 340,000 people access HIV treatment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, while their proactive predictive tool helps keep patients on treatment by predicting which patients are at risk of stopping medicines and empowering healthcare teams to reach out to them before they stop. Other types of predictive analysis help develop an understanding of how particular clinics and staff members are performing, medical stock levels and predicting what may happen and intervening before that happens.

During the Covid-19 crisis, BroadReach has moved quickly to repurpose its existing platforms. The company has used its cloud services, built on Azure, to rapidly gather data from thousands of health workers in the field and instantly upload it into Vantage, where advanced analytics are giving leaders key guidance to manage and prepare for the impact of the pandemic.

In healthcare, quick response times save lives. BroadReach has produced a facility readiness survey that allows government to redirect resources to prioritised hospitals and facilities, so that they have the right equipment and medical supplies on hand. Predictive analysis can be used to help forecast and track outbreak hotspots.

Partnerships like the one with BroadReach demonstrate the significant value that technology can deliver in situations that are rapidly changing and require high volumes of data from disparate sources to be quickly analysed for use in prediction and preventative measures.

Keeping healthcare facilities safe

Our partner Raphta has worked with Microsoft to develop software and hardware solutions that allow contactless biometrics which can be used for access control to facilities, among other things. Of course, during a pandemic where the virus can be transmitted on surfaces, contactless access assumes a far greater importance. Raphta is now offering its Shuri Face Contactless Biometrics solution to hospitals, clinics and buildings for thermal screening and containment, limiting contact and virus spread. Using current AI facial recognition software and hardware technology developed by Raphta and having quickly added the necessary thermal imaging technology, the company is now running pilot projects at the Netcare Gardens Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa and at Kenyatta Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya.

Using technology to reach out

Telemedicine is another area where technology is enabling safer diagnosis and limiting unnecessary contact between patients and healthcare providers. Globally, the use of telemedicine has been surging during the current pandemic.

In Pakistan, we’ve seen first-hand the benefits of telemedicine in reaching patients who have limited access to healthcare and healthcare workers. Sehat Kahani, an e-health start-up supported by 4Afrika uses Microsoft platforms to provide patients who are far from healthcare centres with access to qualified doctors via a telemedicine platform, while cloud computing services mean that their patient records are immediately available anywhere using a mobile device.

Telemedicine can perform a vital role in enabling people to access healthcare services, remote diagnoses, and treatment plans. During the Covid-19 crisis, Sehat Kahani is using its smartphone app to provide virtual consultations to patients across Pakistan, delivering educational content about the pandemic, and helping to direct them to the correct healthcare facilities if necessary. Using its telemedicine platform, it has educated more than a million users about the virus, and provided more than 6,000 online consultations with patients. The company currently has more than 160 female doctors working non-stop to support citizens through this health crisis.

Bringing positive change in difficult circumstances

It’s encouraging to see how technology can support the humanitarian healthcare goals of countries across the globe, and how leading technology companies can support and enable healthcare partners to provide better, faster and more accurate treatment. Seeing how technologies can be adapted to work best in an emerging crisis shows the value of investing in these partnerships to help develop these platforms and services.

The clear challenge in Africa is bridging the gap in healthcare and providing equal access for all. By working with our partners across the African continent and beyond, we can see how technology is having a powerful impact on providing healthcare to the communities and countries who need it the most. Partners working together always provides more muscle through collaboration and we’ve seen technology allow our partners to scale, broadening their reach and subsequently have greater positive impact even in the current challenging, uncharted times.","Today, more than before, Microsoft 4Afrika is steadfast in supporting healthcare partners across the continent as they adapt their platforms and services to meet current needs.

Many for-profit businesses partner with nonprofits to demonstrate corporate social responsibility, which can give them an obvious PR boost. However, the advantages don’t just flow one way—nonprofit organizations can develop a mutually beneficial relationship with these companies.

We asked the members of Forbes Nonprofit Council what perks await nonprofits who enter this kind of partnership. Their best answers are below.

1. Help Others Develop A Positive Purpose

Due to COVID-19, companies’ values and ethics have never been more scrutinized. The way companies treat their customers, their global community and their own people speak to their brand values. Society is calling out for everyone to play their part in supporting those most in need. Nonprofits have the opportunity to ensure every company can develop a positive purpose, aside from commercial goals. - Geetha Murali, Room to Read

2. Gain New Advocates

Nonprofits derive so many intentional and unintentional perks from mutually beneficial partnerships that start with transparent conversations. The intentional perks of shining our light on the ""good"" include gaining donors, volunteers and B2B customers. The unintentional perks are that we gain political and community advocates who share our stories of family and community strengthening. - Kimberly Lewis, Goodwill Industries of East Texas, Inc.

3. Connect To A Broad Audience

Consumers and businesses want to know their investment, generosity and philanthropy is making a positive difference. Give sponsors the information and tools to help tell your incredible story in an incredible way. Sharing stories that include analogies, personal testimony, facts and stats helps connect to a broad spectrum of stakeholders. - Aaron Alejandro, Texas FFA Foundation

4. Tackle Larger Projects

These partnerships with companies can help nonprofits tackle larger projects and problems. They might not have been able to do so prior due to lack of resources and infrastructure. - Gloria Horsley, Open to Hope

5. Spur Further Conversation About Your Cause

We partnered with a local organization to create a fun t-shirt that supports our gig economy relief fund. Together, we collaborated with creative illustrators and designers to conceptualize a product that will raise funds and spur further conversation about our fundraising efforts. - Alejandra Guzman, New Orleans Business Alliance

6. Increase Transparency And Engagement

Charities that are more transparent are almost always more successful. They invite others to be part of their mission, see where the money is spent and are willing to share their successes and challenges. Success will involve inviting others who reflect the diversity of the community in an invitation to create engagement, show openness and allow for real transparency. - Patrick Coleman, GiveCentral","Many for-profit businesses partner with nonprofits to demonstrate corporate social responsibility, which can give them an obvious PR boost.

In this column we’ll look at partnerships, specifically the underlying dynamics of what constitutes a healthy one.

Business partnerships can be tricky to navigate but are often essential to building a business. Each person brings a certain set of skills to the table, and when each can complement the other, you’ve got the farm version of the A-Team. (I’m dating myself with that reference!)

While statistics are hard to come by, it does appear the majority of business partnerships are couple partnerships, but whether your on-farm partnership consists of just you and your significant other, a sibling or a parent, or whether it’s a larger operation with formalized partners and employees, a forward-looking business partnership will consider the following critical components: commitment to a common mission, mutual trust, complementary capabilities, fairness and forgiveness, and, perhaps most importantly, open and ongoing communications.

Do you share a ‘why’?

Do you share a common “why”? That is, do you and your partner(s) have a common vision about where the business should go?

Simon Sinek, author, motivational speaker and “inventor” of the Why concept, says that a Why is “the purpose, cause or belief that drives every organization and every person’s individual career.” A clear sense of purpose helps you focus on what matters most, driving you to take risks and push forward despite the odds or obstacles. Your Why will help you establish goals and will keep you motivated when waters get choppy.

The 40-word rule: Try this advice when you need to say something difficult. Typically, we awkwardly trip over our tongues, apologize 15 times for having to say what we have to say, and then offer several justifications, hoping against hope that the listener will see where we’re coming from. No wonder, then, that the message the other side hears is confused and convoluted, and a real muddle when you need clarity. Instead, sum up your thought in 40 words or less. Then say it. State your point. Then stop talking and let your partner absorb and process.

Research shows that entrepreneurial passion falls into three categories: passion for inventing, passion for founding and passion for developing. The research also shows that too many types of passion (i.e. too many incompatible “whys”) lead to “decreased team performance due to conflicting emotions and identities within the team.” Ultimately, when it comes time to making decisions, opposing Whys can’t rally around a central goal.

Finding a partner who has a comparable Why to yours means you will be passionate about the same business goals, approach risk in a similar fashion, and you will both be compelled to approach business challenges with the same optimism and vigour.

Do you trust each other?

At the heart of successful partnerships is communication — and at the heart of successful communication is trust.

An advantage to partnering with someone you know well (e.g. a family member) is that you’re already comfortable with each other and, many would add, you can trust them. (Though there are some families where lack of trust can be a big red flag.) How can you identify if trust is an issue?

Sonia DiMaulo, founder and chief reinvention officer at Harvest Performance, says that there are five most common factors that lead to conflict and are a strong indication that trust is lacking: 1) personality clashes, 2) poor leadership, 3) lack of honesty, 4) stress and 5) clashing values.

“These factors end up leading to personal insults and attacks, people getting sick and a lack of motivation,” says DiMaulo. “Trust is the performance multiplier that enables all others.”

Stephen M. R. Covey, author, speaker and trust expert writes in his book How the Best Leaders Build Trust that “true transformation starts with building credibility at the personal level.”

“Having an honest, transparent conversation with your partner(s) about if and how much you trust each other is the key to success and happiness at work,” says DiMaulo. “Coupled with a compatible ‘Why’ you will have the perfect recipe for longevity of the business and meaningful work.” The 40-word exercise (see sidebar) is an example of a trust building step that you can use to kick-start the trust conversation.

Do you speak the same language?

Everyone has a unique linguistic style. The word choices they make; the pauses and pace of their speech, whether they tend to use a lot of stories, apologies or questions, and how direct or indirect they are, are all very personal. Now, linguist Deborah Tannen has shown through research that our individual linguistic styles are how we interpret others’ meaning, and that conversational style often overrides the content of our speech.

Not only do individuals have different communication styles, but so do women and men. “Combined, any misunderstandings resulting from these different styles can lead to disastrous results,” she writes in her book You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.

She points to a common example: “The accusation of interruption is particularly painful in close relationships, where interrupting carries a load of meta-messages — that a partner doesn’t care enough, doesn’t listen, isn’t interested. These complaints strike at the core of such a relationship, since that is where most of us seek, above all, to be valued and to be heard.”

While in this sense she’s talking about a partner as in a husband/wife, much of her research has focused on the conversational dynamics of the workplace and she always comes back to the fact that men and women differ in how they express what they mean. It’s very much like cross-cultural communication: would you readily pick up on the nuances of a business conversation in, say, China without research and training? “You can’t assume that the other person means what you would mean if you said the same thing in the same way,” Tannen writes in the Harvard Business Review article “The Power of Talk: Who Gets Heard and Why.”

Poor communication is often the result of differing linguistic styles. “Simply realizing that what seems like unfair or irrational behaviour may be the result of a different style helps to reduce frustration,” she says.

Do you know your partner’s decision-making process?

Research by Gary A. Williams and Robert B. Miller at Miller-Williams Inc. found that when it comes to high-stakes, tough decisions that “involve many complex considerations and serious consequences,” people tend to fall into one of five dominant styles of decision-making: charismatic, thinker, skeptic, follower and controller. According to their Harvard Business Review article “Change the Way You Persuade,” the characteristics of these five groups are as follows:

Charismatics : Account for 25 per cent of all executives they polled. Charismatics are easily intrigued and enthralled by new ideas, but experience has taught them to make final decisions based on balanced information, not just on emotions. They are typically enthusiastic, captivating, talkative, dominant.

Charismatics are easily intrigued and enthralled by new ideas, but experience has taught them to make final decisions based on balanced information, not just on emotions. They are typically enthusiastic, captivating, talkative, dominant. Thinkers : Thinkers made up 11 per cent of the executives surveyed. They are impressed with arguments that are supported by data and they tend to have a strong aversion to risk. They can be slow to make a decision and are the hardest group to persuade. Typical characteristics: cerebral, intelligent, logical, academic.

They can be slow to make a decision and are the hardest group to persuade. Typical characteristics: cerebral, intelligent, logical, academic. Skeptics : Made up 19 per cent of those polled. They tend to be highly suspicious of every data point presented, especially any information that challenges their world view. They often have an aggressive, almost combative style and are usually described as take-charge people. Typical characteristics: demanding, disruptive, disagreeable, rebellious.

They often have an aggressive, almost combative style and are usually described as take-charge people. Typical characteristics: demanding, disruptive, disagreeable, rebellious. Followers : Accounted for 36 per cent of surveyed respondents. They make decisions based on how they’ve made similar choices in the past or on how other trusted executives have made them. They tend to be risk averse. Typical characteristics: responsible, cautious, brand-driven, bargain-conscious.

: Accounted for 36 per cent of surveyed respondents. They make decisions based on how they’ve made similar choices in the past or on how other trusted executives have made them. They tend to be risk averse. Typical characteristics: responsible, cautious, brand-driven, bargain-conscious. Controllers: Made up nine per cent of polled executives. They abhor uncertainty and ambiguity, and they will focus on the pure facts and analytics of an argument. Typical characteristics: logical, unemotional, sensible, detail-oriented, accurate, analytical.

Why is knowing someone’s decision-making style important in a partnership? It provides insight into how they come to conclusions, so you learn not to take it personally and go “off” on them. Also, once you’ve identified each partner’s style, you can package information (e.g. your arguments for trying something new) in a way that appeals to and even persuades your partner. It’s not just about what you say, but how you say it. “Each decision is influenced by both reason and emotion, but the weight given to each of these elements during the decision-making process can vary widely depending on the person,” says Williams and Miller.

Do you have an escape plan?

Life happens. We get distracted by personal issues or stressed out about an ongoing problem. As they say, there is no “I” in team; in order for the business to work as a unit, the components have to be in good shape — or at the very least a jobber part can be added. Don’t leave your partners in the lurch; if you feel that you can’t pull your weight, discuss with your partners about bringing in a temporary, part-time employee. It’s important to take time for ourselves and step away from the business, but it’s equally important to be honest with partners and let them know when you’re struggling so the business doesn’t suffer.

Another important escape: setting time aside outside of work to spend with each other. This is particularly important in an agricultural context since many farm partnerships are with a spouse and/or children/parents. One survey indicated that 59 per cent of respondents complained about a lack of separation between work and personal life and 56 per cent were worried that it could ruin their relationship with their spouse. Plan some occasional fun family time and leave the business in the barn.

With an advisor’s help, you might also want to come up with the ultimate escape plan: an exit strategy that describes under what conditions and how a partner will leave and/or how you will dissolve the partnership.

What next steps can you take today?

Test the waters : Start working on a few small projects with a potential partner to see how (if!) you can work together. Identify areas of friction and try to gauge how big an impact they could have on a larger project or business venture.

We are trying to understand the immediate impacts of the virus on how we do business, while also trying to predict and pre-empt what universities will look when the lockdowns end. How will our campuses feel? How will we deliver our programmes? How will we assess our students? How will we plug the financial gap caused by not having international students? How will research be affected?

Looking a little further into the future, will the knock-on effects of Covid-19 mean a wholesale review of all our programmes? Will online be the new norm? What will the inevitable recession mean for publicly funded universities? And are there perhaps – just perhaps – any opportunities that the pandemic offers us?

Over the past decade, we have seen exponential growth in the number of cross-border higher education partnerships between particular universities. This has been celebrated as a way of addressing the internationalisation agenda, enriching the student experience – as well as the staff experience. But differences in scale and governance structures mean that aligning two separate institutions, even under normal circumstances, is a huge undertaking, and effective communication is key. The strengths of these partnerships and the depth of combined strategic vision have never been tested quite so much as in the current crisis.

As we have come to terms with the realities facing us, those of us in strong strategic international partnerships have had a further layer of complexity to address. It is one thing having to sort out your own on-campus students and everything that entails; it is another thing again to do so while adhering to guidelines and directives being established by a partner university for students in a completely different context, in a different country and at a different stage of the pandemic.

For instance, while here in the Gulf, governments went into the initial stages of lockdown, closing schools and universities, in early March, the UK was still nurturing the idea of herd immunity and trying to adopt a business-as-usual approach.

A few weeks later, when most countries had stopped on-campus teaching and moved to online delivery (of sorts), the criticality of fast, effective and clear communication was even more evident – even as we were scrambling to offer support to students, adapt material to online delivery, amend assessments and scenario-plan for a completely unknown set of variables in the next academic year. The acid test has been our ability to strike the fine balance between contextualising communication with students so that it is relevant and ensuring that it is timely, correct and does not contradict local and partner regulations.

Those of us operating in the Gulf are probably in a better position than many of our neighbours in the region because student access to the internet is, on the whole, good. Hence, we can hope to continue to deliver teaching whatever Covid-19 throws at us in September. This is definitely not the case everywhere.

But there is a silver lining to every cloud. As we learn to accept that things will not be the same, we will ultimately see that there are opportunities. For universities with international partners, surely the most obvious opportunity must be in leveraging those partnerships to help address the inevitable drop in international student numbers.

Partner institutions can form an excellent stepping stone for students who are reluctant or unable to travel abroad to study. This can be in the form of blended learning, 1+3, 2+2, recognition, matriculation or any other form of arrangement that ensures that students have options.

Flexibly adapting to a changing international market over the next few months could be wise even if it does not offer immediate returns. Going the extra mile in such trying times will bank significant credibility and brownie points with students – and, more importantly, their sponsoring countries – for when times are good again.

108,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/decarbonization-not-offsets-private-partnerships-as-the-path-to-universi/578807/,"Fri, 29 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Utility Dive,"Decarbonization, not offsets — Private partnerships as the path to university carbon neutrality","The following is a contributed article by Jigar Shah, president of Generate Capital and a 1996 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Jonah Messinger, a student pursuing both Bachelor of Science and Master of Engineering degrees at the university.

Pledges to achieve carbon neutrality have swept academia. This fall, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will finalize the 2020 Illinois Climate Action Plan (iCAP), the university’s guiding document for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 — a commitment it made in 2008, alongside hundreds of U.S. universities, as part of the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment.

That universities are making such commitments is good. But not all of these commitments are created equal. Many institutions are using carbon offsets and stand-alone renewable energy certificates, rather than taking steps to decarbonize operations. UIUC is doing more to that end than most. UIUC has successfully procured a wind-power purchase agreement, and — upon the completion of its second solar farm — will soon be third among U.S. universities in on-campus solar-power generation.

However, UIUC still lacks a comprehensive decarbonization strategy — one that would achieve true carbon neutrality. UIUC must resist carbon offsets and pursue a deep approach to erasing carbon emissions.

For example, the university’s current plan doesn’t adequately address the Abbott Power Plant, which remains a significant source of carbon emissions. Biogas from anaerobic digestion is a top candidate technology for decarbonizing the power plant. In addition, it fails to address the minimum $400 million in deferred maintenance costs the university has on the books — a number that is expected to balloon to $1.5 billion in the next decade.

One reason these steps toward legitimate decarbonization are ignored is they’re perceived to be prohibitively expensive. But that’s why the university’s mission to go carbon neutral must include one essential element that it currently does not — private partnerships and lease agreements with energy and infrastructure finance firms.

Such agreements can seem daunting. But the good news is that a model for university-scale energy decarbonization financing already exists. In 2017, fellow Big 10 school Ohio State University (OSU) approved a 50-year energy infrastructure lease agreement with Ohio State Energy Partners. Through the agreement, the Partners assumed ownership over operations of the university’s heating, cooling and power infrastructure units; provided the university with $1 billion in cash; and issued a $150 million commitment for academic programs. The university, in turn, pays annual service and cost-recovery fees.

Three years later, OSU has lowered energy procurement costs from $56 million to $51 million and aims to reduce campus energy-use intensity by 25% in the first ten years. The school has also exacted crucial infrastructure improvements, such as upgrades to LED lighting, installation of smart energy meters, and the soon-to-be-completed construction of a combined heat and power plant — which, in its first fiscal year of operation, is projected to reduce the campus' carbon emissions by 35%.

Pursuing a similar kind of partnership could provide the upfront capital UIUC needs for full-scale decarbonization efforts, which would otherwise require costly debt-financing.

UIUC must leverage private risk capital. Beyond decarbonization and sustainability investments, an influx of funds, on the order of a billion dollars, would help shore up the core educational mission of the university and prepare students for the significant job prospects from global decarbonization efforts.

UIUC has addressed many standard low-hanging fruit solutions. This is the next essential step.

There is sure to be opposition, mainly over fears of university job losses, unpredictable costs, and unchecked corporate power. However, UIUC maintains all the leverage. In a request for proposals, UIUC can stipulate requirements such as guaranteed jobs for university employees — as OSU did — retention of capital-project authority, performance-based annual payment structures, and more.

The institutional responsibility our universities bear regarding climate action is an awesome one. Universities must be at the forefront of technology deployment and innovation. It’s incumbent upon UIUC to lead on climate action, and the best way is to pursue private energy infrastructure lease agreements.

Treating climate action as a kind of public relations expense simply will not suffice.","However, UIUC still lacks a comprehensive decarbonization strategy — one that would achieve true carbon neutrality.
UIUC must resist carbon offsets and pursue a deep approach to erasing carbon emissions.

Photographed by Mamadi Doumbouya.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit new heights in March, the last thing on rapper CJ Fly’s mind was reaching fans at home via social media to promote his new album. “I was trying to figure out my way around quarantine and I had family members who were sick,” he says via Zoom. “I was dealing with life. It’s not easy for artists to do these things alone.”

Fortunately, he’s not alone: As a founding member of Brooklyn-based collective and independent record label Pro Era, CJ Fly also has at his disposal the resources of Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA), the independent music distribution arm of Warner Music Group. The partnership, dating back to April 2019, spawned from Joey Badass, CJ Fly’s fellow Pro Era founding member and a Mr. Robot cast regular, seeking out a “flexible and understanding” collaborator for the label. “We were at the growing stage, and ADA presented the best possible opportunity for us at the time,” Joey Badass says. “It’s even better when the partnership can manifest great individual relationships with the ADA's people, and that’s what it is for us.”

For ADA, working with Pro Era meant partnering with an independent label that has admirably established itself over the course of nearly a decade, but still had room to grow in terms of marketing, sync licensing, and more on a global scale. “ADA looks for partners that have their own point of view and a story to tell, with which we act as an amplifier,” says ADA President of A&R/Label Services Kenny Weagly. “Pro Era Records is synonymous with quality. While the individual artists each bring their own style, it’s a timeless hip-hop sound that they all have in common, rather than just reflecting current trends, which come and go. CJ and his album Rudebwoy are great examples of this.”

Sure enough, Rudebwoy, released in March, stands out among the 2020 hip-hop landscape with its blend of boom-bap and reggae/dancehall, an homage to both CJ Fly’s and hip-hop’s roots in Jamaica and New York City. (DJ Kool Herc, credited with helping originate hip-hop in the Bronx, was born in Kingston, Jamaica.) After taking a few years to create the autobiographical project, CJ Fly was excited for its release, and got help from ADA on a robust promotional strategy that included a short film series and a visit to “Sway in the Morning.” But the week he was scheduled to display his freestyle skills on the radio show’s famous “The 5 Fingers of Death” segment, the country began enforcing shelter-in-place orders to contain the spread of COVID-19. “It was the most devastating thing ever,” says CJ Fly, while still acknowledging positive reactions from fans. “I feel like people are very appreciative to have the music…so the fact that it’s healing during the pandemic is a blessing.”

It also helps that the creative minds at ADA are helping CJ Fly promote Rudebwoy in a way that references the album’s themes and reaches fans right at home. They developed the concept for “Rudebwoy Fridays,” CJ Fly’s weekly Instagram Live series launched last week, in which he adjusts to the new normal in different ways. In the forthcoming “Rudebwoy Riddims” episode, he’ll be freestyling over Jamaican dancehall instrumentals from his makeshift studio at home, and in “Rudebwoy Recipes,” he’ll hone his Caribbean culinary skills. He’ll have guests, too—in today’s episode, “Rudebwoy Wellness w/ Emilia,” he goes live with his girlfriend Emilia Ortiz, a spiritual advisor and mental health advocate, to do a deep dive on the impact of our current circumstances on mental health, coping techniques, and giving back to others. “I just want to be able to connect more with the people,” says CJ Fly. “That was the whole goal with this album.”

It’s a prime example of the synergy between ADA and its partners, utilizing the resources of the former to expound, and not infringe, upon the creative identity and goals of the latter. Pro Era has been adamant about this type of creative independence from the beginning. “To be honest, a lot of that was from being young and not understanding the business too much,” says CJ Fly. (He and his fellow founding members were in their teens when Pro Era formed.) “But it was a great decision. A lot of people end up signing deals with the wrong partner and losing creative control. But we have to protect the artistry.”

Weagly shares that passion: “It is important for artists, managers, and independent labels to have access to the resources, relationships, and experience required to share their creative vision with a global audience. Utilizing ADA resources, they can maintain creative control, business control, and own their own masters, while having the tools to compete in today’s global landscape.”

One such tool is ADA’s foresight. The team developed a virtual performance by Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys on St. Patrick’s Day, before such acts had become the norm, and Macklemore and Anderson .Paak participated in Warner Music Group’s 72-hour PlayOn Fest in late April. “The current climate has allowed ADA to help partners find unique opportunities for fan engagement without the luxury of touring or content shot outside of the home,” says Weagly. “It has further spotlighted the need to help weave together social media strategy, an engaging content creation plan (even if that is now content shot at home), and great music to help connect artists and fans.”

For ADA and its partners, the pandemic isn’t a road block; rather, it’s a challenge to think outside of the box. “We are engaging in charitable opportunities in conjunction with our music and artists, and even working on some Guinness World Records opportunities utilizing fan engagement from home.” says Weagly. “Pandemic or not, our marketing, publicity, radio promotion, digital strategy, and sync licensing team members haven’t slowed up a bit.”","Pro Era Records rapper and ADA partner CJ Fly.

Dr. Estabrook-Russett, who has worked on foreign veterinary projects involving white rhinos in South Africa and street dogs in Sri Lanka, is owner of Court Street Veterinary Hospital in Keene. She and veterinarian Michael Dutton joined The Exchange to discuss how the coronavirus has affected veterinary practices. Dr. Dutton is founder of Weare Animal Hospital and Exotic Bird Clinic and the Hopkinton Animal Hospital.

(For the full conversation, listen here. Excerpts here have been edited slightly for clarity).

“I think we've got a lot to offer in terms of research that is already underway, that's already being worked on, that could then be applied to human medicine,"" Estabrook-Russett said.

Veterinarians know a lot about animal-borne diseases, including those that jump from animals to humans. These are zoonotic diseases, such as avian and swine flu, as well as Ebola, HIV, and COVID-19. Estabrook-Russett wears protective gear when doing surgery on animals, though not as air-tight as the PPE used by health care workers treating COVID-19 patients.

Veterinarians sometimes use the equipment -- such as respirators and ventilators -- that was in high demand in COVID-19 units, and they have provided these to hospitals in need of them, she said.

“Veterinarians do a lot of the same work with intubation and managing patients on respirators and even triaging and taking vitals. I think it's not it's not inherently different, just because the feathers or the scales or the skin might be a bit different.”

According to Estabrook-Russett, COVID-19, which is widely believed to have originated in bats, may have its antidote in another animal: Llamas.

Llamas, she said, create certain antibodies that effectively neutralize the SARS coronavirus “That research was beginning to reach the publication stage when this pandemic broke,” she said.

“So they went back to the drawing table and tested these llama antibodies against this particular SARS-Cov-2 -- COVID-19 -- and found that they are producing active antibodies. So the application of llama cells towards human medicine is something that's showing a lot of promise. Things like that are very interesting and are going to have a wider global health application in upcoming years.”

Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to claim victims worldwide, with the U.S. death toll surpassing 100,000. ""Much of the problem is that we don't know how this is going to play out because it's a novel virus. We don't have a playbook for every virus, "" Dr. Dutton said, despite best efforts of the medical community. ""We'll have an episode or more in the future,"" he said.

Dutton has become involved in One Health Initiative, a global effort to integrate human and veterinary medicine. Among its goals: thwarting zoonotic outbreaks. ""There are a variety of international and national organizations that are collaborating on so many levels with the understanding that there is a whole ecosystem of animal health that links to human health and vice versa. We are all interconnected.""","Dr. Dutton is founder of Weare Animal Hospital and Exotic Bird Clinic and the Hopkinton Animal Hospital.

As the trends in the marketplace change, increasingly, businesses have been driven to consolidate, collaborate, and build together. To this end, we have seen collaborations within industries, even between “competitors”, as they begin to see themselves more as collaborators than competitors – each partner focused on growing the overall pie, rather than just a small piece of it.

Partnerships have also flourished across verticals, where complementary service providers come together to identify common needs and behaviours of their shared customers, to enable them adequately address these needs, leveraging on partnerships. These forms of collaborations have brought about disruptions, new opportunities, increased revenue for the businesses, and enhanced customer experiences.

READ ALSO:

The aforementioned partnerships have all been focused on increased financial returns for the businesses, leveraging their core capacities. However, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, we have seen an emerging trend in partnerships. Partnerships between businesses with little or no common grounds coming together to fight a common enemy – COVID-19.

In Nigeria, like in other parts of the world, businesses are partnering governments, health institutions, research institutes, and so on, to fight the pandemic. On Thursday, February 27, 2020, as the first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Nigeria by the Federal Ministry of Health, a new wave of partnerships took hold in Nigeria. First, we had the CA-COVID platform initiated by the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN). Then came the Presidential Task Force constituted by the President. Afterwards, individuals and corporate organisations embarked on private initiatives to partner the government and relevant health institutions to fight the pandemic.

One of the outstanding, privately-driven initiatives, is the Interswitch Group’s concerted intervention efforts to support the fight against COVID-19. The company, in an effort to lend its support, raised N305 million through combined donations from its employees, board and management.

Leveraging its partnership with some state governments across the country (about 23 of them), the company is utilizing the raised fund to support the local initiatives of its partner state governments. Part of the funds have been used to set up isolation centres, procure and donate rapid diagnostic testing kits, deploy its COVID-19 pathway platform, pay the allowances of health workers, donate raw foodstuffs to indigent communities, provide security personnel and procure other medical equipment and consumables.

In another strategic alliance, Interswitch, through its card payment subsidiary – Verve International – partnered with PAX technology, a leading international provider of Point-of-Sale (PoS) payment terminals, to donate facial masks and infra-red thermometers to Nigerians as part of the efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In furtherance of the partnership, Interswitch has also underscored commitment by the partners to promote the adoption of contactless point-of-sale payment solutions across Nigeria and the larger West Africa market. The partners unanimously agree that the widespread adoption of contactless payment solutions has a greater propensity to better mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

READ ALSO:

Other efforts through which Verve International is leveraging its strategic alliances include: its collaboration with the Lagos State Feeding Program (Eti-Osa Local Government Area) and the Young President Organisation (YPO) to set up four Verve Food Banks. The Verve Food Banks is Verve’s response to alleviating the hardship being experienced by the indigenes and security personnel within its immediate community – Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos.

Interestingly, while some of these partnerships were forged purposely to fight the pandemic, others were already existing business alliances that are only now being leveraged for a common goal. A goal that is obviously beyond their core business objectives, and partnerships that offer no direct financial gains.

While these efforts by Interswitch Group, Verve International, the organized private sector and good spirited individuals, might seem to be more ethical than financial, we know that they strengthen the sustainability potentials of these businesses. These intervention efforts drive up trust and brand equity indices for these businesses. So, while these initiatives were not born with the objective of driving sales or return on investment, we know that, in the long run, it could positively impact the bottom line.

So, as we all begin to rise from the ashes strewn around by the COVID-19 pandemic, as businesses begin to re-evaluate their business models, perhaps we should also begin to rethink how we leverage anything at our disposal, be it our core competencies or our partnerships.

We should deliberately evaluate how we can leverage these beyond us because in the long run, it is still about us.

Unveiled at IBM Think Digital this week, the updated channel program adopts a framework of three specialized partner tracks -- Sell, Build and Service. Each track aims to support a different partner business model. The Sell track is designed around IBM's traditional programs for resellers, while the Build track focuses on partners developing offerings on IBM's platform and Service focuses on services providers. According to IBM, the restructured program represents a shift for the company, enabling closer relationships with IBM partners as they collectively pursue the hybrid, multi-cloud market.

""I think it is one of the more significant changes we have undertaken, and it is a real pivot toward getting the ecosystem in behind the hybrid, multi-cloud battle that we are in in the marketplace, and putting our money behind that rather than just words,"" said David La Rose, general manager of IBM partner ecosystem, in an interview.

Steve White, program vice president of channels and alliances at IDC, said the IBM PartnerWorld program's three tracks recognize that channel businesses no longer thrive by doing one thing. ""Customers are looking for business outcomes. To deliver business outcomes, [partners] have to do more than just resell,"" he said.

Partners today instead need to build IT solutions, which is what IBM's Build track supports, and bring technologies together into services, supported by the Service track, White said. The trio of tracks let partners ""have a much more rounded business model.""

David La Rose David La Rose

White added that the revamped IBM PartnerWorld program, while assisting existing IBM partners in the expansion of their business models, also makes it easier for new partners to engage the vendor. ""If it is a new partner to IBM, generally they would probably be in [the sell, build and service motions] already [and] would be looking for these [tracks],"""" he said. Previously, a new partner engaging IBM would be restricted to using the resell program regardless of the partner's business model.

La Rose said he predicts the Service track will ramp up more slowly than the Build track. ""I think many of our partners today have a fairly sophisticated set of service offerings in place, whether it is a managed service offering or whether they are providing basic cloud support offerings. I think we will see they will put their toe in the water and test some of the opportunities we have around the Service track,"" La Rose said.

Other IBM PartnerWorld program changes Alongside the new partner tracks, the updated program also features a new incentive structure, which will reward IBM partners for investing in developing bespoke solutions and IP, earning partner competencies, and integrating IBM software and hardware offerings as part of their offerings. IBM is rolling out partner competencies that correspond to each track. Customers are looking for business outcomes. To deliver business outcomes, [partners] have to do more than just resell. Steve WhiteProgram vice president of channels and alliances, IDC IBM also launched Partner Packages to help partners at different skill levels develop and test solutions on the IBM Cloud. Partner Packages bundle IBM Cloud and cognitive benefits such as tech support and certification pathways, IBM said. La Rose noted that the packages target partners ranging from entry-level to advanced skill sets for developing on platforms. Additional program updates include a new Partner Support Desk, which centralizes support accessible by phone, email or online chat. For the last two weeks of every quarter, the Partner Support Desk will provide ""24-by-7 support infrastructure that all partners will have access to,"" La Rose said. White said the IBM Partner Support Desk is a particularly valuable resource that partners can use to navigate all things IBM. ""Most partners out there are not massive businesses. On average, they might be a 50-person business. To actually work with a big vendor and actually consume [everything] they have is really hard,"" he said.","IBM has restructured the IBM PartnerWorld program to more tightly align with its broad partner ecosystem and expand beyond reselling motions.

115,https://en.as.com/en/2020/05/26/football/1590480477_866898.html,"Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AS English,"Europe's most exciting wing partnerships: Hakimi, Sancho, Davies, Gnabry","Tuesday's Der Klassiker between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich looks set to play a decisive role in where the Bundesliga title ends up, and the game itself could conceivably be decided by the two teams' options on the flanks.

There is something deeply satisfying and exhilarating about an effective, attack-minded wing partnership, and there have been many such combinations down the years that fit the bill.

Lionel Messi and Dani Alves, Luis Figo and Roberto Carlos, Philipp Lahm and Arjen Robben, Djalma Santos and Garrincha – the list goes on.

While there are also many effective flank pairings in modern football, when considering which are the most effective from an attacking sense, it is difficult to look past those served up by Germany's big two.

Although Jadon Sancho has only been fit enough to make a couple of substitute appearances since the Bundesliga resumed, there is every chance he will be back in the starting XI on Tuesday, with Achraf Hakimi, Alphonso Davies and Serge Gnabry all likely to feature as well.

All four are enjoying fine seasons – below, we examine just how effective the quartet have been.

Hakimi vs Davies

Given they'll both be operating on the same side of the pitch, Hakimi and Davies will likely spend a significant amount of time in close proximity or running at the other, hoping to punish any defensive lapses. Even watching it could be exhausting, given how quick they are.

Both are more renowned for their attacking tendencies than defensive nous, which is certainly understandable with respect to Davies, who is effectively in his first season as a full-back. A straight comparison highlights plenty of common strengths when they are unshackled.

Davies' remarkable pace has attracted attention at times this term, and with good reason – his top speed of 35.3km/h is second only to Kingsley Coman (35.7km/h) in the Bayern side, though Hakimi clocks in as the quickest player since these records began in the Bundesliga, having got up to 36.5km/h.

Bayern youngster Davies shades it in terms of ball carries (running with possession for at least five metres), however. He embarks on 19.9 per game, 0.4 more than Hakimi, while Davies holds on to the ball for 12.4m on average – the Dortmund right-back keeps it for 11.5m.

Davies has also attempted more take-ons (118 to 113), has a better dribble success rate (58 per cent to 56 per cent) and runs an average of 11.2km per 90 minutes, 600m more than Hakimi.

Nevertheless, Hakimi's 146 carries for more than 10m is a Bundesliga-high, and while Davies negligibly edges him out in many of the aforementioned metrics, the Moroccan's 14 Bundesliga goal involvements is more than double that of the young Canadian.

Either way, it is clear to see both full-backs play a significant role in driving their respective teams up the pitch - Davies might be in for a more robust test of his defensive capabilities in this contest, however.

Sancho vs Gnabry

It's worth pointing out neither player is exactly guaranteed to start – fitness issues have meant Sancho only made substitute appearances in Dortmund's past two matches, while Gnabry was on the bench at the weekend.

However, given their respective records this term, if they are in top condition, there is little doubt both will start. It is the biggest match of the season, after all.

Sancho and Gnabry have enjoyed immensely productive campaigns. The Bayern winger has had a hand in 20 Bundesliga goals, while the England international hit 30 with his 16th assist of the season at the weekend when setting up Hakimi.

Sancho is way out in front in terms of take-ons, having attempted a league-high of 131 this term, completing 47 per cent. Gnabry has looked to beat his man 92 times, succeeding 48 per cent of the time.

But there are fundamental differences between their respective styles of play when in possession.

Gnabry is more likely than his counterpart to end a carry with a shot, doing so 29 times in 2019-20, behind only Timo Werner (36). Similarly, 22 of his successful dribbles have come inside the penalty area – a joint-high for the division with Robert Lewandowski and Marcus Thuram.

By comparison, Sancho has only completed eight dribbles in the box and just 14 of his carries ended with a shot. However, eight of them have led to an assist, which is a Bundesliga record in 2019-20 and seven more than Gnabry.

This suggests, to a certain degree, that Gnabry lacks some of the awareness of Sancho, or at the very least possesses more of a single-minded approach.

The data also highlights Sancho's slightly deeper role, which is backed up by the fact he tends to run further (11.2km per match to 10.7km), sprint more (35.5 per match to 34.1) and has reached a higher top speed (34km/h, to 33.2km/h) than Gnabry.

While Sancho arguably comes out on top generally, there's no doubting both are exceptional talents and if they get anywhere close to their best on Tuesday, either he or Gnabry could light up the Klassiker by themselves.","He embarks on 19.9 per game, 0.4 more than Hakimi, while Davies holds on to the ball for 12.4m on average – the Dortmund right-back keeps it for 11.5m.

“We’re really proud to announce this partnership and to extend our support to the South Sydney Rabbitohs as their official foody partner coming into the much anticipated season relaunch,"" Cheng says.

“Menulog has a long history of partnering with local businesses, having launched in Sydney in 2006, and so the alignment with the Rabbitohs and the opportunity it gives us to further support the community is really exciting.”

Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly says the club is looking forward to working with one of the nation's biggest brands to bring new offers to its 30,000 members.

“Menulog have done a fantastic job to become one of Australia’s leading home delivery businesses over the past 14 years. Our goals are aligned – the Rabbitohs and Menulog want to assist and support Members and the community,"" Solly says.

“With no crowds able to attend games at the moment, there is no better way to re-launch this season than to jump on Menulog, order a meal for you, your family or your mates, and settle in to watch the mighty Rabbitohs take on the Roosters next Friday night, followed by the Melbourne Storm on Friday-week.""

Fans will get their first taste of the partnership on Friday, as South Sydney run out with a little extra “Menulog green” on their shorts, along with the now super-green Rabbitohs mascot, Reggie the Rabbit.

Cheng says Menulog aims to make the at-home experience even better, offering 25% off for all 30,000 Rabbitohs members to help them enjoy the first game back.

“We know that food orders increase, on average, 20% around major game days and so we thought what better way to launch this partnership to fans than by giving members an even bigger discount off their foody favourites,"" Cheng says.

Data shows the most-loved foods to enjoy while watching footy at home are pizzas, burgers and wings, however cuisines on the rise include chicken and barbeque.

While Sydney-siders are some of the biggest sports-lovers, orders increase across the country around sporting events.

Menulog and South Sydney Rabbitohs will partner for the full 2020 season, with the view to build the partnership long-term.

The home delivery service has also partnered with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to offer eligible customers cashback via a CommBank app feature CommBank Rewards.

The initiative is off the back of new research commissioned by the bank, which found the most notable shift in consumer spending habits is in the food and drink category.

“CommBank Rewards is designed to give customers relevant and personalised offers for what they regularly spend their money on,"" CBA executive general manager everyday banking Kate Crous says.

""As Aussies continue to stay home during this period a big part of their daily life is around meal time, and accessing food safely and easily by ordering online.”

To support customers and drive more business for local restaurants, CBA and Menulog will offer CommBank Rewards customers $15 cashback when they spend $30 or more using their CBA credit or debit Mastercard when they activate and redeem the offer.

“We know that during this time, restaurants, cafes and businesses are having to adapt their operations in line with changing government guidelines, while customers are choosing to spend more time at home to keep safe,"" Cheng says.

""This is why we look forward to introducing initiatives like this, so that our partnership with CBA can help give back to the community by enabling customers who rely on services such as ours, to discover their new local eateries and support local businesses.”

The research also revealed the top changes in consumer behaviour, which included significant increases in Australians using contactless payments (46%), cooking meals from scratch (42%), spending time unwinding and slowing down (42%), and shopping online (27%).

These preferences were further reinforced in how CBA Mastercard customers actually shopped.

In the four weeks to May 9, these customers increased the number of online takeaway and food delivery purchases by 52% over the same time last year.

Similarly, the number of online grocery purchases increased 37%, with purchases at liquor store increasing 72%.

117,https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2020/05/18/facilities-management-leaders-call-for-strategic-partnerships-to-drive-robotics-and-innovation/32295/,"Mon, 18 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Robotics and Automation News,Facilities management leaders call for strategic partnerships to drive robotics and innovation,"With cleaning robots increasing in number and being installed in many types of buildings, a study about the future of facilities management has been published.

In the survey, it was found that the vast majority of facilities management leaders across the EMEA region believe that technology suppliers should offer performance-based contracts in order to improve the success rate of innovation projects within facility management and commercial cleaning.

New research from SoftBank Robotics EMEA, reveals that 89 percent of supply side and 78 percent of demand side facilities management leaders think that performance-based contracts are positive for the cleaning industry.

More than half (57 percent) of facilities management leaders would like to see performance-based fees, 46 percent would like gain-share models and 44 percent would like some level of commercial and operational risk-sharing when entering into a contract with a cleaning technology provider.

The research is presented in a new white paper, The Cobotic Evolution in Cleaning. The word “cobots” is a combination of the words collaborative and robots, and is used in the report to mean mainly cleaning robots such as the one developed by SoftBank Robotics.

The report highlights the need for a new approach to innovation within commercial cleaning, with 81 percent of facilities management leaders reporting that their innovation projects have failed to deliver on expected outcomes over the past two years. 66 percent state that innovation in cleaning is long overdue.

The majority of facilities management leaders believe that future innovation strategies need to be more holistic in their approach, with 76 percent stating that it is as important to innovate their business model as it is to innovate with technology.

facilities management leaders want suppliers to offer procurement models which make new technologies more accessible and affordable, and minimise their financial risk.

Seventy percent of facilities management leaders state that a leasing model that reduces their financial risk would make the adoption of new cleaning technologies more attractive. This figure rises to 73 percent within supply side organisations.

Nils van der Zijl, VP sales and marketing, SoftBank Robotics EMEA, says: “There is clearly a real appetite for partnership models within facility management and cleaning, where technology providers work closely with facility management service providers and businesses to deliver innovation, with shared goals, risks and rewards.

“It’s understandable that in an industry that has experienced significant challenges in delivering successful innovation programmes, there is a certain amount of scepticism and uncertainty when it comes to technology adoption.

“Facilities management leaders need to ensure they get the advice and support they need, working collaboratively alongside trusted partners to develop the right innovation strategies.”

The research shows that facilities management leaders are enthusiastic about the introduction of collaborative robotics into commercial cleaning.

Collaborative robots are collaborative robots which work alongside cleaning teams and undertake repetitive and time-consuming tasks such as vacuuming, freeing up staff to focus on other tasks such as the deep cleaning and sanitisation of hard surfaces which is critical in the fight against COVID-19.

As well as driving cleaning performance and operational efficiency, facilities management leaders are also attracted to the commercial model of cobotics, where cobots are deployed in a highly agile and scalable way through month-on-month operational spend.

This eliminates the need for large capital expenditure to access new technologies, one of the major barriers to innovation in the cleaning sector. Indeed, 86 percent of facilities management leaders point to the high capital expenditure involved in current cleaning approaches as a major operational challenge.

Facilities management leaders believe that the introduction of collaborative robots into their operations can deliver the technological and operational transformation they need.

Ninety-three percent report that collaborative robots will increase the quality and consistency of service delivery within commercial cleaning, 77 percent state that cobots can drive productivity, and 76 percent predict that cobotics will lead to healthier workspaces for all employees.

Innovation remains a key strategic objective within the facility management industry, with 90 percent of facilities management leaders citing it as a top business priority. It is seen as critical in attracting new customers, providing a differentiated customer experience and improving productivity.

Van der Zijl says: “Successful innovation depends on a lot more than simply having access to the very latest and most impactful technologies; it’s about developing the business models, processes, skills and understanding within the organisation to integrate new technologies in an effective and sustainable way.

“It’s crucial that facilities management leaders, whether on the demand or supply side, find strategic technology partners that can help them to implement the wider operational and cultural changes that are so critical to delivering innovation and real commercial impact.”

He grew his business after partnering with a friend and former fellow club rugby player, Demetrius Sas.

Together they raise sheep in Carnarvon, a remote town in the Karoo. Louw is featured on the latest edition of Food For Mzansi’s weekly podcast called Farmer’s Inside Track. It can be heard on most of the world’s leading podcast platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts.

“We thought if we want to go bigger, we have to put something together. We sat together and made a plan. After a while, we decided to do it. We hired some land. One thing led to another. It’s a few years later and we’re still going strong,” says Louw (29).

The Carnarvon duo have since faced many trials together, including the Karoo’s worst drought in 100 years. Not only do they equally share the responsibilities, burdens and triumphs, they also share the challenge of getting financial assistance to grow their farming business.

Louw says their business would not have grown were it not for his partnership with Sas (32). “Before we partnered up, we had the same goals. We spoke about the same things. We had the same ambition and a shared love for sheep farming in the Karoo. I like listening to him, and he had good advice as someone who (previously) did everything on his own. Both of us were upcoming farmers with the same struggles, and we also have our own personal ambitions.”

The trick is to lay ground rules to stimulate a successful partnership, he adds. “If you partner has more ambition than you have, then you know you’re on the right path. When I think I work hard… then Demetrius just works harder. He has more ambition than I have – more love for the Karoo, sheep and our people too. That’s our glue, but if you have a partner that just wants to ride on your back then it’s not going to work. We are so driven to succeed.”

Also featured in the Farmer’s Inside Track podcast is North West farmer Thabo Dithakgwe who says Food For Mzansi’s earlier article about his agricultural journey even opened doors for him with pres. Cyril Ramaphosa. This week Farmer’s Inside Track club members have selected as Agbiz economist Wandile Sihlobo’s Finding Common Ground: Land, Equity and Agriculture as their book of the week.

119,https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/security-threats-contemporary-world-politics-potential-hegemons,"Wed, 06 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Cato Institute,"Security Threats in Contemporary World Politics: Potential Hegemons, Partnerships, and Primacy","A broad range of research in international relations suggests that, under most circumstances, great power politics in Asia is likely to be peaceful. Defensive realists have long argued that the costs of conquests are extraordinarily high; their theories are especially relevant in Asia, where maritime geography and the likely presence of secure nuclear arsenals provide a large defensive advantage.21 Liberal arguments often come to the same conclusion by a different route: economic exchange has skyrocketed in Asia, creating the capitalist interdependence that is often said to incentivize peace. Modern economies have become more difficult to exploit, meaning that fewer economic gains are to be had from conquest.22

One could further add cognitive, normative, and biological arguments: Steven Pinker has recently argued that humans are moving away from warfare for all those reasons, while John Mueller has contended that major war among modern, industrial societies has already gone the way of dueling among people.23 Even the Asian absence of two traditional liberal causes of peace—widespread democracy and dense institutionalization—has become a less compelling worry. Although Asia lacks the institutionalization of European politics, it is not exactly devoid of institutions, which have increased in number, membership, and overlapping linkages since the end of the Cold War.24 More Asian regimes are democracies than ever before, and China’s autocratic regime appears to bias its external politics in favor of compromise, so that it can maintain domestic control.25

However, one might argue that grand strategy should not assume “normal” times and actors. In the past, some states anticipated—and bore—tremendous costs to obtain their national objectives. The factors that restrain mature liberal democracies in secure regions may not apply to more nationalist, authoritarian, and state‐​capitalist countries in a region of shifting power balances. The presence of highly revisionist regimes, which are insensitive to the costs of war and inducements to peace just noted, might threaten Asia’s peace.

Many defensive realists’ projections of world politics assume that security is the dominant state preference, and they define security narrowly as the protection of the homeland. However, a body of research suggests that some states prioritize other values as highly as security. For instance, Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth argue that “states have preferences not only for security but also for prestige, status, and other aims, and they engage in tradeoffs among the various objectives.” Moreover, states often define “security” broadly in relation to “many and varied milieu goals.”26 If Asia’s politics are driven by those sorts of motivations, then even secure states may, nonetheless, engage in power competition, with potentially disastrous results.

Furthermore, offensive realism doubts the validity of claims about defensive advantage and easy signaling of intentions altogether. Offensive realists argue that the deadly logic of security competition in an uncertain world dominated the effects of institutions, ideas, democracy, and capitalism in the past. The theory may remain powerful today, as Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth contend, and its predictions are grim: “The withdrawal of the American pacifier will yield either a competitive regional multipolarity complete with associated insecurity, arms racing, crisis instability, nuclear proliferation, and the like, or bids for regional hegemony, which may be beyond the ability of local great powers to contain (and which in any case would generate intensely competitive behavior, possibly including regional great power war).”27 Offensive realism predicts a world full of revisionists, checked only by large centers of power.

Primacy’s core difficulty is that if highly motivated revisionist states exist, they will be incredibly difficult to manage even with the presence of the American pacifier. Such states are least likely to credit American threats and promises, and they are most likely to accept the costs of American punishment. Primacy has a Goldilocks problem: conditions can be neither too hot nor too cold. Challengers to the American order must be so strongly motivated that they are willing to pay the very considerable costs associated with modern conflict, but not so strongly motivated that the prospect of fighting the United States fails to deter them. Perhaps that describes the world in which we live, but it seems far more likely that only a few states are motivated by an amount of revisionism that is “just right.”

Primacy depends on allies and adversaries alike being responsive to American security guarantees. The more states prefer other objectives to security, the less likely American security blandishments are to influence their behavior. Revisionist opponents will have good reason to believe they have a stronger will than the United States on critical non‐​security issues, and challenges are likely. The simple fact that such states will care far more about the issue in dispute will, thus, incentivize a gamble that the United States will decline to intervene. Even if the United States chooses to fight and even if the United States can deny the challenger its military objectives, revisionists motivated by non‐​security aims will have good reason to believe they can win the resulting contest in pain. How long will Washington continue to bear costs over a quarrel in a faraway country between people about whom it knows nothing?

If the revisionists are allies of the United States, they may simply value the issue at hand more than they value security guarantees. Alternatively, they could make the opposite bet, gambling that the United States can be convinced to support their objectives, however grudgingly, or that less resolved regional actors will be deterred by that possibility. In any case, a basic point holds. Revisionists must take risks to obtain their objectives. A state that places a very high value on non‐​security gains is much more likely to take risks. It is difficult to imagine the Goldilocks revisionists for whom U.S. commitments represent the decisive factor in their calculus.

Those dangers are particularly evident when states seek positional goods, such as status or prestige, that tend to be zero‐​sum. For instance, Wohlforth argues that status is connected to material capabilities and that “dissatisfaction [with status] arises not from dominance itself, but from dominance that appears to rest on ambiguous foundations.”28 Multipolar environments, he argues, cause status dissatisfaction because there are multiple indexes of capability (e.g., military, naval, economic) across which states compare themselves, all of which provide different assessments of status. An illustrative example is the Crimean War, where Russia pursued status goals against an overwhelming coalition whose members themselves had no security concerns. Wohlforth argues that Russia’s power on land and its ambiguity about Britain’s economic power led Russia to pursue a higher rank than it could secure with its capabilities.

Applying those arguments to East Asia should give us pause. Though Wohlforth argues that unipolarity should produce an unambiguous status hierarchy, East Asia looks similar to the Crimean example. Using Wohlforth’s metrics, China has the largest ground force in the world and the ability to rapidly augment it. That point of comparison could be relevant for potential flash points such as the Korean Peninsula. The Chinese navy is no match for its American counterpart in the open ocean, but it is growing and modernizing and would likely be operating close to its own coasts in a potential clash. Economic measures throw the problem into bold relief. Using an index of energy consumption and iron and steel production, Britain was 13.5 times more powerful than Russia at the time of the Crimean War. China’s GDP is roughly half of America’s now and is projected to overtake Washington in the next couple of decades.29 Tsarist Russia had not undergone the Industrial Revolution and misunderstood its economic implications. By contrast, Chinese growth is well understood and is the most salient feature of contemporary East Asian politics. There seems ample cause for the Chinese to experience status dissatisfaction across a number of metrics, which could be very difficult to manage through American commitments in the region.

Offensive realist revisionists pose a similar problem. Offensive realism predicts a bleak world of relentless security competition because of its focus on uncertainty. States cannot reliably predict one another’s intentions—a very difficult task in the present, and an impossible one any distance into the future. “In a world where great powers have the capability to attack one another and might have the motive to do so,” John Mearsheimer argues, states “must at least be suspicious of other states and reluctant to trust them.” The result is that “each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and alone, and therefore it aims to provide for its own survival.” The only reliable provision for security is more power.30 Unfortunately, that conclusion means that “alliances are only temporary marriages of convenience: today’s alliance partner might be tomorrow’s enemy,” and vice versa. Offensive realist predictions are, therefore, trouble for primacy. Friends and foes will be looking to take advantage of one another, and they will not be prone to regarding the commitments the United States made a long time ago as especially relevant to the present. Indeed, “great powers are also sometimes unsure about the resolve of opposing states as well as allies.” That uncertainty leads to calculated risks by aggressors and allies who begin to take security measures as though the United States may not intervene. Furthermore, because “fighting wars is a complicated business in which it is often difficult to predict outcomes,” revisionists of all stripes have incentives toward innovation and clever strategies. Fait accompli tactics that quickly revise the status quo and then dare others to push for reversal, or new military technology and doctrines that give revisionists hopes of a quick victory, are likely to be common in an offensive realist world. American commitments will be of questionable value for deterrence or reassurance under those circumstances.31

Nuno Monteiro has recently laid out the problematic relationship between offensive realist assumptions and American strategy. He argues that primacy—which he calls a strategy of “defensive dominance”— tends to create extremely dedicated minor power revisionists, for two reasons. First, primacy is a strategy of locking in the status quo through formal or informal commitments to regional actors. A favorable status quo for major regional powers will often come at the expense of local minor powers, which may be inclined to try to reverse it: for both security reasons and the non‐​security reasons noted earlier, a unipolar world will reduce the “value of peace” for some countries.

Second, the most prominent aspects of the status quo being locked in are the extant territorial, alignment, and power distribution conditions. Those conditions pose no special problems for a state that can ensure its own survival, but minor powers by definition cannot. They exist in a state of radical uncertainty regarding the intentions of the unipole. Lacking the hope of an external sponsor should the unipole turn on them, recalcitrant minor powers have incentives to build up their military power, pursue nuclear weapons, and change the status quo through salami tactics. Those actions are just the sort of security competition that primacy hopes to prevent, and they are likely to precipitate a clash with the unipole.32

Recent scholarship in international relations highlights additional circumstances under which the management of regional politics will be difficult. Timothy Crawford’s work identifies two conditions that make restraining others—or “pivotal deterrence” in his terms—more difficult: when the pivot is trying to defend nonvital interests and when potential adversaries and allies have other alignment options. Empirically, his view is not particularly sanguine. Crawford’s chapter on 1870s’ Germany is subtitled “Why Bismarck Had It Easy” and shows that non‐​Bismarckian strategists in less propitious circumstances have a tough task. His chapter on America’s failure to prevent war between Pakistan and India in the 1960s demonstrates just how difficult restraining major Asian powers can be, and it is an imperfect but useful analogue for the type of problem a contemporary primacy strategy may face. And, of course, his chapter on Britain in 1914 should provide a cautionary tale to any power trying to “hold the balance”—those who want only to prevent war are most likely to be chain‐​ganged into a conflict they would prefer to avoid.33

Similarly, Jeremy Pressman argues that for alliance restraint to work, the restrainer must avoid deception by its partner while unifying its national leadership and political institutions around costly measures of power mobilization. That his book begins with the example of the United States’ failure to prevent the 1956 Suez crisis is noteworthy.34 Tongfi Kim’s work on entrapment notes that “there is a reputational cost for non‐​involvement” in an ally’s wars and that security commitments “increase the costs of non‐​involvement and make it rational for self‐​interested states to become entangled into undesirable situations”— surely a concern in East Asia.35 Even Dominic Tierney, who argues that restraint will be more common than chain‐​ganging in alliances, identifies salient conditions that lead to chain‐​ganging: an especially hawkish partner pulling its moderate dovish ally over the cliff and within defending coalitions. Since the United States is certainly not wholly averse to the use of force and is generally trying to protect the status quo, those conditions seem especially relevant.36

In sum, for primacy to work, the weight of U.S. power must be the decisive influence by which local actors make decisions about whether to engage in security competition. The many powerful forces working for peace—geography, nuclear weapons, trade, and so forth—will often produce very low levels of security competition with or without an American presence. Only highly dedicated revisionist actors, motivated either by non‐​security gains or the uncertainty of the international system, are likely to pursue a power competition. They are just the sort of actors, however, whom it will be difficult to manage. Competition will probably ensue anyway, with or without American engagement. Primacy, therefore, faces a Goldilocks problem: Asian politics will frequently be too cold for American commitments to be useful or too hot for them to handle. Only if the temperature of revisionism is “just right” does primacy have any hope of contributing to regional security.","Many defensive realists’ projections of world politics assume that security is the dominant state preference, and they define security narrowly as the protection of the homeland.
The more states prefer other objectives to security, the less likely American security blandishments are to influence their behavior.

ChainUP

ChainUP has a rich experience in the crypto industry, which makes them stand out among blockchain service providers. Having launched in September 2017, they have served over 300 exchange clients, 100 digital wallet clients, and 150 liquidity service clients. In total, they’ve served over 50 million users in more than 20 countries in Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania.

Their product lines include white-label exchange solutions, digital wallets, public chains and consortium blockchains, mining pools, blockchain cloud media, liquidity and brokerage solutions. Essentially, they are a one-stop-shop for blockchain and tech solutions in the space.

As the corona-induced market conditions linger, ChainUP has been globalizing and localizing while cultivating skills internally.

They continue to lead the way in promoting the cooperation between blockchain companies and regulators in order to strengthen monitoring and increase compliance.

Can you tell us more about ChainUP, how you got started and what you aim to do?

Sure, I am Zhong Gengfa, the founder and CEO of ChainUP and I previously served as the Technical Director of Baidu SNS Division where I founded its technical team. I’ve also served as the CTO of a well-known P2P car rental platform, START.

In September 2017, I established ChainUP as a blockchain technology solution provider together with my co-founders Jun Du and Hu Donghai. There are some interesting anecdotes actually about our early days as a startup but that will take a bit of time, so hopefully you can take a rain check!

Our main goal is to provide the technical solutions much needed in the development of the crypto-blockchain industry. We strive to provide top expertise, the requisite know-how, offer diversity in the types of solutions, and provide exceptional support and service to the blockchain community.

Why did you choose Bplus and BitSG Labs as your partners?

First of all, we are all based in Singapore, so that makes it more convenient. Bplus and BitSG Labs are also professional compliance consulting companies who are well-versed with the latest compliance policies of MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore). They can provide services that meet MAS standards in the areas of legal opinions, drafting services, overseas entities and account set-ups, having served over 150 blockchain projects and crypto-exchanges.

ChainUP, Bplus and BitSG Labs have complete setup facilities in Singapore and can provide a one-stop shop compliance service for exchanges that reduces costs and achieves compliance efficiently with peace of mind. At the same time, together, we are also able to provide more value-added services. They include incubation for exchange compliance, support for Singapore as a core location incubator, professional consultation services, quality industry resource sharing, community marketing support, over 100 global top media resources and more.

As a blockchain technology service provider, what gives you an edge over other companies that provide the same services?

One thing that stands out at ChainUP is our rich industry experience.

The team members behind ChainUP have also worked in top blockchain or internet companies and institutions in technological development and operations management, and are highly experienced in the blockchain industry. We have more than 100 “technology genes” from BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) backgrounds. Moreover, ChainUP has always maintained its position as a dedicated technical service provider, not branching off into other areas that might cause conflicts of interest for our customers.

At ChainUP, we have constructed a full technology ecosystem, an industrial closed-loop, from technology services to traffic and traffic commercialization. Our strength is being a one-stop shop for blockchain and technology service solutions. Clients can come to us with various challenges and we can offer not only turn-key but also customized solutions. Products have been designed to easily integrate with the other products in the ecosystem.

Our past success has also proven our industry competence and the efficacy of our branded solutions. Here are some examples:

Compliance Solution

In Japan, a country with extremely strict compliance regulations, ChainUp already has 2 exchange customers who have obtained local compliance licenses.

Security Solution

Security is a priority at ChainUP. Over the past two years, our complete risk control and security system has served 300+ exchange and 100+ wallet customers, providing smooth functionality with zero security incidents.

Financial Derivative Platform Solution

EXUP enables clients to create blockchain financial derivative platforms and currently serves more than 60 enterprises in over 10 countries and regions worldwide.

Liquidity Solution

BitWind offers the aggregated liquidity of 300 exchanges and currently services more than 150 liquidity customers successfully.

Wallet Solution

Using the d’App platform as our basic foundation, HiCoin has managed to skip over the d’App integration challenge that many wallets are facing. We currently serve more than 100 wallet clients successfully.

What made you decide to create a compliance technology solution for exchanges that meets MAS standards? And can you elaborate on the MAS standards you’re referring to?

Presently, the countries where obtaining compliance licenses are in high demand, include the United States, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Canada, Kazakhstan, Malta and Australia.

We feel that Singapore presents a favorable landscape for long-term compliance development of crypto exchanges. Firstly, its legal policy framework is relatively open, prioritizing efficiency and practicality. Next, Singapore is internationally recognized and this can help in the globalization of a brand and its reputation. We believe that many exchanges also recognize these advantages that Singapore offers and that Singapore will continue to grow as a global hub for professional crypto trading services.

Hence we decided to create a compliance technology solution that meets with MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) standards to service these exchanges. We are providing customized development systems for exchanges that focus on MAS compliance requirements in these areas – KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), fund storage and withdrawal, local government audit reports/API, and the underlying wallet storage solution.

How important is regulatory compliance for blockchain companies? What makes it a worthy investment and what would be the consequences of failing to comply?

Compliance has been an area of major concern in the crypto industry. Recent developments indicate that exchange compliance is a future trend.

The time when crypto exchanges and blockchain companies can operate without oversight in many territories is ending. This is due in large part to the amount of fraudulent activity that has occured in the industry unfortunately. Exchange hacks, ICO scams and other criminal activities in the space have led governments everywhere to step up regulatory oversight.

We can see the different issues faced by the markets in both the East and the West. To fulfill the different market needs is precisely why there are different types of exchanges.

However, in the long run, tightening measures are good for the industry. Regulations are absolutely necessary to protect the interests of all stakeholders in this space. This is how we gain market confidence. As digital tokens gain mainstream momentum and adoption, we hope this new Payment Services (PS) Act by MAS will be for the better good in this largely unregulated space so far.

For the global crypto industry, regulations should ideally chase out bad actors and legitimize the industry, hopefully leading to mainstream adoption. However, this will take time and the expected drawbacks during this period of regulatory transition may include gradual but consistent sell-offs and a change of loyalties for users to regulated exchanges. This will either lead to lower liquidity for unregulated entities and their eventual closure or they might seek regulatory licensing in a different jurisdiction. We should expect a period of correction in the global digital tokens market as companies get adjusted to something as new as this.

Over time, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By gaining public confidence, our local crypto ecosystem will be stimulated and this in turn will attract more credible blockchain companies to be based and licensed here. I believe this is a critical move towards a new era for the industry.

What are your goals from here on out and what are you planning to achieve?

Under current market conditions, ChainUP has been globalizing and localizing while cultivating skills internally.

When it comes to future plans, we plan to accomplish even more in the areas of compliance, our enterprise group strategies, and globalization initiatives.

In terms of compliance, we continue to promote cooperation with regulators and licensed institutions to strengthen monitoring and increase compliance.

In terms of structuring brand groupings, we focus on the development of one main brand, which is ChainUP, three sub-brands (wallet technology service provider HiCoin, exchange liquidity service provider BitWind and financial derivatives platform EXUP), and our five business lines, to create a full technology ecosystem.

In terms of globalization, in addition to our Singapore headquarters, Japanese branch, and Hong Kong branch, ChainUP has expanded into more than 10 key markets in various countries and regions, establishing deep ties and connections. In the future, we want to continue expanding our blueprint and realize both globalization and localization goals.

As we build our ecosystem holistically in the blockchain technology services sector, our goal is to be a leading contender for the global market share of this business. And as always, our top priority is our customers. Thus, providing the very best in both our technology and services will always be foremost for us at ChainUP!","All-in-one blockchain solutions provider ChainUP has launched an exchange compliance solution together with partners Bplus and BitSG, according to CEO Zhong Gengfa.
In September 2017, I established ChainUP as a blockchain technology solution provider together with my co-founders Jun Du and Hu Donghai.
As a blockchain technology service provider, what gives you an edge over other companies that provide the same services?
At ChainUP, we have constructed a full technology ecosystem, an industrial closed-loop, from technology services to traffic and traffic commercialization.
Here are some examples:Compliance SolutionIn Japan, a country with extremely strict compliance regulations, ChainUp already has 2 exchange customers who have obtained local compliance licenses."

This year marks 30 years since he set foot into the hotel industry. Back then, in 1990, Obado Obadoh was a student at Norfolk, where he became an apprentice chef. 20 years later, he founded Cafe’ Deli. Now, Café Deli has three branches in Nairobi CBD, and in 3 to 4 years, Obado plans to have 15 branches.

How did that journey begin?

Café Deli is born of a dream, risk and commitment. I worked in five-star hotels for 15 years. I worked at Safari Park, Block Hotels (now Nyali Beach) and Sarova Hotels. While at Sarova, I made a friend that would turn out to be a godsend.

She progressed under my tutelage at the hotel and then left for the United Kingdom at a time when many Kenyans flew to the European country. Upon her return in 2004, the lady, her boyfriend and I decided to open a pastry shop in Westlands. They named it Metropolitan Limited.

How did the three of you divvy up the roles?

I was the pastry chef, her boyfriend was the pastry artist. She on the other hand contributed about 10,000 pounds while the guy and I contributed about Sh 100,000 each. The shares were equally divided among us. But two years later, we would have a fallout.

Why?

We lacked a plan that was aligned for the three of us. The distribution of profits led to a serious disagreement. While she wanted her share of the profit to go back into repaying the loan she had taken for her contribution to the business, the rest of us were ploughing back our profits into the business. While she was not actively involved in the running of the business, the two of us were totally reliant on the profits from the business.

Take a quick survey and help us improve our website! Take a survey

Our manager also seemed to be sending inaccurate information to her, which may have made her afraid that we were trying to shortchange her. But ultimately, what led to our break up was my ambition. While I wanted them to expand and open new branches of the pastry shop, they maintained that sticking on the one we already had made management easy.

So you had a go at it alone?

Yes. In 2007, I took my share; Sh700,000 and walked away to start anew, alone.

Shortly after, I almost ran broke after buying a car (for Sh400,000) and using nearly Sh300,000 on house rent for four months and on kitchen equipment. But I got things in order.

Did you sink or swim?

For three straight years, I would bake and supply to many restaurants in town. One of them was Coffee World, which was along Moi Avenue. In 2010, the founders of Coffee World informed me of their decision to quit the market, citing poor business. When they said that, I felt that I knew what was ailing them.

What was ailing them?

They had made it a vegetarian restaurant. In the middle of the city, people need meat! The place was also overstaffed. I saw a business opportunity too. I made a bid to acquire the hotel even though I had only Sh40,000 in my bank account. The asking price for the hotel was sh18 million.

That was quite a leap…

Yes it was. But I set out looking for financiers and haggling to reduce the price of the hotel began in earnest. The price was reduced to Sh14 million.

Through a friend I learnt about a growth finance company called GroFin. I presented my case and I won them over. They would finance me. They said that they believed in me because I believed in my idea. I had a clear goal of what I wanted. I was resilient, and my journey convinced them that given the resources, I would gun for everything within reach. And thus, Café Deli was born.

How long did it take to pay back your financiers?

Although I was to pay money owed to GroFin in six years, it took me only four years to do so. I then opened up two other branches in town.

Are you content with how far you have gone?

Not quite. I am collaborating with a financier because I want to expand Café Deli to 15 branches in three years.

Are you actively involved in the running of the restaurants now?

Well, I delegate a lot. I hire experts instead of acting as a know-it-all. I know something about accounting but I have to listen to my accounts manager; he is fully-trained professional in that field. I have about 105 employees. I am still working with many that I started with. They are part of my success story.

There is a vegetable supplier who I used to pay Sh4,000 a month when my business started. Now that I expanded, I need more supplies from him. I find myself paying him Sh750,000 a month. We’ve grown together. But demands are higher and in spite of our friendship, if he gives me lower quality produce, I send him away.

What is the ultimate lesson you have learnt about entrepreneurship?

When you enter into a partnership, understand one another’s goals. Those determine where you direct your energies. Also, the motives of some partners may not be pure. And basing business partnerships purely on trust is akin to signing a death wish. Record-keeping is of immense importance, every detail should be inked down for easy reference.

What advice would you give when getting into a business partnership with an investor?

You have skills and the investors have capital. The relationship should be symbiotic and both parties should hold their end of the deal. Draw a step-by-step growth and development plan complete with timelines and projections. Transparency, honesty and discipline are crucial components of successful partnerships. Communicate promptly and honestly always. Make decisions that do not conflict with company interests and most importantly, keep records of everything.

And if one wants to get out?

Be flexible enough to jump out of situations that are unfavourable. A shareholder agreement we had signed took care of my interests at the time I broke free of my partnership at Metropolitan. The agreement saves the day in case of a disagreement. Also, partners must agree that one of them is in charge and is more powerful, and that he/she makes the decisions. The rest have to stand by that.

Would you recommend employment or entrepreneurship to your son?

I think that innovative minds should quit the comfort of employment and follow their dreams. I used to earn around Sh50,000 by the time I left employment. Now, I can own a few cars.

Economists say that way of doing business will change post-Covid-19. How do you think your industry will be affected?

I believe robotics will be the way to go for hotels as less people will be required. Already, restaurants are grappling with offering takeaway services to customers, the Kenyan culture, being anything but a takeaway culture. People are used to eating while seated at eateries.

But here’s a new norm, and we will have to adapt. Buy food, carry it along, eat on the way. We have managed to inculcate a coffee-drinking culture in Kenya, why not a take-away one?

The Global Tamil Forum (GTF), an influential diaspora group based in the UK said that the importance and urgency of securing pragmatic and tangible gains, with the objective of fulfilling the political and economic aspirations of the Tamil people, cannot be overstated.

The GTF today joined Tamils worldwide in commemorating the 11th anniversary of the end of civil war in Sri Lanka.

“The final phase of the war is one of the most brutal in recent history and mass atrocity crimes were systematically committed against the Tamil people. It is estimated that 40,000 to 70,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final months alone, and this constitutes only a fraction of the total deaths, destruction and displacement suffered by the Tamil community during its 70-year political struggle for equality and justice in Sri Lanka,” GTF said in a statement today.

The GTF said that with the advent of the new Government six months ago, the Tamil struggle has once again entered a challenging phase.

“The Government, elected almost exclusively by the majority Sinhala-Buddhist vote, appears insensitive to the concerns and aspirations of the minority communities and bent on reversing even the minimalist reforms achieved by the previous government. The high degree of militarization of the Government apparatus (including by officers credibly accused of serious human rights abuses), the authoritarian approach to governance, and the arbitrary decision to withdraw from the UNHRC commitments, provide a stark glimpse into the challenges ahead,” the statement said.

GTF said it is important that the Tamil community remain conscious and sensitive to the immense suffering and sacrifices made by large sections of the Tamil community during the decades-long struggle.

“Equally important is that the Tamil people and their leaders take stock of the challenges and opportunities in the present political climate and act strategically by forming partnerships with all relevant stakeholders in Sri Lanka and in the international community. The importance and urgency of securing pragmatic and tangible gains, with the objective of fulfilling the political and economic aspirations of the Tamil people, cannot be overstated,” GTF said.

While remembering those who perished and suffered in innumerable ways during the Tamil struggle, the GTF said it will solemnly commit to continue to do all that is possible, however long it takes, to ensure that the Tamil people in Sri Lanka will one day constitute a confident and empowered community that will have opportunities to lead a peaceful, prosperous and fulfilling life.

Oracle NetSuite software solution is a scalable full cloud product focused on enterprises both large and small that have high growth potential. The product is designed to assist office processes in the front end as well as the back end of various industries such as financial management, revenue management, and inventory and order management.

Is NetSuite Growing Technology?

Oracle NetSuite is a globally purchased product whose sales are growing rapidly on all continents. These customers all look to NetSuite as a product that can greatly improve business operations that can be automated, as well as implement a faster sales strategy and a more positive customer experience.

Does NetSuite Work for Cross Industry?

One of the goals of NetSuite is to implement a solution that integrates the entire business, eliminating the typical silos that tend to exist in an enterprise environment. NetSuite operating at its full capacity can take over all your business software systems and allowing all its functions to be well integrated. Imagine a software system at your business where financials, inventory, and personnel information are all integrated. This can avoid issues like duplication of data entry and ensure one source of truth information that is real-time updated.

These systems are perfect for agencies that are not operating out of one single facility, where traditional software required more complex firewall infrastructure and communication set-ups between physical locations of staff. NetSuite is ideal for industries that you would not suspect could benefit from ERP technology, including areas like the Fashion Industry, whose business models are driven by accurate inventory and pricing management. An ERP set-up can drive your business data transparency and analytics.

How Efficiently can NetSuite Fulfill to Global Business Needs?

Many companies want to either grow or maintain their brand in the global market but are often held back by limitations of their data practices. These limitations come in the form of labor productivity being spent on compliance issues, data verification, and reconciliation of transactions, instead of pushing forward the overall productivity of an agency.

If your agency feels some of these headwinds, then perhaps an investment in NetSuite products is what your company needs. The result of NetSuite is to rid your enterprise of inefficiencies that stunt company growth, through a software solution that eliminates the human error of everyday business. Chetu is a certified NetSuite solutions partner that will help you tackle any of your business needs that require the NetSuite Implementation product.","Future Scope of Oracle NetSuite ERPCloud computing software in today’s world has a lot of competition in taking over total market share in the industry of cloud computing.

126,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/secrets-circular-supply-chain-partnerships-interface-and-aquafil,"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,Secrets for circular supply chain partnerships from Interface and Aquafil,"It’s an enviable alliance that has outlasted most marriages. For two decades, Interface and Aquafil have worked together to close the loop on carpeting, an example that other companies have followed.

The carpet maker and the nylon supplier moved long ago past the early steps of engagement and strategy. They've innovated on raw materials, resulting in Aquafil's Econyl yarn that it recycles from ghost fishing nets, carpet fluff and other would-be waste. They've co-launched pilot projects that have reshaped their supply chains, including the Net Works program, which pays fishers in the Philippines and Cameroon for turning in castoff nets used to create new nylon. They've expanded their markets and slashed carbon footprints along the way, cementing reputations as innovators.

What are the secrets for the successes of this longtime collaboration between Interface and Aquafil? A virtual GreenBiz event June 23, ""How to Get Your Supply Chain to Embrace Circularity,"" moderated by GreenBiz co-founder and Executive Editor Joel Makower, revealed insights.

Buying 100 percent-recycled nylon from Aquafil has helped Interface reduce the carbon footprint of its carpet tile by 69 percent. Learnings from this partnership also helped Interface to move forward with other initiatives, such as being able to count recycled or bio-based ingredients in 60 percent of the material used in its carpeting and 39 percent of its luxury vinyl tile, the latter of which took only three years to achieve.

It’s not easy to be ahead of your time

""When I see a landfill I see a goldmine,"" Aquafil Chairman and CEO Giulio Bonazzi told a banker in 2008, pitching his circular vision for using waste materials instead of oil to produce nylon yarn. ""The guy was so shocked he jumped out of his chair, I’m not kidding, and said, ‘I will not give you one penny.’""

Ten years earlier, Bonazzi was on the other side. When he heard Interface legend Ray Anderson position Interface as a regenerative company by 2020, he thought the man had lost his mind. Eventually, though, something tugged at Bonazzi. He began to find value in that audacious goal, a notion that eventually led Aquafil to collaborate with Interface on common working teams to tackle one problem at a time. The companies share a long-held desire ""to engineer a product with the end in mind just like nature does,"" as Bonazzi put it.

For Interface, the journey was a solo one that began back in 1994. That's when founder Anderson set ""Mission Zero"" goals to remove negative environmental impacts by 2020, an ambition that largely has been achieved. These include three goals of a zero carbon footprint, zero use of virgin materials and zero use of chemicals of concern, in addition to the ""reuse or re-entry"" of materials in each of Interface's markets.

The company took this commitment a step further by applying these same metrics and goals to its suppliers in what it called the Suppliers to Zero program. Reaching out to suppliers to get them on board took Interface a great deal of creativity and early consciousness raising.

How can other companies find success in winning over their suppliers toward eliminating the very concept of waste in their products?

Moving toward circularity is a tough sell if the concept is new to certain stakeholders, but know thyself and consider data your friend, urged Interface vice president and CSO Erin Meezan: ""Look at your components individually so you can target your first steps toward what’s most material.""

For example, in the early steps toward its Mission Zero path, a life-cycle analysis blamed nylon for being Interface's largest environmental impact. In 1996, the company began working with suppliers toward using nylon produced from waste. Aquafil, in the meantime, fine-tuned a depolymerization process that it says sidesteps the use of toxic chemicals or dyes, relying largely on a food-grade catalyst to help separate waste material from nylon.

Interface eventually unveiled its first recycled nylon carpet tile, using Econyl, in 2010.

No-cost or low-cost ways to get the conversation going with suppliers include simply meeting with them, Meezan noted. Interface invited suppliers into its factories for sustainability summits in 2003, showing off practices that suppliers themselves could mimic. It raised awareness during these events and in other conversations, which included suggesting relevant webinars and other resources.

Interface also requested new types of data from suppliers that often never before had been asked about the carbon footprint of their products. That introduced a new lens through which to view their approaches.

As for higher impact results, Interface early on promised bigger purchases for suppliers that ramped up their recycled content.

How can the business case be made?

""What we did with suppliers is share what we had learned about our own footprint and how we did that analysis,"" Meezan said. ""That was our best weapon and the best capability we had."" For Interface, 92 percent of its products’ environmental impacts come from raw materials. Knowing such figures is the first place to start, she added. ""Data is really your friend, being able to map out for the senior leadership team how important your supply chain is.""

Next, if you’re thinking of pitching something ambitious, start small. Don’t overwhelm stakeholders with a major reinvention of complex systems. Instead, consider a pilot project. ""It’s a way less threatening way to pitch a senior leader,"" Meezan said. And while a pilot keeps both the targets and the opportunity for failure modest, success can encourage new possibilities.

Finally, don’t forget to bring strong examples of supply chain progress and innovation to senior leadership. Interface was the first carpet maker to use Aquafil’s Econyl, now widely used among competitors, too. Yet it’s common for arguments to spring up internally over when to open up an innovation to the greater industry, she said.

Meanwhile, years ago Aquafil attempted to spark a parallel partnership toward circularity with its own supplier, a chemical giant. Once again, Bonazzi said he was laughed at and told he would fail.

""Basically they were not happy, they were feeling more a competitor than a customer and made a big mistake,"" he said.

Today, Aquafil is selling the solvent-free nylon processing technology that it created back to that supplier.

Bonazzi didn’t change suppliers, in part because he didn’t need to. The very nature of the progress Aquafil helped to advance with Econyl shifted the sourcing needs away from big petroleum. Instead, a widely distributed crew of fishers, carpet collectors, waste pickers and post-consumer material suppliers including Gucci and Stella McCartney have become primary suppliers.

""Instead of oil, we use waste,"" he said.

For Aquafil, the costs of regenerating nylon initially were more expensive than for the process of producing virgin-oil nylon, but no longer. Bonazzi noted that it’s important to look at price trends over the course of several year when considering an innovation of this nature instead of reading too much into a recent rock-bottom price for petroleum.

""If you take into account all the costs, sustainability is never too expensive because if we pay the cost of landfilling or incinerating or the raw material we take from the planet, the actual costs are much higher than the costs we are paying nominally,"" he said.

Both Bonazzi and Meezan noted that their customers are far more savvy than a decade or two ago about the fact that the cost of raw materials doesn’t reflect the negative effects caused by extracting them from the earth in unsustainable ways.

Ahead of the times

What happens when your circularity efforts are ahead of what most consumers are demanding?

Interface and Aquafil have found themselves in the position of consumer educators, which requires ongoing diligence.

For example, Interface’s sales personnel bring the message to potential customers about why products designed for circularity make for greener, low-carbon buildings. In the last five to 10 years, Meezan has found these efforts amplified by an adjustment in popular sentiment led by advocacy from the likes of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Circular messaging by fashion companies such as Gucci, Prada and Stella McCartney — all Aquafil customers, by the way — have helped too.

Despite speed bumps in the early days of figuring out nylon recycling, Bonazzi said the market and customers have been supportive along the way. He said working with a client with exacting sustainability standards, such as Interface, brings far more benefits than headaches.

""They challenge us a lot but also the most challenging clients are the ones making the best products,"" he said. ""The more challenging the customers, the better they are. We work together to learn how to be better companies. This is really what we are trying to do.""","For two decades, Interface and Aquafil have worked together to close the loop on carpeting, an example that other companies have followed.
What are the secrets for the successes of this longtime collaboration between Interface and Aquafil?
Buying 100 percent-recycled nylon from Aquafil has helped Interface reduce the carbon footprint of its carpet tile by 69 percent.
When he heard Interface legend Ray Anderson position Interface as a regenerative company by 2020, he thought the man had lost his mind.
Interface eventually unveiled its first recycled nylon carpet tile, using Econyl, in 2010."

Chris Fox’s bona fides working to combat climate change are so strong, Al Gore honored them in 1993. The vice president recognized Fox for environmental activism while an undergraduate at Yale University. Today, Fox is the senior director of international investor engagement at the nonprofit Ceres, where he directs investor action on climate change. He discussed his work earlier this year in a talk on corporate social responsibility hosted by the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative.

Work smart with our Thinking Forward newsletter Insights from MIT experts, delivered every Tuesday morning. Email Address

Fox still takes his cues from activism. Answering our questions about how he works with ideas, he explained how he seeks input and engagement from stakeholders in common pursuit of change. He casts a wide net for information and inspiration. And his goal, limiting global warming, is both aspirational and specific.

What inspires you?

I am passionate about tackling the climate crisis, one of the biggest global threats facing humanity. The impacts of climate change — heat waves, fires, droughts, floods, storms, and rising seas — are already here and are poised to get worse in the coming decades unless we act decisively and swiftly. Climate change is also profoundly unfair. The people that have done the least to cause the problem — the world’s poor, communities of color, and children — will suffer the most.

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Limiting temperature rise to 1.5 C requires halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

The En-ROADS simulator developed by MIT Sloan professor John Sterman and others shows we can curb emissions by scaling up renewable energy, reducing the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), boosting energy efficiency, and protecting forests, among other solutions.

Who inspires you?

I am inspired by my three children — Jonah, Oliver, and Cornelia — and children around the world who are demanding urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. I believe all adults have a moral responsibility to try to protect children from climate disruption.

I am energized by the advocates I work with — both at Ceres, the nonprofit organization where I work that mobilizes investor, business, and policy action on climate change and other sustainability challenges — and groups around the world that are part of the global climate movement.

I am also inspired by climate scientists. One climate scientist, John Holdren at Harvard, has been educating the public and policymakers about the scale and urgency of the climate crisis for decades. Holdren has helped me grasp there are only three possible human responses to climate change: mitigation, adaptation, and suffering. We will have to do a lot of both mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable climate impacts) to reduce the amount of human suffering that results from climate change.

Where do you get ideas?

“I believe all adults have a moral responsibility to try to protect children from climate disruption.” Chris Fox Ceres Share









I read as much as possible from a wide range of sources — academics, journalists, business leaders, investors, activists, and others. I listen to relevant podcasts and webinars. I scan press coverage on climate change every day to help build my mental map of the external context for our work. Meeting with students and faculty members is another way I learn. I was very grateful for the opportunity to speak with MIT students in February at the invitation of Bethany Patten of the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative.

I also get ideas by listening to my colleagues, not only at Ceres but also at other groups in our field. My Ceres colleagues and I organize regular conferences and forums (both in-person and online) that convene experts and leaders advocating for action on climate change and sustainability. To help generate ideas for our work mobilizing U.S.-based investors and businesses to tackle climate change, I have monthly calls with investor groups from Asia, Australia, Europe, and the United Nations to share best practices and discuss areas of mutual interest and possible collaboration.

How are new ideas discovered and developed in your organization?

At Ceres, we discover and develop new ideas through dialogues with our staff and board members through our planning processes. We also have structures to get input from the investors, businesses, and nonprofit groups that are members of Ceres networks.

One new idea that Ceres helped translate into reality is the Climate Action 100+ initiative. After the Paris Agreement on climate change was adopted in December 2015, CalPERS, the largest U.S. public pension fund with over $380 billion in assets, expressed interest in collaborating with us to build a new investor initiative on climate change. We agreed to work with CalPERS and other investor groups in 2016 to create the steering committee, recruit funding, staffing, and investor participation.

After nearly two years of planning, the Climate Action 100+ initiative was launched publicly in December 2017. Today more than 450 investors with more than $40 trillion in assets under management are Climate Action 100+ signatories, and working together to encourage the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to take necessary action on climate change.

How do you test ideas?

When I want to test ideas, I involve relevant staff in discussing and debating the idea. If the relevant staff think the idea is worth pursuing, then a staff member is assigned to develop the idea into a proposal that can be vetted further with relevant internal and external stakeholders. If external funding is needed to make the idea happen, the Ceres staff on our fundraising team will work with the staff member to prepare the plan, the budget, and the approach to prospective donors. If the prospective funder supports the idea, the funder often has helpful questions they ask in the funding proposal process that help strengthen the idea. If the funder does not back the idea, that’s a good signal that the idea needs further refinement or may not be worth pursuing.

What was your worst idea?

My worst idea was thinking I should devote all my life’s energy to my work. I went through a phase of my career when I failed to balance work with other important aspects of my life. I doggedly pursued my work goals while failing to exercise, eat well, and get enough rest. After resetting my priorities and incorporating exercise, sleep, and healthier eating into my daily routine, I found I was not only just as productive at work, but also was enjoying better relationships with my family and friends.

At MIT Sloan, we talk about ideas made to matter — ideas that are carefully developed and have meaningful impact in the world. In that context — what is your idea made to matter?

One new idea with great potential is The Investor Agenda — a collaborative global initiative to accelerate and scale up the investor actions that are critical to tackling climate change and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The Investor Agenda provides investors worldwide with a clear set of actions that they can take in four key focus areas: investment, corporate engagement, investor disclosure, and policy advocacy. For example, in the last year Ceres and our allies in the Investor Agenda recruited 631 investors with $37 trillion in assets under management to sign the Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change urging governments to step up their policy ambition on climate change, phase out coal, and put a price on carbon emissions, among other measures.

The Investor Agenda is a powerful idea because it represents the largest-ever collaboration of investor groups joining forces to tackle the climate crisis. Working alone, Ceres will fail to tackle the climate crisis. But by working together more effectively with our allies worldwide through the Investor Agenda, Ceres can make a much greater impact.","facebooktwitterlinkedinemailprint open share links close share linksChris Fox’s bona fides working to combat climate change are so strong, Al Gore honored them in 1993.

In the new fanscape, brands have a huge opportunity to make a difference through sports partnerships.

Attending sporting events may never be the same, but some things may be better in the After Covid-19 (AC19) era. Consumers are alert, following the news, engaged with the world, and perhaps as much as anything else, waiting for the return of sports.

Working with Kristen Fulmer at Recipric, we offer ten ways brands can partner with teams as leaders in corporate responsibility in the whole wide world of sports.

Below each of the ten ways is an example and a link to an article to learn more. In other words, the link below each one is not an ad.

#1 Gameday Commute

Incentivize fans to rent a bicycle, scooter, or to walk to the game when possible. Leverage existing municipal transportation with a gameday incentive program. Teams can identify partners for ‘park & ride’ options to reduce on-site traffic congestion.

Example: AEG and LYFT.

#2 Entry Screening

Identify a vendor for an efficient one-stop screening technology that also reduces waste. Avoid screening options that spit out single-use packaging and cleansing wipes that create unnecessary waste streams. Engage a corporate partner to underwrite and co-brand with the team.

Example: Janus offers a temperature self-check kiosk.

Truyo Janus Temperature Self-Check Kiosk | Truyo

#3 Personal Protection Equipment

Not all PPE is created equal. Disposable gloves and masks generate unnecessary waste. Instead, find a partner to provide healthy, sustainably sourced branded masks. Consider opportunities for fans and gameday staff.

Example: Bonus for partnering with suppliers that give back, like Parachute.

Parachutehome Parachute

#4 Food and Beverage Sales

Leverage the trend towards cashless, contactless, frictionless transactions. Partner with suppliers that offer a variety of solutions, including options to select the amount of packaging, napkins, utensils, and condiments. The best apps can also partner with sustainable food options and can promote reusable packaging options.

Example: Bypass Mobile/FiServ transforms customer experiences.

Bypass Sports & Entertainment Venues | Bypass

#5 Merchandise

Many vendors have already identified new products to offer in the fan store that help fans combat viruses while promoting the team. Target suppliers that source healthy materials, reduce packaging, and are built to last.

The shift to a more home-based virtual world creates an opportunity to provide new team-branded products. including reusable food containers, workout equipment, water bottles, gardening tools, and work-from home accessories. Co-brand these with corporate partners.

Example: NBA gear from upcycled jerseys.

Looptworks NBA x Looptworks: Jerseys Upcycled

#6 Cleaning & Sanitation

The knee jerk reaction to combat the virus is to clean often and to clean with strong, harsh chemicals. Though COVID-19 does highlight the need for robust cleaning practices, many cleaning options do not contain toxic chemicals that harm the environment or, importantly, essential sanitation staff. Identify a ‘green cleaning’ partner to support your new cleaning policy and validate the safety standards. Better, have them move-in with you.

Example: Jani-King and the Texas Rangers.

Jani-King Jani-King of Fort Worth Regional Office Moving To Globe Life Park - Home to the Texas Rangers - Jani-King

#7 Waste Diversion

The hiatus in live events is an opportunity to revamp waste diversion practices at the venue. If you’ve been re-thinking logistics and adding new features and signage with new partners, this may be the best time window. Identify a partner to implement a food waste diversion program - even just back of house - or partner with an existing vendor to improve waste signage to promote better waste diversion.

Example: Waste Management & the Phoenix Open.

Green Sports Alliance Green Sports Day: Waste Management Phoenix Open

#8 Facility Infrastructure

The break in the action can provide a reset to improve the efficiency of the stadium to save money and reallocate budget. Locate partners to install renewable energy sources that generate immediate payback. Collaborate with technologies to upgrade the efficiency of fixtures. Identify sponsors to provide validation of healthy building strategies (e.g., air quality sensors).

Example: The Eagles All-In Green.

Upenn Philadelphia Eagles Go Green with Renewable Energy

#9 Fan Education

Select partners to communicate healthy, sustainable practices with fans. Even before fans physically return, they want to hear from the team. Now is the perfect opportunity to help them identify solutions to improve the environment at home and in the community. Work with existing sponsors to send fans branded sustainable merchandise at home and incentivize a sustainable return to the venue.

Example: The Mariners string of American League Recycling Championships

seattlepi.com Seattle Mariners announce new sustainability efforts at T-Mobile Park ahead of Earth Day

#10 Player Engagement

Fans follow favorite athletes on social media, listen to post-game interviews, and follow fashion-leads by players. Sponsoring athletes showcases corporate responsibility goals while leveraging the athlete’s personal passions and values.

Example: Brent Suter and the Brewers","Teams can identify partners for ‘park & ride’ options to reduce on-site traffic congestion.

Clearly there’s misplaced credit in that statement as it rarely sheds light on the intangible mechanics of high stakes revenue generation.

Sitting in his sunny Los Angeles home fiddling with a succession of Zoom backgrounds that includes palm trees and a view from his office’s boardroom, Matt Wiener is one of the most unassuming faces in the lucrative US$68 billion sponsorship market for global sports and entertainment.

For starters, he just turned 32 a month ago and is far too young to be at the top of his game. Secondly, he could moonlight as a stunt double for Hollywood actor Andrew Garfield. The first part he’s not unfamiliar with.

“I joke with people about my age but it rings true where all my grey hairs are,” he laughs.

“When you’re 30 or 31 you’re still in your early 30s, but I feel like I’m in my 50s now. I definitely have some laps under my belt.”

Uncovering the hidden value of partnerships

Innovative Partnerships Group (IPG360) executives are responsible for generating billions of dollars in long-term revenues across its senior leadership team and portfolio clients. It’s an impressive feat considering the small Los Angeles-based company is only three years old and has already partnered with some of the world’s most recognisable names across sports, music and entertainment. The firm’s specialty comes from connecting buyers and sellers with a solution-led and business-first approach to partnerships. Think matchmaking for brands and properties.

The Circuit of the Americas – home to the Formula One’s US Grand Prix, MotoGP and the INDYCAR series, the 2019 World Series Champion Washington Nationals, Major League Soccer projects including D.C. United and the Portland Timbers, Olympic-National Governing Bodies including USA Handball, USA Triathlon and USA Volleyball – are just some of the featured long-term projects that IPG360 represents. Its latest project, however, could be its most ambitious yet as it involves one of the world’s most prestigious sporting franchises.

IPG360 will partner with the franchise’s global commercial efforts including the creation of a new ‘sports city’ that encompasses stadium renovations, securing title rights for its stadium development and entertainment district, and implementing key founding district sponsors and global commercial partners.

How did Wiener and his team pull off such a lucrative deal?

“We built the business to bring an investment banking mentality to the marketing world,” he explains.

“It’s about connecting a real measurable business case attached to marketing through a word we never use – ‘sponsorship’.”

Wiener instead prefers to throw around the term ‘partnership’ in his hallways. He believes it represents a complete view of what a collaboration can be across sports and entertainment venues, stadium naming rights, jersey sponsorships and global football.

“The essence of a partnership is that you’re able to borrow equity, awareness or the power of a brand to attach to your brand.“

“The language of what sponsorship is, oftentimes, does the sponsorship process a disservice. So, we use partnership.

“The word ‘partner’ ultimately creates long-term business-led solutions. If you’re going to become the naming rights partner of a Major League Baseball (MLB) or NFL Stadium, or a European football club, you want to make sure they commit to five to 20 years for a long-term naming rights deal and that there’s a measurable business case to support it. Otherwise, after some time into that deal, one side is going to be upset, or will look to get out of the deal, or priority shift.

“Marketing narratives and marketing programs and initiatives can change. But at the end of the day, what doesn’t change? Bottom-line impact.

“As long as you align on what the bottom-line business case looks like on a go-forward basis, you’re going to have a win–win scenario.”

It’s a unique strategy that Wiener further details through a case study of a partnership between a tech company and stadium. Potential customers won’t just see the tech company’s name attached to the venue, they will also get to experience their technology integrated into the venue.

“So not only are they getting business from that specific project, they’re also using it as a way to showcase globally to other potential projects that they’re looking to bid on,” explains Wiener.

“What that does in the long-term is solve the direct business case and the indirect opportunity for them to use it as a global showroom to bring on other projects. Once you have that underlying foundation of the technology that is already powering that venue, product, brand or company, it’s helping to provide a solution to enhance the overall experience.”

This means that brands will get the business alongside a story to tell. This story, according to Wiener, is easier to share and market because it’s authentic and integrated.

The 32-year-old going on 50 isn’t quick to dispel conventional marketing strategies though.

“I’m a creative at heart but all I think about on a daily basis is how we realign marketing. Marketing becomes much more expensive when you can align product, business, recruitment, indirect opportunities and COS marketing. What you’re doing for employees, events and programming is you’re bringing that all under a 360-degree type of partnership.”

Superseding ‘bus stop’ marketing

One could be forgiven for assuming that a partnership is simply a very expensive way to describe a bus stop advertisement. That belief would only be half correct.

“The essence of a partnership is that you’re able to borrow equity, awareness or the power of a brand to attach to your brand,” says Wiener.

“Let’s say the brand is a new beverage company looking to launch in Australia or Europe. They will then look to a sponsorship opportunity with a well-established property, sports team or league to drive awareness.

“You can do that on a bus stop or a sign, but what you’re removing is the emotional connection and borrowed equity. You’re borrowing equity of a brand that already has an emotional connection.”

In a partnership arrangement, the hypothetical money that is set aside for a bus stop advertisement instead goes towards a sponsorship deal with a property such as a football club. Wiener’s team then flesh out the details to ensure the beverage name receives the borrowed equity, the hospitality and the association with that football club for an agreed period of time.

Using emotional allegiance to advance a brand name is what takes this form of marketing revenue generation to another level.

Turning his back on Wall Street

When Wiener was studying economics at UCLA, he was adamant he’d eventually end up on Wall Street as an investment banker. His love for sports, however, would see to it that he’d become more of a Jerry Maguire than a Wolf of Wall Street.

“I was just on the phone with the sports agency that Jerry Maguire was based on,” Wiener laughs.

Spending most of his free time reading about sport during his university years, he soon found himself delving into the semantics of how deals were being done in the industry.

“Sponsorship deals in particular,” he says.

“The jersey for football clubs in Europe; the big stadium rights deals that were just starting to happen in the US. What I found was the excitement I had for business married with my interest in the sports industry. It wasn’t who was being traded to what team. It was ‘What is the business of sport?’”

At university, he started his own sports business club and quickly made inroads with those who would become his greatest business mentors today.

“We would do programs and summits, but do it at a young age and really understand from industry leaders how you can break in.”

The move would also set the longer-term vision and goals for where he wanted to go in his career. It seemed that breaking into the industry first and then figuring out what he wanted to do next had worked in his favour.

“I was very fortunate to have a strong network that helped pave the way for where I am today.”

In 2020 Wiener stepped into the Milken Institute’s Young Leaders Circle (YLC) as a member of 300 of the world’s most talented rising professionals across all industries.

Secret to building successful partnerships

Wiener isn’t one to be stumped in conversation but following this question, he hesitates for a noticeable moment.

“I’ll be giving you the tricks of the trade!” he smiles.

“Both sides have to win. What I mean by that is, you not only have to be genuine, you have to hook, you have to have sizzle, you have to have a really thoughtful approach and you have to do your research. All of those things go into the equation.”

In practice, these sides can encompass intermediaries like a financier, capital source, property, owner and brand all coming together for a cut of the payoff pie.

“You need all sides to be aligned and centred on one collective goal, whether that’s revenue or business, marketing or exposure, product launch, or just making money.”

Wiener’s advice for securing successful partnerships:

Having flexibility is understanding what each party wants.

A successful collaboration involves saying what you want, what you can provide and how you can connect all the parties.

There always needs to be a little bit of sizzle, eagerness and excitement.

Remember that you’re not there to sell. No one wants to be sold. Make sure you are giving potential partners something meaningful and measurable.

The goal is to create a holistic partnership beyond traditional marketing.

The most successful partnerships are revenue-led, specifically measurable bottom-line impact such as cost savings, direct business, core marketing principles or new product debuts.

Having a revenue case to support a partnership is just the beginning. On one side is the brand and on the other side is the property – both still need to go back to their shareholders, owners and board of directors for approvals, so you need to ensure you work with more than one internal champion.

Resilience over rejection

Receiving a ‘no’ is common in Wiener’s industry. “It’s a pretty binary equation,” he admits. “Someone says ‘yes’ or ‘no’.”

But the hardest challenge he’s faced to date has been the pandemic, which saw the global sports and entertainment industry decimated within 48 hours. There was no indication of when people would be back in stadiums or festivals, and even the return of live sports was a stretch.

“We had a lot of people saying ‘no’ at the time. Not because they don’t want to do something, but because they couldn’t deliver on it.”

There is, though, one trait that has always been his secret weapon and to this day it continues to be the most pragmatic.

“The hardest thing is when you work so hard on something and you believe in it, and somebody says ‘no’ for some reason.

“If you can’t get over somebody saying ‘no’ and be resilient in order for someone else to say ‘yes’, you’ll never succeed in our business.”

Not bad for a young guy with a few laps under his belt.

The email was sent in response to a call to action to end police brutality.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Several teams and companies in the Carolinas have ended partnerships with CPI security following an email by the CEO of CPI Security that was leaked to the public.

It all stems from a leaked email CPI Security CEO Ken Gill sent to the Executive Director of a local nonprofit. In it, Gill suggests working on police reform is not a productive use of time.

In the email obtained by WCNC Charlotte, CPI Security CEO Kenneth Gill suggests Jorge Millares, with Queen City Unity, “spend time in a more productive way,” and that “a better use of time, would be to focus on the black on black crime and senseless killing of our young men by other young men.”

Days since the email was leaked to the public, the fallout continues for CPI Security and CEO Ken Gill.

Tuesday, Bojangles and the Greater Charlotte YMCA followed the lead of the Carolina Panthers and Hornets and cut ties with the company.

""Bojangles stands against racism and injustice of any kind. In light of recent comments made by CPI Security’s CEO, Bojangles will end our relationship with the company,"" Bojangles CEO Jose Armario said in a statement. ""We have informed CPI Security of our decision and will begin the transition of our Charlotte Support Center and more than 300 company-owned restaurants as quickly as possible.""

The YMCA of Greater Charlotte announced it would no longer name its new Steele Creek facility after the Gill family and issued the following statement:

""The Y is committed to equity, inclusion and opportunity for all and we are especially focused on racial inequity experienced by African Americans in our community. We are aware of CPI CEO Ken Gill's recent email comments. We denounce these comments that were hurtful and are at odds with our intent to be a unifying force, a community convener and a place free of racism. The YMCA previously agreed to name a new, much-needed YMCA in the highly diverse Steele Creek area for Ken Gill and his family as lead contributors. The YMCA of Greater Charlotte board voted yesterday that this Y will not be named Gill Family YMCA. As well, we have offered to return to the Gill family capital funds received to date.""

At this point, some of the biggest and most powerful players in the Queen City have cut ties with Gill and CPI. Public relations experts say in this current climate, bouncing back would require big changes.

“When one part of the partnership is not sharing those goals and belief systems, it’s really important to part company with them,” says Corri Smith, the owner of Black Wednesday, a Charlotte-area PR and marketing company.

Gill sent the email to the Executive Director of Queen City Unity, Jorge Millares, who is also a former CPI employee. It was in response to a call to end police brutality.

In the email, he says, ""a better use of time would be to focus on the black on black crime and senseless killing of our young men by other young men."" Several employees walked out as a result.

“I think now companies are more empowered and supported to walk the walk,” Smith said.

Smith says people want to engage with brands they're aligned with, especially with the current cultural movement.

“Brands are really sort of coming into this place where they know what they believe and now they can be loud about it because their values and their goals are in line with their constituencies and community,” she says.

Gill has also voluntarily resigned from the board of the CMPD Police Foundation after 15 years of service.

Sunday, the Charlotte Hornets announced that the team would be ending its partnership with CPI Security.

In a statement, the Hornets said the team believed it was ""appropriate"" to end the relationship.

“Our chairman has been very clear about his thoughts surrounding the issues of racial equality, social justice and diversity,"" the statement from the Charlotte Hornets reads. ""Hornets Sports & Entertainment shares these values. As a result, we believe it is appropriate at this time to end our partnership with CPI. We notified CPI CEO Ken Gill of our decision earlier today. Across our organization from our ownership, to our players, to our staff, we are fully committed to improving racial equality, social justice, diversity and access to education throughout our community.”

The Charlotte Knights announced Sunday that the team was ""committed to inclusion and diversity"" and would be ending the partnership with CPI, including sponsorship and branding in the ballpark.

“As the Charlotte Knights are committed to inclusion and diversity, we were very disappointed to hear of the recent comments made by a representative of CPI Security,"" the Charlotte Knights said in a statement. ""As such, effective immediately, we are ending our partnership with CPI which includes sponsorship and branding within our ballpark and on various media platforms. We stand with those in our community and across the country who are working to affect change to bring an end to racism and discrimination.”

Saturday night, the Carolina Panthers announced the team was ending its long-term partnership with CPI Security.

In a tweet, the Panthers said they felt ""it was right"" to end the relationship.

In a statement posted to Facebook Saturday — before the Carolina Panthers announced they were severing the relationship with the company — the CEO of CPI Security said he's ""listened to the feedback, and now more than ever realize the need for continued dialog to help end racism within our community.

Ray Tanner, University of South Carolina's Director of Athletics, announced in a statement that they were also ending their ""corporate sponsorship relationship"" with CPI, saying the university and athletics department ""stand for equality and justice for all.""

Gamecocks Athletics added that student-athletes, coaches and staff had taken part in peaceful protests since the death of George Floyd.","It comes after an email by the CEO of CPI Security was leaked to the public.

As soon as Rude began considering adding a turmeric product line, he thought of Sabinsa. Not only had he successfully done business with the company previously, but he knew Sabinsa’s saffron-hued ingredient is the “gold standard in curcumin,” he says, reflecting on the beginning of the companies’ turmeric relationship. C3 is the most clinically researched curcumin brand. More than 70 clinical studies and over 150 papers published in peer-reviewed journals support it. “When shopping for suppliers, consider how much the company has invested in its own product with research and look for independently conducted studies as well,” he says.

“What it really comes down to is trust, and what we offer is a chain of custody that shows transparency throughout the entire system,” says Shaheen Majeed, president worldwide at Sabinsa. The company welcomes prospective partners to visit its farms and facilities.

For youtheory, the links of the chain had to be strong not only from farm to bottle, but also throughout the farming communities in the region where the ingredient was grown. To help farmers succeed, Sabinsa introduced new farming technologies, financed irrigation systems and championed sustainable agriculture methods. The company also commits to paying farmers top dollar—no matter what the weather delivers. “We set a price at the beginning of the season and make sure they get paid, even if they have 0% output,” says Majeed. “If these farmers fail to meet output goals, it is usually because of Mother Nature, and not their fault.”

Sabinsa also supports farming communities by bringing in much-needed water and supporting schools. “For every Sabinsa water truck that goes into a farm, two go into the village,” says Patty Rude, president of youtheory. When you see efforts like that, according to Rude, “making a difference in other peoples’ lives by making a product that helps other people, it’s just a really neat feeling.”

For Muhammed Majeed, Ph.D., founder and chairman of Sabinsa, a reliable supply chain is all about great relationships every step of the way. “Sabinsa is committed to creating a positive impact on farmers’ lives. This, in turn, guarantees a more dependable supply chain and raises the quality of life for everyone in the value chain—including consumers desiring natural, top quality products.”

Partners in problem solving

Of course, once an ingredient leaves the field, things don’t always go according to plan. When youtheory began manufacturing its turmeric, the product clumped and wouldn’t go into capsules, says Rude. “Sabinsa flew over from India and we worked together on the capsule machines in order to solve the issue.”

This is core to who the company is: A supplier partner should be ready and able to help manufacturers develop formulations, says Shaheen Majeed. “Some of these herbal products don’t work the way they’re supposed to when you’re standing in front of the capsule machine,” he says. “You need to do additional process steps such as roll compaction, blending and granulation work. We can do all that.”

Case in point: Manufacturing turmeric turns walls yellow. And when washed down with water, mold can sometimes grow. “So, we needed a wall for turmeric rooms that wouldn’t absorb water,” says Rude. He notes that within a few months, Sabinsa had developed and tested three different walls and gave Nutrawise the one that worked best. “This is definitely the best business partner-ship for raw materials I’ve ever had,” says Rude. “They’re our partner, not just a vendor.”

Strong communication between brand and supplier is key to a healthy partnership—and communicating that relationship to the public is key for building trust with consumers. The supplier-manufacturer partnership story, if leveraged effectively, can be a powerful tool in building consumer confidence in products—and brands.","The CEO of Nutrawise (parent company of youtheory) was on the ground, literally, in the state of Tamil Nadu, southern India, visiting fields and manufacturing facilities overseen by supplier Sabinsa.
On-site visits are critical to vetting a supplier, says Rude, who has traveled the world tracing ingredients for his products.

Whether you’re new to business or already have an established brand, creating a consistent revenue stream can help you survive the economic instability that accompanies pandemics and natural disasters. Here is some insight into what referral partnerships can do for you and why they can save you money and help grow your business, including how to find and pitch a potential partner.

Referral Partnerships

A referral partnership is an agreement between your business and another company that includes parameters for sharing work, making referrals and allocating revenue.

Benefits can be substantial and include arrangements that lower your costs while increasing your network potential. Specifically, they help:

• Establish access to like-minded firms.

• Minimize the costs of hiring employees or subcontractors.

• Save money on advertising every time you are sent a referral.

In some cases, you and your referral partner may agree to market a service or product together. In others, you may agree to recommend one another's services and products to eligible customers in exchange for a set fee or a percentage of the sales price for every sale made. The terms and conditions are up to you and the other business owner.

Drawbacks may include arrangements that impact your independence, decision-making and management style. You may even need to be accountable to another business for decisions that you have historically made alone.

Opportunities For Growth

Let me introduce the fictional Tony, a web designer with a small client list, as an example of how a referral-based partnership works. He makes a living developing and maintaining websites for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Since he first began his business a year and a half ago, his clients have requested additional services, such as copywriting, social media marketing and graphic design. The problem is, he isn’t an expert in these. “Do I leave the money on the table?” Tony keeps asking himself. “Or should I figure out how to do this on my own?”

It would not be cost effective for Tony to spend time providing these services. He could either collaborate with a more experienced partner and split the rate accordingly or subcontract to a partner and take a cut of the revenue.

Making the right choice depends partly on Tony’s goals, and partly on his ability to find the right partner. Fit is just as crucial as reliability for a successful relationship, because linking customers to trustworthy service providers is essential for both customer and partnership satisfaction.

Finding A Partner

So how do you search for a trustworthy referral partner?

First, identify whether a potential referral partner might already be in your network. Ask yourself, “What services or products do my clients ask for that I usually can’t deliver?” For inspiration, consider what additional services and products your most successful competitors offer.

Then, ask yourself, “Who do I know who offers those services or products?” Note that you’re looking for potential partners in allied, but not identical, fields. If you can’t source anyone directly, ask for network recommendations, or approach a professional organization for fields adjacent to yours to identify potential partners among the membership.

Creating A Pitch

Once you've found a potential partner, your task is to develop a pitch to showcase the added value a partnership with your company could provide you and them.

Your pitch should:

• Briefly identify who you are and how you know the potential partner.

• Explain what you do, who your market is and why aligning with your company could benefit both you and them.

• Include a few dazzling statistics about your skills and abilities (your “partnership value”), focusing on the most impressive credentials, such as your background, loyal client base, amazing quarterly growth or customer service awards.

• Close by mentioning incentives you can offer, such as a social media shoutout to your mailing list, a brief trial run or leads for a potential new business.

As you talk, seek to respectfully uncover what they need and why a partnership might interest them. This insight will make it easier to create an agreement.

Making An Agreement

Some companies create an agreement shortly after the pitch phase. Others engage in a brief trial run first. Whatever sequence you follow, any agreement you create should address the issues of scope, profits, systems, conflicts and termination procedures outlined below.

1. What is the scope of the partnership agreement you are creating?

• Are you interested in a combined service package?

• Will you be marketing your partnership arrangement?

• Is the agreement exclusive?

2. What are the terms for partnership-derived profits?

• Will you each earn a flat fee when you close on the other party's leads?

• Will you earn a percentage of the proceeds?

• What is the review system to ensure that referral business is properly compensated?

3. What processes or systems will you establish to review, revise or renew the partnership, whether written or oral?

• How often do you want to review the contract (e.g., every six to 12 months)?

• How long is the grace period for contract revision or renewal (e.g., 14 to 21 days)?

4. How will you resolve any conflicting terms or the termination of the agreement?

• What will you do if you have a disagreement, and how will you move forward?

• What necessitates the end or conclusion of the agreement?

• If the agreement ends prematurely, how will you handle outstanding work?

Finally, remember that partnership agreements can evolve with time, so do not worry if the agreement changes as the situation changes.

Takeaway

Creating a referral partnership is an economical way for both entrepreneurs and established business owners to attract new clients and strengthen their ties to members of the small business community with similar target markets. Focus on using business connections to build your company and protect yourself during times of change.

The New Energy Policy Review report finds that stronger policies than those currently in place will be needed to deliver on these ambitions and that the energy sector needs to be at the heart of those efforts, as it accounts for 75% of EU greenhouse gas emissions.

The report further states that EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were 23% lower than in 1990, meaning the bloc had already met its target of a 20% decline by 2020. However, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU transport sector are still rising, and the use of energy in buildings remains fossil-fuel intensive.

Report findings and recommendations:

Strong cooperation will be needed under the framework of the National Energy and Climate Plans

EU must build on the bloc’s integrated energy market and cross-border trade and develop stronger carbon price signals

EU electricity systems and markets will need to accommodate growing shares of variable renewable energy

Risks such as extreme weather and cybersecurity threats are intensifying the challenges for designing and operating electricity systems

In December, the new European Commission led by President Ursula von der Leyen launched the European Green Deal in a bid to make the EU climate neutral by 2050. Soon after the COVID-19 crisis was to test energy sector resilience and policy makers’ commitment to clean energy transitions.

The EU energy sector has so far stood up well to the pressures it has been under, but the economic downturn continues to weigh on company and government balance sheets. Last month, the European Commission presented a massive recovery plan to counter the economic damage from Covid-19.

“The IEA’s review of EU energy policy comes at a crucial moment, as we debate the investment priorities for our economic recovery and the future EU budget,” said Kadri Simson, the European Commissioner for Energy. “The review supports the Commission’s firm commitment to a green recovery, which is at the heart of our proposal for a €750 billion recovery plan. We will continue to work closely with the IEA as we design European policies to transform our energy sector and at the same time provide jobs, growth and better quality of life.”","Read more about Europe’s required policy reformsThe report further states that EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were 23% lower than in 1990, meaning the bloc had already met its target of a 20% decline by 2020.

134,https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/opinion/it-is-time-for-the-eu-to-build-security-partnerships-with-its-neighbours/,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",EURACTIV,It is time for the EU to build security partnerships with its neighbours,"As the EU is discussing the way to develop the Eastern Partnership policy for the decade ahead, it is time for the EU to finally become more ambitious about the security dimension of this partnership, three former Eastern Partnership foreign ministers argue.

The signatories of the joint call are former foreign ministers of Ukraine, Pavlo Klimkin, Moldova, Nicu Popescu, and Georgia Eka Tkeshelashvili.

Since the launch of the Eastern Partnership over a decade ago our countries – Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine – have experienced a remarkable development of relations with the EU. Many of the declared goals of the EaP policy have been largely accomplished.

Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova now have Association Agreements, free trade areas, visa-free regimes and a network of business and people-to-people contacts that increased tremendously in the last few years. The energy security of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova improved, not least with substantial EU contributions on the financial, infrastructural and legislative front.

The EU is our countries’ first trading partner. And a vitally important one. Access to the EU market helped our countries diversify our economies’ which have been under systematic Russian pressures.

The EU has also offered billions in assistance to our countries, most recently with significant amounts of assistance offered in the context of the COVID19 crisis. These are considerable achievements of the last decade. But it is important to start planning for the next decade.

As we look at the decade ahead it is important to upgrade the Eastern Partnership in a way that builds on the already achieved successes, but also addresses remaining vulnerabilities.

Despite all the achievements of the EaP, so far the policy lacked one significant dimension – that of security.

When the European neighbourhood policy was launched in 2003, its declared intention was to stabilize the EU’s neighbourhood by contributing to the resolution of separatist conflicts. Since then instead of improvements we have experienced significant deterioration of security in the region.

The Transnistrian conflict in Moldova got further entrenched. Russia’s aggression against Georgia in 2008 resulted in Russian occupation of South Ossetian and Abkhazian regions of Georgia. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and ignited a large-scale conventional war against Ukraine.

These massive security threats have been the single biggest inhibitor on the achievement of other EaP goals. Security pressures, some hybrid, some conventional, make it more difficult for our countries to achieve prosperity, economic growth, a stable business environment and more stable democratic systems.

Illicit party finance, aggressive digital and TV propaganda, cyber attacks against state institutions and critical infrastructure, subversion of our institutions, or attempts to instrumentalize Church links are all complicating our countries’ progress. These are vitally important issues related to the functioning of our states, and stability in the European neighbourhood.

But the Eastern Partnership framework has been shying away from these hard, but unavoidable, domains of cooperation.

A recent European Commission communication, and EU Council Conclusions on the Eastern Partnership are steps in the right direction, aimed at developing a more ambitious and resilient framework for the EaP.

This is a positive development, albeit not fully sufficient. EU’s approach on resilience of eastern partners is based on economic, societal, environmental and digital pillars.

The main focus for cooperation in the security realm is on the fight against corruption and organized crime, improvement of the rule of law, and judicial reforms. Combating hybrid threats, ensuring cyber security, and cooperation in ESDP formats are the least developed components.

It is time for the EU to speak the language of power in Eastern Europe by becoming more geopolitical and developing stronger security partnerships with its neighbours.

Our shared interest is the building of states capable of protecting themselves from all kinds of threats, not least hybrid threats. It is not in the EU’s interests to have subverted, dysfunctional conflict-ridden states in its neighbourhood.

But so far not enough has been done to develop security partnerships with institutions in our security sector, be it intelligence services, or cyber security agencies.

Obviously, the EU as such has few prerogatives in such sensitive domains. But we strongly believe that a ‘Eastern Partnership Security Compact’ where the EU member states and the EU institutions can combine and coordinate funding, knowledge, intelligence or cyber capabilities.

Such measures could go a long way towards improving the security of the EU and its neighbours. We all believe in further enlargements of NATO and the EU, but such cooperation should also be an end in themselves.

The deteriorating security situation in the Southern Mediterranean in recent years meant that the voice of the EU has been less and less heard in that region. The situation in Eastern Europe is somewhat better.

The EU has a strong presence and a highly relevant profile. But it should no longer shy away from dealing with security matters on the European continent.

Such intensified security partnerships between the EU and its neighbours would help stabilise further the EU’s neighbourhood, but also make the EU a stronger global power.","The energy security of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova improved, not least with substantial EU contributions on the financial, infrastructural and legislative front.

135,https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/17/aaas-meeting-protest/,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Harvard Crimson,Graduate Students Protest Potential Police Partnerships at African and African American Studies Meeting,"Tensions flared in Harvard’s African and African American Studies Department this week after a professor proposed a forum to discuss potential partnerships with local police departments.

In an email to colleagues earlier this month, AAAS professor Doris Sommer invited faculty to a discussion of “activities that link Harvard to local communities beyond the University” in response to nationwide protests against police brutality. Since the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis police on May 25, thousands of Americans have pushed for a greater public reckoning with anti-Black racism.

“Among the questions we might consider is how best to partner with community service inside the Cambridge/Boston Police Department, and perhaps how to participate in educational initiatives inside police academies and training centers,” Sommer wrote in her email.

Sommer also invoked “student voices” as part of the motivation for hosting the conversation.

At the forum on Monday, which took place on Zoom, a number of graduate students protested both the possibility of partnering with the police and Sommer’s reference to “student voices” on the issue.

Though the students remained anonymous — obscuring their video and using pseudonyms — they identified themselves as a “coalition” of graduate students in the AAAS Department and across the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In total, around 80 individuals attended the forum on Monday.

During the meeting, members of the group repeatedly pasted text from and links to a letter they had authored on the issue in the Zoom chat function.

“We are deeply disturbed to learn of a communication from faculty in our department, African and African American Studies (AAAS), proposing partnership with the Cambridge/Boston Police Departments,” the letter read. “We want to be ​very​ clear that this is not the sort of action student voices are calling for.”

The letter also advocated for AAAS and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to instead “commit resources” to four local organizations and sever all ties with the Harvard, Cambridge, and Boston police departments.

“That our department, which was ​born out of a moment of civil unrest​ very similar to the one we are experiencing today, or any of its members, would consider collaborating with law enforcement institutions is shocking and misguided,” the letter read. “This discussion stands in the face of all that we have been taught and all that our department claims to stand for.”

Sommer said in an interview Tuesday that her email “probably should have been phrased differently.” She said she included the reference to collaboration with police academies to “ground the invitation in an experience” that she knew had occurred in other cities.

“That opportunity doesn't seem to be on the table anymore,” Sommer said.

Nevertheless, Sommer said she did not think the protest was “necessary.”

“I understand the tone of the protest and the purpose of the protest, but from my position as a convener of an open meeting for faculty, I don't think that the student protest was necessary,” she said. “My intention was to convene a group of like-minded faculty members to explore what we can and should be doing as a community.”

AAAS Professor Walter Johnson said he supported the students’ efforts at the meeting and in an emailed statement Tuesday.

“Their entry into the meeting was dramatic, and while it seemed as if some of my colleagues were put off by that, I thought it produced a good discussion of very important issues,” he wrote.

Johnson wrote that the clash between students and faculty at the meeting was indicative of “two fundamentally different approaches” to issues of police brutality.

“How to reform police departments? Or how to dismantle them?” Johnson wrote of the two paths.

“For what it is worth, I do not think that the faculty of AAAS are all on the same side of this question,” Johnson added. “This is not simply a divide between faculty and students in the department or in the university at large.”

Sommer said she did not think there was a difference of opinion between herself, other faculty, and the students. She said she favors the abolition of police departments over reform but believes it must occur “in stages.”

“I don't think there was a difference of position,” Sommer said. “I think we were all involved in a moment of frustration among the students.”

Though the conversation continued for over an hour, faculty vowed to postpone a full discussion of the issues at hand until AAAS department chair Tommie Shelby could be present at the meeting.

Sommer said the number of faculty who attended the event was “promising” for future efforts. She said she hoped the faculty would also discuss possible educational initiatives and other community partnerships in later conversations.

“It was heartening to see people from a variety of disciplines come together so that we can think together,” she said. “I hope we'll be able to convene that in the future, and students will be rooting us on rather than worried about what we're doing.”

Back in the Premier League’s fledgling years and the days of 4-4-2, frontlines were all about the double acts.

Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke, Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton, Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn. These were the partnerships that lit up the league and dominated defences for a number of years.

But football has changed. Tactics have changed. Rarely do two strikers start Premier League matches these days. Nowadays, it’s all about target men, lone strikers, false nines and wingers.

Among the best in the world are Liverpool's deadly trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, whose 30 league goals between them helped fire the Reds to their first league title in 30 years.

With that in mind, Daily Star Sport takes a look at the ten best front lines in today’s Premier League.

(Image: GETTY)

Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin

Dominic Calvert-Lewin looks like a changed man under the management of Carlo Ancelotti. Once on the fringes of the Everton side, the striker is on a hot streak and has become a mainstay in the Toffees first team thanks to an influx of goals.

Richarlison’s class was never in doubt, but with the Brazilian linking up with Calvert-Lewin, Everton now possess a frontline to be reckoned with.

A little more time to gel in a new system and they’ll surely help bolster Everton’s goal tally which must be higher if they want to compete with the very best.

Danny Ings



Plagued for so much of his career by injury, Danny Ings looks to have found the miracle cure this season to become one of the league’s best and finishers.

The quality was always there, now Ings has added the consistency. He went on a real hot streak just before Christmas and Southampton have 15 of his goals to thank for the fact that they’re now seven points clear of the relegation zone.

If he can stay fit and keep scoring, then Saints will ensure Premier league survival. But their biggest challenge might be holding on to the striker.

Raul Jimenez

Another name who deserves a spot on this list on his own.

Raul Jimenez has proven himself among the league’s best strikers in the past two seasons. The Mexican is a brilliant goal scorer but also a top assist provider for his side, showing himself up to be a real all-rounded figure up top.

Wolves impressed last season but have moved up another level this year and look a safe bet for a spot in Europe.

A little bit of an old-school target man, but Jimenez has played a massive part in their ongoing success and deserves recognition as one of the division’s most consistent lone strikers.

Callum Wilson and Josh King

Perhaps the closest thing we have in the Premier League to an old-school front pairing.

Callum Wilson serves as Bournemouth’s poacher-in-chief with Josh King providing the ammunition while taking penalties.

The two have taken a huge share of The Cherries’ goals in the past few seasons and will be desperate to help their team secure their place in the top division for next season too.

This is a Premier League calibre front-line and deserves to be playing at the highest level.

(Image: GETTY)

Jamie Vardy

Still a superstar striker and even better under Brendan Rodgers, despite topping 33 years of age.

A fierce finisher with all the pace to match, Vardy is a sheer menace in front of goal and backs it up with the stats – before the season was postponed, he topped the goalscoring charts in the current campaign.

Leicester are pushing for third place and a spot in next season’s Champions League, and Vardy’s clinical nature has been a significant factor in their success.

Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang

An absolute one-man-band at times, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has saved Arsenal on countless occasions with his goals this season.

With so many of Mikel Arteta’s men looking off the pace, the 30-year-old has become an indispensable member of the first team.

Supported up top by the likes of Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe, but neither can lay claim to consistency and so often the heavy lifting is left to Aubameyang.

The Gabon international is reportedly looking for a move away from the club, the Gunners should do everything in their power to ensure he remains at The Emirates.

And with the Champions League already looking doubtful, losing Aubameyang could set the Gunners back even further.

Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Daniel James

The United front three have gone from strength to strength this season, and under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer they are finally beginning to convert pace and pressure into goals.

Crucially, both Rashford and Martial are beginning to add a more lethal streak to their game. The two look almost telepathic at times and can tear teams to shreds at their best.

Daniel James has been thrown in the deep end this season but has performed admirably this season, but if he loses his place to Jadon Sancho this summer then we can expect the United frontline to move higher up this list.

Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min

Little need be said about the goal scoring prowess of Harry Kane, who has become far and away the nation’s top goalscorer and one of the very best in the Premier League.

But his main supporting act for Spurs – Son heung-Min – is often underrated by those who don’t see week-in week-out the brilliant things he can do.

The South Korea has shown himself to be one of the league’s top wingers, hitting double digits for goals and assists last season. His goal vs Burnley this year was absolutely stellar too.

Jose Mourinho’s main challenge seems to be keeping them both fit and available. With these two up top, and accompanied by the likes of Steven Bergwijn or Lucas Moura, Tottenham have won of the best attacking lineups in the division.

Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling + reinforcements



Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling are two of the mainstays at the front for Manchester City despite Pep Guardiola’s penchant for rotation.

The two have become an absolutely lethal pairing in the past few seasons as City romped to consecutive Premier League titles.

And with Riyad Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane on standby, the two are also usually accompanied by world-class talent.

Aguero will surely go down as one of the best striker’s the league has ever had. As for Sterling, he hit double digits for both assists and goals last season.

Mane, Salah, Firmino

Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino are one of the best frontlines in world football right now, let alone the Premier League.

The Champions League winning trio and Premier League Champions, their goals having propelled Liverpool to the highest heights.

Firmino’s role may not reap all the usual rewards for a number nine, but he is the perfect foil for Salah and Mane, who simply overwhelm defences with their pace, trickery and talent for finishing.

Jurgen Klopp has found a system that no one else has quite worked out how to stop, nor any sides yet possess the talent to copy it. They’re our number ones.","With that in mind, Daily Star Sport takes a look at the ten best front lines in today’s Premier League.

As the global economy emerges from its recent slowdown, many small businesses have turned their thoughts to how they will achieve growth in the coming months.

Although the nature of the economy has changed, strategic partnerships remain a useful option for small businesses looking to drive growth. Here is some information about the types of strategic partnerships that are available and how your business can use these types of relationships going forward.

A strategic partnership is a mutually beneficial relationship between two businesses which aren’t in direct competition with each other. These partnerships usually involve businesses sharing one or more of the following: customers; industry knowledge; resources; marketing resources; events and data

The primary goals of strategic partnerships are usually to improve your customer offering, offset costs, or expand your customer reach.

By combining resources, both businesses become stronger and more resilient. Strategic partnerships often provide new growth opportunities, something which is particularly useful in this difficult business climate.

There are several types of strategic partnerships, but the most useful options for small businesses are:

Strategic Referral Partnerships

A referral partnership involves each of the business partners referring customers to the other. It is a very common form of partnership amongst small businesses.

A real world example of a referral partnership would be a car tyre sales business partnering with a local car repair shop. When the car repair shop notices that a customer requires new tyres, they are directed to the tyre shop and vice versa. The two businesses share customers, which provides opportunities for growth.

Strategic Marketing Partnerships

A strategic marketing partnership involves working with a partner to co-brand products or services in combined marketing campaigns. Food companies and technology companies often use this type of relationship to reduce marketing costs, increase customer engagement, and boost sales.

Strategic Supply Chain Partnerships

This is a coalition of two or more businesses in the same supply chain. The businesses in the partnership work together to create more value than they would if operating independently.

Some of the activities businesses can perform together include manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, product development and research. This is a more sophisticated form of partnership, but it can be very advantageous for small businesses involved in manufacturing.

Strategic Technology Partnerships

This is a partnership that a small business makes with an external technology provider. In return for exclusively working with the technology company, the business receives cheaper rates and access to new technologies to improve workflow. Small businesses can save money and improve their operations by entering into technology partnerships.

Strategic Financial Partnerships

A strategic financial partnership is similar to a technology one, with a focus on financial activities instead of technology. Your business can form alliances with accounting agencies, banks, lenders, and finance professionals to achieve better outcomes.

One recent example of this type of relationship is the partnership between Nigerian-founded Fintech, Flutterwave and Uber. Flutterwave is providing access to their Pan-African network of remittance partners, so Uber can deploy its cash digital wallet feature for their customers. Both companies benefit from this relationship.

Strategic Integration Partnerships

This type of partnership involves combining the different technologies, products, or services from a variety of businesses. The partners remain independent, but share the benefits and risks involved in their joint venture.

A large-scale example of this approach would be the Nike and Apple creating products (shoes and phones) which could integrate with one another.

Small businesses can use a similar approach whenever there are complementary products or services in the same market. For example, a fruit shop could form a partnership with a local chocolate factory to produce a line of chocolate coated fruits.

Businesses can also share infrastructure or occupy the same space in order to reduce overheads and operating costs. In many cases, this approach can help both businesses generate more sales. Since they share customers they can attract more customers to their shared space as it will be more convenient for their customers to shop in a single location.

Are Strategic Partnerships Still Useful in the Emerging World?

The shakeup of the global economy has presented many challenges for small businesses. Businesses that are able to quickly adapt to these challenges have the greatest chance of success.

Strategic partnerships give small businesses an opportunity to diversify their operations, become more agile, and improve their financial stability. Small businesses can use partnerships to improve their products or services and interact with consumers in new ways, which may be critical to survival in the coming years.

Partnerships provide an excellent opportunity to improve the financial position of small businesses and make sustained growth possible. Here are a few useful tips for using strategic partnerships:

Understand your market

Perform extensive market research before entering into a strategic partnership. This will help you understand what strategic fits are available, where opportunities may lie, and what new offers your customers may be interested in.

Look for competitive advantages

Strategic partnerships that give you a competitive advantage over other small businesses are particularly valuable. Look for relationships that can reduce your marketing costs. Alternately, look for partnerships which will provide a significant technological or financial boost or access to markets

Be creative

Some of the best strategic partnerships are not obvious. Take Uber and Spotify for example. One company is a ride-sharing service while the other is a music streaming service. Not the most complementary partnership at first glance.

However, both companies realised that customers wanted to listen to their favourite songs while travelling. Spotify added the ability to automatically play a user’s playlist when entering an Uber vehicle. This improved the value of both services for their customers.

As you can see, there are many benefits to strategic partnerships. Despite the current economic turmoil, it is still a good time to look for these kinds of business relationships.

Hidden Fields’ folklore-inspired horror game Mundaun and InnerspaceVR’s puzzle adventure Maskmaker are currently in development and slated for release in 2021.

A division of leading media company MWM, MWMi is dedicated to bringing players inventive, artful and compelling games from independent developers around the world. The company’s approach is to let the vision of the developer lead, and to represent the creator at every stage of the development process. Maintaining the intent and integrity of the designer, MWMi provides the support and space creatives need to bring their games to life and to connect them with global game audiences.

“We look for game creators who elevate their art through storytelling, craftsmanship, inventive play styles and more,” said Ethan Stearns, executive vice president of content, MWM Interactive. “Hidden Fields and InnerspaceVR are vastly different, yet both are deeply artistic and passionate studios. I am completely drawn in by Mundaun’s beautiful, hand-penciled art style and story, and I’m obsessed with Maskmaker's ability to use gameplay to take you deeper into its narrative. I am also incredibly excited to be publishing an upcoming game from Night School Studio as I am a huge fan, and we can’t wait to start sharing what Quiet Dimensions is working on soon.”

Mundaun, a lovingly hand-penciled horror tale, is the first full-length title from Hidden Fields, a one-man studio founded by Swiss programmer and illustrator Michel Ziegler. Every character, scene and even environmental textures in the game are hand-penciled. Inspired by the dark, mythical folklore of the Swiss Alps, Ziegler sketches out the story of a young man who travels to Mundaun to face off with the malevolent entity that resides there and uncover the mystery of his grandfather’s death.

“It was important to me to work with a group that respects my goals, my process and my art, and MWMi has really shared the same excitement for everything I am passionate about,” Michel Ziegler, Hidden Fields, said. “Ethan and the team bring both the enthusiasm and the industry support a super independent designer requires. I am thrilled to finally bring players deeper into the world of Mundaun, which I have been drawing and designing for the last six years.”

Maskmaker is the follow-up title from Paris-based InnerspaceVR, the award-winning VR creation studio behind the mind-bending escape game A Fisherman’s Tale. Maskmaker transports players into a magical mask workshop to meet Prospero, the maskmaker who tasks them to solve the ultimate mystery behind his masks. As players travel between unique environments, they learn more about Prospero and this strange land, frozen for a moment in time.

“We wanted to create an outstanding experience that doubles down on the magic of being in VR,” said Balthazar Auxietre, creative director and co-founder, InnerspaceVR. “MWMi really believes in the power and importance of VR for storytelling and interactive entertainment. It has been a great experience to work with a team who supports our creative vision through every stage of the development process.”

MWMi has partnered with Night School Studio, the developer behind popular titles Oxenfree and Afterparty, to publish a new yet-to-be announced game. Also joining the roster is newly formed Czech Republic-based Quiet Dimensions, who will bring their debut title to market through MWMi.

“Ethan and MWM Interactive have created a publishing organization that is committed and trustworthy,” said Sean Krankel, co-founder and studio director, Night School Studio. “In making the decision to work with a publisher, we wanted to make sure that our partner would be the right fit for our culture as well as our goals.”

Maskmaker was created with the support of Creative Europe, MEDIA programme of the European Union and with the support of the Ile-de-France region.

140,https://www.tes.com/news/online-partnerships-unite-classrooms-around-world,"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",TES News,Coronavirus: How online partnerships are uniting schools across the world,"Almost every aspect of life is now looked at through a digital lens, which means that schools are having to explore the new ways to stay connected with their pupils, staff and parents.

For teachers, this presents the opportunity and challenge of using virtual platforms to motivate and engage students, while also making sure lessons are reflective of digital skill levels.

This has become especially key in the Covid-19 lockdown.

Coronavirus: How tech is connecting schools

Paddy Carroll, assistant headteacher at Shaw Wood Academy Primary School in Doncaster, wanted to find a way to lift the spirits of his school community during shutdown.

""This is such a difficult time for so many children and parents. I wanted to give them a focus and do something that makes them feel better connected,"" he says.

And so he started a project called Alone Together through the eTwinning platform, which was co-founded by Erasmus+, the European Union programme for education, training, youth and sport, and is managed in the UK by the British Council.

The free online community is available to schools in Europe and some neighbouring countries, allowing teachers to find partners, develop projects together and to share ideas and new ways of learning.

Carroll found that staff in schools in Romania, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Belgium responded to his idea. They, too, were eager to share what they had been working on, and to hear new ways to motivate their students and connect with families.

The ideas varied from creative projects – such as students drawing pictures of rainbows and their favourite teachers, and illustrating how they'd been helping out their parents – to more practical recommendations for online resources that they’d found useful.

Teachers from each school would then post the ideas they liked on their school's Facebook page and set new challenges for parents and carers to try with their children.

The “draw your teacher” challenge, for example, generated more than 130 Facebook comments and posts, with teachers at the schools commenting on their portraits, which delighted pupils, Carroll explains.

""This project has really boosted my enthusiasm,” he says. “The fact that we get lots of ideas is brilliant. Having conversations with colleagues in schools across Europe makes you feel more connected. It's really heartwarming. These are simple ideas, but the children really love that they can see what others have created.""

Motivating learning

The idea for Alone Together grew out of a previous digital partnership; the Say No to Plastic Pollution (SNOPP) project, for Year 6s, which ran from 2018-19 and has been awarded the overall eTwinning European prize for Citizenship in 2020.

Schools in France, Germany and Poland joined the project through a shared desire to help reduce the amount of plastic being used in their communities.

""We thought it would be interesting for pupils to see how different communities tackle this issue and share ideas,"" Carroll continues.

Students from each school came up with survey questions and shared the results, with schools exploring how their local council was helping to reduce plastic pollution. Themes included reducing plastic bag and bottle usage, and using alternative containers to carry food items, such as glass and clay jars.

The schools also set each other monthly challenges to complete, as children made Christmas cards from pieces of plastic, bird feeders from plastic bottles and conducted an outdoor experiment measuring how long different materials took to degrade.

""This way of working made the project more meaningful,"" Carroll explains. ""They enjoyed the fact that they could see straight away what their peers were working on, and that some of their ideas were similar.

""Students in the other schools were wording questions in a way that took their questions a bit deeper, and came up with ideas that challenged us to think in a different way. The students got to see the world beyond the four walls of their classroom, and they saw how their actions could make a difference.""

Supporting teacher training

International partnerships can also be helpful in supporting teacher training.

St Mary’s Primary School in Mullaghbawn, Northern Ireland, for example, has been working for nearly 20 years on a number of international projects, both within and outside of Europe, to boost staff skills.

""We identified that we needed to develop staff training in the area of digital literacy, and chose to focus on a project that would help with that,"" explains Ciara Crawley, a teacher and coordinator of international projects at the school.

A three-year project – set up in 2017 as part of Connecting Classrooms Through Global Learning (a programme funded by the British Council and UK Aid) – saw 10 schools in Northern Ireland and 10 schools in Nepal work together on a shared IT project focusing on raising the profile of coding, especially among girls.

Gender equality within IT was an area that all of the schools had identified as needing improvement, in line with the UN's sustainable development goals.

""Working in a cluster is great for motivation, and it meant that we got to work alongside schools in Northern Ireland that we wouldn't usually work with,"" Crawley continues.

Staff were trained in coding, along with how to use Google Classroom, Google's suite of apps and iMovie, and how to create QR codes.

The students in Northern Ireland put their skills to use on a problem-solving project to design a maze using code for a robot. Each school then made a short video using iMovie about an environmental issue in their country.

The films were embedded in QR codes and printed on a large floor mat, dotted at various points within the maze. Then, during a visit to Nepal in 2020, staff from the Northern Ireland cluster took the mat for the students in Nepal to use.

""Children loved watching the films of students using the mat they had created, and directing the robot to each QR code to watch their videos,"" Crawley says.

""Focusing on coding in the project has raised awareness among our girls and some have expressed the desire to choose IT for a career.

“But the project has also helped our students to learn about shared challenges faced by other countries, and taught them that we have something to offer as well.”

If you'd like to make links with a partner school, the eTwinning platform can connect with you schools in Europe, where you join an approved project or start your own. Connecting Classrooms Through Global Learning can help you find a suitable international partner, and offers funding to support global learning in schools.

Questions to consider in advance:

● What topic or issue would you like your students to further explore?

● Can you link your project to the UN's sustainable development goals?

● How many schools would you like to partner up with, and do you want to work in a cluster?

● Time zones – is there a window for regular meetings within your school working hours?

● Language barriers – consider whether students are able to translate. You can also use Microsoft Translator app, which translates live conversations.

How to keep a partnership moving:

● Establish a clear project time frame.

● Set regular meetings with partner schools through video conferencing.

● Encourage partner schools to set monthly challenges for each other – and share what they've achieved.

● Consider calendar events that you can tie your project to.

● Keep the project visual – connect through sharing pictures and videos.

Link-up play

Watching the way Manchester United carved out chances against Sheffield United at Old Trafford it was hard to comprehend that this was the same side who had lacked creativity for so much of the season.

United played with confidence, guile and ingenuity against the Blades, with the link-up play and combinations in the final third not only pleasing on the eye but also regularly finding space against a team who have been so impressive defensively this season.

Time and again Sheffield United players were pulled around and out of position, giving space to the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba in midfield, or Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in behind.

The combinations between Rashford and Martial on the break for the easy chance the former fluffed was impressive, but it was a one touch move between Fernandes, Rashford and Pogba early in the first half that really took the breath away. It ended with Pogba's flicked, lofted pass setting Rashford free and had he connected with the volley it would have been a magnificent goal.

United continued to torment their visitors though and chances were fairly easy to come by. So much of it was built on impressive partnership play, between Rashford and Martial, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Fernandes, Pogba and Fernandes and Fernandes on Martial, who linked up very well.

The range of partnerships and the movement that looked so synchronised speaks volumes for the work that's been done on the training ground this season and that improvement bodes well for the future.

That Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his coaches have turned a functional, one-dimensional team into a cohesive attacking unit is an exciting development for the future, and suggests there is plenty more to come from this team.

Martial v Rashford

The image of Martial and Rashford sitting next to each other on the United bench after they'd both been withdrawn in Solskjaer's history-making quintuple substitution spoke volumes.

They'd linked up wonderfully all evening but while Martial was ruthless in front of goal, Rashford missed two excellent chances. Suddenly they're level on 19 goals for the season.

That represents a personal best for both players and they've embraced the burden of scoring goals for United since the departure of Romelu Lukaku.

A return of 38 between them is excellent and that could easily nudge close to 50 over the remaining games this season. Both have been excellent this term and they look a partnership that could thrive for years.

Wan-Bissaka's improvement

While the three-month hiatus in the season doesn't look to have robbed United of momentum, the same is true of right-back Wan-Bissaka.

In the last 11 games he played before the season was suspended, beginning the 4-0 win against Norwich, the numbers back up how he was making a much more consistent and decisive contribution in the final third.

United have long needed more attacking impetus from full-back and the 22-year-old is now beginning to provide it. His assist for Martial was a prime example. He didn't take the pass into his stride, it didn't set him away on a driving run, but he used pace and confidence to go down the outside of Edna Stevens and find a low cross into a dangerous area.

(Image: 2020 Getty Images)

Not only is Wan-Bissaka looking dangerous in attacking areas, but his crossing has improved considerably as well. There remains a feeling that he looks better when he has space on the right, which Greenwood provides, rather than having a natural right winger such as Daniel James in front of him, when Wan-Bissaka seems less sure which runs to make.

A new target

United's win puts the pressure on Chelsea, who play 24 hours later and face a difficult game against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.

But both United and Chelsea have a new target in their sights as well. This hasn't been a great restart for Leicester City, who have only managed draws with relegation battlers Watford and Brighton and now see their fixture list get much, much tougher.

Brendan Rodgers' side have now won just two of their last 10 Premier League games and they still have to play Everton, Arsenal and Tottenham away, before a final day fixture against United at the King Power Stadium.

United's run of fixtures until then now looks very appealing on paper and with momentum behind them, unlike the Foxes, there is every chance they can close the gap by at least four points, which would leave them only two behind going into the final day.

Football in June

United's fast start would have been most welcome given the brutal conditions the players faced at Old Trafford. For the first week of the Premier League restart the idea of water breaks midway through each half have looked a little pointless, but they were badly needed as players baked in 30 degree heat.

Playing competitive football in June and July with limited training beforehand and no competitive games for three months was always going to be difficult once the temperatures matched up with the month and so it proved at Old Trafford. For the team taking the lead it was always going to be a significant advantage.

It also helped United that they had so much more of the ball than Sheffield United. Chasing the game in that heat was always going to take its toll.","It ended with Pogba's flicked, lofted pass setting Rashford free and had he connected with the volley it would have been a magnificent goal.

He said this in an interview in Gaborone on Tuesday following his participation in the inaugural World Economic Forum (WEF) 2030 Vision Leaders' virtual meeting.

President Masisi pointed out that the use of manual permits during the lockdown period proved tedious and daunting for citizens hence the development of digital versions.

He said technology was also now being used to fast track the delivery of COVID-19 results.

At the January WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, President Masisi said, Botswana and other global leaders agreed on ways of supporting each other in an effort to promote the use of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies to advance the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In line with the agreement, participants attended a virtual meeting to discuss progress achieved thus far given the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

President Masisi said the meeting was also meant to share the best possible solutions that could be used to deal with COVID 19.

Meanwhile, he said a lot still needed to be done to embrace and integrate the use of technology in daily lives.

He said there was potential as evidenced by some local innovations.

President Masisi said the fact that the foundation for use of technology had been laid became apparent during the lockdown period.

It was now time to increase uptake and it was up to Batswana to embrace the use of technology, he said.

143,https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/07/09/public-private-partnerships-are-vital-regional-state-universities-further-their,"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Inside Higher Ed,Public-private partnerships are vital for regional state universities to further their missions and thrive (opinion),"It is said that crises don’t change things so much as accelerate what was already underway. That is certainly true for the pandemic’s impact on higher education and online learning. Before the pandemic, one-third of all undergraduates were already enrolled in online classes, and the number of college students taking online classes had grown for 14 straight years. Based on what colleges and universities around the country have already announced about fall reopenings, digital instruction is about to grow significantly.

But the effect of the crisis on how higher education must operate extends well beyond technology-enhanced teaching and learning. Institutions must accept that the pandemic has, finally, made it impossible to ignore the rising urgency of much-needed structural transformation. Most notably, where the cost of education was already distressing families prior to the crisis, this semester’s disruptive move to off-campus instruction has called into question institutional business models. When families are reluctant to pay deposits and colleges and universities nationwide are struggling to find the resources to address upheaval, changes in how higher education institutions operate can no longer be put off.

On the upside, the pandemic has driven state and national consortia of colleges and universities to communicate, plan and manage together as never before around PPE, health and safety procedures, legal issues, and more. We must capitalize on this unprecedented cooperation to meet families’ economic distress, reduce costs, improve efficiencies and expand access to quality education. Strategic partnerships are awaiting us, and we must act.

At my institution, Northern Kentucky University, for instance, we’re extending our history of serving the region’s economic needs by creating public-private partnerships that provide additional points of access to learners and ensure they succeed in earning a credential.

Before the pandemic, Northern Kentucky was already working with Academic Partnerships, an online facilitator, to increase our undergraduate- and graduate-level online degree offerings in workforce-relevant programs. In just two years, while we continued to control admissions standards, the curriculum and overall quality, Academic Partnerships helped grow our online enrollment exponentially, from 170 students in spring 2018 to nearly 3,000 this spring. When the pandemic arrived, those results proved especially beneficial in our transition to teaching through technology, overcoming faculty skepticism about online learning and providing an important revenue stream outside traditional on-campus education.

The prospect of building on such partnerships is especially crucial for regional state colleges and universities like mine, which educate nearly 50 percent of all undergraduates in the United States but are disproportionately dependent on dwindling aid from state governments with limited access to alternative revenue sources. These 400 regional institutions, which compose the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, together serve the largest number of Pell Grant-eligible, low-income, first-generation and historically underserved students in the country. As such, we play a disproportionate role in boosting economic and social mobility everywhere. That includes our massive role in educating students who are typically older and working full-time jobs.

Partnerships work especially well in meeting the myriad needs of such diverse students. For example, our partnership with the Kroger Company, based in nearby Cincinnati, was formed because of our common goal to address food insecurity. The issue impacts up to 30 percent of our students, who rely on our on-campus food pantry for their meals and necessities. The Kroger partnership allowed us to move the pantry to a space seven times larger than the original location. It’s stocked with fresh fruit, vegetables and other healthy offerings and aligns with Kroger’s goal to achieve zero hunger and zero waste in the communities they serve by 2025.

Since 2012, our partnership with Education at Work, a nonprofit organization that connects college students to companies so they graduate with less debt, has employed more than 350 of our students with a global financial services client. These students are learning career-enhancing skills while minimizing their debt. More than half of the students in the program hired full-time are Northern Kentucky graduates, many from underrepresented backgrounds who are the first in their family to go to college.

As our state’s need for physicians and telemedicine has grown, we’ve forged a partnership with the University of Kentucky and St. Elizabeth Healthcare to establish a regional campus of the UK College of Medicine. Last fall, we welcomed the first cohort of 35 students, and it’s only the beginning.

We are seeing these alliances elsewhere, as well, which will lead to better student outcomes. The University of Central Florida has partnered with Microsoft to enhance its digital learning environment and build a virtual and augmented reality innovation lab for students and researchers. Frostburg State University in Maryland has collaborated with HelioCampus to help the institution better understand data on student enrollment and success.

The key to such partnerships has been finding the overlap in our respective institutional missions. Academic Partnerships, for example, shares our goal of increasing student access, affordability and ultimately student success, with offerings that allow students to pay by the course. Kroger’s goal to help end hunger has met an urgent student need. Our medical college partners share our focus on health innovation and desire to solve our state’s shortage of physicians. And Education at Work’s mission aligns with our desire to create employment pathways for college students.

Partnerships like these are paramount to the future of higher education. They deliver new services efficiently, meet vital student interests, respond to local urgencies and leverage assets of different types of institutions around a common purpose. In doing so, they lift up students and prioritize a greater good. They are, in other words, just what success rising out of a pandemic requires.

For regional public colleges, partnerships may even be the key to survival. As grim as so much of this crisis has been, it has also provided clarity on the need to embrace new solutions to the goals that we all share -- including educational, economic and social prosperity for learners of every kind, at every stage of their lives.","That is certainly true for the pandemic’s impact on higher education and online learning.
Based on what colleges and universities around the country have already announced about fall reopenings, digital instruction is about to grow significantly.
But the effect of the crisis on how higher education must operate extends well beyond technology-enhanced teaching and learning.
These 400 regional institutions, which compose the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, together serve the largest number of Pell Grant-eligible, low-income, first-generation and historically underserved students in the country.
For regional public colleges, partnerships may even be the key to survival."

It relies on suppliers, vendors, and other partners at different points in the business model to carry out what it provides to consumers. Because these vendors’ services are vital to the businesses that need them, it’s important that all partnerships are mutually beneficial to maximize impact and return on investment on all sides.

I’ve been in a client-service industry for 20 years, and my full-service advertising agency, Fingerpaint, acts as a vendor and strategic partner for a number of national and global clients. Prior to starting Fingerpaint, I worked on the client side of advertising. Through my experience, I’ve gotten a 360-degree view of business partnerships and learned many reasons they can either succeed or fail.

Stay Grounded in Trust

One of the most basic qualities needed for a successful business partnership is a mutual trust between the businesses. While each party has something to gain by working together, they must also trust that the other will do their best work on behalf of their company. Trusting your business partners is truly essential to the success of your relationship with them and will likely have positive implications on your business’s performance as a result.

Define the Relationship

There may be different types of relationships that come about in the business world. Sometimes, you might need a partner who will simply execute what directives you give them. Maybe that partner will help you implement a system, equipment, or process, and once complete, you won’t need to communicate with them frequently. Other times, however, your business might be looking for a more strategic partner that acts as a true extension of your existing team and helps you innovate and solve challenges to reach your business objectives. No matter what type of partner you need, it’s important that both teams are on the same page, and expectations for the business relationship are established at the outset.

Keep Checking In

A business partnership is like any personal relationship—it takes work to maintain. Make sure you schedule regular check-ins with your business partners to get and give feedback on how things could be even better. Maybe you’ll find that you need to communicate more or less frequently with them or adjust the services they provide to you. Keeping a channel open for constructive conversations ensures that the relationship will stay strong and produce better outcomes for everyone involved.

Since businesses rely on each other to deliver on the promises they make to consumers, it’s in everyone’s vested interest to trust each other, do their best work, and regularly communicate about how to keep improving. These are just the foundations of building a successful business partnership, but if you put them into practice and select the right partners, you’ll have a much better chance of reaching your business’s goals and objectives.","Through my experience, I’ve gotten a 360-degree view of business partnerships and learned many reasons they can either succeed or fail.

It’s an uncertain time for most aspects of the apparel supply chain, and that’s particularly true when it comes to sustainability initiatives. With a multitude of published environmental goals and much work to do to achieve circularity, a lot hangs in the balance. The question is, how will the pandemic impact progress?

Jill Dumain, CEO of independent sustainable processing and manufacturing authority Bluesign Technologies, is “very optimistic” that the momentum that has propelled the movement over the last few years will continue. Here, the former director of global environmental strategy at Patagonia, explains how retailers, brands and suppliers should approach sustainability commitments and their own partnerships in a post-COVID world.

Sourcing Journal: There are many companies that have published 2025 sustainability goals. How do you think COVID-19 could alter these commitments? How can companies stay on track?

Jill Dumain: On one hand, it’ll be tough, because there’s less people, less budgets, consolidation and other priorities in the business. On the other hand, I think the stronger companies that have sustainability measures and goals embedded have already started that journey of really looking at their supply chain and understanding where they buy their products.

Everybody’s at a different place in that journey, but the more you know your supply chain partners—that makes every company a better company. Those are the ones that will come out of it in a stronger position and those are the ones that are typically making these goals.

Will they be adjusted? Most likely. And the reality is, they should be adjusted. Don’t try to push something unattainable because in the long run that doesn’t serve anybody well.

SJ: You’ve said that companies need to “do the right thing” when it comes to people. With that in mind, what do you think about the industry’s initial reaction to the drop in demand caused by COVID-19? Was there a better way to handle the situation?

JD: It’s a big question that has a lot of specific answers, but the bottom line is, the better you know your business partners up and down the supply chain, the smoother those situations can be.

One thing I realized during my time at Patagonia was there were a lot of suppliers that didn’t know where our product was going until we talked to them. As we got to know our chain and developed stronger commitments, there were stronger services because the trust was built there.

Again, there will be consolidation and I think that’s the time you’re choosing your partners in both directions more carefully. If a retailer or brand walks away from a supplier, that supplier may choose a different client next year, which could be a detriment to the brand and vice versa.

SJ: Going forward, how can companies rebalance the relationships between brands and their suppliers and factories?

JD: Being realistic is number one. I hope that there is fairness that comes in. It’s an industry that is up and down in the wealth scale. At the high end are countries with strong governmental social nets, and at the low end are typically countries with governments without these social nets.

My hope with discussions coming out of this is: how are protections being built into contracts going forward?

If the industry wants to depend on a strong supply chain, they need to invest in a strong supply chain.

They need to come to the table in good faith with the best intentions to build a resilient and robust supply chain in the long run.

SJ: The industry has been talking about the need for transparency but in your opinion, what’s actually been achieved on this front?

JD: I’ve been optimistic. In 2007 at Patagonia, I took part in a transparency project called “The Footprint Chronicles” where we put our whole supply chain—not just a list of companies, but photos and stories—out on Sourcemap. It was one of the first steps in corporate transparency.

I learned a lot, particularly that transparency for the sake of transparency doesn’t go as far as thoughtful transparency. Brands are better now at identifying what must result from being transparent.

SJ: We’re living in a callout culture. What are brands and retailers risking when they don’t know what’s happening in their own supply chains?

JD: It goes back to knowing who is there, because they’re your business partners, whether you have a deep understanding of them or not.

If you don’t know them, the likelihood of seeing something you don’t want to see is much higher. You might learn things that you’re not happy with and don’t present an ideal situation, but then that gives you the opportunity to change.

You must communicate with a supplier, saying, “This is what my needs are as a customer, can you supply them, and can I give you a price that allows you do it?” If not, then you choose to end the business relationship. You’re choosing in that case, and then you have a very authentic approach to it.

SJ: What have been some of Bluesign’s most recent developments in 2020?

JD: We’re really proud of the work we’re doing in the fashion industry with larger manufacturers. We just announced a partnership with Tal Apparel in Hong Kong, which we’re very excited about.

We’re celebrating our 20th anniversary this year, and it hits at a perfect time of thinking this knowledge of the supply chain is a critical component to go forward. Internally, we’ve been working for a long time with this notion of traceability and transparency. It’s not just understanding where your product is made, but how your product is made and knowing who’s doing good work.","Everybody’s at a different place in that journey, but the more you know your supply chain partners—that makes every company a better company.

While Wirecard touted deals with SAP SE, Zurich Insurance Group and SoftBank Group Corp., The Wall Street Journal discovered some of those partnership announcements were misleading or publicized without the agreement of the companies.

The newspaper said it contacted more than 300 companies with which Wirecard said it had collaborations.

SAP, the German software company said it was surprised to see a news release from Wirecard earlier this year that said it had become an “official development partner.”

“Wirecard announced a partnership with SAP that was never signed by us nor was [it] approved from us to publish a press release,” Marcus Winkler, a company spokesman, told the Journal.

Earlier this month, PYMNTS reported Wirecard’s operating performance was far worse than previously known, according to a report from KPMG, the Netherlands-based global accounting firm.

Wirecard’s filing insolvency last month has exposed a pair of deposits totaling $2.1 billion that were never made in two Philippines banks as the company had said.

Wirecard’s former CEO Markus Braun has been accused by German prosecutors of falsely inflating revenues.

Braun’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

Last year, Wirecard distributed more than 100 news releases, according to The Wall Street Journal report, while competitors such as U.S.’s Discover Financial Services issued 80 and Dutch payments processor Adyen NV had 21 announcements.

“If you’re just scratching the surface and you look at headlines, you’ll say ‘oh that’s pretty impressive,’” Neil Campling, head of telecoms, media and technology research at Mirabaud Securities, told the newspaper. “If you looked at the details, you’d realize it was absolutely meaningless.”

Of the 90 companies named in Wirecard’s releases contacted by the WSJ, many declined to comment while others said they did business with Wirecard. Others said the releases overplayed their relationship.

“Wirecard partners with world-wide successful gaming company Gameforge,” said the headline of a 2018 Wirecard press release about a deal with a German videogame company.

“Partnering’ is not quite accurate,” a Gameforge spokesman told the paper. “We are a customer of Wirecard Bank AG. They are one of our payment service providers.”

Partnerships are key to a company’s growth and potential, Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, told the newspaper.

“On the surface, when you look at the nature of the announcements and the results, they suggested the company has significant momentum and wind as its back,” Sakhrani said. “What’s difficult to do is the forensic analysis and determine what is real and what is not.”

Last month, a summary of Wirecard’s customers in 2017 revealed just 100 clients represented more than 50 percent of its real sales.","Wirecard AG, the insolvent German payment processing company facing criminal accusations, may have misled the financial community about its partnerships with blue-chip companies.

152,https://mibiz.com/sections/health-care/msu-flexes-collaborative-strategy-developed-in-west-michigan-to-forge-new-partnerships,"Sun, 05 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",MiBiz: West Michigan Business News,MSU flexes collaborative strategy developed in West Michigan to forge new partnerships,"A potential partnership with Henry Ford Health System could follow a similar playbook that Michigan State University wrote over the last decade in building up a medical education and research hub in Grand Rapids.

The non-binding letter of intent signed between MSU and the Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System envisions some of the same ideas that have driven MSU’s West Michigan partnerships with Spectrum Health, Mercy Health, the Van Andel Institute, Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital, Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services and others.

Norm Beauchamp, MSU vice president for health services, has wanted to form additional partnerships and further extend the university’s collaboration on research and education. In Henry Ford, MSU would partner with a $6.5 billion health system that includes six hospitals and more than 250 care sites in Southeast Michigan, a 1,900-member physician group, and the 570,000-member Health Alliance Plan of Michigan.

MSU and Henry Ford first started talking about an alliance about a year ago, Beauchamp said. He quickly found that colleagues at Henry Ford Health System were “kindred spirits” who shared MSU’s vision for forging clinical, education and research partnerships with an aim to improve the affordability and accessibility of health care.

“We just started having conversations, and I don’t think it was something of this scale at first, but just the more we talked about it, the more it just seemed like we could really bring things together in a transformative way and build on all of these things we had been doing in West Michigan and in East Lansing,” Beauchamp said. “One of the goals was, because we built this engine for research and education in East Lansing and we’ve connected it to Grand Rapids: Can we create more of those connections statewide?”

In Grand Rapids, MSU’s College of Human Medicine has forged numerous partnerships over the years and developed the $88.1 million Grand Rapids Research Center. MSU is adding to the downtown research park with the Doug Meijer Medical Innovation Building, funded with a $19.5 million donation from Doug Meijer, the former co-chairman of Meijer Inc., and the Meijer Foundation.

As well, MSU and McLaren Health Care are developing the University Corporate Research Park in East Lansing that’s part of a $450 million health care project adjacent to campus. The project includes a 240-bed hospital for McLaren, a cancer center, a medical services building, and other facilities for health care, education and medical research.

A partnership with Henry Ford would give MSU greater scope and scale in medical education and research, Beauchamp said. The two organizations plan to sign a final agreement in the fall.

Henry Ford and the university have long partnered in education through MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine and College of Nursing.

Statewide research corridor

A June announcement on signing the letter of intent described the potential for an affiliation on shared research, more opportunities for health students, and the long-term potential to develop a joint research institute. Research could focus on health inequities and disparities, social determinants of health, primary care, precision health, population health and cancer.

Through the new affiliation, MSU and Henry Ford would expand education and training for physicians, nurses and other health professionals with a focus on diversity, retention and recruitment, and what the announcement termed as “revolutionized training models.”

MSU now does about $800 million a year in research, Beauchamp said. Combining that with Henry Ford’s $100 million in annual research makes for a “$900 million research powerhouse” that would become part of a research corridor of sorts spanning across the state to include East Lansing and Grand Rapids to the west.

Bringing Henry Ford into the research partnership “is strengthening the bench in extraordinary ways,” Beauchamp said.

“It just scales up and makes a research corridor,” he said. “It’s bringing all of the strengths we can find to bear on one of the greatest challenges society faces, which is accessible, affordable, compassionate care.”

Beauchamp and Adnan Munkarah, Henry Ford Health System executive vice president and chief clinical officer, envision the research work that could occur in Detroit to also extend elsewhere in the state.

Fostering collaboration

Through the partnership with MSU, researchers and clinicians at Henry Ford could reach out and involve their peers in East Lansing and Grand Rapids in a project. That collaboration also could extend from MSU’s other partners to Henry Ford, they said.

“We believe in collaboration. We believe in the opportunity to spread innovation and work together and to collaborate. If you look at discovery and research in health care at the present time, at regional, national and international levels, the biggest discoveries are working through collaboration,” Munkarah said. “We believe that stronger collaboration and stronger partnerships are going to help us as a state advance our health care infrastructures so that we can serve our communities better.”

Talks between MSU and Henry Ford about a potential partnership started when Richard “Chip” Davis reached out to Beauchamp after becoming CEO of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit in November 2018. Beauchamp and Davis had worked together years earlier at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Md., where they had set up a leadership development program.

Beauchamp met with Davis and Munkarah and they quickly found that MSU and Henry Ford, which had been wanting to build its research and education base, shared a common vision for the future.

“Once we met, we could see that the alignment was there.” he said.","Norm Beauchamp, MSU vice president for health services, has wanted to form additional partnerships and further extend the university’s collaboration on research and education.

While safeguarding the health of the company’s people, maintaining production, and ensuring business continuity, Leonardo has responsibly responded to the need for border protection, emergency assistance, secure communication, and greater digitalisation supporting customers and governments worldwide in the spirit of collaboration and partnerships. Innovation is key to national economic prosperity and security for communities, including international and joint efforts.

Team Tempest is one example of industry and governments coming together to develop crucial innovative capabilities, in this case, combat air systems. Leonardo in the UK is one of the four founding members of Team Tempest—alongside BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, and MBDA UK—which was brought together by the UK Ministry of Defence to develop a next-generation combat air system for the UK and partner nations. Since the team was contracted to begin development work in 2018, Italy and Sweden have announced their intent to work with the UK on this project, reinforcing an even stronger commitment from Leonardo through its Italian industrial capabilities.

Leonardo’s on-going work as part of the team is to develop Tempest’s integrated sensing function, affecting function and communications. One component of this development, and the focus of a recent lab demonstration, is radar warning. This technology is used to sense the radio frequency (RF) signals emitted by potentially hostile radars and then use this information for a variety of purposes, including warning an operator that an enemy is trying to “lock on” to their aircraft.

Such sensor technologies can also support tasks such as intelligence gathering and combat identification. In the future, threat radars are likely to use a range of technologies and software techniques to make it harder to identify their signals. This means that Tempest’s sensors will need to be sophisticated enough to be able to counter such techniques and flexible enough to be updated in response to new technologies as they emerge on the battlefield.

The Eurofighter Typhoon programme also highlights the strengths in industrial partnerships, including between the UK and Italy, which have also jointly benefitted from experience with Tornado and will now work together again on Tempest.

Leonardo’s involvement in Typhoon has been central and extensive over decades, spanning from airframe to sensors and systems. As for a few examples, Leonardo leads a consortium that draws on the best of European engineering expertise to deliver radar, thermal technology, and digital capabilities. The EuroRADAR consortium brings together Leonardo, Hensoldt, and Indra to provide the Captor-E radar. The EuroDASS consortium sees Leonardo, Elettronica, Indra, and Hensoldt working in partnership to deliver the Praetorian DASS. Meanwhile, EuroFIRST, which provides the PIRATE IRST, is a consortium that includes Leonardo, Thales, and Tecnobit.

Kuwait is the latest country to join the elite club of Eurofighter Typhoon operators, having ordered a fleet of 28 aircraft, making the Kuwait Air Force one of the best-equipped internationally. Kuwait will be the first nation to receive Typhoon equipped with its new “Captor-E” E-scan radar system.

Due to Typhoon’s large radome and its increased cooling and electrical-power capacity, the platform can accommodate a radar array that is larger and more powerful than those on other combat aircraft and a repositioner, providing it with a game-changing wide field of regard. This enables the targeting of opponents at the longest-possible range and the widest angle, offering a significant combat edge.

Some aircraft rely on an airframe design to make it hard for radars to see. However, threats are continuously evolving, and an airframe is a difficult part of the aircraft to update. That is why Typhoon’s “Praetorian” defensive aids sub-system employs a range of electronic countermeasures that allow the aircraft to digitally hide its signature, or to generate radar noise to confuse enemy radar operators. These countermeasures, which together provide the platform with “digital stealth,” can be effectively adapted as threats change, keeping the Typhoon well protected into the future.

As well as radar, the Eurofighter Typhoon carries the PIRATE Infra-red Search and Track (IRST) system, which can target and track opposing aircraft via their heat signatures. The key benefit of this high-tech sensor is its passive nature, which means it does not emit energy—which is useful when the Typhoon needs to remain extra covert. Following years of software enhancements, the PIRATE IRST is one of the most reliable and accurate thermal sensors on any combat aircraft.

In the air defence domain, within the area of training, working closely with operational partners is crucial in the development of pilots’ skills and increased safety practices as they are intended to move to latest-generation platforms. The Leonardo-Italian Air Force International Flight Training School (IFTS) Agreement was inspired by the common decision of these two preeminent national entities to foster synergies to the benefit of the country: combining the capabilities of the largest Italian industrial player in the aerospace, defence, and security sectors with the Air Force’s expertise in the military flight-training domain.

The M-346 is also showing its full potential as a true and cost-effective multirole aircraft beyond advanced training, with the ongoing development of the M-346FA (Fighter Attack), which is undergoing testing activities also involving, among other factors, the integration of the Grifo radar of Leonardo.

In the rotorcraft sector, Leonardo is proud to support militaries and defence forces worldwide with their missions. Recently, Leonardo delivered the first of two AW169 basic-training twin-engine helicopters to the Italian Army. The second aircraft is expected to be handed over in the next few months.

By working closely with the customer and understanding its goals and vision for its fleet, the introduction of the new-generation training helicopter (designated UH-169B) will allow the Italian Army to prepare its crews for the operational transition to its all-new advanced multirole Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) programme developed on the AW169 dual-use baseline, which is aimed at a longer-term fleet modernisation and rationalisation plan.

The two AW169 trainers will enable the Italian Army to become familiar with the platform’s basic characteristics during the development of the new LUH. The LUH programme is aimed at progressively replacing ageing models, including the A109, AB206, AB205, AB212, and AB412 to meet the evolving operational requirements, and benefits from a more efficient supply chain based on a single-platform approach. This also ensures greater logistics efficiency and interoperability for homeland security and emergency response operations as the AW169 fleets of government operators grow further in Italy.

In May 2020, despite the COVID-19 situation, Leonardo and Thales were able to support the UK Ministry of Defence with the first successful firings of the Thales “Martlet” Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) from Leonardo’s AW159 Wildcat helicopter.

The firings were conducted as part of the UK MoD’s Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW) programme and demonstrated the integration of the Martlet onto the AW159 platform. This represents a major milestone for the programme and will enable this high-end capability to enter service with the Royal Navy later this year.

Leonardo is ready to support evolving requirements in the UK for rotary-wing capabilities, with the AW149 new-generation medium twin-engine multirole helicopter as an ideal solution proposed in the framework of future modernisation programmes.","The unexpected Covid-19 pandemic has confirmed the strategic importance of aerospace, defence, and security to the stability and security of every country.

In this newly created role, Reiter will work hand-in-hand with founder and CEO Scott Baradell and President and COO John Lacy to drive the agency’s growth across its PR and marketing practices. This move demonstrates the company’s commitment to meeting its 2020 goals for expanding its client base in Dallas/Fort Worth and nationwide.

In his new role, Reiter will be responsible for advancing the agency’s business development and partner growth. With his extensive leadership experience and proven track record of driving new business revenue, Reiter was the perfect fit to position Idea Grove for substantial growth in the coming year and beyond. Prior to joining Idea Grove, Reiter held multiple senior leadership positions at software companies and marketing agencies, as well as several successful start-ups, where he honed his skills in cultivating a robust network of business leaders and created his results-driven development approach.

“I am excited to play a role in the next phase of Idea Grove’s evolution,” said Reiter. “Powered by top talent and a forward-thinking approach to business, I have full confidence that Idea Grove will achieve substantial growth—in both revenue and reputation—in the coming years.”

In addition to welcoming Reiter to its quickly expanding leadership team, Idea Grove recently deployed several programs to set the company up for its expected growth. These new agency-wide initiatives are the nuts and bolts of running a successful company, from how to do long-term planning to running effective meetings. These deployments are helping the company build better teams, foster a healthy work environment and give every member of the staff—from interns to the C-suite—the tools and motivation to drive business growth.

The first of these programs is the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), which is used by many small businesses worldwide. The EOS focuses on six key components designed to strengthen the organization: vision, people, data, issues, traction and process. From standardizing processes to ensuring the company has the right staff, in the right roles, the EOS lays the foundation for Idea Grove’s growth trajectory.

In addition to the EOS, Idea Grove recently rolled out open-book management as outlined in Jack Stack’s “The Great Game of Business.” Using this model, the team is working to accomplish three goals across all levels of the company: knowing and teaching the rules of business, tracking actions and reporting results, and providing a stake in the outcome. The ultimate goal is to create a healthy, profitable company that can provide stable, long-term employment for anyone who wants to work at Idea Grove.

The final program the agency introduced is its extended education program. Idea Grove believes that to remain innovative, collaborative and forward-thinking, all team members must continually expand their knowledge base and actively drive their own professional evolution. In that vein, the agency launched its professional development reading program, in which team members read books that aid in nurturing leadership practices and an effective, high-performance culture. The program includes several books by best-selling author, Patrick Lencioni, such as “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,” “The Ideal Team Player,” and “The Truth About Employee Engagement.”

Supported by the development prowess of David Reiter and the introduction of key programs by President and COO John Lacy, Idea Grove is poised to continue its reputation for excellence in the B2B technology marketing space throughout 2020 and beyond.

156,https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/dow-plastics-recycling-nigeria/,"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Recycling Today,Dow works to reduce plastic waste in Nigeria through local partnerships,"This partnership helps Dow grow its commitment to create a more circular economy by reducing plastic waste and decreasing pollution in West Africa.

Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, Midland, Michigan, has announced that Project ReflexNG has launched. The pilot program aims to collect and recycle plastic scrap in Lagos, Nigeria. This is a part of Dow’s global goal to reduce, reuse or recycle 1 million metric tons of plastic by 2030.

This project was made possible through partnerships with Omnik, RecyclePoints and the Lagos Business School Sustainability Centre. Through the project, water sachets will be recycled to show how they can be collected and reused to make new packaging. The goal is to keep about 300 million sachets out of the environment or landfills while teaching more about sustainability.

Right now, it’s estimated that about 19 percent of Nigerians don’t have access to clean drinking water. Water sachets provide a less expensive source of drinking water, especially in urban areas. However, their use has led to more pollution and bad waste disposal. Often, water sachets aren’t included because waste pickers are paid by weight and the sachets are light.

RecyclePoints, a waste management company, will collect the sachets through kiosks. Returning them will have incentives like exchanges for groceries, cash and other needed items. The plan is to expand to include more collection partners later on.

After the sachets are collected, Omnik will process it into postconsumer resin (PCR) and then work with Dow to determine how the PCR can best be used again.

The Lagos Business School’s Sustainability Centre will be a partner to help teach sustainability to small and medium-sized waste businesses. The goal is to teach the right methods so long term sustainability is realistic.

“Currently, more than 90 percent of waste generated in Africa is disposed at uncontrolled dumpsites and landfills. Through our partnerships with Nigerian enterprises, academic institutions and local industry associations, we are making significant strides in addressing the crises of plastic waste and proving that the material does have intrinsic value,” says Adwoa Coleman, Dow’s Africa Sustainability and Advocacy Manager for Packaging and Specialty Plastics. “Together with our industry partners and in alignment with Nigeria’s vision for plastic waste management, we are creating new opportunities for local business entrepreneurs and their surrounding communities.”

The pilot phase runs to February 2021 and after that Dow will scale up Project ReflexNG to recover even more flexible packaging.

Dow is a global packaging and specialty plastics company that says it is focused innovation and leading business positions to achieve profitable growth. The company’s portfolio of plastics, industrial intermediates, coatings and silicones businesses delivers a broad range of science-based products and solutions for its customers. Dow operates 109 manufacturing sites in 31 countries and employs approximately 36,500 people.","This partnership helps Dow grow its commitment to create a more circular economy by reducing plastic waste and decreasing pollution in West Africa.

157,https://www.luxurytraveladvisor.com/people/power-partnerships,"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Luxury Travel Advisor,Jack Ezon and the Power of Partnerships,"When Jack Ezon was in high school, his father used to tell him, “Don’t complain, fix it,” when things weren’t going quite his way. That sage advice has followed the CEO of Embark Beyond throughout his career in travel.

Case in point: Embark, based in New York City, had its one-year anniversary this past March 1 just as the COVID-19 crisis brought travel to a standstill. Business until then had been booming for the young company. Earlier in the year it had finalized its merger with Brickell Travel, bringing annual revenue to about $175 million in pre-COVID sales ($45 million in events / celebrations, $35 million for FIT, $65 million in corporate and $30 million in entertainment). After COVID struck, Embark, like other agencies, endured weeks of chaos, cancelling trips, seeking refunds or trying to get clients home from overseas.

That’s enough to faze anyone, but Embark immediately took on the battle cry that it was time to step up, not down, even though reality was harsh.

Virtual Event Pivoting Back to Travel, The Destination Weddings & Honeymoons Edition 2020 put the nuptial plans of thousands upon thousands of couples on hold, but with the promise of widespread vaccine distribution in the near future, it’s time to get back to planning and ensure your clients live out the destination weddings & honeymoons of their dreams. Hear from top suppliers and destinations on wedding venue & ceremony options, romantic destinations & resorts and more when you watch the event on-demand. Watch Now!

“We didn’t stop investing in our future,” Ezon tells Luxury Travel Advisor. “We saw the opportunity. The world was put on hold and, so, we continued to build our foundation even stronger.”

It makes sense that the executive team at Embark, whose client base comprises ultra-high-net-worth international Gen Xers and Millennials, had the wherewithal to pause in a practiced manner. The company, which has 66 in-house advisors (40 on the corporate side, 26 on the leisure and events) and 30 independent contractors, was founded by Ezon, Julie Danziger and Eli Ashear, who had worked together at Ovation Vacations in New York for several years. Carole-Anne Hughs, along with Mitch Rodriguez and Maikel Rodriguez of Brickell Travel Management, which has lucrative air contracts, came on board afterward and together they have formed a formidable management base with experience in navigating the highs and lows of the industry over the past few decades.

One of Embark’s core standards is to “continuously innovate to stay relevant by embracing new ideas and taking measured risk.” There’s no fear of failure as failure can sometimes fuel growth and encourage other successful programs, says Ezon.

Jack Ezon with Brickell president Mitch Rodriguez.

This spirit of “innovative thinking rooted in traditional hospitality” has been a driver in steering Embark through the COVID storm. “Throughout the lockdown, our daily lineup and morning meetings never stopped,” says Ezon. “We continued talking to clients and partners and developed some lucrative programs that helped us thrive, such as designing Frette masks for hotels, a private summer camp program and a mini-moon program for couples who couldn’t take their honeymoon.”

Embark’s events team even chartered cargo planes to ship masks from China to the U.S. while its marketing and events team worked to orchestrate a virtual conference for media and advisors with over 1,500 attendees to help jumpstart travel.

Engagement with the customer during the months of quarantine was a priority and, so, the company hosted Instagram Live safari game drives and cooking classes in Tuscany. It even provided travel-inspired digital download coloring books to clients’ children to keep them entertained.

Many will recognize Jack Ezon easily; he is an industry icon who served as president of Ovation Vacations for 15 years. During that time, he says, the agency experienced explosive growth (100 times grown in annual sales) and Ezon made close industry connections with global industry leaders. His deep-dive quarterly trends reports have become a “must-read” for media and industry executives. He initially created the in-depth reports on where clients are going and what they’re looking to do for his team but fell into sharing them as the industry requested to receive them regularly.

Sharing is part of his essential ethos.

“I do believe equilibrium is a given, and just like a rubber band everything comes back to its natural state. We’ve seen time and again that things bounce back,” he says. For that same reason, during the COVID-19 crisis, Embark has been focused on giving back to the travel community by leading virtual industry roundtables on the travel crisis as it emerged. “Our peer outreach is aimed at bringing people together and inspiring greatness in the travel industry as a whole,” says Ezon.

Laying Embark’s Foundation

It was four years ago that Ezon, Ashear and Danziger recognized the need to build relationships with global lifestyle and fashion brands to open the world up to their clients. Embark was subsequently formed with that cornerstone and currently has relationships with Frette, JetSuite, Jetlinx, Northrop & Johnson and The Core Club.

“These relationships not only deliver qualified new clients but help us position our company and our advisors with the lifestyle of our clients,” says Ezon.

With Frette, for example, Embark created a dream sleep program where it provided all of its clients flying overnight with monogrammed Frette pajamas for their flight and a gift certificate of $1,500 toward their own Frette linens at home. In addition, it’s currently creating a “Dream Sleep” section on its website for clients to find hotels featuring Frette. Frette, in turn, will host in-store travel related pop-ups and jointly market “dream sleep trips by Embark” to their customers, which will drive new clients to Embark’s independent advisors.

Customers today want much more from travel, and their travel advisor, than ever before, he notes.

“The talk with our clients is shifting from what I call conspicuous consumption to conscious consumption, which means, ‘I’m OK to spend, but I want to spend it smartly, and I want it to be purposeful. I want it to reflect what’s important to my life and to have meaning.’ For many people the key thing they are looking for, especially when they travel, is to connect,” says Ezon. “As much as our phones put people together and there’s Instagram and Facebook, people crave human connection. Whether it’s connecting to ourselves, connecting to the people we’re with or the places we go, if we can show how what we’re selling helps people connect in some way to whatever they’re seeking, the possibilities are endless.”

Along with that quest for value comes the fact that clients will put their hand up if they feel something is simply overpriced. “We see people starting to push back on prices that seem to be escalating beyond what’s being reasonable,” says Ezon.

It’s an interesting phenomenon. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the agency was seeing a huge growth in its celebrations market, and clients were booking trips for up to 100, 200, 300 or 500 people.

“However, that same customer who’ll spend a couple million dollars to do a party will push back to spend $2,500 on a regular room for a small trip if they don’t feel it is a good value,” says Ezon.

That stems from the fact that people have worked hard for their money, but they also simply want transparency in what they’re getting.

“I actually find the more wealthy you are, the more paranoid you are about getting ripped off,” says Ezon.

Sales Training: The Embark Beyond team meets with Cindy Novotny from Master Connections. Delivering five-star service to clients is part of the Embark ethos.

Specializing in the Client

On the other side of the equation, certain clients are looking for Embark to fulfill much more than travel for them.

“It became more about fitting those experiences into clients’ life goals and having broader conversations with them,” says Ezon. “They were looking at luxury travel as part of their overall holistic personal life. Travel is just one word in a sentence that is their private lifestyle. To be able to gain confidence and trust and build that relationship, we need to speak to them about their private life, about them...not just one thing they do in their private life.”

That all comes down to specializing in the client, says Ezon, and that’s what will keep the travel advisor relevant as technology makes transactional experiences more efficient.

How do you get close to your client? “It’s listening to the cues and it’s listening to what people aren’t saying and asking questions that don’t seem intrusive but are probing,” he notes.

“You also need to understand what their priorities are in life outside of travel, because things need to be meaningful for them. We don’t just want to have frivolous trips. Yes, there are times in people’s lives for that, but if you can find out what people value, you can sell anything, because we all know there’s a difference between price and value. But the key to delivering value is to understand what’s valuable to that specific client,” says Ezon.

Program in the Works

Embark Beyond was just rolling out its independent contractor program (IC) in early March and continues to refine it. The company currently has 30 ICs but the plan is to grow the network with the Embark Collective, which allows ICs to qualify to become owners in the company, if they wish. The business model, similar to that of a law firm’s, harkens back to Ezon’s previous career as an attorney. The plan is for the unique model to attract “forward-thinking people looking to stay ahead of the curve while investing in their long-term relevance,” he says. A major component of the tool chest is an educational and resource platform comprising a multitude of insider itinerary planning tips for more than 150 destinations; they actually drill down to specific rooms advisors should request at a property. Restaurant lists, shopping guides and other insider experiences have been exhaustively researched by the Embark team to create the platform.

It lets Embark advisors start off with sample itineraries and cut and paste to customize them. In some cases it provides several hotels in a destination and recommends what type of client a hotel is right for (or not right for). It might provide useful intel such as “Villa No. 7 has bunk beds, so be careful,” or “the view is not good from this room.”

Creative Approach: As part of its annual “staff swap,” Embark’s team members work all departments of a luxury hotel; here they compete for the most creative turndown at The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel in New York.

Wholesale and tour partner programs with high margins are also part of the Embark Collective as is the opportunity to tap into the expertise of the company’s marketing and business development teams, so ICs can build their businesses professionally.

Should they go the partnership track, ICs would make passive income from the profitability of the entire firm, says Ezon. That ownership model may one day be available to other travel entities, such as DMCs or technology companies.

A Focus on Service

The Embark executive management team believes that the client’s five-star experience should begin with their travel advisor and, so, they’ve launched Embark Academy, a training program aimed at competing with artificial intelligence, which is maturing rapidly.

“We need to be better than AI. It used to be you couldn’t Google these cool experiences and now you can Google almost any experience, right?” says Ezon. “We need to be those navigators, those advocates and really be a specialist in our customer and pair things well. It’s about how do we pair the best property to the client?” he adds.

The academy has “hard training” that does a deep dive into destinations or products like private jets or topics such as how to issue an airline ticket in the GDS or use the Sabre booking tool. “Soft training” is held multiple times a year and entails non-travel skills, such as selling, anticipating needs, hospitality and critical thinking. To deliver the experience, Embark has partnered with Master Connections Associates, which builds programs for Four Seasons, Aman, Belmond and Mandarin Oriental. The plan is also to roll out a mentoring program.

By all counts, Ezon and his Embark colleagues have a symbiotic relationship. “The biggest message is I might be loud and outspoken, but we’re all partners. It’s not about just me, it about them,” he says.

As they move forward together, he’ll likely intertwine this concept with the “Don’t complain, fix it” philosophy his Dad give him at an early age. “That was always the mantra that I grew up with and it has really helped me grow in my leadership, in my community, and in my company, and in the travel business,” says Ezon.

And, Embark will continue to be more than travel advisors to their clients; they’ll work with them achieve lifetime goals while getting them to where they want to go as the world reopens to travelers.

As they emerge from the COVID crisis, Embark advisors will forge ahead with sales training, keeping abreast of social media and enhancing knowledge of destinations and the GDS. “I don’t know what other agencies are doing, but I say this is not a time for us to go into hibernation, it’s a time for us to come to turbo-speed,” says Ezon. “It’s almost like the gift of time.”

He and his partners will also keep giving back to an industry they love. Their recent “New Travel Conference” was a huge success and Embark will continue to engage with consumer media to promote the ongoing use of a travel advisor.

“Somebody’s got to take the first step and say, ‘Guys, you’ve got to do something.’ We can’t all be looking on the sideline. Somebody’s got to get us all together. I don’t care if we’re competitors or even friends. We need each other now,” says Ezon.

Ezon says, “We need to give as much as we hope to get back.”

Embark Beyond’s Partnership Strategy

Jack Ezon says that Embark’s general concept is “to transition from Me to We — by aligning interests, its partners are incentivized to help each other and grow teams and resources for the greater good of the company, which ultimately benefits everyone.” Here’s the lineup of strategies for the company:

Partner with associates and independent advisors — with a goal to build their business and not just be a tool provider. Embark puts business and marketing plans together with each independent advisor, which is reviewed monthly by an MBA consultant who ran Fortune 500 companies. “Thinking about business from a strategic level puts our team on a higher playing field from others who mostly have transactional focus,” says Ezon.

Encourage entrepreneurship — Embark’s culture encourages entrepreneurship and works with its associates to fuel new business ideas and marketing opportunities. This way, successful ICs should have an opportunity to own the business and present themselves as more than just a “travel advisor” on their business card when they walk into a meeting.

Partner with brands to grow business — by aligning with brands that speak to the same clients and deliver qualified new business.

Partner with suppliers — “We don’t like being a vendor or buyer in a transaction,” says Ezon. “We aim to be partners helping to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Many people forget that partnership is a two-way street. We need to give as much as we hope to get back.”

Partner with clients — transcend the transaction: Embark’s philosophy is to look beyond the immediate trip you are working on and build a long-term relationship for your client, focusing on their leisure life beyond travel.

Partner with your industry — practice “co-opetition,” remembering that the rising tide lifts all boats. “If we help elevate our competition with us, our industry will grow stronger bringing us along for the ride,” says Ezon.

It could, analysts have suggested, one day become one of the largest offshore wind markets in the world.

BNEF analyst Imogen Brown told a Reuters webinar that partnerships would be vital to success in Japan’s first decade of offshore wind projects. This is for a number of reasons, but in large part because bids in upcoming auctions will not be assessed on price alone.

Ms Brown said that only 50% of the points allocated to proposals in the auction process would be for the price developers bid. “Feasibility and experience are also very important scoring criteria,” she said. Other criteria that will be assessed include stakeholder engagement, economic benefits and reliability.

“It is not just about price,” Ms Brown said. “Japanese companies need to team with experienced developers to maximise the points they will be awarded.”

Among the Japanese corporations she highlighted who are already involved in the offshore wind sector are Marubeni, Tepco, J Power and JERA. Other Japanese and international players are queuing up to get involved in the industry, including RWE Renewables Japan and Kyuden Mirai Energy Company, who are to undertake a feasibility study for a bottom-fixed offshore wind project in Japan.

Other companies with an interest in bidding in upcoming auctions include Sumitomo Corporation, INPEX Corporation, Japan Petroleum Exploration, JR-EAST Energy Development, Kato Construction, Narita Construction and Venti Japan, along with Chubu and Mitsubishi Corporation, which recently acquired Dutch utility Eneco. In recent weeks, Japanese telecoms giant NTT has indicated that it is planning a foray into offshore wind.

The combination of an existing Japanese player in the offshore wind market and an overseas developer, or new Japanese entrant and overseas developer, is likely to outscore bids from new foreign entrants alone, existing Japanese players or new Japanese ones, Ms Brown suggests.

Japan launched its first auction for offshore wind at the end of June. That auction is for a small-scale floating windfarm offshore Nagasaki at the southernmost tip of the country, but as highlighted by OWJ, most initial offshore wind projects in Japan are expected to be bottom-fixed projects.

The Japanese Government is expected to auction 1 GW of offshore wind capacity a year from 2020 onwards, which translates into an ambitious target of 10 GW of projects auctioned by 2030.

Japan’s offshore wind market is likely to grow to around 7.3 GW of capacity by 2030, according to analysis by BNEF, with most of that capacity taking the form of bottom-fixed projects, despite the country’s significant potential for floating offshore wind.

BNEF’s analysis suggests that Japan is capable of achieving 7.3 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 even in the event of a multi-wave Covid-19 pandemic. 7.3 GW could even be possible in the event of an enduring pandemic, BNEF believes, but large-scale build-out of offshore wind capacity would be pushed later into the decade.

Following on from the launch of the first auction on 3 July 2020, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) issued an ordinance regarding ‘areas that have already reached a certain preparatory stage’ and ‘promising areas’ toward the designation of future promotion areas under the Renewable Energy Use Law.

As consultancy RCG noted, 10 areas were announced as already having reached the ‘preparatory stage.’ In addition, the agencies will initiate preparation of data on wind conditions and geological surveys for four of these areas designated as ‘promising areas.’

RCG said areas that have progressed to the ‘certain preparatory stage’ include: Ganwu and Minami Shiribeshi, Hokkaido; Hiyama, Hokkaido; offshore Aomori in Japan sea (North), Aomori prefecture; Offshore Aomori in Japan sea (South), Aomori prefecture; Mutsu bay, Aomori prefecture; Happou-town and Noshiro-city, Akita prefecture; Katagami-city and Akita-city, Akita prefecture; Yuza-town, Yamagata prefecture; Murakami-city and Tainai-city, Niigata prefecture; and Saikai-city, Nagasaki prefecture. Ganwu and Minami Shiribeshi, Hokkaido, Hiyama, Hokkaido and Yuza-town, Yamagata prefecture were newly added.

Among this group, four areas have been singled out where ‘councils’ will be formed in each area by METI/MLIT and the preparation of wind measurement and geological surveys will be conducted by the government. RCG considers that these four areas will be candidates for offshore wind Round 2.

RCG said the four promising areas are: offshore Aomori in Japan sea (North), Aomori prefecture; offshore Aomori in Japan sea (South). Aomori prefecture; Jappou-town and Noshiro-city, Akita prefecture; Saikai-city, Nagasaki prefecture.","It could, analysts have suggested, one day become one of the largest offshore wind markets in the world.

Business partnerships built on ethics, shared motivations and the greater good are taking off. To explain the finer points, we spoke to the Chairman of EQ Capital Partners, Barry Palte.

Cultivating networks based on shared values, synergistic ethics and shared motivation is crucial to networking at a higher level. Ethics should align in networking and partnership outcomes. Where once the predominant motivator for investment was the financial return, a significant shift in investor and corporate mindsets has highlighted the critical importance of social impact outcomes and full alignment between partners.

Many leading corporations have been developing strategies which have a common value system at their core. They have increasingly been acknowledging how opportunities exist for increased competitiveness and profit, by helping solve social problems.

There are greater forces at work in the world which have made a substantial impact right across the financial sector stark examples of this include the Australian bushfires and now the global COVID pandemic.

One key trend is the burgeoning approach to finance of ‘impact investment’, a fast-rising trend that has ignited excitement among investors, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike. An important element of building a more inclusive economic system, impact investment seeks to serve society better while tackling ongoing economic, social and ecological issues.

The mission of impact investors is to build better, more sustainable outcomes by investing in businesses and projects with potentially large social benefits. Examples include better health, ecological and social inclusion outcomes. Those socially beneficial goods and services—such as renewable energy, vaccines, cancer therapeutics, collision avoidance technology and innovative agriculture—are, after all, the “purpose” of businesses. Impact investors also understand that profit is a condition—and a result of—achieving a purpose. Understanding this is critical to impact investors’ ability to leverage their scarce capital against investors driven by financial return.

The term’s origins date back to 2000, when Baruch Lev of the NYU Stern School of Business, collated his thinking about intangible assets, which furthered thinking about the non-financial effects of corporate production. As a result of this, in 2007, the term ‘impact investing’ emerged.

Characteristics

Two key aspects are held to define impact investing: its intended social impact and the way its impact will be measured.

Another key aspect of impact investing is the concept of “additionality”. Impact investing should improve a social or environmental outcome more than what would have otherwise occurred – a concept known as “additionality”, where investors with scarce capital are encouraged to concentrate their investments where it will make a difference.

Making a successful impact investment

According to the World Economic Forum, the four qualities common to successful impact investing fund managers are effective partnerships with the public sector, the use of catalytic capital, multilingual, or ‘cross-sector’ leadership, and integrating financial and social objectives on an equal footing.

One ongoing success story in Australian impact investing is Barry Palte. Chairman of private investment group EQ Capital Partners, Barry is an investment expert with a primary focus on sustainable investment and achieving positive social outcomes.

Barry’s passion for impact investing is reflected in his focus on investing in, and working with, disruptive technology companies and projects which have a major impact on the health of people, and of the planet. He has cultivated his circle of influence through nurtured relationships that have evolved into highly successful and enduring commercial partnerships.

These partnerships are based on a strong sense of shared values.

We asked him what he looks for when it comes to ‘impact investing’ decisions. Barry’s response was that he has six criteria that a potential investor needs to encompass.

“The thing I look for is explicit positive social impact,” he said, “(plus) a passionate and aligned team, an organisation which is based on ethics, trust and shared values, its ability to manage risk, and if it is ultimately globally scalable.”

Palte is a veteran in the financial sector, with professional experience dating back to the 80s. In that time, he’s seen a number of trends come and go, and many market cycles.

His many investment experiences around the world have reconfirmed the criticality of a strong sense of purpose to shape investment decision making.

“I have a strong sense of purpose,” he said. “A lot of my decisions are based on how it would reflect on me, my legacy once I’m gone.”

A key component of his investment decisions, according to Barry is, “What positive social good would my family, friends and partners reflect on at my funeral?”

An R-o-I that’s more than financial

Investments, by their very nature, are made with the goal of there being a strong financial return. But how much of a financial return on an impact investment should someone expect, or hope for? We asked what the benefit was of impact investing, and if it was broader than just simple, financial ones.

“Sustainable investment returns come from delivering tangible benefits to people and the planet,” Barry said. He noted how the need for such investments is huge and growing, and as a result, high financial returns are very achievable, “… but not at the cost of people and the planet.”

“The two are not mutually exclusive,” he said. “In fact, they are very complementary.

“It is increasingly becoming the case that ‘positive social impact’ is a prerequisite to generating sustainable investment returns. We map our returns both financially and explicitly mapped to the achievement of sustainable development goals.”

When building financial partnerships, a likeminded approach to ethical investments is of paramount importance to him.

“This is another non-negotiable starting point. Ethics, shared values and trust go hand-in-hand and create true alignment.”

Winning on all fronts

It was reported recently in The Guardian that some if not many ethical investment funds are outperforming traditional funds. There is strong emerging evidence for ethically minded investors like Palte and EQ Capital Partners that in a very competitive investment marketplace, social benefit and financial windfall rank as a ‘win-win’.

“Ethics, shared values and full alignment are in my view a basic and non-negotiable starting point. Then the social impact benefits get layered on top and are key drivers of investment returns,” he says.

The competitive nature of financial markets and business generally means that there are overriding factors when investment decisions are being made

“It is very important to understand competition,” Barry says, “particularly from large incumbents, who can either support or block new initiatives, as well as other innovators.”

The knowledge that positive social impact can be combined with exceptional investment returns is Palte’s primary motivator. He also hopes that his actions will stand as being positive influences on his network, colleagues and professional peers. Palte’s work is done in part to positively influence his peers, and done in the hope that the example he is setting will inspire others in a similar position to do the same.

“In a global environment dealing with bush fires, with climate change, and now a global virus pandemic, coupled with ongoing global political tensions, people of goodwill and ‘light’ have an obligation to build a common understanding and deliver concrete outcomes,” he says.

“We are in a dangerous time in history, and the world desperately needs inspiration, passion and solutions.”","Impact investors also understand that profit is a condition—and a result of—achieving a purpose.

WayaWaya founder and lead Janja product builder, Teddy Ogallo, joins Ajua as VP of Product APIs and Integrations.

Launched in 2012, Ajua was built to solve the customer experience gap for businesses on the continent to drive business growth. Ajua combines technology with customer experience and has built a number of innovative products that deliver real-time customer feedback at the point of service, for small and large businesses across Africa, with the goal to digitalize and power growth for over 45 million SMEs. Current Ajua infrastructure partners and clients include GoodLife Pharmacy, Standard Chartered, FBNQuest, Safaricom, Total, Coca-Cola and Java House.

The acquisition of WayaWaya allows Ajua to integrate Janja to automate much of the customer experience journey by integrating janja.me product into their product stack, closing the customer experience loop as the smart AI and ML built by WayaWaya gives SMEs the ability to automate responses and give the customer what they want, when they want it.

WayaWaya currently helps both individuals and businesses with intelligent messaging, across a number of social platforms, including Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, Telegram, and others. It allows its users to automate customer support and make cross-border payments. As well as its vast reach with social platforms, WayaWaya is also integrated with global and African financial leaders including Mpesa, Airtel Money, Bankserv, First Data, Interswitch, Stripe, Flutterwave, Visa and MasterCard.

This comes just one month after Ajua announced its partnership with Nigeria’s MTN for MTN EnGauge, an agile application that offers innovative customer management solutions. The platform enables businesses to access digital payments using a unique USSD code, CRM tools, customer feedback channels, debt management and tracking, business and product promotions through mobile and social media channels.

Through its new product roll-out with MTN, Ajua is generating more data for its thousands of users, much of which can now be better automated and monetized through the products and services WayaWaya has built, including cross-border digital transfers, payments services and intelligent finance bots.

The SME market in Nigeria alone is valued at $220 billion annually and projections reveal that businesses with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) have bolstered their productivity by 40 percent. Ajua, the leader in the technology-powered customer experience market for the continent, uses data and analytics to connect companies with their customers in real-time, helping businesses to better understand the nature of their customers and subsequently increase sales through smarter experiences.

What they are saying

Kenfield Griffith, Ajua Founder and CEO said “The acquisition of WayaWaya is an important milestone for us, as we make a significant leap in ensuring the customer experience journey for businesses across the continent is seamless. Integrating WayaWaya’s technology significantly complements our product suite and gives us the ability to automate our clients’ businesses and grow their revenues, which is an extremely powerful proposition for our customers of all sizes, across Africa. From our experience in this area, we understand the CX fundamentals that drive growth for our customers and we want to bring this intelligence to SMEs across the continent.”

Teddy Ogallo, founder of WayaWaya and new VP of Product APIs and Integrations for Ajua adds, “Ajua’s focus on introducing and scaling customer service and customer experience for the continent – and essentially how they help businesses deliver excellence for their customers is something my team and I have long admired. Seeing how WayaWaya’s technology can complement Ajua’s innovative products and services, and help scale and monetize businesses, is an exciting opportunity for us, and we are happy that our teams will be collaborating to build something unique for the continent.”","WayaWaya founder and lead Janja product builder, Teddy Ogallo, joins Ajua as VP of Product APIs and Integrations.

As South Africans ride the ‘Coronacoaster’, they need news, information and advice they can trust. There is a unique opportunity for commercial brands and corporates to partner with these news brands to communicate meaningfully with their sizable audiences.

Newspapers are more than the words on a page. For Mondli Makhanya, editor in chief: City Press, they are “news organisations, peddlers of credible news, influencers of society”; and they “need to help readers make good decisions in their lives”.

His counterpart at Rapport, Waldimar Pelser, says bewildered readers are looking for “news they can believe and analysis they can trust, content that reflects their experience of the world”.

Mapula Nkosi, editor in chief: Daily Sun, highlights how this publication changed the local media landscape by providing a voice for the blue collar worker and addressing the “real politics of the reader”, the day-to-day challenges they face, such as a burst sewerage pipe that prevents them leaving their yard.

It was clear that the participants in the invitation-only webinar, Storytelling for Brands, hosted by Gayle Edmunds, strategic projects editor at Ads24 on behalf Ads24 and Media24, has been rethinking their purpose long before the Covid-19 crisis struck. They have transitioned into multiplatform brands using words images and video to tell their stories and adapted swiftly to the challenges of remote publishing.

All three editors concurred that successful news brands could not talk down to their readers. The Daily Sun pioneered the use of the unique kasi and township lexicon and gave legitimacy to the traditional and indigenous belief and knowledge systems of its readers. Pelser says the Rapport platform is the readers’ platform. He stressed that while Rapport catered for people who wanted to consume their news in Afrikaans, it was not only about Afrikaans people.

The editors believe their brands earn readers’ trust by “corroborating and confirming and checking and checking facts again” and sayid they are held to account in a way that social media is not.

They also agree that, while they would be derelict in their duties if they failed to report stories of corruption and malfeasance, they can’t bludgeon their readers over the head with negativity. Readers need stories of hope and guidance to find solutions to their own lives.

This presents commercial brands with an opportunity to use these trusted media brands as a vehicle for their messages. It us not about simply booking advertising space or providing bland or brand bludgeoning press, but about collaborating with the news brands to allow them to explore and tell these stories in the language of the brands and through interrogative journalistic eyes.

Nkosi announced that the Daily Sun had partnered with 1Life and Mzansi Wethu to launch Sun’Ceda, a TV programme providing solutions and assistance to readers who have reached out for help.

Another example of the Daily Sun’s constructive engagement with its readers is Mr Fixit, a duo who traverse the country to attend to issues, and in so doing, embarrass the municipal and council officials who have failed in their duties. She spoke too of SunPower, which showed that SunReaders were a community geared to solving their own problems and helping each other.

The “jewel in the crown” for Makhanya, is the long-running partnership project City Press runs with Absa. Money Makeover is a six month financial bootcamp which takes six readers who were failing in their financial goals and puts them under the guidance of the publication’s personal finance editor and Absa financial advisers. Not only did the six manage to achieve their goals, but many readers told the publication that they had been able to resolve their problems after following the lessons shared during the series.

Pelser stresses that when Rapport entered into these partnerships, the team produced the kind of copy they would produce for the newspaper, constructing stories that are compelling and relevant to their readers. He cites successful collaborations with the Department of Environmental Affairs, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, Coca-Cola, Grobank and the Ombudsman for Banking Services. In the case of the last mentioned, they provided advice on how not to fall prey to online scams.

The editors agreed that South Africans cannot simply rely on politicians to provide the solutions to the problems which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. This presents commercial and news brands with opportunities to collaborate to find solutions and shape the way forward.

Having spent some decades working in the media agencies, Britta Reid now relishes the opportunity to take an independent perspective on the South African media world, especially during this time of radical research transformation.

India is classified as a ‘high growth market’ by Enterprise Ireland, while the majority of the current exports of Irish Life Sciences’ companies are to the EU & America, India has strong potential for growth and is an important market for several Irish enterprises.

What is different about India in terms of both, opportunities and challenges? What makes it an attractive investment destination for Irish firms?

In Ireland, the medical device sector is thriving and is now the second-largest exporter of medical technology in Europe. Four out of five of the stents used worldwide are produced in Ireland. Half of the ventilators used in acute hospitals worldwide are produced here, as are a third of the world’s contact lenses. More than 30 million people with diabetes use injectable devices made in Ireland.

India imports nearly 80 per cent of its medical devices and this offers a unique opportunity for leading med-tech companies globally. India’s expanding affluent and middle-class patient population increasingly demand improved healthcare services, to which Irish companies have responded by providing upgraded healthcare infrastructure, high-value medical diagnostic devices, and newer medical technologies. Also, the thriving medical tourism sector in India added to growing expenditure on medical and surgical equipment, which is also opening up newer opportunities for Irish companies. India has a high reliance on foreign-made technologically advanced devices such as cancer diagnostics, medical imaging, ultrasonic scans, and PCR technologies for speciality and super-speciality hospital facilities, and Ireland has strong capabilities in these areas.

Like many developing markets, India also poses some challenges for Enterprise Ireland’s client companies. The medical device market is fragmented with no centralised procurement process in private/public hospitals, making it difficult to navigate the market.

What are the strengths, benefits that Irish firms can bring into India’s healthcare and pharma sectors? And, what can Ireland gain from India’s skills, capabilities, and experience?

Ireland is a world-leading centre of excellence for the manufacturing of pharma and fine chemical products. The Irish pharma sector, which comprises pharma, fine and speciality chemicals, as well as biotech companies, is one of the world’s largest exporters of pharma. Nine out of the world’s top 10 pharma companies have substantial operations in Ireland, the country has a robust infrastructure in R&D with globally leading clusters and education/training facilities.

Indian medical device and pharma sectors witnessed a disruption in the supply chain due to the COVID-19 crisis, particularly due to temporary suspension of raw materials and Class 1 medical devices from China. Currently, the Indian government is strongly focusing on building India’s capability in the healthcare, pharma and bulk chemicals sector to reduce import dependency. India can benefit from Irish partnerships in R&D, education/training and innovative technology to help to build a stronger infrastructure to support India’s vision to be more self-reliant.

Irish companies have a lot to gain by engaging with the Indian pharma industry which is strategically placed to cater to the COVID-19 crisis. India has considerable manufacturing expertise; Indian companies are among the world leaders in the production of generics and vaccines. As both of these areas become more important, Indian producers are likely to take a large role on the world stage – and potentially partner with global pharma companies. India now produces more than 20 per cent of the world’s generics. Vaccines are another prominent area of growth. India is one of the largest vaccine producers in the world and is estimated to produce around 70 per cent of the global vaccine and exports to about 150 countries.

Enterprise Ireland has appointed an Indian for the first time as the Director for India and South Asian regions. How will your experience and understanding of the Indian market help you make decisions and chart strategies?

Before joining Enterprise Ireland, I have worked with several foreign governments, corporates, and non-profits. As the Director for India & South Asia, my main focus will be to enhance trade relations between India and Ireland by providing market intelligence, strategic advice, access to business opportunity and funding to Irish companies looking to do business in India. There is still a lot of apprehension among Irish companies when they look at India as a market or manufacturing base. We will be creating programmes and soft landing infrastructure for Irish companies to learn about India, how business is done here, who to work with, and the regions they should focus on.

As you know, Enterprise Ireland is among the largest venture capital firms in Europe making nearly 200 investments annually, I would also be keen to develop partnerships with the innovation ecosystem in India so that startups from both countries can benefit.

In the life sciences and health sector, we have strong relationships with many leading Indian companies and several of them have also visited Ireland. We would also be supporting companies from Ireland to develop a base in India which help them in getting better access to the market. There are already several Irish healthcare companies like Aerogen, Trulife, Novearus, etc., who already have a strong base and/or partnerships in India and I hope to have more such companies active in India.

What are your short term and long term goals where India is concerned?

COVID has caused a lot of disruptions in the ongoing business activity and in the short term, we will be focusing on supporting Irish companies who are already active in the market to help them sustain and preserve their existing business. We would also work closely with Irish companies who have solutions to tackle the current pandemic, for example, companies like Novearus have recently launched a portable air disinfection device which has shown effective results at reducing MS2 Bacteriophage, a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), by 99.99 per cent in 15 minutes. Another example would be Aerogen their high-performance aerosol drug delivery technology is providing effective treatment of respiratory illness and the company is actively catering to COVID19 hospitals across India.

There are about 100 Irish companies active in India and my aim remains in the longer term is to grow that number and further strengthen the relationship between Ireland and India.

166,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-systems-mapping-helps-drive-successful-partnerships,"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,How systems mapping helps drive successful partnerships,"The number of multi-stakeholder partnerships (including organized collaborations between governments, businesses and civil society organizations) that address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has rapidly expanded since 2015. Many of these partnerships are working to transform complex systems from an unsustainable to a sustainable pathway, such as moving from fast fashion to a circular fashion industry; switching from a fossil fuel-dependent economy towards a renewable energy-dependent economy; revamping the global financial system to create impact investment opportunities for marginalized communities; or reducing ocean plastic pollution by creating new markets for recycled plastics.

Goal 17 of the SDGs emphasizes these transformational partnerships, but little is known about their impact and contribution to systems change. As a result, questions remain on their effectiveness.

""Today, systems thinking is needed more than ever because we are becoming overwhelmed by complexity,"" said Peter Senge, a leading thinker on systems dynamics modeling, in his book ""The Fifth Discipline."" ""Perhaps for the first time in history, humankind has the capacity to create far more information than anyone can absorb, to foster far greater interdependency than anyone can manage and to accelerate change far faster than anyone’s ability to keep pace.""

Systems change evaluation and multi-stakeholder partnership experts are placing increasing emphasis on the need for partnerships to integrate systems thinking and understand the system they’re working in before and during partnership implementation. This will allow partnerships to better:

Design innovative solutions that target system leverage points that are best suited to take advantage of players' unique value, skills and experience;

Identify the right partners and champions to engage;

Align partners on a systems understanding and transformation vision;

Adapt and respond to changes within and external to the partnership; and

Evaluate whether the partnership is contributing to systems change.

Systems at all scales are dynamic and composed of a variety of actors, interconnections, power dynamics and underlying cultural mindsets. All of these can shift based on things such as election cycles, economic recessions, cultural movements, natural disasters and, as of recently, a pandemic. This often means partnerships need to pivot to make sure they stay on track for their transformation goals.

This leads to the concept of systems mapping, which partnerships can use to understand the systems they’re working on and align on a shared vision and strategy for change. Through WRI’s recent research supporting the upcoming report ""A Time for Transformative Partnerships: How Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships Can Accelerate the UN Sustainable Development Goals,""and through our recent collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute on the Systems Change Lab, we have been exploring systems mapping as a vital success factor. Our research shows that systems mapping is not only needed for multi-stakeholder partnerships seeking to transform complex systems to a sustainable pathway, but can — and should — be tailored to a partnership’s resources.

What Is systems mapping?

Broadly speaking, systems mapping is the creation of visual depictions of a system, such as its relationships and feedback loops, actors and trends. Systems mapping is intended to provide a simplified conceptual understanding of a complex system that, for collective action purposes, can get partners on the same page. Multiple systems mapping methods and tools exist, but expert Steve Waddell recently noted, ""Knowing the full range is difficult if not impossible, new ones are continually evolving, and knowledge about them is highly fragmented.""

However, some tools and methods are more commonly used or promoted by systems change evaluation experts and partnerships. Multiple free training resources were developed from organizations focusing on collective and social impact, such as FSG’s Systems Thinking Toolkit. Understanding each method’s focus, strengths and weaknesses is also important and can help a partnership decide which to use.

Actor mapping is a tool used to understand system stakeholders and relationship structures, However, it is not well-suited for understanding the ""why"" of the system, including underlying issues and trends.

It can be used to explore key stakeholders and decision-makers to engage and identify potential bottlenecks, but can be time-intensive.

New online tools are also becoming available, several of which combine multiple mapping methods. Some of the more popular tools include:

Systems mapping in action

The examples below show how some partnerships used systems mapping tools to understand different aspects of their system and create outputs that moved the partnership forward. These examples demonstrate how systems mapping tools can lead to success in partnerships.

NextWave Plastics

NextWave Plastics (NWP) is a coalition of multinational technology and consumer companies committed to reducing marine plastic pollution. NWP integrates recycled ocean-bound plastics and mismanaged plastic litter captured within 31 miles of shoreline into its products and packaging. Current partners or member companies include Dell Technologies, Bureo, Herman Miller, Interface, Humanscale, Trek Bicycles, General Motors, IKEA, HP Inc. and Solgaard. NWP’s convening partner, Lonely Whale, in coordination with the other inaugural partner, Dell Technologies, led the charge in developing a holistic systems understanding and partnership vision before engaging other member companies to build a global network of ocean-bound plastic supply chains.

To identify potential member companies to engage in their vision of reducing ocean-bound plastic, founding members Lonely Whale and Dell Technologies used a lighter version of actor mapping. In order to identify actors already integrating ocean-bound plastics into their supply chain or those with the potential to do so, NWP produced a list of relevant companies as opposed to a conceptual map. Interestingly, due to extensive research and networking with experts, NextWave was able to secure membership from competing companies in the same industry — HP and Dell, Humanscale and Herman Miller. This collection of companies serves as a nod to the power of civil society organizations as conveners and the trust that others have in them.

NWP continues to use system mapping to better understand and react to evolving supply chain development opportunities. They mapped their existing supplier network, as well as potential ocean-bound plastic source locations, informed by scientific research on the most significant contributing countries to ocean plastic pollution and a market assessment of adequate ocean-bound plastic collection and recycling. The ocean-bound plastic supply locations can be mapped visually, but a more functional database provides members with detailed information, leading to decisions on which countries and with what suppliers to pursue ocean-bound plastic material sourcing. This allows for maximum impact on ocean plastic pollution while informing effective business decisions.

Rocky Mountain Institute — India Electric Mobility

Rocky Mountain Institute convened a group of other climate-focused organizations working in India —including WRI, NRDC and ClimateWorks Foundation — to generate a shared map and understanding of what it will take to dramatically accelerate electric vehicle adoption in India. An initial version of a map was created specifically to discover the barriers to adopting electric assets in India. The group then iterated on the map, leveraging perspectives over time to create a more complete picture.

While it is important to be intentional with the outputs of a mapping exercise, a large part of the value comes from the collaborative process itself. The discussion, driven by the map, articulated that a shared understanding of the drivers and barriers of the system is helpful for creating complementary strategies about what, where and how to intervene in the system.

It was especially helpful that the causal loop diagrams were not specific to the work of any single organization, but allowed for a discussion of the dynamics at play. By allowing the group to alter the map based on their perspectives, these experts also benefited from the opportunity to hear about lessons learned from their colleagues and to think about how strategies should change over time, including what some of the most salient impacts of COVID-19 might be and how their organizations might pivot to react to these dynamics.

Systems maps can be overwhelming to look at without being a part of the creation process. However, animating and stepping through the stories told by a system map is a helpful way to learn about the key parts of the system without becoming overwhelmed. An animated version of the India Mobility Electrification map can be found here.

Tips for selecting the right systems mapping approach

When selecting the right systems mapping methods, tools or suite of methods and tools to use, these three steps can help set priorities:

Identify your learning priorities and what will be most useful to share with your partners, champions and relevant decision-makers. Maybe you already have research to support the issue underlying the system from moving to a sustainable development pathway, but need to identify partners and champions. Maybe you need to establish a performance tracking or monitoring and evaluation system. No matter the case, identifying priorities will help you select the right methods and tools. Designate staff to systems mapping and performance tracking and set a realistic budget. Many experts can be hired to run systems mapping exercises. Or, as with NextWave Plastics, the partnership’s administrator can drive regular systems evaluation and mapping. Either way, having at least one staff member with a dedicated job responsibility tied to systems mapping is critical for ensuring this task takes place. Knowing your budget can help you identify the right option for designating a staff member. Use a participatory approach. Most tools detailed above are participatory or can be made participatory in the exploration of their outputs. Time and time again, partnership guidance recommends including all core partners, relevant decision-makers and those affected (either positively or negatively) by the partnership in developing a systems understanding. Transformative partnerships working in complex systems are largely working to disrupt the status quo or cultural mindsets, resulting in a shift of power balances where some people will lose power. Participation is key to aligning on the underlying issues of the system and solutions.

As more partnerships form to address the SDGs, it is critical to ensure that these partnerships effectively achieve their goals. Whether partnerships undergo systems mapping may be a make-or-break decision in whether they will have a lasting impact and be truly transformative.","This leads to the concept of systems mapping, which partnerships can use to understand the systems they’re working on and align on a shared vision and strategy for change.

Space has fascinated Americans since they turned their ambitions to the skies during the Space Race and reveled in the successes of the Apollo missions.

This feat of industrial engineering and government focus is often held out as the personification of American exceptionalism. Space still represents an opportunity for expansion and dominance, one that has not gone unnoticed by adversaries. Foreign attention and investment in the space domain has led U.S. policymakers to act in-kind. The Defense Department in June released a summary of its Defense Space Strategy, a document that lays out the roadmap to advance U.S. space power in order to compete, deter and win in the “ultimate high ground.”

Following the defining of space as a warfighting domain in 2017 and the establishment of U.S. Space Command and the Space Force in 2019, this new strategy is the next step in offering a much needed vision for integrating the space domain into all areas of conflict. Importantly, it places space power within the larger focus on great power competition called for by the National Defense Strategy.

The Defense Space Strategy comes at a critical time. With an expectation of a flattening defense budget, an additional service branch and unified combatant command will require increasingly sparse resources. The Pentagon can’t afford to take the scenic route establishing its goals and lines of effort to achieve its desired end state. While outlining these goals is an important step forward, a key to achieving success can be found through a thoughtful and sustained engagement with the defense innovation base and burgeoning space industrial base.

Recent aggressive actions by Russia, such as the April direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test and the instance of satellites tailing a U.S. spy satellite, demonstrate that the United States can no longer view space as an isolated domain used to enable military operations. Rather, space must be viewed as a domain of active conflict where national security cannot be assumed. If the United States is forced to take action beyond deterrence and signaling, partnership with the commercial sector will be essential to fielding and integrating the capabilities necessary to compete and win in space. This kind of partnership should be prioritized early and nurtured carefully.

The new space strategy lays out several desired conditions, including a secure, stable and accessible space domain underpinned by U.S. military and industrial strength.

Recognizing that these conditions will not be realized overnight, the department plans to grow its space power over the coming decade through the following lines of effort: build a comprehensive military advantage in space; integrate military space power into national, joint and combined operations; shape the strategic environment; and cooperate with allies, partners, industry and other U.S. government departments and agencies.

Successfully organizing, resourcing and integrating the Space Force and Space Command into the broader Defense Department missions and cultures will be vital to the success of the first two lines of effort. Standing up these two new organizations offers an opportunity to rewrite slow and costly acquisition processes, expand current programs and create innovative pathways for nontraditional companies to enter the defense supply chain, and simplify the national security space structure.

As the department continues its effort to align reality with strategy and goals, a robust messaging platform will be required not only to target external audiences such as industry and adversaries, but components of space operations that have traditionally been held across other services and combatant commands and now need to be brought under a unified and focused structure.

One key challenge identified by the strategy is the relative speed of advances in space capabilities, both domestically and by U.S. adversaries. In a domain as novel as space where financial barriers to entry have decreased significantly in recent years, commercial sector innovation often outpaces the speed of traditional government research and development. Gone are the days where breakthroughs at NASA trickled down into household and commercial technologies; instead, innovations in all aspects of the domain — from situational awareness to launch to on-orbit capabilities — are driven by the commercial sector.

This dynamic presents an opportunity for the Defense Department to collaborate with industry to ensure a solid position at the cutting edge of technology and capability development. This spring’s SpaceX Crew Dragon launch demonstrates just how successful the U.S. can be when it partners with pioneers in industry to achieve national security objectives in space.

Focused, results-oriented dialogue between industry and government around the future of space operations and space power will be essential to pursuing the lines of effort and achieving the goals laid out by the Defense Space Strategy. The Apollo missions that captured the country’s imagination and stunned the world required floor-to-ceiling innovation, deep pockets and a high tolerance for failure.

The challenges of integrating current space activities and tackling costly and technically difficult R&D problems are ones that neither government nor industry alone can overcome. For over a century, the National Defense Industrial Association has stood as the trusted intermediary between public and private entities to facilitate these government-industry partnerships that serve the national interest.

Through forums such as NDIA’s Rocky Mountain Chapter, Space Division, and the first-ever Space Warfighting Industry Forum, the association will continue to engage leaders from government, industry and academia in order to quickly put solutions into the hands of warfighters.

As the Defense Department continues to transform space operations from an enabling function to a full component of its warfighting capabilities, close collaboration with industry and academia remain vital to its success.

Looking back at the early victories which enabled U.S. dominance in space through the end of the 20th century, and with forthright analysis of adversaries’ capabilities and ambitions, it is clear that the United States will need to marshal all of its industrial and governmental might to prevail.



Retired Air Force Col. Wesley Hallman is senior vice president of strategy and policy at NDIA.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Building the right partnerships can increase growth velocity for early stage businesses. One brand we work with at Anvyl has experienced exponential growth during the pandemic, due in part by heavy collaboration with it’s partnership base. To learn more, I met with Matt Mullenax, co-founder and CEO of Huron, a men’s DTC personal care brand, and his co-founder Matt Teri, who is Huron’s Chief Development Officer. We discussed how Huron’s success with partnerships has helped them achieve scale and how other small and medium-sized businesses can use partnerships to add long-term brand value.

“You rely on partners as an extension of your own team, so you can remain nimble but efficient,” said Mullenax. “We trust our partners to help bring our brand to life and deliver our product to customers. It's not a vendor-client relationship; it’s a true partnership. 10 years ago, you might have needed in-house fulfillment, product development or marketing teams. Now, with the right partners, you can grow and scale your company with a fairly small corporate team.”

Mullenax and Teri recommend taking these three steps to form stronger, more connected partnerships.

Related: 4 Tips to Go Further, Faster with Strategic Partnerships

1. Connect your partners to your vision.

Ideally, when a customer makes a purchase, they aren’t just buying your product — they’re also buying your brand. They feel an emotional connection to your mission and values, and this helps them build a lasting relationship with your company.

Apply this same concept to your partnerships. Before you get into any tactical conversations, sell potential partners on your brand’s story and vision. Give them a 360-degree tour of how you operate and what you’re trying to achieve, and seek out partners who are excited to be part of it. You will be working with these people for months, if not years, so think about who you want to build your brand with.

“We know the supply chain is basically the lifeblood of any brand,” said Teri. “When we partner with someone, it's because they're part of our team. Whether we’re talking about packaging or raw materials, this relationship matters. Sharing who we are and what we're all about, and the passion that we have for the brand, our customers and our partners resonates with them. It’s helped us find like-minded companies to partner with.”

2. Go beyond transactional and become collaborative.

The best partnerships are built on trust, confidence and collaboration. Look for partners who want more than a simple transactional relationship and will bring useful ideas and expertise to the table. They should take a proactive role in identifying problems and working with your team to find solutions.

“During the pandemic, we were experiencing shipping delays from various service providers,” said Mullenax. “Our fulfillment partner took the initiative to bring up the issue and quickly resolve it. They brought on additional vendors who were a good fit on price, planning, safety and execution. What was initially a pain point on the fulfillment side became a way to improve the overall customer experience.”

3. Be thorough and selective.

While evaluating new partners, follow this rule of thumb: look wide but go deep. Don’t just talk to one vendor and sign a contract the next day. Have conversations with multiple vendors in any vertical before selecting the one that makes the most sense for your company. Aim to select fewer partners but form tight-knit relationships with them.

Start by researching the partners of brands that you admire. If Brand X works with this vendor, what does that tell you about their diligence, responsiveness and efficiency? Which qualities are most important to you in a partner, and how can you screen for them?

“Think of each conversation as an interview and an opportunity to tease out certain characteristics,” said Teri. “How resourceful, creative and enthusiastic are they? Can they make quick decisions and pivot when you’re up against the wall? What processes do they have in place to ensure quality and safety? Dig deep into how they operate.”

Just because your team is small doesn't mean your growth prospects have to be. Building partnerships with trusted vendors will allow you to expand your team’s capabilities and scale your company more quickly.","We discussed how Huron’s success with partnerships has helped them achieve scale and how other small and medium-sized businesses can use partnerships to add long-term brand value.

Having taken Serie A by storm, Sportsmail has compared the best strike forces across all of the top European leagues this season.

Bayern Munich's attacking force of Robert Lewandowski, Serge Gnabry and Thomas Muller ran riot in the Bundesliga - providing a total of 97 goals.

While the combination of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi helped Paris Saint-Germain become champions of France after scoring 68 goals all together.

From the Bundesliga, to Serie A, to the Premier League – here are the most formidable attacking forces.

Sportsmail have rounded up the best strike partnerships in Europe’s top-flights at the moment

Inter Milan: Romelu Lakaku and Lautaro Martinez

Inter's strikers Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez are on a run of nine straight games in Europe with at least a goal between them.

The pair have equalled an Inter Milan record held by Obafemi Martins and Adriano, after they both scored twice in Monday's 5-0 Europa League semi-final win over Shakhtar Donetsk.

Martins and Adriano were the last Inter players to achieve the record after they won the Coppa Italia, finished third in Serie A and were quarter-finalists in the Champions League.

In order to break the record, Lukaku netted a total of 33 goals this season and Martinez provided another 21 - bringing their combined total up to 54 this season.

Bayern Munich: Robert Lewandowski, Serge Gnabry and Thomas Muller

Bayern Munich attackers Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry are among the most prolific strike pairing in Europe.

The Polish forward now has 55 goals across the Bundesliga, Champions League and DFB Cup for Bayern this season.

While Gnabry, who is seven years Lewandowski's junior, has scored 28 goals - giving them a combined total of 83.

The pair even helped each other reach such targets - with Lewandowski providing Gnabry with four assists and Gnabry providing Lewandowski with six this term.

Thomas Muller has also added to Bayern's attacking force, contributing a total of 14 goals this season.

Paris Saint-Germain: Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Mauro Icardi

The combination of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi is one that can compete with Inter's long-term forward partnership of Lukaku and Martinez.

Mbappe has 29 goals in league, cup and European outings this term, while Neymar and Icardi notched 19 and 20 retrospectively.

Despite racking up some impressive goal-scoring stats, the PSG forward's have flourished due to their ability to work together.

Mbappe provided seven assists to Icardi and three assists to Neymar over the course of the season.

In return, Neymar provided seven assists the Frenchman.

The trio's partnership helped PSG become champions of France despite the season being ended early due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Mauro Icardi have been exceptional as scoring and assisting

Liverpool: Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah

Liverpool's Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah have once again been on the same wavelength this season.

The Reds deadly trio are now widely seen as one of the Premier League's best-ever scoring partnerships.

Mane, Firmino and Salah fired Liverpool to Premier League glory this season, scoring 46 times combined to see Liverpool top the table 18 points clear.

As for the season as a whole, Firmino leads the Anfield outfit's scoring with 12 goals in all competitions this season, while Salah also provided 23 goals.

Mane's 22 strikes completed the trio's contribution - helping Liverpool pick up four trophies in 13 months.

Manchester United: Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial

When Manchester United sold Lukaku to Inter Milan last summer there was a feeling among Old Trafford that they may have made a significant mistake, leaving them short of attacking options.

However, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial have provided them with exactly that.

The United forwards were in devastating form in front of goal following football's return after lockdown.

Their goals even saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men secure a Champions League spot for next season.

Martial provided 23 goals in competitions this season, while Rashford contributed 22 goals.

18-year-old Greenwood topped the charts, scoring a total of 18 goals for The Red Devils this season.

Borussia Dortmund: Jadon Sancho, Erling Haaland and Thorgan Hazard

Erling Haaland made the headlines by bursting onto the scene with a record-breaking start to life with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

Though his attacking threat mesmerised the football world, his partnership with those around him contributed to his impressive goal-scoring record.

Sancho and Hazard played a defining role in bettering their team-mate and provided vital goals for the team.

This saw the three forwards form a formidable partnership - with their combined total of goals for the 2019-2020 season sitting at 43.

Sancho established himself as one of Dortmund's key men, having scored a total of 22 goals in all competitions this season, while Hazard grabbed eight himself.

While Haaland has been lighting up the Bundesliga for Dortmund - establishing himself as one of the most feared attacking players in Germany by providing 13 goals in just half a season in Germany.

Manchester City: Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero

Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero are known for their ability to provide goals for Manchester City.

Sterling even praised his team-mates form, saying Manchester City 'depend' on Aguero after the Argentina international scored a hat-trick in their 6-0 win over Chelsea in 2019.

Following such praise, Aguero went on to keep up his good form - finishing the season on a total of 23 goals.

While Sterling single handily put away 33 goals while playing under Pep Guardiola in the 2019-2020 season.","Having taken Serie A by storm, Sportsmail has compared the best strike forces across all of the top European leagues this season.
The pair even helped each other reach such targets - with Lewandowski providing Gnabry with four assists and Gnabry providing Lewandowski with six this term.
In return, Neymar provided seven assists the Frenchman.
Mane, Firmino and Salah fired Liverpool to Premier League glory this season, scoring 46 times combined to see Liverpool top the table 18 points clear.

Asif Rahman and Tajah Brown from Gleam Solutions take a look at going further with paid social.

With ROI at the top of their agenda, marketeers (understandably – we all have targets to reach) often look back at the results of their previous talent and influencer partnerships and wonder what more they could do to deliver against wider marketing and business objectives.

The answer to this is amplifying the partnership beyond its organic reach – but from the talent themselves, not the brand. People buy from people and brands need to tailor their paid strategies to this.

Let’s look at it this way, you’ve got the perfect talent who shares the brand’s ethos, is an existing advocate of the brand, has a super-engaged audience within the target demographic, and can create high quality, authentic content that seamlessly integrates the brand and call to action. You’ve done your due diligence and checked their conversion power, so you know the results from their existing audience will be good so why not make that go further and deliver wider, outstanding results?

In these dynamic times, consumers more than ever want to hear from authentic voices that relate, not brands. They are increasingly engaged with talent-led branded content.

According to Campaign, there has been a 76% increase in the number of likes on Instagram sponsored posts and Instagram Lives increased by three times in March 2020, showing that consumers are turning to trusted sources for both support and entertainment.

Why is paid media spend on talent-produced content so effective?

Through talent-led partnerships which are amplified with media spend, brands can achieve three key objectives; they can tell their stories and share key messages through authentic voices, they can reach new, super-targeted audiences and they can measure effectively.

The reason that this works so effectively is that digital-first talent knows their channels and audience better than anyone – they have a creative style and format that drives high engagement and results, which means marketers can tell their brand story in a way that makes their target audience take action. Through such bespoke content, talent provides brands with authentic endorsements that move consumers further along the journey.

This, coupled with the strong communities they have built, provides a strong foundation from which to scale and drive consumer action with media spend. It also extends the longevity of the partnership for weeks, without fatigue by consistently reaching a new audience each time.

Putting paid media spend behind talent content is the next step to reaching millions of people with similar demographics, behaviours and interests to the talent’s audience. According to the MediaKix 2019 survey, 89% of people said ROI from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels. It’s a no brainer to add talent-led advertising to your marketing mix and to include paid media for effective talent content amplification.

As you can see from this, the notion that ‘influencer’ or talent-led marketing isn’t measurable is a myth and this is just the beginning, measurement can go so much further. Brands can truly understand the impact of talent-led marketing in achieving their business goals, looking at all different stages of the customer journey.

How do brands create the right strategy to drive maximum ROI against their objectives?

There is often concern amongst marketers that they will run talent-produced ads with paid media spend and not achieve the results they had hoped for, attract the wrong target audience or be unable to tell if they’ve actually reached the community they wanted. Putting the right strategy in place will mitigate this risk, ensure brands reach the right target audience and deliver a cost-effective campaign with a strong ROI.

Boosting a talent’s content is not all about reaching as many people as possible. With an organic partnership, you wouldn’t just choose talent for their follower count alone, you would look at audience demographics, creative style, engagement and conversion power too – and its no different with paid media. A brand’s paid media strategy must align with their true business objectives, so it’s important that brands do their research and think about every stage of the marketing funnel before pressing the live button.

Tailoring content to the brand’s key goals and objectives is also key and with talent-led partnerships, the brand has the beauty of collaboration and a deep understanding of an audience to ensure success. If a brand is planning to boost awareness and reach, then they should build brand and product hype with the talent’s tone and style.

If a brand is looking to reach consumers at mid-funnel level, they should work with talent to create content that changes brand perception and convinces the brand’s future customers to commit to an action. Bottom of the funnel action can also be achieved by developing urgency and reminders to get consumers over the finishing line to purchase. Brands must lean on the talent’s creative prowess to achieve this.

Building an impactful, cost-effective strategy for a campaign needs an effective tool to collate and compare organic results, and build benchmarks per talent and content formats, coupled with considering the sentiment and audience feedback generated from a highly engaged community. With the paid media boost, brands are able to dig deeper into the benchmarks and cost efficiencies. Partnering with the right effectiveness agency to look beyond the channel metrics and align with your business goals will help achieve this.

Reaching consumers at every stage of the journey

In summary, putting media spend behind talent-produced content is so effective as talent can reach consumers at every stage of their journey to purchase by producing attention-grabbing content with authentic endorsements.

With paid media to amplify, brands can reach targeted audiences beyond the

brand’s and talent’s organic following to audiences who are pre-disposed to positively receive the talent content (both as an audience and in terms of platform context), reaching outstanding ROI. By producing organic content and ads, brands can access the metrics that count and build an effective marketing strategy with influence as a legitimate channel within the mix. Long-term campaign planning on this basis also allows for ever-improving efficiencies through continued talent and content testing.

Treasury is statutorily allowed to designate financial institutions as financial agents to provide essential services such as collecting federal tax revenue and making payments to Social Security and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries. McDaniel, assistant commissioner of revenue collections management at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, and Cole, chief diversity and inclusion officer, started Treasury’s Bank Mentor Protégé Program in 2018 to expand the scope of these partnerships to include more small, minority-owned and women-owned banks.

“Protégé banks gain a new business partner in the mentor (one with considerable success in the industry), and in an industry where change is so rapid and the delivery of banking services evolving,” said McDaniel.

“Each of the mentor-protégé banks determine their own unique goals and parameters for the relationship, which will vary depending on the capacity and expertise of the respective banks,” said Cole.

As a result of their efforts, Cole and McDaniel are the winners of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service's 2020 Service to America Medals People’s Choice Award, which is part of its annual Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals (known as the Sammies) for outstanding achievements of federal employees.

“We live in a world today with so many challenges and our federal government is central to addressing many, many of them,” said Max Stier, PPS president and CEO. “Our federal government is made up of extraordinary people who don't often get the limelight when they really deserve it. It's with real great pleasure to be able to recognize Corvelli and Lorraine for the exceptional work that they are doing and hopefully offer them up as models not only for public servants to emulate, but also for particularly young people looking for a way to make a big difference.”

Government Executive interviewed McDaniel and Cole earlier this week about their careers in government, the program that led to their winning of this award and their advice for future public servants. The interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.

GE: Why did you decide to join the federal government?

Cole: I've been doing public service my entire career. I have had about 20 years experience leading not for profit organizations, which I very much consider public service. I've been at Treasury, which is my first and only federal position, [for] almost 10 years. Congressman John Lewis in his final message said that, “Democracy is not a state. It's an act” and no matter what job title I've had, whether it's been in the private sector or public sector, I've always considered myself an activist. So my entry into federal government has just really been an extension of a career that I consider public service.

McDaniel: My time as a public servant does go back a ways now starting when I was in the military as an Army officer, serving primarily overseas. This element of service just resonates with me. It’s something great about giving back about helping others, seeing communities get better and get stronger and…[is] something that is meaningful to me, fulfilling to me. I’ve been at the Treasury Department [for over 27 years] in various roles, but I always had in the back of my mind: ‘You are serving here. You're not only a public servant and a representation of as far as the citizens go, making their government work, this government that they are part of, you’re a representative.’ [It] has been deeply satisfying to play a part in making government more efficient, more effective [and] really making it advance forward [by] modernizing and transforming it, making it relevant, real and appropriate for the times that we're living in.

GE: Can you talk about the program you started and its origins?

McDaniel: It was a reality that Treasury's current network of commercial bank partnerships had become limited to a small number of big banks and it isn't wise for any organization to put all of their eggs in a limited basket. We asked ourselves the question, do we have dynamic enough alliances, partnerships, coalitions to meet the challenges on the horizon? How inclusive and diverse are our business relationships?

We looked at and focused on the talents and abilities of small banks, minority owned, women owned banks. And so the objective, though the mentor protégé program, we wanted to achieve a new end state: a more dynamic network of banks, large banks that could play an important role with their capacity to perform more complex services and small banks [that could] give us the ability to be more agile, nimble, so we can pivot quickly and respond rapidly to immediate needs.

Cole: I came to the whole collaboration from a somewhat different perspective. I'm the chief diversity officer for the Treasury headquarters. And I head the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion...and part of the mandate of this office is to ensure a fair inclusion of minority and women owned businesses in all business activities of the agency.

Treasury does very well in terms of contracting and ensuring minority and women-owned businesses are participating as contractors and providing goods and services. But the bigger challenge was involving minority businesses or financial entities within the financial agent activities that Corvelli and others within the Bureau of Fiscal Services oversee. So my office and Corvelli’s office had dialogue very early on about ways to fulfill this mandate and this was a perfect marriage with the needs that Corvelli just articulated that Treasury had to diversify its financial agents.

GE: What is the importance of this program and what are your future goals?

Cole: There are 5,400 financial institutions in the United States, but only 148 minority owned banks. For generations, small community banks, including minority owned banks, have been crucial to the economic vitality of low to moderate-income communities. For local communities, access to credit, loans, deposit services, financial expertise and even bank jobs are essential to daily life and economic stability. Therefore, it is imperative that this sector of America’s banking network remains viable.

The ultimate aim is that the capacity of the protégé banks will build to allow them to compete for work as Treasury financial agents. Also [I] would like to see long-term partnership evolve between mentors and protégé banks.

McDaniel: [The program] changes the paradigm and inverts the long-standing position of banks viewing one another as competitors. The program introduces the dawn of a new day where new partnerships are created and mentorship is applied, which creates a stronger national banking system, and better services and a higher degree of financial inclusivity for all Americans.

Cole: A lot of government programs are either mandated by legislation or by executive order, or by some external force. But this program was created organically...It's showing a great deal of success, members of Congress took notice and now there is legislation in process to codify this program into law.

GE: Why is having mentors to the protégé banks important?

Cole: There is complete flexibility to be creative in how mentor protégé agreements can be structured. Each of the mentor-protégé banks determine their own unique goals and parameters for the relationship, which will vary depending on the capacity and expertise of the respective banks. The types of technical assistance and growth strategies could be either narrowly specialized or broadly encompassing, as mutually determined during the early development of the mentor-protégé arrangement. Prospective technical assistance can run the gamut and could include such things as expanded banking service offerings, implementation of emerging technologies, government contracting, and mergers and acquisitions.

McDaniel: Mentors are difference makers. They have an uncommon ability to help others, and it’s these special attributes of a mentor that distinguishes Treasury’s mentor-protégé program from others.

Protégé banks gain a new business partner in the mentor (one with considerable success in the industry), and in an industry where change is so rapid and the delivery of banking services evolving (e.g., traditional brick-and-mortar bank branches are being transformed to café branches, virtual branches, and portable pop up branches where bank employees use an iPad to open customer accounts), a mentor is invaluable.

We anticipate that the mentor bank will have such an impact that the protégé won’t stay a protégé, but will one day be a mentor themself. As the protégé becomes the mentor, Treasury’s mentor protégé program becomes perpetual and thus will continuously impact the banking industry and Treasury’s network of banks.

GE: How, if at all, have the events of 2020 have affected the program?

Cole: The Bank Mentor Protégé program was established to promote greater inclusivity among banks that are providing services to the Treasury. But, we never could have imagined that minority-owned banks would play such a key role in Treasury’s economic stimulus efforts during the worst health crisis in modern history.

McDaniel: The protests and mass demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd’s death that have drawn attention to the issues of racial injustice, economic disparities, and inequalities, are events that have, if anything, been a form of validation that the purpose and guiding principles of the mentor protégé program (e.g., inclusivity; greater access to Treasury business opportunities; diversification of our bank relationships to include [minority depository institutions]) are in keeping with what the American public would expect from their government and the Treasury Department. The events of 2020 have shown the mentor protégé program is relevant and an example for others to consider following.

Cole: Minority-owned banks and other depository institutions stepped up to become lenders in the Paycheck Protection Program. According to the data from July 24, 171 Paycheck Protection Program lenders were minority depository institutions. These institutions approved over 120,000 loans that provided more than $10 billion to small businesses.

McDaniel: The pandemic events of 2020 pointed to the importance of programs such as the mentor protégé program that develop capacity and capabilities in small banks such as [minority depository institutions] that are on the front lines of serving communities most impacted by national crises.

GE: What advice would you give to young people looking to join the federal government?

McDaniel: The counsel I would give is that there is a great opportunity to make a difference [in working for the federal government], if you're looking for opportunities to learn and grow, to use your skills and your education to support an organization that is impacting various sectors of the population and the business world. Government touches all businesses, all citizens...What I have found is that there are recent college graduates, [those in their] 20s and, even, 30s, who want to serve. They want to make a difference. They want to do something that has an impact and there's no greater opportunity than in government to make a difference.

Cole: I would just add to that that there’s really no discipline that is not represented within the federal government. So there are opportunities just in all sorts of career disciplines. But not only is there a breadth, there is a lot of room to grow, to really have a long-term career within the federal government.

McDaniel: Lastly, I would just dispel some myths that maybe a 20-something recent college graduate would likely hear. I've been on the inside and I know the truth of the matter: government is a place where you can be innovative, where you can create, where you can be out of the box, where you can be entrepreneurial.","We looked at and focused on the talents and abilities of small banks, minority owned, women owned banks.

Environmental NGO BVRio has launched a new online platform connecting circular economy projects with corporates and impact investors, whose aim is to help small programmes scale-up and large organisations put sufficient finance behind their resource goals.

Called the Circular Action Hub, the platform will connect sources of finance with local projects, which will have to prove that they are ""ambitious and scalable"" to standard-setter Verra be listed. There Is a particular focus on plastic waste - particularly removing plastic waste from habitats and diverting It for reuse or recycling - but the platform will cover all waste streams and all stages of the material lifecycle.

The scheme purports to support ""a huge diversity of circumstances, technologies and approaches that can be used by projects in different parts of the world"". It has attracted sign-ups from more than 100 projects spanning 35 countries ahead off Its launch. BVRio estimates that these projects could collectively recover more than 300,000 tonnes of waste from the environment with adequate funding.

BVRio worked with an advisory coalition to develop the platform and will continue this collaboration In a bid to achieve ""continuous improvement"". It Is specifically looking to build on context-based learnings, taking Into account factors like projects' locations and their specific funding needs, and to maximise the social benefits of the projects.

The likes of Nestle, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, WRAP, Waste Aid and Regions for Climate Action sit on the platform's advisory group, alongside the UK Department for International Development's (DFID) Sustainable Manufacturing and Environmental Pollution arm.

Nestle has also signed up as a corporate user, along with the likes of Danone and Tetra Pak.

BVVRio's chief executive Mauricio Moura Costa said the platform should play an ""important"" role In the global ""circular economy ecosystem"". ""In particular, we are glad to have designed an inclusive system that removes barriers to entry and gives access to smaller initiatives, such as the waste picker cooperatives that operate all over the world”, he added.

Circular economy snapshot

BVRio has been working with Verra for more than a year. 2019 saw the organisations jointly launch a scheme whereby consumer goods firms, retailers and packaging producers can trade plastics credits issued by recycling and recovery providers worldwide in order to prove compliance and to “offset” plastic use.

At the time of the launch of the initiative, called 3R, between eight and 12 million tonnes of plastics were believed to be seeping into oceans and waterways annually. The Ellen Macarthur Foundation had priced the global financial loss associated with linear models of plastics consumption at between $80bn and $120bn each year.

Despite resources policies tightening in markets like the EU and seemingly stronger promises by businesses - made both through standalone sustainability strategies and collaborative initiatives - research has shown that the global plastic pollution problem is growing.

The recent ‘breaking the plastic wave’ report found that the volume of plastic on the market will double within 20 years. At the same time, the volume of plastic entering oceans and waterways will triple, and the global ocean plastic stock will quadruple.

WWF, meanwhile, is warning that a further 104 million tonnes of plastic will “leak” into ecosystems by 2030 in a ‘business-as-usual’ trajectory.

The ministry clarified that the first meeting was held on April 2nd, 2020 with more than 120 representatives from 45 international institutions and foreign courts to discuss the Government of Egypt’s Response and Rebuild strategy, immediate requests by the Ministry of Health and Population to combat Covid-19 and the Ministry’s Global Partnerships Narrative, People at the core, Projects in action and Purpose as the driver.

“The second multi-stakeholder platform acknowledged cooperation to combat Covid-19 and highlighted the active ongoing partnerships portfolio and the wide array of projects and initiatives that are under negotiation and implementation covering various sectors, including health, electricity, transportation, housing, community development, education and women empowerment with an emphasis on partnerships that support the private sector directly and also through financing by domestic banks,” it added.

The ministry noted that the platform included the participation of several multilateral and bilateral development partners, such as the UN and its agencies, World Bank Group, International Finance Corporation, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the African Development Bank, JICA and several foreign courts including the UK, Spain, Canada, France, Germany and the European Union, amongst others.

“Increased coordinated action is key to boosting confidence and providing stability to the global, regional and local economy. The Ministry of International Cooperation through pillars of Economic Diplomacy that were identified early on, aims to ensure that Covid-19 does not derail us from pushing forward with the SDG agenda,” Minister of International Cooperation Rania al-Mashat said.

The Ministry of International Cooperation aims to push the frontiers of collaboration through Economic Diplomacy, since the launching in April 2020, aimed to strengthen partnerships to achieve value-centric results through the set-up of Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, activating the Global Partnerships Narrative and creating the framework for Official Development Assistance (ODA) mapping to the sustainable development goals, according to its statement.

The 3 pillars of ‘Economy Diplomacy’ actively involves a wide range of stakeholders to enhance a sense of ownership, developed knowledge, creating a linkage between different governance levels and most significantly improved policy formulation.

Since the launch in April 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation organized a number of participatory Multi-Stakeholder platforms in various sectors since the COVID-19 crisis, focusing on discussing different areas such as the health sector, public enterprises, transportation, rural and agricultural development and gender quality, and monitor progress in the implementation of projects.

Al Mashat noted that the second element of Economic Diplomacy is to have a strong, consistent and consolidated narrative that helps document stories of development creating awareness, mobilizing audiences and easing the narrative on the SDGs with the overall goal to not just to engage with development-minded people, but to also include members of the international community in the process, allowing them to contribute to and advocate Egypt's development story.

“With only a few percentage of people aware of the SDGs, effective communication on development stories is essential to produce future agents of change that can accelerate progress in development and impact more human lives. This is how we build back better.” the minister said.

In its effort to promote effective development cooperation and ensure the optimal contribution of development cooperation projects to the UN SDFS, the Ministry of International Cooperation also conducted a comprehensive ODA mapping exercise of all current effective projects to identify their alignment with the SDGs.

Putting emphasis on Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Minister Al Mashat highlighted exemplar multi-stakeholder signed agreements by the AfD, AfDB and EBRD for projects allocated to the Energy Sector through its Budgetary Support Program and Electricity and Green Growth Support Program, both seeking to promote a sustainable competitive and diversified electricity sector that ensures secure supply and support climate change mitigation and green growth.

Reaching larger segments of society cannot be achieved without the help of civil society, and this is why the recently launched USAID initiative to support the Egyptian Red Crescent’s (ERC) network of 30,000 Egyptian youth volunteers and health care professionals in conducting community outreach and building ERC’s capacity to respond to future crises, was also highlighted. The initiative brought together multiple stakeholders; including the Ministry of International Cooperation, Ministry of Social Solidarity, and ride hailing company Uber.

In light of fears of the COVID-19 crisis to pull back the gender agenda, women were at the heart of many development stories, most notably in the example of the ‘Kemama’ campaign. It saw a collaboration between UNDP Egypt and El Nidaa Foundation, a community-based initiative launched to accelerate a socially-inclusive sustainable future for Egypt, to engage Egyptian women from Upper Egypt to produce medical face masks, a shift from previous ready-made garment production. The initiative was in partnership with AltFind Labs and Neya Foundation embraces agility and flexibility creating value during challenging times.

“We are very happy with the Ministry’s initiative to create a Multi-Stakeholder Platform which is helping increasing coordinated efforts and work among international institutions. This second meeting showed already an increased dialogue to set up the country’s priorities and is key for the development of various sectors based on the expertise of each institution, putting the impact on people’s lives at the heart of our efforts. This will help avoiding work duplication and achieving quicker results and impact in developing the Egyptian economy”, said Heike Harmgart, Managing Director for the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.","CAIRO – 17 August 2020: Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation announced Monday hosting the second virtual Multi-Stakeholder platform on ‘Global Partnerships for Effective Development Cooperation’.

The European Commission opened a Call for Expressions of Ideas/Potential Members (CEI) on August 26, 2020 that is open to interested technology stakeholders with transformative ideas or concepts in the field of clean aviation contributing to the European Green Deal (EGD) goals. The EGD proposed by the European Commission will include the first European Climate Law to confirm the 2050 climate-neutrality objective in legislation.

The “Partnership on Clean Aviation”, envisaged under Horizon Europe, aims to accelerate the development and demonstration of integrated aircraft technologies towards deep decarbonization while ensuring safety and security. It will help to increase the focus on sustainability goals, environmentally friendly technologies and engage new stakeholders in the field of electrification and digitalization.

The Call for Expressions of Ideas document lists three expected outcomes:

Disruptive technologies for a hybrid electric regional aircraft.

Disruptive technologies for an ultra‑efficient short and medium-range aircraft (SMR).

Disruptive technologies to enable hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The first two will be achieved through two pivotal aircraft demonstration programs which will enable the integration of technologies and provide a clear validation of the aircraft environmental impact achievable by 2030.

Source | June 22, 2020 press release by Clean Sky 2

Note that Clean Sky 2 published its report, “Hydrogen-powered aviation” in June 2020, noting: “Novel and disruptive aircraft, aero-engine and systems innovations in combination with hydrogen technologies can help to reduce the global warming effect of flying by 50 to 90%.”

See a replay of the associated Clean Sky 2 webinar.

The European Commission is particularly interested in receiving ideas that exploit synergies with sectors outside of traditional aviation, such as experts in full and/or hybrid-electric power plants, hydrogen propulsion, etc. Decades of experience in highly safety-critical applications of hydrogen technologies in other sectors can serve as an important stepping-stone for aviation.

The Call for Expressions of Ideas document also states that the proposed Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking should focus on the most promising pathways and technologies that are able to foster the introduction of new products and deliver impact by 2030.

Eligible applications will be submitted by a consortium of at least three legal entities (large industry, SME, research organization, academia, etc.) or by clusters (applying as single legal entity) which are established in an EU Member State or Horizon 2020 Associate Country.

Applicants have until November 30, 2020 to submit their proposals and all documents can be found at https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/new-call-ideas-clean-aviation-partnerships-2020-aug-26_en

Further background from the EU call document is given below:

The task facing the aviation sector, in this and the next decades, is to develop and introduce safe, reliable and affordable low-to-zero emission air transport for citizens and to ensure Europe’s industrial leadership is maintained and strengthened throughout the relevant transition to climate-neutrality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the aviation industry, affecting passenger traffic, air cargo demand, airport workforce and incoming revenues. This crisis will have a lasting impact and the market will take years, perhaps a decade, to return to pre-crisis levels. The actual consequences for the sector will depend on the duration and magnitude of the outbreak and containment measures, the degree of consumer confidence for air travel and economic conditions, etc.

Horizon Europe, the EU’s future research and innovation (R&I) framework program for 2021-2027, will include R&I activities to support civil aviation. A relevant part of these R&I activities may take place in the potential European Partnership for Clean Aviation proposed for Horizon Europe. The main aim of the proposed Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking will be to contribute to the reduction of aviation’s ecological footprint by accelerating the development of climate-neutral aviation technologies. These technologies should be deployed as soon as possible, to allow for a significant contribution to the achievement of the EGD objective of no net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, whilst ensuring high levels of safety, and maintaining the competitiveness of Europe.

The Next Generation EU recovery plan agreed by the European Council on July 21, 2020 will provide a comprehensive framework of financial support to the Member States to recover from the crisis while stimulating key investments to meet the EGD objectives and the 2050 climate neutrality goals.

Horizon Europe (HE) will be reinforced with €5 billion to fund vital research in health, resilience and the green and digital transitions. Part of this additional amount will contribute to the recovery plan by supporting the industrial sectors mainly affected by the crisis.","Source | © Raul Mellado Ortiz, Dreamstime.comThe European Commission opened a Call for Expressions of Ideas/Potential Members (CEI) on August 26, 2020 that is open to interested technology stakeholders with transformative ideas or concepts in the field of clean aviation contributing to the European Green Deal (EGD) goals.

The events of 2020 are something few would have predicted. Many brands have had to entirely rethink their marketing strategies to adapt to these new circumstances. Fuelled by lockdowns and greater digital consumer consumption, ecommerce is skyrocketing, creating unprecedented opportunities for digital marketers. An April Kantar survey on ecommerce behaviours indicated that the share of consumers making more than half of their purchases online increased by 25% to 80%, depending on country.

These shifts in consumer behaviour, coupled with increasing digital spend, make partner marketing one of the highest-potential marketing channels going forward. According to a 2019 Performance Marketing Association study affiliate partnerships drive a return of 12 times the advertising investment. Many other studies show that partner and affiliate marketing are the highest performers on return on advertising spend.

Partnership also offers advantages in an environment in which paid digital media is being consolidated to a few big players. Today’s online consumers have greater control and access to many forms of advertising, some of which are incredibly costly to brands. Partner marketing, however, delivers consistency and scalability. This is particularly important when a brand must strive for a ubiquitous media presence despite limited marketing dollars.

The flexibility afforded by the channel and diverse array of partner possibilities is endless, and a growing number of brands across all industries from telecom to high fashion are quickly realising its potential. We’re seeing large brands utilising performance-model partnerships as a means both to strengthen brand equity and to drive more purchases.

Partnership offers advantages in an environment in which paid digital media is being consolidated to a few big players.

Performance partnerships with content publishers are a great example here. They can help attract many new buyers at the top of the funnel, with content and messaging that are often less price-orientated. Partnership programs with content publishers can take many forms, from performance-based advertising to deep integrations of messaging and technology. Content partners can also provide a unique opportunity to support backlinks that improve search rankings.

Further, we have seen many brands moving their influencer programs to a performance model. With social media usage increasing exponentially, it is vital that brands harness the equity these advocates afford. While the traditional model for compensating influencers was pay-for-activity, a growing number of influencers are pleased to participate in programmes where their compensation is driven by the sales and conversions that they drive.

An evolving channel

New methods of measurement are critical here – you need technology that can track these sales impacts. Fortunately, partner management technologies can provide the needed connections here.

Partner marketing also offers the opportunity for performance-based alliances between brands. Ultimately these brand alliance partnerships allow you to leverage the creativity of two teams to inspire and persuade prospects, add customers to your database, increase customer acquisition and can help you gain customer allegiance through the transfer of loyalty. Again, these can come in many forms, and the ultimate design of such programs is limited only by your own imagination.

The partner channel continues to evolve and expand as brands recognise its full potential, and as would-be partners recognise the tremendous revenue potential in pay-for-performance. Managing your partnerships through purpose-built technology can open a lot of doors. It often makes it easier to find new partners and partner types, provides access to a much wider variety of tools and capabilities, delivers more actionable data, and empowers greater control of customer experience.

Further, developments in AI technologies are allowing brands to pick the partners which will deliver optimal results, and make decisions to optimise campaigns on the predictive insights this technology delivers. Additionally, brand protection technology can provide the assurance that brand experiences delivered by partners are brand safe and compliant.

Collectively these all add up to increased scale, more diversified revenue streams and brand safety assurance. Beyond its most obvious characteristics, partner marketing can also help meet other marketing goals and objectives. The challenges we face in 2020 actually present a great opportunity to broaden your use of partnership and make it a central component of your marketing endeavors.

Former DHS Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection Caitlin Durkovich, an HSToday contributing editor, and former DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism Policy Thomas Warrick argued that dismantling DHS is not the solution, but “today’s challenges demand more DHS leadership attention and resources, even as the department needs to meet all its other current missions.”

Warrick, director of the center’s Future of DHS Project, and Durkovich, the project’s co-director, crafted their findings and recommendations with input from a senior advisory board composed of former secretaries and acting secretaries of DHS and a distinguished bipartisan study group of more than 100 homeland and national security experts.

As of the beginning of this month, 17 senior DHS officials were serving in an acting capacity and the department has come in last place in federal employee morale surveys among large cabinet departments every year since 2010, they noted.

“What DHS does, or should be doing, is vital to the security and safety of Americans and to national security broadly,” Warrick and Durkovich wrote. “DHS is the third-largest cabinet department with more than 240,000 employees and an annual budget of $62 billion. Scattering DHS’s functions among other cabinet departments would not make those missions and capabilities go away.”

First, they wrote, the department needs to look at what’s happening with the COVID-19 pandemic — on track to kill 25 times the number of people killed on 9/11 in the last five months of this year — and see that disease threats have “not yet received the leadership attention and resources” deserved, and as a result “the American people are paying a terrible price.”

DHS also needs to see that’s it “best suited” to defend again mounting threats from “foreign nation-states — specifically Russia, China, and Iran — executing a strategy to weaken the United States by targeting American democracy itself.” Warrick and Durkovich said it’s critical that “for the defense of American democracy to succeed, the secretary of homeland security and DHS generally will need to be, to the greatest extent possible, ‘above politics.'”

“The United States currently has no effective, comprehensive defense against this new style of non-kinetic warfare,” they noted, stressing that to effectively combat the threat “DHS will need more people and resources, and support from other parts of the U.S. government.”

And the department will have to prepare for the changing terrorist threat. “Today, terrorist threats to the United States have changed from what they were immediately after 9/11—and have further evolved from what they were as recently as 2016. The international terrorist threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Qaeda has not gone away, and DHS needs to use the next two to three years to get ready for what is coming next,” Warrick and Durkovich wrote. “…Domestic terrorism by white supremacists and other ‘homegrown’ causes also needs more DHS attention and resources.”

The report’s recommendations include maintaining resources on existing missions and adding resources for the above priorities — “if DOD’s bumper-sticker version of its mission is ‘We fight and win America’s wars,’ DHS needs to think of its mission as ‘We lead the defense of the Nation against non-military threats'” — along with improving communications and public engagement and investing “urgently in considerably wider access to classified voice and data networks used throughout the national security community.”

On COVID-19, DHS “urgently needs to devote significantly greater leadership focus and resources to efforts” against the pandemic, ensure medical stockpiles are quickly rebuilt, and “be more proactive in sounding the national alarm in future pandemics to ensure the federal government is fully mobilized.”

Warrick and Durkovich emphasized that “protecting American democracy and building a resilient homeland is a shared endeavor with many stakeholders,” and “DHS should not be viewed at the top of a pyramid directing downwards — if anything, the ‘pyramid’ is inverted with DHS often in a supporting role or called upon to assist when partner resources are overwhelmed and they ask for federal assistance.”

To modernize these essential public-private partnerships, the former DHS leaders recommended:

“Task the Office of Partnership and Engagement with developing a comprehensive engagement strategy to increase trust and harmonize engagement with key private sector partners and make better use of convening authorities.

DHS should inventory its information-sharing relationships and adjust its practices according to the different levels and capabilities of state, local, tribal, territorial and private sector stakeholders.

DHS should devolve operational-support decisions to the local level to strengthen trust with SLTT partners—and have DHS’s local representatives communicate to headquarters what they are hearing.

DHS should designate ‘systemically important critical infrastructure’ and DHS’s support should be comparable to what DOD provides to the companies in the defense industrial complex.

DHS should ensure threats against systemically important critical infrastructure are a priority across the Intelligence Community.”

Warrick and Durkovich said that “addressing the workplace issues that drive DHS’s low morale needs to be one of DHS’s top priorities.”

“A lack of common DHS culture and other challenges related to organizational culture and different degrees of employee engagement are holding DHS back as a department from moving toward a culture of innovation, collaboration, and empowerment,” they wrote. “DHS employees are focused on their component’s goals and appear not to know or understand departmental strategies or goals, nor how their individual work contributes to the larger DHS mission.”

Turning around DHS’s morale problems starts with TSA and CBP, the two components most responsible for the department’s low scores, they argued. “DHS has some remarkable success stories in turning around employee morale that need to be recognized, understood, and, where possible, replicated,” highlighting Under Secretary Francis Taylor’s 2014 reorganization of Intelligence and Analysis, the Secret Service rebound from its 2012 prostitution scandal, and ICE’s morale surge under Director Sarah Saldaña.

Recommendations to improve morale include:

“DHS’s headquarters and component leaders need to recognize that morale at DHS can be improved by sustained focus and attention on the underlying workforce issues that drive the department’s low morale.

DHS needs to move to a ‘culture of cultures’ approach, celebrating the unique aspects of each component, while providing a unifying cultural overlay around a mission that most of its employees can embrace.

Public trust and support for DHS’s mission is vitally important.

DHS should considerably increase two-way communications with its employees. DHS leadership needs to listen more to what employees are saying. DHS should brief national and departmental strategies to all employees so they know how their work contributes to such strategies.

DHS should make better use of the FEVS surveys as a management tool.

DHS should create a career path for entry-level personnel, especially from TSA, to get preference for hiring into other DHS jobs with better long-term career prospects.”

“If TSA’s morale can be raised by fifteen to eighteen points, that alone would be enough to raise DHS out of last place in federal workforce morale,” Warrick and Durkovich wrote, stressing that the agency can hike morale “by urgently addressing issues of pay, promotions and career advancement, and employee empowerment.”

Customs and Border Protection, however, “presents a totally different picture — CBP needs to address problems relating to trust, how it deals with poor performers, and promotions.”

The report concluded that “DHS will never achieve its potential as a cabinet department until it addresses its headquarters-component problems.”

Warrick and Durkovich said the department should bring together policy and budget officials more often, have better communication with components, and rotate component personnel into headquarters so they gain experience.

“DHS should make no major reorganizational changes in the next year because the resulting disruption will take focus away from DHS’s more urgent mission and management challenges,” they wrote, adding that the department should have an “S3” deputy secretary-level official just below the current deputy secretary in rank to coordinate DHS’s law enforcement components. Additionally, “DHS should immediately return policy officials working biological, chemical, and nuclear threat issues to PLCY to support DHS’s urgent and ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.”

“The COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term threat to US infrastructure from climate and weather changes, and the increasing non-kinetic actions by nation-state adversaries in 2020 that seek to undermine U.S. power all point to the need for the United States to make another fundamental change in how the U.S. government defends the nation and keeps the American people safe,” Warrick and Durkovich wrote. “The best solution available is to refocus the Department of Homeland Security and to fix DHS’s internal problems so it can lead the defense of the nation against nonmilitary threats.”

For decades, no matter the industry, people of colour have suffered through a lack of opportunity and a lack of respect, leaving them stuck playing second fiddle throughout their careers.

The games industry is no different, and here at PocketGamer.biz we wanted to do our part and help bring attention to the many incredible people of colour that help make up this sector. That is why we are committing to a new long-term regular feature to spotlight these people and their careers.

So, welcome to our new 'POC in Mobile' series, where discussion about finding a place in the games industry, the various challenges faced as a minority, and what truly needs to be done to make games more diverse will be the focal points of conversations.

This week, we spoke with Facebook global director of games partnership Leo Olebe regarding his more than two decades in the industry and why it's on everyone, not just job recruiters, to seek diversity.

PocketGamer.biz: Can you start off by telling us about your role in mobile games and what it entails?

Leo Olebe: I got started in the games industry a little over 20 years ago. My first job was on the marketing side at Disney Interactive. In fact, the first game I ever shipped was on a handheld - Peter Pan: Return to Neverland on the Gameboy Advance.

The magic of bringing an idea to reality and sharing it with as many people as possible is unmatched Leo Olebe

Over the past two decades, I've shipped numerous mobile and handheld games from companies like Disney, Kabam, and Zynga, most often playing a marketing/brand management role.

Since coming to Facebook in 2015, I've been in a general business role leading a team dedicated to helping game developers, publishers and creators to be successful - whether on the Facebook platform or through using Facebook tools like Connect, Sharing, etcetera.

In 2017, I was part of the team that created and launched Facebook Instant Games. To date, there have been thousands of mobile games launched on the Instant Games platform, hundreds of millions of players, and billions of game sessions.

Why did you want to work in the mobile games industry?

I'm drawn to gaming because of the unlimited potential for awesome. It's an industry with the opportunity to reach billions of people around the world. The magic of bringing an idea to reality and sharing it with as many people as possible is unmatched.

How would you recommend people get started in games? Any tools or literature you would advise?

The first step is to play games - as many as possible. If you haven't already, try to understand why people fall in love with games. Understand your own passion for games and how you can combine that passion with your professional interests - from writing to coding to marketing and everything in between.

Peter Pan: Return to Neverland was the first game Olebe shipped back in 2002

To get started, try talking to people who already work in games. Find where opportunities lie, and be willing to learn. Learning is the most important thing you can do, regardless of the role you are interested in.

What did you study (if anything) for your role? Are there any courses out there that you would advise for aspiring professionals?

I have an MBA in marketing and strategy and undergraduate degrees in politics and public policy. Every bit of my education has been valuable in building a career.

Gaming touches everything you can think of and the more knowledge you have the better. There isn't any one course to take or curriculum to follow. Find your passion and deeply engage. Learn everything you can and bring your full, authentic self to work.

What do you think should be done to improve diversity, not only across the games industry, but across all industries?

The games industry in particular, and most industries in general need to make a serious commitment to bringing in diverse talent, telling diverse stories, and putting diverse product thinking into the foundation of anything that is created. This takes real commitment, not just platitudes and promises.

Mobile games is an excellent example of using data to measure success. I would implore all industries to set specific and measurable goals and then hold each other accountable.

The biggest challenge I have faced in games is that much of the time I'm the only person who looks like me in the room Leo Olebe

For example at Facebook, our company is working toward some ambitious goals. Last year, we set the goal of '50 in five' which means that by 2024, at least 50 per cent of our workforce will be underrepresented people. When we announced this goal last year, people from underrepresented groups accounted for 43 per cent of our staff. Today, that number is up to 45.3 per cent.

In doing this, we aim to double the number of women employees globally and double the number of Black and Hispanic employees in the US. And this year we made an additional commitment: to increase the representation of people of colour in leadership positions in the US by 30 per cent, including a 30 per cent increase in the representation of Black people in leadership by 2025.

What are the biggest challenges you have encountered since joining the industry?

The biggest challenge I have faced in games is that much of the time I'm the only person who looks like me in the room. I ask myself, is my voice being heard and do I have the courage to speak up?

What do you think can be done to help encourage more people of colour to get into games?

We need to get out there and expose more people of colour to the fact that the games industry can be a place for them too. We need to create games and experiences that reflect a more diverse population and set of experiences. We need to specifically hire people of colour and make sure that they have every opportunity to shine and thrive.

Is there anything that recruiters should be doing differently to address the lack of diversity across the gaming industry?

It's like the old saying: 'you have to fish where the fish are'. That means go to black neighbourhoods, schools, and historically Black universities. Go to professional organisations like National Black MBA or National Society of Hispanic MBAs.

I would add that the games industry should adopt the diverse slate approach to hiring. It's everyone's job to find great and diverse talent - not just a recruiter's job, and certainly not just the job of the diverse employees you already do have.

What changes (if any) have you seen from across the industry to address the issue?

I've really enjoyed watching the games industry rally around diverse voices - speaking out about the kinds of communities we want to create - communities that are diverse, inclusive and welcoming to all people. We partnered with The Game Awards to create Global Gaming Citizens - a recognition of people using the power of games to create positive change in their communities.

There are amazing programs like Gameheads or The Hidden Genius project that are focused on diverse youth and teaching them about games. Facebook also has a great program to showcase 'Women in Gaming' and bring more women into the space. Microsoft has also taken a great leadership role in advocating for the value of diverse communities and holding the industry accountable for change.

What advice do you have for other people of colour that are looking at getting into games?

Learn as much as you can and always strive for greatness. Don't let the fact that there aren't a lot of folks that look like us get in your way. Reach out to local developers and publishers and find out what roles are available and then relentlessly engage. Be the change you want to see. Support each other.","PocketGamer.biz: Can you start off by telling us about your role in mobile games and what it entails?

The early indicators for Hibernian have been positive with regards to a potential partnership between Christian Doidge and new striker Kevin Nisbet, with the latter netting a hat-trick in Saturday’s 4-1 away win over Livingston.

He could hardly have hoped for a better start to life at his new club.

Strike partnerships are something of a rarity in the modern game, but there’s a certain charm to the relationship between two centre forwards working together.

So with that in mind, here are five of the best strike partnerships ever witnessed in Scottish football.

Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton (Celtic)

For many, this is the greatest strike partnership the Scottish game has ever seen, at least in the modern age. Celtic wrestled control of Scottish football away from Rangers at the start of the millennium and the goals of Larsson and Sutton helped them do this, with the pair almost unstoppable for a number of seasons.

Their best season as a duo came in the Treble-winning campaign of 2000/01, with Larsson netting an astonishing 53 goals in all competitions. Sutton contributed 14 goals himself, but the Englishman’s greatest quality was in the way he created space and set up chances for his Swedish partner in front of goal.

Garry O’Connor and Derek Riordan (Hibernian)

There was a time when Hibernian arguably boasted the best young team in Scottish football and O’Connor and Riordan were at the vanguard of that generation. Riordan scored 64 goals in 146 appearances in all competitions for the Easter Road outfit, earning himself a move to Celtic which seemed befitting of his promise at the time.

O’Connor was a different sort of frontman, using his physicality to create openings, but he too was regarded as one of Scotland’s best young talents, heading to Lokomotiv Moscow and then Birmingham City. O’Connor and Riordan’s careers didn’t pan out as many expected they would, but their partnership at Hibs is still one of the best Scottish football has ever seen.

Mark Hately and Ally McCoist (Rangers)

This was a classic strike partnership with a penalty box poacher playing off a target man. Hately and McCoist were perfect for each other, with the rough-and-tumble style of the former complimenting the finishing instincts of the latter for a number of highly successful seasons at Rangers.

Hately and McCoist were key figures for the Ibrox side during the ‘nine-in-a-row’ years, winning six league titles, two Scottish Cups and three League Cups together. The two players went on to become Rangers icons, giving the Govan side real presence and quality in the final third of the pitch.

Eric Black and Mark McGhee (Aberdeen)

Aberdeen were the last team to break Celtic and Rangers’ stranglehold on Scottish football and they did so in no small part due to the partnership of Black and McGhee in attack. The former was the one who offered guile and elegance in front of goal, while the latter was all about the strength and power he brought to the football pitch.

With Black and McGhee in attack, Aberdeen won a league title, three Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winners’ Cup and the European Super Cup in what was easily the most successful period in the Pittodrie club’s history. These were the glory days for the Dons and their front two were as integral to them as anyone else.

Davie Dodds and Paul Sturrock (Dundee United)

Before Aberdeen broke Celtic and Rangers’ stranglehold on Scottish football, Dundee United did it and the partnership between Dodds and Sturrock was key to this period of glittering success for the Tannadice club. They were the quintessential big man-little man pairing, spending 12 years playing together for the Tangerines.

Dundee United won the Scottish league title with Dodds and Sturrock leading the line, with the pair scoring a combined tally of 211 as the Tayside club made themselves a real force, both domestically and in Europe, over the early part of the 1980s. They earned their place in Scottish football folklore.","Join your fellow Hibees and subscribe to the Hibs FC newsletter now Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

(Bloomberg) -- Robert Fritzshall had to be pushing 80, Bethany McLean thought, so she was a little surprised to hear him talk about expanding his law practice.His office was a bit dusty and cluttered with papers. There were files on the floor. She was concerned that he didn’t see the need to carry malpractice insurance. But she doesn’t remember anything being a red flag.“He was charismatic, enthusiastic,” she said. “A little eccentric.”Besides, she needed the job.The global financial crisis hadn’t eased up. Despite graduating near the top of her class and serving on the law review, she’d been biding her time at a Chicago-area WhirlyBall, booking children’s birthday parties.And he needed some help. Fritzshall & Associates comprised only Fritzshall, a legal intern, and his legal secretary, after the previous associate departed suddenly.McLean was thrilled when he extended her an offer, even if it was part time. When he agreed to get malpractice insurance, she accepted.It looked like her break.But within weeks, McLean would realize that Fritzshall was no longer capable of managing his practice. His cases were in disarray. Expanding was a fantasy. She recognized the signs of dementia from her grandmother’s decline.The experience would be the most harrowing and painful of her career. But it’s one that’s becoming a growing challenge confronting a profession in which many are working into their 70s and 80s.Over the last ten years, the number of lawyers practicing over the age of 65 has increased more than 50%. In 2020, roughly 14% of American lawyers were over 65, compared to 7% of workers generally. Meanwhile, more than one in nine people over 65 are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, the most common type of dementia. The risk increases dramatically with age.Recent, comprehensive data on how often disciplinary bodies and lawyer assistance programs confront the issue is non-existent, and there’s no way of knowing how often colleagues intervene without assistance from a professional organization.But Diana Uchiyama, executive director of the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program, says she’s seen a significant increase in outreach related to cognitive decline in the last year. She’s had at least two such calls in recent months as lawyers emerge from a year of pandemic-induced isolation.Lawyers who are relatively high functioning in early stages of dementia are often in denial about the need to step down, said Alex Yufik, a forensic psychologist who has worked on such cases. They’re adept at hiding it, tapping their intellectual reservoirs to redirect conversations when they’re confused or unable to answer questions, he said.Lawyers and other professionals often develop “routines, practices, conversational and social skills over many years, which are reinforced and rehearsed over a career to the point where they can function almost automatically,” said Kendra Basner, a partner at O’Rielly & Roche LLP who counsels clients on legal ethics.Colleagues are generally ill-equipped to distinguish between signs of of normal aging and something more. And the decision to intervene can be a heartbreaking and even risky one, especially if the aging lawyer is a friend, mentor, boss, or someone powerful in the profession.Getting involved in a case of substance abuse or mental health problems can mean saving someone’s career. In the case of progressive dementia, intervening almost always means ending one.“Even when the issue is right in front of their faces, many find excuses to avoid having the uncomfortable conversations and making the hard decisions,” Basner said.Tish Vincent, chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, said it’s partly a cultural issue of lawyers tending to think they’re invincible.Lawyers “need to stop encouraging denial,” said Vincent, who is both an attorney and a clinical social worker.Spotting the IssueFrederick Emery Jr., an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Maine, was within a year of retirement when his colleagues started to notice something wrong.When they elevated their concerns to agency officials, they were told that “if there were no appreciable performance issues,” they should just “monitor the situation as the AUSA progressed toward retirement,” according to a 2015 ruling by a U.S. district court in Maine.Much of Emery’s case load was transferred to another attorney within a few months. But it was already too late.He had botched an IRS dispute with a bankrupt taxpayer because of dementia, the government said in an appeal asking the district court to set aside Emery’s loss. The underlying case involved more than $500,000 in tax liabilities.The government eventually confirmed that Emery had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, coupled with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Three physicians agreed that the onset was prior to the summary judgment proceedings, the court said.But it still declined to undo the bankruptcy court’s summary judgment order discharging the debt. The government’s argument about Emery’s mental decline came too late. The IRS ultimately abandoned its efforts to challenge the bankruptcy court’s ruling.Emery had been “a responsible and highly respected member of the bar and the bankruptcy court for many years,” the court said.Cognitive ReservesForensic psychologist Yufik handled a case involving an 85-year-old attorney, whom he said he couldn’t identify for confidentiality reasons, when he worked at the Elder Abuse Forensic Center in Los Angeles.An auditor reviewing financial documents noticed signs of neglect in an estate the lawyer was managing. The lawyer’s daughter also called the center, saying her father was bouncing checks and falling behind on monthly bills. She was worried that her father might be the victim of financial abuse.She was right: Yufik said he soon discovered that two former clients had persuaded him to sign documents handing over control of his finances. When his daughter presented the documents to her father, he told her he didn’t recognize them.The lawyer could chit chat with strangers and recite poetry—which in his younger days, he composed—and was able to dress himself appropriately and prepare meals. But his bedroom was in “complete disarray,” Yufik said. There was uneaten food accumulating, and dirty laundry strewn about. It smelled of urine.Although the lawyer could explain basic legal concepts and understood things like his obligation to pay taxes and the importance of health insurance, he was unsure of where his money was held, how much income he was earning, or whether his bills were being paid. The cognitive decline rendered him an easy target, Yufik said.RoutinesRobert Fritzshall would put on a suit every day and take the train to downtown Chicago like he had for years.He was a creature of habit, lunching at the same restaurants over and over. He would regale McLean, his new associate, with old stories and introduce her to acquaintances around town.Part of the self-denial common to lawyers in the early stages of dementia has to do with how closely their identities are hewed to their careers and professional status. “It’s where they have found success, it’s where their friends are, it’s where they are comfortable,” Basner said.One’s identity as a lawyer is “so intertwined with their sense of self,” Vincent said, they will cling to their professional identities “until their dying breath.”Fritzshall had been a respected member of the Chicago area’s legal community—the prosecuting attorney for the Village of Skokie for 13 years, an arbitrator for 12 years, and president for a time of the North Suburban Bar Association. He also served on Skokie’s Village Board of Trustees, Planning Commission, and the theater board for the Performing Arts Center.But that had all been before McLean met Fritzshall.SidewaysPersonal injury and workers’ compensation cases were the bread and butter of Fritzshall’s practice when McLean joined in July 2010. She was unfamiliar with those areas of law, but didn’t have to study his files for very long to realize something was wrong.He was missing irretrievable deadlines and failing to tell clients about significant developments. He didn’t know several cases had been dismissed for failure to prosecute.In one instance, after he accepted a settlement and opposing counsel filed an affidavit indicating that the parties had reached agreement, Fritzshall denied it.McLean said she found opposing counsel were often frustrated and seemed to think he was playing games with them.Before long, she discovered that about half a dozen attorneys had preceded her at Fritzshall & Associates and quickly left, some within weeks.When she raised her concerns, Fritzshall was aloof.McLean reached out to the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program. Although there were plenty of resources and protocols for lawyers struggling with substance abuse or mental health disorders, she found the state bar at the time seemed to lack any systematic approach for dealing with Alzheimer’s or age-related dementia.“It would have been easier if he had been a drug addict,” she said.Ethical ResponsibilitiesA lawyer’s duty to report or otherwise intervene when another lawyer is impaired varies by state. At least a dozen states have ethics opinions on the topic, applicable whether the impairment is due to substance abuse, mental health issues, or age-related decline, and the American Bar Association has issued its own guidance. Case law may also come into play, depending on the jurisdiction.The ABA’s Model Rules provide at least a rough proxy for most jurisdictions.Among other things, rules may require lawyers to report misconduct that calls fitness or truthworthiness into question. They also demand that supervising attorneys take reasonable steps to ensure subordinate attorneys comply with ethical rules, while prohibiting blind reliance on a supervising attorney’s direction.Most states have adopted some version of the relevant rules. But there are notable exceptions. California, for example, has rejected the mandatory misconduct reporting requirement, which the state’s bar journal once referred to as the “snitch” rule.Even if not required, larger law firms often have protocols in place, including internal reporting systems and monitoring when necessary. But for lawyers working alone or who only have subordinates, it’s a lot less likely there will be anyone able to intervene informally, if at all, before serious issues arise.The Last ResortMcLean eventually gave up on the lawyers’ assistance program and started calling the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission’s ethics hotline. But she hit a dead end there, too.She knew filing a formal complaint would likely end Fritzshall’s career, and wondered what the consequences would be for her own future. But his clients were real people, and she said she couldn’t just abandon them.Less than three months after she was hired, McLean mustered the courage to tell Fritzshall she intended to resign and report him to the disciplinary commission.“I figured, if going to the ARDC would do me in, this wasn’t the career for me,” she said.She had him on speaker phone, with his intern at her side. The intern had been working for him for about a year and adored him, McLean said. At her fingertips was a list of his active cases—at least 20—detailing the errors she’d identified, along with approaching deadlines.She told him she was confident that the ARDC would know whether her concerns were warranted.“He turned on me,” she said.DenialIn his formal response denying the allegations, Fritzshall stated, in essence, that McLean was inexperienced and simply didn’t know what she was talking about.She remembers reading it and feeling disheartened, like it had all been “a stressful waste of time.”The ARDC administrator filed a petition against Fritzshall alleging incapacity in August 2011. Fritzshall was initially responsive, but after he stopped appearing at conferences or otherwise complying with the investigation, the allegations were eventually deemed admitted.McLean didn’t hear from the ARDC again until they called to ask her to testify at his hearing in June 2012. By then, Fritzshall had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s-type dementia, according to a letter from his physician that’s referenced in the hearing board’s report.More issues had surfaced. Another associate quit after three weeks when Fritzshall couldn’t afford to pay her. He’d stopped paying rent on his office space. He’d overdrawn his trust fund account multiple times. He’d even bounced a check for $31.71 to a court clerk.His wife had been encouraging him to retire, to no avail, according to testimony at the hearing.When McLean testified before the hearing board, she remembers one member asked something to the effect of, “You left the clients? You just quit?”I called you first, she said.HindsightIn hindsight, there were perhaps earlier signs of Fritzshall’s cognitive decline.In 2005, he’d been suspended for six months, stayed by probation after one month. He’d mismanaged client funds, failed to pay medical lienholders in a timely manner, and misrepresented to an administrative law judge that he had authority to settle a matter when he didn’t, according to the disciplinary findings.Fritzshall told the hearing board that he didn’t remember making the misrepresentation, but admitted he lacked his client’s authorization at the time.Although the misrepresentation was ultimately found to be dishonest, he wasn’t found to have engaged in any fraud or deceit. His trust account had never gone negative, and he’d never written a bad check. Although there were a handful of significant delays in paying lienholders retained for client cases, they all ultimately received the money they were owed.No clients complained or testified against him. The client whose case he’d settled without permission ultimately accepted the same amount of money. When her bankruptcy estate paid him about $16,600 in fees, he cut her a check for about $10,700. He told the hearing board he just wanted her to have it.His mismanagement of client funds was attributed to bad bookkeeping.The review board cited numerous mitigating factors in issuing him a lighter penalty than the conduct otherwise warranted. It was Fritzshall’s first disciplinary action in his 50 years of practicing law. He had already modified his bookkeeping practices and reduced his caseload.The commission also considered the implications of a lengthier suspension: Fritzshall had told them that at his age, he’d be unable to rebuild his practice if suspended for a year.His probation, which he completed successfully, was conditioned on implementing new trust account procedures.The Last ActIn May 2013, Fritzshall was finally placed on disability inactive status. He died in hospice care in October 2015. He was 86.While the hearing board report and Illinois Supreme Court order adopting the board’s recommendations are public, the underlying record of Fritzshall’s proceeding is sealed. The ARDC, citing confidentiality rules, said it couldn’t comment.By the time of the hearing, Fritzshall—with the help of his wife, who was by then his power of attorney—had sold his practice and moved to Wisconsin.The lawyer who purchased his practice had spoken to him after taking over. She told the board that sometimes he was still “very lucid and at other times not.”Two weeks before Fritzshall’s hearing, the Illinois Supreme Court had modified its rules “to allow lawyers facing minor misconduct charges to petition the Court for permanent retirement status.”The change was made “in response to the challenges presented by an increasing population of aging lawyers” in order to provide “a reasonable and dignified option for senior lawyers who should retire from the practice of law while preserving their dignity and hard-earned reputations,” according to the ARDC’s 2012 annual report.But given the seriousness of the ultimately uncontested allegations against Fritzshall, it’s unclear whether he would have been able to take advantage of the new rule even if he had petitioned for permanent retirement status.‘A Preventable Mess’Bud Rubenstein, now 93, knew Fritzshall for most of their lives. Their fathers were law partners. When they joined the military, they were stationed together in Japan for almost a year. They sold shoes together and even attended the same law school, the University of Illinois at Chicago.Rubenstein said he had no idea that Fritzshall had been living with dementia. Fritzshall visited after Rubenstein moved to Arizona, but he doesn’t think they talked much after 2000.“It’s a terrible thing to practice when you have that disease,” he said, “but you’re not sure when you’re in it.”Rubenstein said he voluntarily retired his own license in 2012.Steven Fritzshall, Robert’s son, still practices law near the same courthouse where his father spent so many years advocating for his clients. Steven didn’t know how his father’s career ended until Bloomberg Law contacted him. He said he was shocked. They had been estranged since 1990, he said.Steven recalled seeing his father on a crowded street near the courthouse once, long after they had stopped talking. Robert didn’t say hello.“He walked right past me,” Steven said. He wondered aloud if his father recognized him.“The whole thing is sad,” he said.“We have an obligation to represent clients to the best of our human ability and with a competent state of mind,” he said. “There’s no excuse, zero tolerance—these are innocent people.”Steven said he hoped his father would have said the same thing.McLean still practices law, as an assistant public defender in Kane County, Ill., just west of Chicago.As frustrating as it was at the time, McLean said she’s not bitter about the ordeal. Ultimately, the ARDC pursued the matter, and she recognizes now that there had to be due process, which takes time. She said she just wishes there had been better resources and another way to intervene quickly.She said she feels badly when she thinks about the impact on Fritzshall’s legacy.“He had this whole career, and I was seeing it in its final throes,” McLean said. “It seemed like a preventable mess.”To contact the reporter on this story: Holly Barker in Washington at hbarker@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bernie Kohn at bkohn@bloomberglaw.com; Jay-Anne B.

“As in all periods of uncertainty, there is also opportunity to consider for personal and professional development. In difficult economic times, MBA applications generally rise as candidates seek to enhance their employability. The need now is for what I call versatility and it’s a vital attribute. This is where the MBA comes in because it provides students with a unique big picture overview and insights into all the key functions of business, from operations to HR. These are then brought together through an over-arching strategy course.”

Firas Eid Firas Eid, founder and CEO of Analytics and an Alliance MBS alumnus.

“Leadership in a crisis demands a high degree of soft skills – a more reflective approach that incorporates empathy and compassion. This emotional intelligence (EQ) focuses on people skills, and combined with business insight and acumen, are essential qualities for any leader. The Manchester Global part-time MBA places a greater emphasis on developing these personal and professional skills and qualities, alongside the harder technical skills and expertise expected from an MBA holder, to help create a more rounded business leader.”

Such ruminations became particularly popular by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency when the negotiations eventually found themselves in deadlock. However, I would rather call it a “freeze,” and while this may not be the best solution to the problem, it is certainly not the worst either.

The crisis over North Korea’s nuclear missile program has been going on for some 15 years, and I would argue that the reason why no practical solution has been found lies in poor positioning. As I have repeatedly noted [1] North Korea’s nuclear missile program is not the root of the problem that disrupts the traditional world order; rather, it is a consequence of problems that are more global in their dimensions, reflecting the transition from the wonted world order to a new one.

There are a few signs to this new world order. First, some nations abuse the right to decide which state is a democracy and which is not, with the contrived singling out of “rogue states” to be countered through any methods, including those that seem ethically unacceptable. Broken promises are no longer perfidy but military stratagems. When it comes to North Korea, one might recall the Agreed Framework story or how President Kim Young-sam and his administration spared no effort to destabilize the situation in North Korea at a time when it suffered from what has been called the Arduous March. Seoul advocated providing no aid to the starving country, one South Korean official admits while privately talking to the author, in the hope that the famine would spur mass riots and subsequent “reunification.”

The second sign indicative of the new world suggests that international law and major arbitration institutions have lost their authority. UN Security Council resolutions that forbid North Korea to launch any kind of ballistic missiles is a good case in point. Incidentally, this violates the decisions enshrined in a number of other UN documents that guarantee the universal right to explore outer space for peaceful purposes.

The third sign has to do with the crisis of competence, which affects the quality of decision-making on the part of both politicians and subject-matter experts, blurring the line between the real country and its cartoonish propaganda image. This is well illustrated by the case of North Korea: any foolish news report about the country ultimately finds an audience. While the story of Jang Song-thaek being fed to a pack of dogs was debunked fairly quickly, no less fantastic death penalty stories for listening to K-pop are still popular.

Besides, the might of the law has been replaced with the law of the might. The new generation of politicians no longer fears a major war, rendering military conflict—“humanitarian” bombings of “rogue states” in particular—one of the acceptable means for achieving domestic and foreign policy goals.

Finally, under these circumstances, North Korea cannot use the conventional conflict resolution methods, thus being compelled to look for ways to defend itself on its own, especially since the threat of losing sovereignty is by no means hypothetical. Officially, the Korean war is not over, and South Korea’s Constitution still extends the state’s sovereignty to the entire peninsula, demanding that the president promote the country’s unification. What is more, the National Security Act refers to North Korea as an anti-state organization rather than a country. Even relatively liberal populists, such as Roh Moo-hyun and Moon Jae-in, failed to review this concept.

Relying on its nuclear missile program, North Korea sets itself two goals. The first is to achieve minimal and, eventually, guaranteed nuclear deterrence, which would certainly take a belligerent solution to the North Korean problem off the table. The North Korean leadership has certain reasons to believe that only North Korea’s nuclear weapons saved it from the fate of Iraq or Libya. It is well-known that once in a while the U.S. and its allies plan an offensive war against the North, whose elements are drilled at joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises irrespective of their scale.

The second goal is to achieve international recognition and ditch the “rogue state” yoke. Should North Korea theoretically join the “nuclear club,” this will put it on a par with the leading superpowers. This is the principal reason why—despite the UN Security Council’s internal disagreements—the Permanent Five have so far voted unanimously for yet another sanctions package each time North Korea has taken another significant step in developing its nuclear missile program. The current world order is based on the premise that only the five great powers are allowed to possess nuclear weapons. It also relies on the UN’s authority, which would collapse if it became known that at the end of the day North Korea got the UN to “cave in”—following nearly 30 years of condemnation, resolutions and sanctions.

It is no accident that the very term “denuclearization” is under discussion. American conservatives, such as John Bolton and others who adopt a strictly realistic approach, interpret “denuclearization” as meaning nuclear disarmament of North Korea, which should be stripped of all types of WMD and—to boot—of its nuclear program. This entails eliminating the North Korean threat both globally and regionally. In contrast, North Korea, as well as Russia and China, stress that denuclearization should extend not to North Korea alone but to the whole Korean Peninsula, which requires certain commitments on the part of the U.S. and South Korea, up to and including prohibiting U.S. warships carrying nuclear weapons from docking at South Korean ports.

It has to be noted that those who identify with the allegedly liberal approach to international relations view the North Korean issue as highly ideologically charged. Liberal democracy advocates and WASP conservatives alike perceive North Korea as an authoritarian regime imbued with atheistic collectivism, as an “Evil State.” They see it as the pure opposite of the ideal state—an abstract concept that exists in their minds. That, in turn, stimulates an intractable drive towards confrontation, since not only is the “Evil State” incapable of negotiations, such negotiations are impossible in principle. Any deal with such a regime is an unacceptable concession in terms of values, and value-based confrontations are always more inflexible than those political or economic in nature.

During the 2017 crisis, when I believed the probability of conflict really rose beyond 50%, Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un emerged as pragmatic leaders, essentially putting the process “on hold.” The jury is still out on how this related to the Russia-China “double-freeze” plan, while each party would certainly have wanted more. Kim Jong Un would have loved to have the sanctions eased, with Donald Trump expecting further concessions. The pause that was achieved, though, allowed both parties a “small profit.” The U.S. president could say that, first, he prevented war and, second, that the sanctions were effective, with no missiles in the air and the U.S. having granted no unacceptable concessions. Kim Jong Un, on the one hand, got a peaceful breather, which allowed him to focus on the country’s economic development, and, second, his commitments were essentially unofficial and did not restrict the development of the nuclear missile program. This could be exemplified by multiple successful launches of short-range missiles as well as by presentations of new types of ICBMs and SLBMs, even though these were not tested.

Yet, since late 2019, both parties have been aware that “things are not going to get better.” In late 2019, Kim Jong Un said it was no use hoping for an easing of the sanctions, while allowing Donald Trump to “sit out” the final year of his presidency with no unnecessary tensions. As of the writing of this article, his moratorium is still in place, although American and South Korean experts believed that several dates came and went when Kim could have raised the stakes, opting for an escalation. I believe that Pyongyang is waiting for the White House to formulate and announce a new North Korean policy. So far, as Roman Lobov puts it, “the door is shut but not locked”; and Choe Song-hui, who seems to be still in charge of North Korea–U.S. relations, has not been dismissed from office and declares from time to time that the North will use force in response to force and amicability in response to amicability. The 8th Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea emphasized that no change in the White House would change the U.S.’s overall hostility towards North Korea, which is why North Korea will hardly make the first step, choosing to wait for truly serious proposals from the U.S.

This is the situation three months into 2021, exacerbated by several additional aspects. The new U.S. president is the first such aspect. Of course, there is some hope that he will follow the same path as Donald Trump once did: a hardliner early in his tenure shifted to a more constructive approach once collided with reality. So far, however, it appears that the logic of factional strife is compelling Biden to go along “the main thing is not to be like Trump” pattern, and that means steering a course towards escalation. Such an approach will provoke North Korea to retaliate. More importantly, such blinders will keep the Biden Administration from rapidly developing a constructive approach to its interaction with the North. In particular, we can see that human rights issues in North Korea, all too valid for the Democrats, were not broached regularly under Trump while they have come under attention once Biden assumed office.

The U.S.-China confrontation is another aspect, which was pronounced to be value- rather than merely politics-based even under Trump. There has been no change to this approach under the new president. The U.S. attempts to restrict and contain China, with this confrontation being part of Russia and China’s more broad confrontation with what is perceived as the West.

I believe such a rift and its would-be consequences deal no smaller blow to the existing world order than Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions. First, this reinforces North Korea’s conviction that the current situation makes the country rely on missile sovereignty. Second, rifts in the Security Council give North Korea a certain boost. It does not, however, mean that the Security Council will no longer remain unanimous should the North decide to raise the stakes sharply. Yet, if we consider the U.S.-China confrontation from the point of view of allies of both states, we will see that China could only rely on the North since it has for a long time stressed the two countries’ socialist nature and their friendship based on ideological values. Besides, North Korean media outlets have been condemning the U.S. for criticizing China’s policies. What this means is that China will keep Pyongyang afloat and contain American pressure to denuclearize Kim’s regime unless it decides that North Korea’s actions are too provocative. The same can be said of Russia, although the North Korean issue is less of a priority for Moscow, especially when compared to the post-Soviet states or the Middle East.

The coronavirus pandemic has also affected the global situation. First, self-isolation instituted throughout the country has generated a new spiral of suppositions revolving around the notion that its economic system is about to collapse and that a new Arduous March will ensue. Second, with diplomats and NGOs having left North Korea, gathering data has become more difficult, which has indirectly contributed to growing alarmist sentiments. Finally, we cannot rule out a situation when the North Korean issue may—for a number of countries—become a way to shift attention away from domestic problems, including those related to failures in fighting the coronavirus. In such a situation, any prospects for denuclearization are extremely vague.

The fourth aspect is the level to which North Korea’s nuclear program has advanced, which makes the monitoring methods used for the states that are at the early stages of their nuclear programs ineffective. Since North Korea is a de facto nuclear power, the set of measures intended to ensure complete, irreversible and verifiable denuclearization, as Vladimir Khrustalyov notes [3] will essentially demand that North Korea be essentially stripped of its sovereignty as far as the monitoring and checking powers are concerned, with which international inspectors should be vested.

Consequently, today it might be said that one can only go on talking about denuclearization for the sake of talking. It will take a miracle to move things forward. Option one is some fantastic change in the international environment, which would make North Korea no longer feel threatened and thus less reluctant to abolish its nuclear program. That would mean geotectonic rather than merely geopolitical shifts in the existing international security architecture. Option two, just as fantastic, provides for a North Korean Gorbachev who, for some reason, will make the decision to abolish an important component of North Korea’s political myth and its sovereignty guarantees. Harsher options envision denuclearization as a result of regime change, which is of very little probability as well.

Does this mean there is no way out of this predicament and that missile fireworks will follow sooner or later? No, it does not. The possibility of the “double freeze” is still there, and such a “freeze” could continue almost indefinitely. Another possibility requires more efforts as it entails resetting the agenda—while keeping the term “denuclearization”, new strategies would actually focus on arms control. Instead of destroying North Korean nuclear capabilities, efforts would be channeled into restricting it, operating on the premise that the existing capabilities already serve as minimal deterrence. Many scholars adhere to this stance, both in Russia [2] and abroad, while fully cognizant of the fact that a change in tack will prompt huge resistance, since this would go against the trend of preserving the global status quo. Any attempt to abolish the demand for full denuclearization of states aspiring to the nuclear club “membership” would amount to a crack in the nuclear non-proliferation regime.

On balance, true denuclearization of North Korea would require a radical change in the geopolitical situation in Northeast Asia: once the threat is gone, countermeasures will no longer be necessary. While there is no possibility of such changes, the Russia-China proposal of a “double freeze” settlement remains the most feasible solution, although far from ideal.

“We are proud that South Africa continues to play a key and active role within the African continent in advancing and contributing to the water agenda. Within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Africa is active in advancing the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approach, as well as working within the various SADC structures, which requires engagement with other sectors that have a bearing on what we do in the sector,” Mahlobo said.

Water and sanitation technology

The Deputy Minister expressed that increased innovations in technology present opportunities for water utilities to integrate smart technologies in existing infrastructure.

He also emphasised that the role of youth and women remains critical in building a capable water sector in Africa, thus strengthening water entrepreneurship among these groups.

“[Technology] will help to minimise costs, while maximising the selection of the most suitable solutions that can be easily adapted to local conditions, also assisting with adaptation.”

Mahlobo commended African scientists for taking a proactive stance in the fight against COVID-19 across the continent by sharing information, clinical testing and trying to find innovative ways to apply African knowledge to the pandemic.

“Countries should continue sharing best practices on innovative ideas and research in order to strengthen the coordinated response to global disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19,” he said.

The audience composition is generally around 60 percent entrepreneurs, 20 percent students, 10 percent academics, 10 percent investors, and 10 percent of professionals from legal and support functions.

“Our response was swift and incisive, given our understanding of the pain points of startups, as well as the collective experience of our leadership,” she says. This helped scope out the impact of the downturn and the imperative actions for entrepreneurs to take.

At a time when lives and livelihoods were challenged, helping entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty was a priority. In March, a partnership was formed with the government’s Startup India initiative, and TiE Delhi-NCR became the startup advisors for its National Business Immunity Platform.

The chapter brought elements of resilience to TiE’s core tenets of mentoring, networking, education, funding, and incubation. A one-on-one Online Mentoring Helpline was provided to give founders expert guidance; over 90 individual mentoring sessions have already been held, according to Geetika.

The TiE Gold high-impact mentoring programme was launched online to accelerate companies to growth-stage. A cohort of select startups received in-depth mentorship with a senior mentor from the chapter’s charter member community.

This year’s cohort comprises 25 mentees from startups like Niramai, University Living, and This for That. The lineup of mentors included Saurabh Srivastava (Chairman Emeritus, TiE Delhi-NCR), Rajan Anandan (President, TiE Delhi), Sanjeev Bikhchandani (Founder, Info Edge), Alok Mittal (Managing Director, Indifi Technologies), and Deep Kalra (Founder, MakeMyTrip), among others.

The first webinars were held right from the beginning of the Lockdown 1.0, and provided actionable insights for crisis management. The session — Lockdown Challenges for Startups: Navigating the COVID-19 Crisis — brought together international experts and drew on experiences from other countries who had already experienced lockdowns.

Another webinar on Business Continuity for Startups amidst COVID-19 kicked off a series of collaborative events with Startup India. Featured speakers were Deepak Bagla (CEO, Invest India), Yashish Dahiya (Co-Founder, Policybazaar), Sairee Chahal (Founder, SHEROES) and Anil Agrawal (Joint Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India).

In April, TiE Delhi-NCR launched the TiE Institute online to connect venture builders with experienced industry stakeholders and experts. Their expertise was shared through courses and webinars.

A six-day Venture Accelerator Programme featured 25 industry stalwarts sharing a lifetime of learnings to boost entrepreneurs on the journey of scale. A lineup of over 30 prominent investors came together over two editions of another special programme. They gave real-time feedback to founders on their pitches and ideas.

The Smash-up virtual event for startups was aimed at launching Indian startups on the road to becoming global brands. It was a blend of creativity, showcases, and networking, with startups, angel investors, and venture capitalists deliberating on India’s new economic stances.

India Internet Day

TiE Delhi-NCR organised the ninth edition of the annual India Internet Day (iDay) on August 6-8 – but entirely online this time. With the theme ‘Reimagine and Rise,’ the two consumer and SME tracks featured keynotes and roundtables with experts from India and overseas, including Zoom Founder Eric Yuan.

The event’s 30 sessions featured insights from more than 100 speakers, 50 investors, and 20 unicorn founders. For example, BYJU’S Co-founder Divya Gokulnath shared how COVID-19 led to the edtech startup's addition of 20 million users in less than four months.

The event helped entrepreneurs reimagine and manage businesses in the post-pandemic era, according to Rajan Anandan, TiE Delhi-NCR President, and MD, Surge and Sequoia Capital India. The speaker lineup also included Arianna Huffington, Founder of The Huffington Post; Amey Mashelkar, Head of JioGenNext; Jeremy Liew, Partner at Lightspeed Ventures; Karan Bajwa, Managing Director at Google Cloud; and Puneet Chandok, President, India and South Asia, Amazon Internet Services India.

Session topics ranged from education and ecommerce to healthcare and gaming. Featured unicorn founders included Ritesh Agarwal (OYO), Deep Kalra (MakeMyTrip), Kunal Bahl (Snapdeal), Amrish Rau (PineLabs), Gaurav Gupta (Zomato), and Naveen Tewari (InMobi).

The Investor Lounges and Ask Me Anything sessions helped startups connect to investors. Eight in-depth workshops were held on topics like design thinking, term-sheet analysis, and product development.

Special initiatives

In addition to webinars and conferences, TiE Delhi-NCR held 10 special networking events. Usually, TiE chapters function autonomously, but these unique collaborative sessions featured other TiE Chapters such as TiE Bangalore, TiE Hyderabad, and TiE Chennai.

On the funding front, TiE Delhi-NCR and Indifi Growth Debt Capital partnered to help provide debt capital to entrepreneurs to enable business continuity, over and above guidance and mentorship. TiE Delhi-NCR and the Indian Angel Network launched a Fastrack Funding initiative to complete startups’ cycle of application for funds in 45 days.

Knowledge partnerships were forged with IIITD Incubation Centre and Nidhi Accelerator by Indigram Labs Foundation. For student entrepreneurs, the TiE BiRAC webinar shared inspiring stories of pioneering entrepreneurs. Originally planned as an offline event, it was moved entirely into an online format.

The chapter also held the TYE programme (TiE Young Entrepreneurs) to teach high school students about entrepreneurship. The TiE Delhi-NCR team of students Team WhyQ won the Best Elevator Pitch and Best Execution Awards at the TYE Global Finals.

Challenges and opportunities

The TiE Delhi-NCR team describes the key challenges faced by entrepreneurs during the pandemic – such as funding, sales and team engagement – and how solutions were provided. While many entrepreneurs faced challenges with respect to retrenchment or hiring, TiE Delhi-NCR collated a list of organisations that were hiring and profiles of people who were looking for jobs.

In addition to the above-mentioned initiatives on the funding front, TiE Bangalore and TiE Delhi-NCR came together to launch the B2B Sales Academy. The workshop series offers case studies, frameworks and expert tips for entrepreneurs.

Even in the face of challenges, some sectors actually gained in the last few months. “Education, gaming, and healthcare are going to see a lot of tailwinds. In fact, our next set of unicorns would be from healthcare or telemedicine. A number of SaaS entrepreneurs are also building for Indian small businesses,” TiE Delhi-NCR President Rajan Anandan explains.

Role of government

“The government is increasingly looking to make the startup ecosystem more conducive,” Geetika observes. There are moves to position Delhi itself as a leading destination for startups, and the government convened a meeting with industry leaders and young entrepreneurs advance plans in this regard.

At the meeting, the TiE Delhi-NCR report from September 2019 was cited, according to which the region had over 7,000 startups, Geetika adds. The report added that Delhi-NCR is set to become one of the top five global startup hubs with 12,000 startups, 30 unicorns, and a cumulative valuation of about $150 billion by 2025.

Geetika also points to a number of ways in which India’s entrepreneurs are developing and promoting homegrown apps in line with government moves for economic repositioning. For example, Kaagaz Scanner has developed an alternative to Camscanner. Startups can also work with the government in areas like solutions for testing, sanitisation, and vaccine research.

Tips and advice

The TiE Delhi-NCR offers tips for entrepreneurs on business issues like cash management and pivoting. “Re-evaluate your business model and strategy: do not waste vital time and resources on a channel or product line that is hard hit by the pandemic,” Geetika cautions.

“The balance sheet should be minutely dissected to reduce cash burn and curtail expenses. Keeping cash in the bank is important for survival,” she adds. It is important to observe consumer behaviour closely to evaluate relevant strategies.

“Pivoting may be required so that you conserve cash and stay relevant in these changing times by adaptation to new technology and business contexts,” Geetika says. As examples, she points to food delivery startups who pivoted to deliver essentials, or apparel and innerwear manufacturers adding masks to their product line during the lockdown.

Confidence-building measures and clear internal and external communication are also key during crises. At the same time, entrepreneurs need to not let a challenge go waste and should utilise it. “Some of the best companies are built in a crisis or downturn,” she observes.

Mental health

Mental fitness is a key priority for entrepreneurs during and after the pandemic. “Have a well-regimented schedule that features not only professional goals but also a requisite amount of self-care activities like meditation and exercise,” Geetika advises.

“Reading, learning new skills, and activities that can elevate intellectual prowess are highly recommended. Stay connected with colleagues through fun activities, while also spending time with family,” she adds.

Entrepreneurs should also regularly reflect on factors that keep them motivated and energised, which can vary across the board. “Each person has a unique and individualistic method of dealing with change,” she observes. Some may prefer being connected, others may want time off.

“Be prepared to adapt working styles and schedules when confronted with business or medical issues. Maintain an inner strength and mental balance to take one step at a time and face each day with gratitude for what you have,” she adds.

“This too shall pass and everyone is dealing with pressure. Hence, there should be no sense of isolation. We are a community and will stay strong in the face of challenges,” Geetika says.

The road ahead

Since its founding in 1999, the TiE Delhi-NCR chapter has spearheaded a number of entrepreneurship support initiatives in the region. It has also won awards for best TiE chapter.

Upcoming initiatives include the launch of the Delhi Chapter of TiE Women, a Healthcare 2.0 panel discussion, the next batch of TYE, and a joint report with Zinnov on the startup landscape.

“TiECon, our annual flagship event, is planned for the end of this year. StartupExpo 5 is planned early next year,” Geetika says. In previous editions, there were 20,000 attendees for the expo, which included panel discussions, elevator pitch contests, and free stalls for startups.

Though TiE Delhi-NCR has a modest team size of 18, it clearly has a packed schedule ahead. “We are resilient and action-oriented. We have maintained our full team and are committed to nurture them and ensure their safety as well as continuity,” she proudly says.

Expenses have been trimmed, budgets redrawn, and new partners roped in. “Commitment to the ecosystem has kept us thriving and surviving. There is constant reinvention to find new partners, and ensure value to existing ones,” Geetika signs off.","In April, TiE Delhi-NCR launched the TiE Institute online to connect venture builders with experienced industry stakeholders and experts.

Hot girls everywhere, rejoice! Our favorite “savage” and the legendary “girl on fire” have both announced forthcoming beauty partnerships—each putting the “pretty” in “pretty big deal.”

Showing no signs of slowing down despite her recent injuries, Megan Thee Stallion has been named Revlon’s newest Global Brand Ambassador. The brand teased the alliance on social media Wednesday with video clips featuring a pair of eyes and lips Meg’s fans would know anywhere. Via a press release, Revlon praised their newest brand ambassador, writing:

Known for her breakout anthems, including “Hot Girl Summer” and “Savage,” Megan Thee Stallion is the ultimate triple threat: music artist, social media sensation, and cutting-edge tastemaker. She continues to set and conquer goals in both music and television with a slew of awards and accomplishments to her name. Most recently, she released the song, “Girls In The Hood,” and hit #1 on the Billboard charts with her track “Savage”. She is also co-anchoring HBO Max’s reality show competition, Legendary, which highlights modern drag ball culture, working on her new album and pursuing her bachelor’s degree in Health Administration at Texas Southern University.

“I’ve always set the bar high for myself with everything I do, but to now be a brand ambassador for Revlon, it feels like a new level,” said the “Hot Girl Summer” rapper, who will begin appearing across Revlon’s media platforms this month, and is also due to drop a single with fellow music and fashion maven Cardi B on Friday.

“To me, the Revlon brand stands for both beauty and female strength and I’m excited to help define what that means to a new generation of women,” she added.

“Megan is a remarkable talent and we know she’s only going to continue to rise to new heights,” said Revlon Global Brand President Silvia Galfo. “When we first approached her about a partnership nearly a year ago, we were drawn to her confidence and fierce ambition as much as her power to hold nothing back. She loves to express herself with makeup and is a constant inspiration to her fans on living boldly. It’s that authenticity and unapologetic spirit that we admire, and we are thrilled to welcome her to the Revlon family.”

Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Alicia Keys has beauty news, as well. She’s already got 15 Grammys on her shelf, but now, Keys is planning to put some e.l.f. on our shelves, announcing the creation of “a groundbreaking new lifestyle beauty brand” with the affordable, inclusive and cruelty-free cosmetics company. Keys’ dedication to minimal makeup and a thorough skin care regimen is already well known and per a release from e.l.f. Beauty—which stands with “every eye, lip, face, and paw”—the new collaboration is expected to launch in 2021, and is described as follows:



A culmination of Keys’ personal skincare journey and her passion for bringing light into the world, this new lifestyle beauty brand will enable Alicia to further explore conversations about inner beauty, wellness and connection. With an inclusive point of view, an authentic voice, and a line of skin-loving, dermatologist-developed, cruelty-free products, the brand aims to bring new meaning to beauty by honoring ritual in our daily life and practicing intention in every action.

“Alicia is not just an icon, she is an inspiration. Her perspective on beauty is soulful and timeless. Together we are painting the highest vision to blaze a new trail in beauty,” said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer, e.l.f. Beauty and President of the New Lifestyle Beauty Brand with Alicia Keys. “Alicia inspires millions of people every day. And now, more than ever, the world is craving a vision that is more than skin deep.”

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of e.l.f. Beauty Tarang Amin agrees: “We are beyond thrilled to leverage our strengths to help realize Alicia’s vision, as it not only aligns with our mission to make the best of beauty accessible but infuses it with an even deeper dimension.”

While preparations are underway for this year’s UN General Assembly and the UN 75th anniversary, the world is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all areas of life.

Cooperation and partnerships on the local, national, and international levels, as called for in Sustainable Development Goal 17, are more vital than ever. Many multilateral bodies have yet to show real leadership when it comes to this. The pandemic has exposed their internal rifts and animosities.

In the meantime, civil society, academia, and citizens are collaborating to help humanity soften the blow of the most significant event in recent history. COVID-19 has impacted the world as a whole, but some populations are more affected than others. That is why voices from developing countries in the Global South are critical at this moment.

Like most organizations, the Southern Voice network has had to adapt. Luckily, our 51 member think tanks across Africa, Asia, and Latin America generated timely analysis of how the new coronavirus was affecting their countries. At the network’s Secretariat, we felt that researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders outside the network, should be able to access this knowledge. Hence, we created a sort of “one-stop-shop” on information on COVID-19 in the Global South. At first just a page on our website, it has now evolved into a full-fledged digital knowledge hub.

The digital hub shows how each SDG is being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Southern Voice’s researchers from 25 countries are analyzing the impact the pandemic is having in areas such as the economy, gender equality, education, and the digital divide. The user has direct access to information on how each region (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) is dealing with the virus. In addition, information can be searched at the global level.

The hub also shows how each SDG is being affected by the pandemic. For example, the gulf between the “digital have and have nots” became even more evident this year. For the majority of people in the Global South, working or learning from home via virtual means is not an option. This fact is further widening the poverty gap, with a direct impact on SDG 1 (no poverty) and various other Goals.

The next generation of humans will be affected more than any other by the aftershock of COVID-19, in particular through impacts on education. Achieving SDG 4 (quality education) is critical to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

As a “bonus”, Southern Voice is also making available a database of experts from across the Global South. Various Southern Voice research centers are now teaming up to offer concrete solutions and recommendations to the crisis. Updates on their work will be available in the hub.

We hope that the database will be used for conference organizers and media outlets, but also by policymakers seeking advice on how to “build back better” with the help of fact-based, timely analysis.

Spaces like this hub represent a glimmer of hope among all the bad news this year. A concrete example of cooperation and partnership, it proves that humanity can come together. It shows that we can tackle a problem that affects us all, much in the spirit of the upcoming Declaration on the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary. In it, the UN Heads of State and Government pledge to “boost partnerships” across the whole of society to “ensure an effective response to our common challenges.” To achieve that, new and diverse voices from all walks of life and cultures are pivotal. For this reason, Southern Voice members are working tirelessly not only to understand the effects of the pandemic, but also to promote hands-on solutions for the short and long-term.

We hope that the COVID-19 in the Global South knowledge hub becomes a go-to place for analysis and recommendations. It is a testament to the cooperative work of hundreds of researchers across the Global South and beyond.

2020 can go down in history as an apocalyptic year. Or it can be a time in which we finally join hands to make SDG 17 a reality, through a more robust multilateral system.

Mondi's group head of sustainable development Gladys Naylor outlines why partnerships are key to fast-tracking progress against the Sustainable Development Goals.

In 2015 the UN Member States set the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of an ambitious 15-year plan to protect the planet and improve the lives of everyone, everywhere.

It signalled an important step in driving forward a sustainable future. Five years down the road, we need to question whether enough is being done to achieve these goals in the next decade. The global pandemic has brought to the forefront just how closely the SDGs are interlinked and the need to achieve them all.

As individuals, governments and businesses we have made progress, but to address the scale of the challenges we face we need to ask if more meaningful action is needed.

Businesses need to continue to put sustainability at the centre of their business strategy, showing their commitment to achieving the UN SDGs by setting ambitious targets, and we need innovation and collaboration to fast-track what is possible.

A growing number of businesses are adopting targets aligned with the SDGs which, as highlighted by the findings of the recently published 2020 Leaders Survey from GlobeScan and SustainAbility, is a crucial endeavour for all businesses aiming to make real and lasting change.

At Mondi, sustainability is intrinsic to how we do business and our Growing Responsibly model is the framework through which we respond to sustainability challenges and opportunities, and address societal issues, including contributing to the UN SDGs. It is integral to our future success and ability to drive value accretive growth, sustainably.

This past year we reviewed our contribution to the SDGs and identified those where we have the greatest potential for positive (or negative) impacts. This has enabled us to maximise opportunities and mitigate our impacts more effectively. An SDG Index allows us to map the SDGs and their targets against our progress, enhancing our disclosure and accountability.

Still, while targets and reporting play an important role, I’m a firm believer that innovation and partnership are the real tickets to accelerating change at scale.

Our work on the Forest Sector SDG Roadmap with the Forest Solutions Group of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development last year is a great example of the success innovation and partnership can generate, as is One Young World’s Lead 2030 initiative. This was launched to find, fund and scale the impact of youth-led solutions to each of the SDGs.

We’ve supported the initiative from the start, specifically looking at innovations that address SDG 12: Responsible Production and Consumption, with the aim of turning waste into raw materials of inherent value.

This year, our winner was start-up Genecis Bioindustries which makes compostable plastic from food waste. In 2019, we supported Kenyan entrepreneur Hope Mwanake and her business EcoBlocks & Tiles, which turns plastic waste into affordable roof tiles.

Lead 2030 highlights the role that large corporations can play in supporting young innovators with positive contributions to societal challenges that no business or sector can solve on their own.

It is when we put our heads together, involving stakeholders from across the value chain that we develop a holistic, meaningful approach to change, with innovations that will lead us towards a more sustainable future.

Multistakeholder collaborations like the Marshall Plan often require unlikely partners to come ... [+] together. getty

If Covid-19 has taught us one thing, it is that the world is entirely interconnected and that change can only happen in concert. History echoes this lesson. The Marshall Plan was an early standout example of a multistakeholder alliance that brought diverse parties together to build markets and infrastructure, and stimulated investment and jobs across Europe as it recovered from an earlier profound shock, World War II.

The Marshall Plan was considered to be highly successful – contributing to a significant rise in GDP for those western European countries involved, and it contributed to the renewal of the western European chemical, engineering and steel industries.

Multistakeholder collaborations like the Marshall Plan often require unlikely partners to come together – which can be challenging – but such partnerships carry more impact. Single-issue based political pathways have their limits, as multiple parts of the economy and society need to be engaged in innovation and investment at the same time. Those who stand to lose out or who may feel neglected by a certain focus on one given issue, such as tackling climate change, may push back on any effort that is perceived to overlook their anxieties about, for example, a lack of jobs or new economic opportunities.

The reverse also holds true. A political push on policy, institutions, technology and finance to create new industrial jobs for some, will be resisted by others if they think these jobs are at the expense of tackling other pressing issues such as climate change. Confronting a lack of cohesion and the sustainability challenge, therefore, go hand-in-hand to achieve true political transformation.

The private sector has a compelling role to play. Forward-minded leaders can often mobilize resources, innovation and action, and influence a wide network, that many in governments and civil society cannot do on their own. There is a growing space for corporate leadership to drive political confidence and the opportunity to act.

As we gather for the Sustainable Development Impact Summit in an increasingly resource-constrained world, grappling with a major global development setback, impactful solutions are critical to making informed decisions about the best use of those limited resources. Collaborations and alliances between public and private sectors and new combinations and applications of policy, technology and finance provide a compelling approach to delivering the Great Reset.

If change-making is a team sport, what then defines the winning teams? Here are 5 examples of elements shared by some current partnerships which are achieving impact:

1. Trust

Meaningful engagement and trust between stakeholders, who manage to integrate unique perspectives and expertise.

The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation is working with government and business partners to ensure cross border trade is simple, fast and cost-effective, creating new business opportunities, generating employment, enabling greater economic and social development and reducing poverty. In the first completed project in Colombia, the Alliance worked with the Colombian National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance (Invima) and business, to introduce a risk management system for food, beverages, medicines and medical devices, allowing inspectors to focus their resources on high-risk shipments without jeopardising safety and security. The collaboration has fostered greater trust between government and business, reduced the number of physical inspections and stripped hundreds of hours of delays out of the border clearance process, saving business $8.8m in just 18 months.

2. Macro vision with micro application

A broad constituent group that combines diversity and breadth, with a common purpose that focuses on specific projects with achievable objectives.

Grow Asia is building Better Business by bringing together government, business, civil society organizations and farmer groups, to help scale up inclusive agriculture value chains across key commodities such as palm oil, rubber, coconut, rice and coffee – significant contributors to exports in South East Asia.

With many successes in the region, the Vietnam Coffee Story stands out, where partnerships were established to improve the sustainability of Robusta coffee in Vietnam, the world’s second largest coffee producer. Despite high levels of productivity, Vietnam is susceptible to climate threats and ageing farms, leading to declining yields. Through a National Committee formed by the by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Coffee Task Force of Grow Asia’s Vietnam chapter and public-private partnerships at the district and province level, an initial successful pilot was scaled up, to train 18% (around 100,000) of coffee farmer households in a national curriculum in sustainable practices.

These farmers have seen increased yields and improvements in the quality of yields. They have made progress in adapting to climate change, lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 40,000 tons annually (the equivalent of taking over 8,640 passenger vehicles off the road for one year), reducing water usage by 21 million m3 annually as well as fertilizer use. All this translates into $12.3 million of savings annually for farmers.

3. Empowering other change-makers

If other people or organizations have greater potential to create change, empower them.

Through the Communities partnerships, the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship is building Shared Prosperity and advancing the world’s leading models of sustainable social innovation. Since its founding 20 years ago, the Foundation has helped its 400 social entrepreneurs and innovators to amplify their impact by raising their visibility and inclusion at global events; through education programs, peer learning and through strengthened global networks.

The impact of the social entrepreneurs and innovators on their communities has been significant. Around 622 million people have been directly affected by the operations and activities of this group. More than $6.7 billion has been distributed to people in communities through loans, or from the sale of products which have created value and enhanced livelihoods. Through their initiatives, 192 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been mitigated – the equivalent of taking more than 40.7 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year.

The Schwab Foundation has recently set up the COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurs, an unprecedented collaboration between 60 global organizations, representing over 50,000 social entrepreneurs globally, to pool knowledge, experience, and support responses for social entrepreneurs in their work to alleviate suffering and advance new models of change for a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world. The Alliance released its COVID Social Enterprise Action Agenda on 16 September, 25 concrete interventions calling on key stakeholders to join Alliance members in increasing their commitments to support social entrepreneurs during COVID-19.

4. Global ambition

If the issue is universal – the objectives can be expansive.

The Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) is supporting a Liveable Planet. Established in 2012 to catalyse collective action towards deforestation-free supply chains for commodities such as soy, palm oil, cocoa, beef, and paper and pulp, its official partners now include more than 160 key companies, government agencies, civil society and multi-lateral organizations, which TFA convenes through ‘Action Platforms’ in key tropical forest countries.

With the support of TFA, the Consumer Goods Forum has officially launched the Forest Positive Coalition of Action, which includes 17 global consumer goods companies with a collective market value of US$1.8 trillion working together to accelerate systemic efforts to remove deforestation, forest degradation and conversion from the key commodity supply chains of palm oil, soy, and paper, pulp and fiber-based packaging, and drive transformative change across the industry.

By promoting an innovative and integrated collective action large-scale approach, TFA is working to ensure that commodity production realizes maximum economic gain to local communities, smallholders and large-scale producers, while minimizing the impacts on tropical forests, on which 1.6 billion people worldwide depend. The result is an exciting new way of doing business sustainably - one that will drive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

5. Multi-sector buy-in

Big issues affect many different sectors in different ways. Change only happens when all sectors – public and private – see the benefit.

Diverse and dynamic partnerships form the backbone of Friends of Ocean Action, a unique group of over 55 leaders from a wide range of sectors, who are committed to fast-tracking systemic solutions to the most pressing challenges facing the ocean. Launched in 2018, the Friends of Ocean Action platform pools knowledge, means and influence to help the international community take the urgent steps needed to conserve and sustainably use the ocean for equitable development.

The Global Tuna Alliance for example, is an independent group of retailers and supply-chain companies for whom tuna is one of the top three product groups, representing 90% of this market’s total imports from developing countries. Members are improving environmental sustainability and traceability within global tuna fisheries, working to ensure tuna is sourced sustainably and is fully traceable, that human rights are safeguarded, and modern slavery is eliminated. Such partnerships and communities can help to achieve shared prosperity, fairer and greener business, and a more liveable planet.

On the night before Integrate Health’s first Community Health Worker training in 2015, we got a startling call: “Please take the Ministry of Health logo off the training materials.” Integrate Health had worked with the Ministry of Health’s District Health Director, from day one, to design the program. But she had gotten cold feet.

Gbeleou went to her office the next morning, and emerged after an hour, shaking his head. We had secured permission to proceed with the training and launch the program, with only the NGO logo on the training materials. The program that Integrate Health and the Ministry of Health were piloting together, the Integrated Primary Care Program, had acquired all of the necessary approvals and was even part of a joint study. But it was also different—Community Health Workers were being paid to work full-time, unlike the country's volunteer model—and different can be risky.

Since that initial rocky start in 2015, Integrate Health has made significant progress in strengthening our partnership with the Ministry of Health. In fact, Gbeleou and Dr. Sibabe Agoro, Regional Health Director for the Ministry of Health in Togo, had just returned from obtaining their UK visas in March of this year when they learned that the Skoll World Forum had been canceled due to COVID-19. Gbeleou and Dr. Agoro had planned to travel to Oxford to participate in a panel discussion on government and NGO partnership at scale. But as the novel coronavirus grew to a pandemic, the critical need for effective NGO and government collaboration rapidly accelerated.

Today, Gbeleou is a key participant in the coronavirus task force, convened by Dr. Agoro twice weekly. The two are in contact daily as the Ministry of Health mounts a rapid response and Integrate Health mobilizes technical and financial resources in support of the Ministry of Health to meet the country’s rapidly evolving needs.

Why Partnership Is Critical for Scale

This partnership, seamless in a time of crisis, was not always this strong. NGOs and governments are different. We have different goals, different mandates, and different constraints. But we need one another: NGOs can be nimble and flexible and can try things that governments can't afford to do, whether financially or politically. And while NGOs can take risks and fail, NGOs need governments to scale, especially in fields like health care and education. Governments set national policies and funding, which provide scale and sustainability. And governments can leverage the support of NGOs to innovate and enhance accountability.

How can NGOs learn to work effectively with governments? At Integrate Health, we have learned a few key lessons, often the hard way, over the past five years of working to build real partnership with government.

1. Center the voice of government.

The literature on scale through public sector “adoption” tends to disproportionately focus on NGOs, positioning governments as the passive recipients of innovation. However, success stories illustrate that achieving impact through the public sector at scale requires building genuine, bi-directional partnership. Founding a genuine partnership requires putting government at the center from the earliest stages of designing a program or pilot.

For Integrate Health, our primary counterpart was the Togolese Ministry of Health’s District Health Director, since the health centers and communities where we hoped to work were under her jurisdiction. Our first step was to reach out to her, and to involve her from the initial design stage all the way through launch. She helped to identify challenges, provided input on the solutions, and selected the first intervention sites. Without her deep involvement we would have never gotten the pilot off the ground. But while this step was critical, it was just the beginning. The reality is that while the Director approved all of our decisions, she wasn’t fully convinced that the approach would work. She needed to see it to believe it.

2. Implement within existing government delivery and data systems.

If seeing is believing, then seeing a program work within the existing system is a prerequisite to scale with government. We worked with the District Health Director to ensure implementation was embedded in government systems, leveraging existing government infrastructure and personnel. The Integrated Primary Care Program launched in 2015 across four sites. The program was implemented directly in government clinics under the District Health Director’s supervision. The Director was able to observe the program as it operated and received feedback directly from her staff.

Effectively integrating the program’s impact data into the government’s data collection systems, however, proved more difficult, both logistically and politically. Ultimately the Ministry’s decision to transition to electronic data systems, namely DHIS2, created an opportunity for data from the Integrated Primary Care Program to be fed directly into the public sector system. This enabled outcomes to be routinely and consistently shared with government partners, such that the Integrated Primary Care Program data appear automatically in routine data that government actors see, analyze, and discuss each month in their regular review meetings. Critically, the District Health Director, and her superiors, could see the data and measure the impact from the activities happening in her District’s clinics and communities.

3. Build relationships with government partners at all levels.

There are always risks associated with trying something new, but securing buy-in from multiple levels within a system or hierarchy can minimize those risks for individual actors.

For example, in the first year of the Integrated Primary Care Program it became clear that the program was working: utilization rates of health services were skyrocketing and deaths were dropping. But the idea became far less risky to embrace just in time for the District Health Director to be transferred to a new district. This kind of disruption is a reality of working with governments: personnel are not stable, and during a three-year pilot, we worked with three different District Health Directors. Fortunately, each was able to directly observe the impact of the program in their district, just as the first District Health Director had. As the pilot’s success continued, word spread. Other Directors began to ask for the program in their Districts. As a result, we were asked to meet with the Regional Health Director. Together, we began to think about expansion to multiple districts.

We’ll never forget the day the Regional Health Director sent the email instructing all of his District Health Directors to work with us. This was a paradigm shift: No longer would we have to plead our case, present the evidence, and ask each Director to take a risk on us. But it was by building relationships at multiple levels that we had streamlined our efforts and paved the way to program expansion.

4. Progressively transfer real ownership to government partners.

This should be a goal from the beginning. The process of transferring ownership from NGOs to governments requires a transition, of course. Given the risks associated with new or innovative ideas, it is understandable that government officials want to be convinced of the program’s feasibility and effectiveness before they are willing to take the reins. But ownership is absolutely critical to long-term success and sustainability. Effective government ownership ensures that a program will continue once the NGO is no longer leading implementation.

The expansion of the Integrated Primary Care Program launched in July 2018, three years after the initial pilot began. We had garnered strong buy-in from government partners but Integrate Health, as an NGO, was still leading the implementation. Why was this? “We’ve been implementing this program for three years,” Gbeleou reflected; “We know it works. Our government partners know it works. But now is the time to let them lead.”

With that proclamation our team shifted to position our government partners to take ownership of the program’s implementation. We began by embedding management staff on the Regional Health Team rather than employing them directly, and by having government representatives take over increasing responsibility, such as planning and running trainings, with our team playing a supporting role. These small steps have begun to shift both the perceived and actual ownership of the intervention from an NGO “program” to simply the government’s own system, positioning the program to continue over the long-term. A strong indication of progress; on the eve of the most recent Community Health Worker training in August, Gbeleou received a call from Dr. Agoro. He was calling to ensure that the Ministry of Health logo would appear on the cover of the training materials.

Genuine Partnership Can Unlock Opportunities to Scale

Our hope is that this effective transfer of ownership will be a springboard to national scale. Government representatives themselves are now actively and vocally advocating within the government hierarchy for the expansion of this approach. Having generated strong demand from the ground up, our team is now working with government and other partners at the national level to inform the policy and funding that will enable scale. Critically, the program is now playing a key role in both the current pandemic response and ensuring the continuity of primary health care delivery.

The Honorable Professor Moustafa Mijiyawa, Minister of Health for the Republic of Togo once asked us, in his jovial tone, if Integrate Health is a “non-governmental organization” or a “non-governable organization.” His point was well-taken: Not all NGOs commit, as Integrate Health has, to working within and in an effort to strengthen the government system. Many NGOs pursue their own agenda, contributing to fragmentation of the health system, creating an added management burden for Ministries of Health.

During our earliest meetings with Minister Mijiyawa, we explained that Integrate Health aims to reinforce the public system, rather than build a parallel solution. The Minister later told us that this was the most important thing we had said during that meeting, leaving more of an impression than our outstanding health outcomes, low-cost structure, or efficient delivery model.

At Integrate Health we are still on the journey to scale in partnership with government and we know we have a way to go. But we have learned so much, and so much of it the hard way, that we felt compelled to share some of our lessons learned. Let us know how they resonate with you, or better yet, try them and let us know if they work. We hope that by building on these lessons we can realize true partnerships between governments and NGOs and work together to strengthen health systems and save lives, both in times of crisis and long after.","Dr. Agoro, regional health director, at an Integrate Health Community Health Worker training.

People are scrutinizing how brands are responding to the Covid-19 crisis. Businesses are under the spotlight, and what they do now will set them up for either failure or success in a post-Covid world.

At Zen Media, we've seen firsthand how a well-executed response can catapult a business. When Covid-19 put restaurants at risk of having to close their doors for good and governmental guidelines began to emerge (dictating the terms of doing business in the ""new normal""), we helped OneDine rise up as an innovative industry leader with high-tech solutions for helping restaurants overcome disruption, increase resilience, and fortify for the future. We led an internal strategy-pivot, designed to demonstrate OneDine's deep solidarity with an industry in crisis, that shifted the company's focus from sales to support.

The results earned OneDine enhanced brand awareness nationwide, massive engagement across social, a remarkable boost in qualified prospects from 63 (pre-Covid) to 163 in less than seven weeks, and an extraordinary spike in closed sales in this same period with more than 50 accounts signed representing over 3,000 units when fully deployed.

It's also worth noting that success isn't always found from going it alone.

There are brands collaborating with others to aid those in need of help the most during this time. Not only are they impacting lives--they are positioning themselves as a business that can be trusted. And with brand trust being the biggest factor of a brand's reputation, losing it among your prospects ultimately means losing customers to your competitors.

Here are three examples of brands that have come together to take action and position themselves as leaders during these uncertain times.

Nordstrom, Providence Health & Services, Kaas Tailored, and Ascension

In an effort to help address the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), Nordstrom partnered with Providence Health & Services, Kaas Tailored, and Ascension to bring nearly one million face masks to health care workers in the Providence and Ascension network of hospitals. Nordstrom is the largest employer of tailors in North America, and for this initiative, it is having its alterations teams in Illinois, Washington, D.C., Florida, New York, New Jersey, Washington, Oregon, Texas, and California sew the masks.

Through its willingness to transition its business to fill an essential need, Nordstrom not only received love and praise from fans and followers across social media--it also got people interested in supporting the brand during and after the health crisis.

DoorDash and United Way

To expand on its Ride United program, which provides safe and reliable transportation for individuals and families needing to get to good jobs, access health care, and more, DoorDash partnered with United Way to include the delivery of food and supplies as well.

Nearly 1,100 local United Ways work with food banks and food pantries across the United States. The partnership enables social service organizations across United Way's national network to provide food and supplies to people in need by using DoorDash's on-demand logistics platform and community of local drivers (known as Dashers). The program targets those at high risk and in quarantine who can't leave their homes and are experiencing food insecurities.

In the first eight weeks of the program and across 46 states, Dashers have already delivered more than 650,000 meals from senior centers, schools, food banks, food pantries, and restaurants to seniors, medically fragile students, health care workers, and food insecure families.

DoorDash also received praise from some of its Dashers, who found it an honor to serve their neighbors during this difficult time. As we know, in the age of the connected consumer, workers at a company are as impactful to a brand as its customers. So this display of Dashers' pride in their work positions DoorDash a company that's truly looking out for their communities.

Bungie and Direct Relief

Bungie (developer of the popular video game series Destiny) partnered with Direct Relief to support health care workers and frontline responders. Direct Relief works with a network of providers around the world to deliver supplies that health care workers need, like PPE, portable oxygen concentrators, and ventilators.

So how exactly does a partnership between a charity service and a game developer work?

Well, for a $20 donation to Direct Relief, Bungie offered players an in-game reward for Destiny 2: the Guardian Heart's emblem using the charity's colors. The initiative aimed to reach a goal of $700,000 raised in one month. That goal was achieved in just 17 days.

So Direct Relief received some much-needed aid and supporters earned a reward, while Bungie created an opportunity to get players active on its game.

The Long-Term Benefits of Brand Partnerships and Better Positioning

Setting up your brand for success and positioning yourself as a proactive, caring brand will require effort, and massive action. But taking strategic action right now is the best thing you can do to be competitive, disruptive, and remain top of mind for when people start returning to their normal lives. And collaborating with other brands might just be an ideal move if you're both like-minded and have similar goals.","Bungie and Direct ReliefBungie (developer of the popular video game series Destiny) partnered with Direct Relief to support health care workers and frontline responders.

By Ryno Rijnsburger, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft 4Africa

For Africa to not just survive the current pandemic, but to thrive, investment into digital infrastructure is inevitable. Much-needed digital infrastructure and the resulting digital transformation will be an enabler of rapid development across the continent, positively impacting the most vulnerable communities.

While digital transformation is certainly not a new discussion, the Covid-19 pandemic has abruptly accelerated the need for digital adoption. There’s an urgent need to invest in connecting communities and improving service delivery to citizens throughout Africa. However, governments across Africa, and indeed globally, have budgetary restraints that have been exacerbated by the current pandemic, and digitisation requires significant investments to modernise the government sector and beyond. Public-private partnerships (PPP) will play a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. Africa’s recovery must be digitally driven – the digital economy is the recipe for job creation, spurring innovation, boosting economic growth and supporting long-term competitiveness in the global digital economy.

Digital transformation needs an ICT infrastructure to succeed

To breach the current digital divide, governments alone cannot achieve ambitious targets. It will take a strategic and considered set of PPPs to achieve Africa’s ambitions to compete in the digital economy. A report by McKinsey & Company on Africa in the wake of Covid-19 suggests that the crisis could be a catalyst to help close the digitisation gap, accelerating digital transformation in sectors as diverse as financial services, retail, education and government. To unlock digital transformation, the public sector must be brought into the digital age, accelerating the rollout of digital IDs, signatures and registries, as well as implementing digital-friendly policies. But to positively impact inequality, citizens need access to the internet. There is more work to be done to create equal opportunities for everyone, including improving next-generation connectivity, particularly for rural communities.

The latest Ericsson Mobility report states that mobile data traffic in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to grow by 12 times the current figures by 2025. Mobile broadband subscriptions are predicted to reach 72 percent of mobile subscriptions while LTE subscriptions are set to triple, increasing from 90 million in 2019 to 270 million in 2025. E-commerce has also been growing quickly: online retailers in Nigeria, for example, have experienced a doubling of revenue each year since 2010. Despite this progress, most sectors of African societies and economies still lag behind the rest of the world in digitisation.

In 2016, the United Nations declared access to the internet to be a basic human right, yet in 2020 48 percent of the world’s population lacks consistent access. ICT investment into mobile broadband is a crucial area for development. Internet connectivity across Africa is very low, and there’s a need to use innovative ways to connect the unconnected and the underserved.

One way to expand digital services is to make use of TV White Space technology (TVWS). The sustainable nature of this type of spectrum use makes it very cost efficient to implement, which is extremely beneficial for rural, underserved and developing areas. With TVWS, people are now able to access the internet for less than 5 percent of the average household income, and projects such as Mawingu in Kenya, and Bluetown in Ghana are making a palpable difference to people’s lives and livelihoods.

Policy development must be part of the conversation

Many governments have struggled with digital transformation. In some instances, red tape and outdated policies make it more challenging to implement digitisation goals. In recent Microsoft-EY research, businesses cite a lack of regulatory guidelines among their top three challenges to implementing AI. African governments have important roles to play in developing sound digital policies and stable harmonised regulatory environments that enable people and businesses to participate fully in the global digital economy.

The McKinsey & Company report suggests that governments can help by fostering an enabling environment for rapid digitisation by ensuring that all the key enablers are in place to support digital adoption. For example, governments and technology companies can make sure that data is affordable, while regulators can take steps such as allowing banks to accept e-signatures.

With funding constraints and reallocation becoming an even more stark reality, governments are under pressure to normalise tax collection. Past inefficiencies in the process may well have been overlooked. Countries with vast informal and cash-based shadow economies wish to extend support to all their citizens; however, the support available can be severely hampered by issues with tax collection of existing businesses and individuals. Some countries are taking the opportunity to offer support to informal SMEs in return for a commitment to register and become part of the regulated economy. This is often done by offering discounted rates in return for participation in the government’s tax collection policy and laws. Enabling technology can help governments scale tax collection and manage it, predict fraud and support governments in their goals.

PPPs can serve to accelerate conversations around key country policies. In South Africa, Microsoft commissioned Research ICT Africa (RIA), a leading research institution, to author the white paper, “Paving the way towards digitalisation in Agriculture” in partnership with the University of Pretoria. The white paper was commissioned with the aim to identify opportunities within the agriculture industry and identify key regulatory and policy issues that the country needs to address in order to maximise the benefits of technology. The final report could serve as a reference document that could be leveraged to identify appropriate policy priorities in order to truly transform agriculture across MEA countries.

Digitisation can improve citizens’ access to services

With a booming young digital native population in countries across Africa, the call for more immediate and personalised digital services is growing. Historically, public service delivery across Africa has been characterised by backlogs, inaccuracy, slow response times and poor quality, leaving citizens feeling frustrated, but technology can directly impact operations in public services and improve the lives of citizens. Technology such as AI, IoT, quantum computing, blockchain, cloud technologies and other tools can improve response times and enable digital access to services, while driving important revenue sources for government in areas such as licensing and taxation.

Here, digital systems can help scale and manage online tax collection, predict fraud and deploy analytics for improved service delivery. In tandem with driving tech innovation, public-private partnerships can help unlock vital upskilling, reskilling and digital literacy initiatives for government employees that help drive what we refer to as tech intensity – the ability to not just adopt emerging technology, but to develop the capabilities to effectively use it.

Morocco is one such country that has harnessed the power of PPPs to drive digital transformation. Its Morocco 2020 Digital Strategy places the development of eGovernment services as a top priority. Microsoft 4Afrika has backed the development of this eGovernment solution in Morocco through a partnership with Algo Consulting to develop the Wraqi platform, which uses IoT, biometrics and blockchain to digitise administrative services, document certification and notarisation. Platforms like this help provide secure, trusted services with full traceability of services – an important hallmark for eGovernment services.

In Egypt, public-private partnerships will help bring agriculture into the digital age by delivering real-time data for good agricultural practices, including intelligent water demand forecasting using AI, Cloud and mobile data, and connected farms that benefit from data collected using agriculture IoT devices. It’s hoped that by enabling data protection between agricultural entities, the agricultural supply chain and data platforms can securely share data for greater benefit to everyone within that sector.

Public-private partnerships can form the cornerstone of a successful move to digitisation, and are an effective strategy for bringing together the resources and know-how needed to deliver on digital transformation goals.","Much-needed digital infrastructure and the resulting digital transformation will be an enabler of rapid development across the continent, positively impacting the most vulnerable communities.

199,https://www.journalofclinicalpathways.com/article/population-health-partnerships-advance-value-based-care,"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 17:01:38 GMT",Journal of Clinical Pathways,Population Health Partnerships to Advance Value-Based Care,"The business model for health care in the United States is evolving from a volume-driven model to a consumer-centric, value-driven model. As such, there are new competencies required of hospitals and health systems to effectively manage a population’s health across the continuum of care. Many hospitals and health systems will need to partner with other organizations to gain the capabilities and efficiencies required to provide services under new care delivery and payment arrangements. This article discusses the why, what, and how of creating and implementing a population health project with partners.

As health systems begin to take on financial risk, achieving improved outcomes depends on how successfully that system can deliver “the right care for the right patient at the right time.” Unfortunately, providers often fall short of this goal, resulting in lost opportunity. Today’s complex health care delivery and reimbursement environment requires providers and systems to enact more population health initiatives via partnerships that build on existing resources and tools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines population health as “an interdisciplinary, customizable approach that allows health departments to connect practice to policy for change to happen locally. This approach utilizes non-traditional partnerships among different sectors of the community—public health, industry, academia, health care, local government entities, etc—to achieve positive health outcomes.”1 Standing alone trying to deliver high-value care is nearly impossible, not to mention wasteful. Systems, providers, and leaders should start by understanding the why, what, and how of population health as a foundation for high-value care delivery (Figure 1).

It Starts With “Why”

When we enter the post-COVID environment, most health systems will be focused on enhancing revenue and reducing costs. Investments in population health outcomes will be especially challenging, so clear appreciation of why population health partnerships are important will be critical. In addition, leaders should identify and understand the specific reasons for why they need to enact such projects in their own community/region.

The foundation for the “why” can be drawn from insight via a community health needs assessment (CHNA). A CHNA is a systematic process involving the community to identify and analyze community health needs. The process provides a way for communities to prioritize health needs and to plan and act upon unmet community health needs. The Internal Revenue Service requires nonprofit hospitals to conduct a CHNA every 3 years and to adopt an implementation strategy to meet the community health needs identified through the CHNA.2 The assessment identifies key health needs and issues through systematic, comprehensive data collection and analysis. As described by the CDC,3 CHNAs use such principles as:

Multisector collaborations that support shared ownership of all phases of community health improvement, including assessment, planning, investment, implementation, and evaluation;

Proactive, broad, and diverse community engagement to improve results;

A definition of community that encompasses both a significant enough area to allow for population-wide interventions and measurable results, and includes a targeted focus to address disparities among subpopulations;

Maximum transparency to improve community engagement and accountability;

Use of evidence-based interventions and encouragement of innovative practices with thorough evaluation;

Evaluation to inform a continuous improvement process; and

Use of the highest quality data pooled from and shared among diverse public and private sources.

Given that the ultimate described goal of a CHNA is to develop strategies to address the community’s health needs and identified issues, the assessment findings can serve as the foundation for describing a value proposition for undertaking population health projects.

Finally, before provider or systems commit to action, they should also step back and cultivate an appreciation of the value of a model or partnership. This requires a true sense of a program’s cost. Of note, cost is beyond writing checks, as a health system’s administrative burden is often times more significant. Value is then assessed through balancing these total costs against the benefits in terms of the clinical and financial outcomes. All too often, health systems overestimate the benefits while underestimating the costs. This results in disappointment, which then leads to stalled action moving forward.

The “what” involves development and implementation of population health projects through partnerships. The elements of these projects involve identification and intervention. Identification requires identification of the right patient at the right time. Often here, providers miss the mark on timely identification. Patients are identified as high risk after the fact, at which point interventions to improve outcomes are difficult if not impossible. Instead, focus and interventions should be aimed at “rising risk” patients, ie, those not yet heavily utilizing services but who likely will be soon.

While there are many identification tools, sometimes the calculation process is too complex. Other tools are too delayed in their timeliness to be effective in practice. For an identification tool to be effective, it must have an easy calculation system and be available at the point and time of care.

One screening tool that can easily identify older populations who are at high risk for using health services heavily in the future is the Pra™ and PraPlus™ Screening Instrument.4 These instruments are owned by Johns Hopkins University. The PraPlus is a 17-item questionnaire (the eight questions of the Pra, plus nine additional questions about medical conditions, functional ability, living circumstances, nutrition, and depression). One of the most telling elements of this screener is a patient’s self-assessment of their health status. While the PraPlus is an easy-to-use, timely screener, it does not point the user toward the needed intervention. A tool that screens based on specific intervention can accomplish that. For example, a series of rated questions where a patient assesses their status from -5 to +5 in specific population health areas can easily direct providers to filling care gaps (Box 1).

This can also be done through simply asking hospitalized patients and/or their caregivers, “what do you need to keep safe at home?” hese needs can then be filled through application of clinical pathways to carry out next steps in the care plan. Clinical pathways have done well in this area since their starting point in care is easily noted, often via a diagnosis/staging, and then an effective pathway prescribes the highest value, most evidence-based next steps of care for that type of patient. But population health initiatives may be more complex in terms of factors they consider regarding the patient, such as social determinants of health and other external factors. Addressing all of these factors in a patient-centric approach requires modification of most current clinical pathways to be effective.

The Final Step: How

The perfect plan is nothing if not implemented well. Simply handing someone the ideal playbook is far from ensuring success. Effective implementation requires clear direction to all participants. Ideally, such instruction is provided by leaders in a health system that has already successfully completed implementation of these efforts and their experience in overcoming challenges can be adapted to the new system. Piloting population health partnership projects can go a long way to ease implementation strains and ensure success.

Outcomes, Process, Structure

The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality describes types of health care quality measures.5 Measures used to assess and compare the quality of health care organizations are classified as either a structure, process, or outcome measure. Known as the Donabedian model, this classification system was named after the physician and researcher who formulated it.6 Effective implementation of a plan can be assessed by evaluating the structure, process, and outcomes of a plan.

Structural measures (the “how” of a plan) reveal a health care provider’s capacity, systems, and processes to provide high-quality care. Process measures (the “what” of a plan) indicate what a provider does to maintain or improve health, either for healthy people or for those diagnosed with a health care condition. These measures typically reflect generally accepted recommendations for clinical practice, which can be articulated through high-quality clinical pathways, such as the exact process needed for patient identification, timing, and intervention. Outcome measures (the “why” of a plan) reflect the impact of the health care service or intervention on the health status of patients—why the organization sought to implement the plan in the first place. This appreciation of the value requires examination of the costs and benefits, illustrating how to implement a plan by beginning with the end (ultimate goals) in mind.

We are now less than three years out from the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France, a tournament that will mark the 200th birthday of the sport. It promises to be a very special and record-breaking celebration of world class sport and entertainment, as well as the most socially responsible tournament to date.

In a rapidly changing world, the Rugby World Cup continues to evolve and build meaningful connections with people globally. Still in its infancy and a challenger proposition in the context of the competitive world of major sports events, it offers the ability to attract younger audiences in new nations via emerging platforms and activation tools.

This is something that resonates with our partners, who recognise the potential to create authentic relationships with our fan-base over a six-week global, multi-medium shop window. Spurred on by an incredible tournament in Japan, we are already seeing the halo effect of Asia’s debut event, with unprecedented commercial interest from a blend of long-term partners and new brands.

As we look to 2023, we are building on strong foundations, Japan 2019 was a groundbreaking and record-breaking event. One that provided significant and innovative platforms and opportunities for our commercial family, including a raft of new sponsors such as Japanese giants Secom, Toto, NEC and NTT Docomo.

The 2019 tournament also set new stadia attendance records of 99 per cent and the fan zones brought in of 1.13 million visitors. As a result there are two million new rugby union participants in Asia and Japan 2019 raised more than UK£2 million (US$2.62 million) for Childfund Pass It Back. The economic output was a staggering UK£4.3 billion (US$5.65 billion), reinforcing the low-investment, high return hosting proposition which is so important to nations.

The tournament harnessed the potential of Asia to become the most-watched rugby event ever with more than 857 million people viewing the action on television, a 26 per cent increase on the 2015 edition. Significantly, rugby’s time in the Land of the Rising Sun, engaged new younger audiences – of which more than 40 per cent are female – on new platforms, in new ways. Digital videos captured 2.04 billion views across a social media following that has grown nearly 400 per cent up since 2015. Rugby World Cup and World Rugby owned channels provided commercial partners with an unprecedented share of voice – higher than Fifa, the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the National Football League's (NFL) respective events. Partner visibility was also delivered on an international scale with 3.6 billion impressions on branded posts. As a result, digital activation of assets including player of the match and Rugby World Cup Daily generated more than UK£370 million (US$486 million) in Hookit Earned Media value.

What’s more, through working closely with Nielsen, we have seen that those aware of World Rugby's global partners’ sponsorship of the tournament, recorded more than double the brand consideration and trust of those not aware. So Rugby World Cup is not only growing audiences, brand exposure and awareness across the globe, but is converting them into purchase consideration.

Rugby World Cup 2019 also took rugby into new markets, with 70 per cent of its global broadcast audience outside of traditional rugby markets. There was impressive growth in Southeast Asia, where Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam featured in the top 20 for TV figures globally. The region, along with the US, also broke into the top six across the TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook and YouTube platforms.

Whilst Rugby World Cup 2019 was a huge success and we are incredibly proud of what was achieved, the world has changed during the Covid-19 pandemic and a new way of doing business has emerged. Major events will inevitably need to evolve, as will the offering for commercial partners. There is, now more than ever, an appetite for impactful, purpose-driven partnerships that reflect the passions and concerns of society.

In our preparations for France 2023 we are thinking differently, more innovatively, with greater emphasis on cost efficiency, social and climate change. This is mirrored in our ten-year roadmap for major event hosting which offers certainty and a unique opportunity to build targeted and impactful partnerships with World Rugby’s showcase men’s and women’s events. This long-term strategy will help partners maximise the unique benefits generated by a younger, purpose-driven audience that cares deeply about global issues and the role that sport can play in driving meaningful social change.

Rugby World Cup 2023 will be our most socially responsible tournament ever, embodying our commitment to sustainability, inclusion and diversity; values that are important to our growing fanbase. With an increased appreciation of major events as a beacon of community, the ‘We love rugby 2023’ train, in the colours of Rugby World Cup 2023, has today started a tour around 23 cities in France. As well as generating excitement, the aim is to reestablish social links and promote rugby’s values throughout the country. Rugby World Cup 2023 is also a signatory of the Charter of 15 Environmentally Responsible Commitments, a collaboration between the French Ministry of Sport and WWF France. As part of this, operations will subscribe to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement and ensure sustainable innovation and practices lie at the heart of the tournament.

With the sports’ values central, state-of-the-art venues and competitive world-class action on the pitch, Rugby World Cup 2023 will be an unmissable event for rugby’s global fans. Following the excitement and record engagement of Japan 2019, the current pandemic, whilst incredibly challenging, has given us all an opportunity to reset, to be creative and flexible and have a positive impact on the issues that matter to our fans.","In a rapidly changing world, the Rugby World Cup continues to evolve and build meaningful connections with people globally.

201,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19308/how-bank-and-fintech-partnerships-are-redefining-the-future-of-banking,"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Finextra,How Bank and Fintech Partnerships are Redefining the Future of Banking,"Can fintech and banking play nicely together? Although traditional banks might have once eyed fintech companies with concern or suspicion, the stance of traditional financial service providers seems to be evolving. Traditional banks and financial service companies no longer necessarily look at fintechs as intruders in the field but instead often consider them valuable partners when these traditional companies want to reach new goals or increase engagement with their clients.

Bank and fintech collaboration also benefits the tech companies. They can expand into new markets while benefiting from the regulatory status of traditional banks. Continued collaboration and partnerships between fintech companies and banks are essential for the future of the financial services industry and the technology sector.

Why Fintech Collaboration Is Essential for the Future of Banking

What does the average consumer turn to when they need financial advice or assistance? The answer is uncertain but is likely not their bank. A survey conducted in April 2020 found that just 14% of consumers turned to their bank for financial advice following a life event that significantly affected their finances.

One of the reasons why consumers are often hesitant to seek out assistance and advice from traditional financial services companies is that they have little trust in those institutions. As the 2008 recession unfolded, 41% of people surveyed stated that they felt afraid, and 53% stated that the events leading up to the recession made them angry. The percentage of people who said that they had “high confidence” in banks fell from 53% in 2004 to 22% in 2009. Nearly 10 years later, the number of people who said they had high confidence in banks had climbed to 32%, which is still less than one-third of consumers.

In contrast, the amount of trust people have for technology companies is generally much higher than for financial institutions. In 2019, Pew Research reported 50% of people surveyed stated that they believed tech companies had a positive impact on the country. Another survey, the Edelman Trust Barometer, found that three-quarters of people trusted the technology sector. When banks connect with fintech companies, they can benefit from the higher levels of trust that consumers have in those businesses.

The evolution of the way people manage banking and financial services also highlights one of the reasons why fintechs and banks should work together. Just a few of the technological changes that have affected people’s banking behaviors include:

Increased use of mobile devices: As of June 2019, 81% of adults in the U.S. own a smartphone, and more than half own a tablet. The percentage of smartphone owners in the U.S. jumped by 46% since 2011. Considerably more people now own mobile devices, and they are using them more and more. Seventeen percent of U.S. adults exclusively use their smartphones for internet access. Banks that want to connect with their customers should be considering ways to make the products and services they offer mobile-friendly.

The development of the cloud: Thanks to the cloud, information can be easily accessed from any device that connects to the internet. That means that individuals can access their banking details from pretty much anywhere, and the financial information also updates itself in real-time. Previously, accounts would need to settle overnight before they contained the most up-to-date information. The cloud has allowed for speedier transactions as well as easier access.

Increased availability of online services: While many people still visit a physical bank branch when they need to use their financial institution’s services, many have also embraced online banking, using it to transfer money between accounts, deposit checks, and track their transactions. For some, online banking is considerably more convenient, as it can take place at any time. In some cases, banks have offered consumers special perks to get them to use online services primarily, such as waiving overdraft fees or account fees.

Heightened awareness of security: Data security is important during any type of transaction that takes place online. It is perhaps even more important in the banking world, as people’s life savings are often at stake. In response to data breaches, financial institutions have placed an emphasis on improving security and protecting private data. Since a bank might not have the resources or knowledge to focus on data protection on its own, working with fintech companies, which do have an understanding of vulnerabilities and ways to protect against them, is proving to be essential.

When banks and fintechs partner up, they can harness recent changes in behavior and use of technology and capitalize on the higher levels of trust people have in tech to provide services that effectively engage with consumers.

Benefits of Fintech Collaborations With Banks

Ninety-four percent of financial services companies said they were confident that fintech would help to grow their company’s revenue over the next two years. Ninety-five percent of technology companies said the same. The benefits of fintech for banks go beyond increasing revenue though. Some additional advantages of fintech and bank collaboration include:

Building up brand reputation: If one of the partnering companies has a good reputation, that reputation can trickle down to the other company when the two work together. One example of fintech in banking is if a highly regarded fintech company launches an app with a bank, the bank can profit from the stature and status of the fintech company. Another way that the partnership can improve reputation is by demonstrating to a consumer base that the two companies have their customers’ best interests in mind.

Offering more functions and features to consumers: A partnership between a fintech company and a financial services company allows the bank to offer its customers useful features and functions that it wasn’t previously able to provide, such as money management tools or mobile check deposits.

Increased ease-of-use: Online banking features and apps should be user-friendly and easy for consumers to figure out and make the most of. When a bank works closely with a fintech, it can benefit from the company’s technological know-how and user experience knowledge to provide consumers with a program that is intuitive and easy-to-use. Thirteen percent of financial services companies ranked ease-of-use as the most important concern to address when trying to retain customers.

Broadened consumer base: A bank and fintech partnership can be a bit of a “you scratch our back; we’ll scratch yours” arrangement. Through the partnership, each company can tap into the existing consumer base of the other, allowing them to broaden their market share and reach previously uncontacted customers. For example, a fintech might find that it can reach older customers as a result of its connection with a bank, while the bank finds that the partnership brings a younger demographic its way.

Reduced costs: It can often be much less expensive for a bank to work with a fintech on improving the digital services it offers customers than for it to try to find ways to improve those services on its own.

Ability to scale quickly: The partnership between fintechs and banks can be quickly scaled up or down, depending on consumer response and overall needs. If the initial partnership is a success, the two companies can brainstorm ways to deepen the relationship or to add more services or features. If it is not a success, pulling the plug or changing course is also relatively easy to do.

Types of Fintech Partnerships

All good partnerships require a bit of give-and-take. In the case of fintech and bank partnerships, each company usually has something the other needs. Banking fintech companies often have the ideas for a great product or service to offer, while traditional banks offer regulatory compliance and familiarity with financial rules and regulations.

Several different categories of partnership exist, depending on the product or service on offer.

Banking: Several traditional banks have joined up with neobanks, also known as challenger banks, to provide digital savings and checking accounts to consumers or businesses. Often the neobanks have features that traditional banks do not offer, such as being online-only or rounding up transactions and automatically saving the difference.

Small business loans: Another partnership category allows fintech companies to benefit from the lending ability of a traditional bank. Some companies focus specifically on developing loan programs for small businesses, a sector that often finds it difficult to get financing from more traditional lenders.

Personal or consumer loans: Another option is for a fintech to work with a traditional bank to offer loans to consumers. The loans can be in the form of installment loans or credit cards. Often, the lending programs are targeted to consumers who might be otherwise shut out of or unable to get a loan from a traditional lender, such as people with low credit or those who only want to borrow a small amount.

Debit cards: Some partnerships involve the issuance of debit cards or prepaid cards. Often, the card programs reach people who would otherwise be unbanked or who might be more wary of opening an account with a traditional financial institution.

Although a traditional bank is likely to offer a variety of products, such as loans and savings accounts as well as services for individuals and businesses, generally speaking, the typical bank and fintech partnership focuses on one product. The goal is to accentuate the services of the bank, rather than fully replace them.

When a bank is looking for fintech companies to partner with, it often makes the most sense to work with the businesses that already have an established customer base. One example is Uber, the ride-share company that also announced plans to offer a digital wallet and debit cards.

The partnerships between fintechs and banks can also take several different forms, depending on the needs of each partner. One common option is for a fintech to lease a bank its program, under a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Using SaaS, a bank can offer its own white-label product, such as a financial management app or a digital wallet.

Another option is to use the referral model. For example, a fintech company might work with a client through all the stages of the lending process, then transfer ownership of the loan over to a traditional bank. Alternatively, a bank might direct a consumer to a fintech if it believes the services offered by the fintech company are a better fit.

Challenges Facing Fintechs

Although there are notable advantages of a bank and fintech partnership, there are also some potential challenges to address. One of the most notable challenges concerns regulatory requirements. Before entering into a partnership together, both parties should be clear on the compliance rules. For example, a bank might consider checking with a fintech to learn more about what it does to ensure all regulations are followed and to reduce the risk of fraud.

Another challenge that faces fintech and bank partnerships is the risk of losing money. The challenge is particularly notable for partnerships that center around making loans. A bank that agrees to service loans made by a fintech might want to have a plan in place in case a considerable number of borrowers end up defaulting.

Security is another challenge fintech and banks face. Data breaches have become a part of life, with 1,196 breaches being reported in the first quarter of 2020. Companies need to find a way to keep the private information of consumers and businesses private, as well as a way to let those customers know that their personal information is secure.

Reputation and recognition are two additional concerns that can face banks and fintech companies. A traditional bank that wants to improve its image in the eyes of consumers can benefit from a partnership with a well-known fintech or with a technology company that is beginning to dip its toes into financial services. But it can be challenging for a new or relatively unknown fintech company to convince an established bank to pair up.

One solution to that issue might be for the fintech company to offer the bank access to its products or services on a white-label basis. The bank can brand the software or product created by the fintech, getting the technology out into the world and potentially improving its reputation and enlarging its customer base as it does so.","Continued collaboration and partnerships between fintech companies and banks are essential for the future of the financial services industry and the technology sector.

Making its best efforts to provide dealers with the most intimate virtual booth experience possible during CEDIA Expo Virtual 2020, the company is launching its Premium Products and Premium Partnerships initiative.

Jeff Goldstein, head of sales custom installation channel, Sony Electronics explains the company is going to great lengths to provide show attendees with a booth experience that mimics a normal-year, in-person booth visit at CEDIA Expo.

“We are actually building a version of the CEDIA booth in our headquarters in San Diego, and we will be doing live broadcasts from our show floor right to the CEDIA Expo. We will have tour guides from our team taking tours through the entire booth presenting the new products, reviewing existing products, and we’ve got a lot of exciting things planned as part of this event,” comments Goldstein.

“So, we’re making a big effort to make sure that this approximates being live on the show floor is as close as we possibly can under today’s circumstances.”

Some of the noteworthy happenings in the Sony virtual booth include the launch of several new products that address the projection and television categories, and the availability of Sony Professional product line to support dealers’ commercial installations.

In addition to the products, Goldstein points out that Sony will also provide industry education to its booth visitors.

“So, when COVID hit, our team kind of quickly reorganized themselves around doing virtual trainings. And, so during the early stages we actually had each of our trainers put together almost like a studio in their homes with a green screen, two cameras, switchers and the whole bit,” says Goldstein.

“We will actually be posting all of our key technical trainings for televisions, projectors, as well as receivers on the CEDIA website for people to be able to tune in and look at during the course of the CEDIA broadcasts.”

Summarizing the company’s goals for the virtual event, Goldstein adds the focus of Sony show efforts is to help dealers utilize and leverage their partnerships with Sony.

“[Our goal for the show is] to demonstrate how the Sony partnership is really important for us, and for our dealers. Supporting our dealers is critical. We are making the theme of our CEDIA show this year Premium Products and Premium Partnerships because the partnership is just as important to us as the products that we sell,” he emphasizes.

“We are really kind of trying to wrap all of that around the CEDIA event this year.”

About St. Louis Crisis Nursery

The Nursery is the premier child abuse prevention program in the St. Louis region. Exceptional outcomes, including a track record that 99% of children in our program remain free from abuse and neglect, have set national and even international standards for child abuse prevention in other communities throughout the world.

We began as a respite care program for families dealing with unexpected crises; the Nursery now works to address the whole family, including parent empowerment training, community outreach centers located directly in at-risk communities, food insecurity programs, the Latino Outreach Program, and home and field visits. In 2016, the Nursery celebrated the opening of a new Outreach Center in Ferguson, in partnership with St. Peters UCC Church, to maintain a presence in the community following the unrest in the region in 2014. Perhaps most remarkably, in our 34-year history, we have protected and preserved the childhoods of more than 120,000 girls and boys.

This year, nearly 5,000 will call the Nursery ""home"" while their families weather the storms of life.

205,https://www.tes.com/news/how-use-online-partnerships-teach-climate-change,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",TES News,How online school partnerships can help climate change education,"We’re often told that small changes can make a difference when it comes to protecting the environment. But it can be hard to see the impact of these changes.

So Tom Cadman, a teacher at Littlecoates Primary in Grimsby, was thrilled when he found out that a Year 6 pupil had stopped her mother from getting single-use plastic bags at the supermarket.

That pupil had been involved in a zero-waste learning project developed through the Connecting Classrooms Through Global Learning programme, a partnership from the British Council and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which provides resources and support to help teachers deliver lessons and projects around the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, as well as offering funding for international partnerships and continuing professional development for teachers around global issues.

Littlecoates paired with a school in Morocco, and together pupils tracked the journey of waste in both countries, highlighting the dangers surrounding plastic pollution, and how it ends up on the shores of different countries around the world.

The pupils told their partner school counterparts about daily life in their communities, attitudes towards the environment and habits to do with waste, including where it ends up.

Helping pupils to understand climate change

Cadman says the partnership was instrumental in helping his pupils to understand climate issues on a global scale.

“The children were given exposure to some of these issues and their impact on the world, and how they can make small changes that can contribute to the planet,” he says.

“They found that if you don’t dispose of waste properly it could end up on the other side of the world, and that gives them that motivation to try to make a difference. And you can just see the small difference that makes. It is having an impact.""

Like Littlecoates, Holy Rood High School in Edinburgh has been working with schools internationally with the help of the Connecting Classrooms programme.

Teacher Sandy Radford explains that the school has partnered with colleagues in Tanzania for two decades, but more recently became lead for a cluster of 20 partnerships between schools in Scotland and Tanzania, focusing on global learning around sustainability and climate change.

Each school has committed to building a project around sustainability. Holy Rood’s partner school in Tanzania, for example, has led a series of zero-waste lessons using resources from Connecting Classrooms, and pupils have since started an eco group, campaigning to get recycling bins into schools.

Through the online partnerships, schools are able to share updates on their progress and discuss issues surrounding the climate, particularly those facing their own communities. Radford says this helps to bust stereotypes.

“It’s about building empathy and connection, thinking about what it would be like if you were in a different situation. For example, why does Tanzania care so much about sustainability that they've banned plastic bags? Because they’re feeling climate change so much harder.”

Online partnerships are a way “we can support kids to become global citizens”, Radford adds.

Supporting pupils to become global citizens

“We’ve used our partnership as a lens to teach about sustainability, showing that there are students who are experiencing real hardships and challenges because of climate change.

“We want to try and strike a balance between making sure we're taking personal responsibility for things, but recognising we're part of something bigger and we need our kids to be global citizens as well.”

Although communication between international schools can be a challenge sometimes, Radford advises schools considering bringing global learning in through online partnerships to “go for it”, as the programme is incredibly valuable for students and teachers alike, in the classroom and beyond.

“We saw a massive overlap between the kids involved in the project and signing petitions and writing letters. It keeps them engaged in the world around them,” he adds.

Building bridges

“You are building bridges and friendships. It really is a wonderful thing,” says David Smith from Edenderry Primary School in Banbridge, Northern Ireland.

Smith has developed a Europe-wide environment project through the online community for schools – eTwinning, which has received over 800,000 teachers registrations, is co-founded by Erasmus+, the European Union, and is managed in the UK by the British Council.

Using eTwinning’s online tools, which lets teachers network, discuss various projects and ideas with colleagues around the world, he connected online with a teacher in Spain who previously had a career as an arborist and landscape designer.

They combined their expertise to develop a project that became Tree Detectives, involving around 25 schools across Europe, from Turkey to Latvia, to Finland.

Students collect data about trees in the area surrounding their school, and get to understand about their growth by identifying leaves and budding patterns throughout the year.

Working with citizen science app iNaturalist, students share the data around species and trends with scientists to help them better understand changes in seasons and the climate.

“It reaffirmed that the trend is and has been that the seasons are more erratic, as the budding is becoming earlier. Therefore, we asked, what is making these changes? We made observations, for example – unnatural heat waves at different times of the year.”

These observations were shared between the schools, and so the project coordinated well with the curriculum, especially maths, science and language, Smith says.

The international aspect was vital. “It reinforces learning. We could do it in an isolated fashion within the playground. But when you have collaboration – which is what eTwinning is all about – you’re getting students to look outside the four walls of the classroom, and the nation that you live in.

“We wanted to promote students to look at themselves as citizens of the planet, not just Northern Ireland or the UK.""

""What has become clear is that no one can tackle the COVID-19 crisis alone. We all need to work together,"" he said in his message to the 'Partnership Report 2019: Building Strong Partnerships for Shared Progress.'

""The COVID-19 crisis has not reduced the need for partnerships. On the contrary, it has greatly increased the need for partnerships. Our 2019 report shows that ADB has a strong basis to work from.""

The report details ADB's co-financing activities in 2019 with bilateral and multilateral institutions, the private sector and other development partners. ADB's financing partners committed 11.86 billion dollars in 2019 to projects to help advance development in Asia and the Pacific.

Some 4.89 billion dollars of this supported ADB's sovereign operations. Of this, 4.51 billion dollars comprised loans that ADB partners provided alongside ADB's own loans.

In addition, ADB mobilised 372 million dollars in grant co-financing last year which allowed technical assistance or other components to be added to ADB's sovereign projects for the benefit of ADB's developing members.

Co-financing in ADB's private sector operations reached 6.97 billion dollars in 2019. For every dollar of ADB's private sector long-term investments, an additional 1.50 dollars in long-term financing from partners were mobilised.

Working with more than 50 financing partners on 167 projects and other development initiatives, ADB's partnerships delivered outcomes that would not have been possible without shared resources and collaboration, the report says, from increased cross-border trade and tourism to connecting remote rural communes to the power grid and setting up women to succeed in businesses.

""Even in normal times, strong partnerships are vital for ADB,"" said Asakawa. ""Bringing along partners enables ADB to provide better solutions and to mobilise more resources to address the complex challenges that our developing member countries face.""

In a recently-held forum on financing for development, Asakawa said that re-building the post-pandemic economy must include green, resilient and inclusive measures, adding that these issues require the mobilisation of even larger financial resources than anticipated before the pandemic.

The report showcases stories that illustrate the concrete impact of ADB's financing partnerships on the ground and how they are aligned with the seven operational priorities of ADB's Strategy 2030 and its vision of a prosperous, inclusive, resilient and sustainable Asia and the Pacific.

It also provides a summary of the different types of financing partnerships that supported ADB's sovereign operations and identifies newly co-financed projects in 2019.

ADB's partnerships have been an effective platform to engage its member economies on the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals and the identification of new investments that will accelerate progress toward the targets, the report says.

Beyond financing, ADB's partners share their expertise and experience which helps improve aid effectiveness.

By Alyssa Cole, Office of Public Affairs

EPA’s Brownfields Program helps communities assess and clean up brownfield sites so they can be sustainably reused. In Iowa, more than 125 sites have been assessed using federal resources. While some require oversight, others need less redevelopment intervention.

A brownfield is a property or site where suspected contamination has prevented its use or redevelopment. Cleaning up and reusing these sites increases property values, job growth, and local tax revenues.

Manchester – Riverfront Park

Riverfront Park in Manchester was once the site of Smitty’s Appliance, an auto service shop, and accompanying gas station. It sat abandoned for over 40 years. The site was included in a larger plan to redevelop the area that runs alongside the Maquoketa River, which travels through the community and was connected to a hydroelectric dam. This historic low-head dam was deemed a safety hazard for recreational use of the river and was removed in 2014.

(Photo credit: City of Manchester.)Part of the plan to redevelop the area included making the river more accessible and safer to use, along with the creation of a whitewater flow for recreational use. Running alongside the Maquoketa River, the Manchester Brownfield Site had underground storage tanks, the contents of which were unknown.

“It’s the fear of what’s there, potentially hazardous contaminants, that prevents people from using the property,” said Jennifer Morris, EPA Region 7 project manager for the site.

Mel Pins, Brownfields program manager for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)Exit, discovered the underground storage tanks, and following an assessment, found that their contents were non-hazardous. The assessment did, however, indicate the presence of asbestos materials on the property, the cleanup of which was funded by a cost-match grant from EPA.

“The Brownfields Program was instrumental in getting rid of hurdles that were in the way of them realizing their vision. They could approach their redevelopment project confidently and safely because we assisted with this assessment and cleanup funding,” Pins said.

Following the cleanup of the Manchester Brownfield Site in 2019, Riverfront Park has been transformed into a bustling public access point for the city’s Whitewater ParkExit. And where Smitty’s Appliance once blocked access to the Maquoketa River, with help from EPA, the site now serves as an access point, complete with amenities such as public restrooms, showers, event space, walking and biking trails, and kiosks telling the story of the park. EPA’s contribution of nearly $38,000 resulted in area redevelopment totaling over $1.3 million.

Council Bluffs – Harvester Warehouses

In 2005, Council Bluffs received an EPA Brownfields Assessment Grant to evaluate one of the Harvester Warehouses.

Artspace, a nonprofit real estate developer focused on creating affordable spaces for artists, hoped to revitalize the 100-year-old abandoned industrial warehouse. Council BluffsExitused the $200,000 grant to assess the environmental hazards at the site in 2006.

Due to railroad activity, the abandoned brick warehouse in the heart of the city’s industrial district was impacted by heavy metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination in its upper soils. The Pottawattamie County Development Corporation (PCDC) purchased the property in 2003 and enrolled in the IDNR Voluntary Cleanup Program. IDNR awarded PCDC a $23,000 EPA Brownfields Cleanup Grant, which assisted in soil cleanup at the site in late 2008.

The contributions of different organizations working together makes the redevelopment of these brownfield sites so successful. “We like to help turn brownfields from obstacles into opportunities,” Pins said.

The combined efforts proved fruitful. The renovation of the warehouse was completed in July 2010 and includes 36 residential lofts, an artist’s studio, office space, art galleries, and showrooms. While the goal was to create a mixed-use space where artists can live, create and work, redevelopment of the Harvester Warehouse also contributed to an area-wide revitalization of downtown Council Bluffs.

BEFORE: Harvester II Warehouse. (Photo credit: City of Council Bluffs.)Following the successful development of the first Harvester Warehouse, the city used another $200,000 award to assess and clean up a second one, which was built in the 1890s and used as an agricultural implement warehouse until about 1968. It was then used by a video equipment rental business and as a storage facility. The property was contaminated with PAHs, metals, volatile organic compounds, and asbestos.

“To clean up the second Harvester building, the city of Council Bluffs and I worked with the state of Iowa Historic Preservation Office to ensure that historic features of the building were protected during the abatement of asbestos,” Morris said. “Later, when I visited the site during its redevelopment by PACE, I experienced the grandeur of the preserved windows in the open concept function hall. The second life of the building is transforming the industrial downtown of Council Bluffs and is becoming a destination for education, entertainments and events for diverse patrons.”

Courtney Harter, Housing and Economic Development manager for Council Bluffs, echoed these sentiments: “Fifteen years ago, the Harvester buildings were vacant warehouses that many believed should be demolished. Local leaders had a vision for this area that would spotlight its uniqueness and save the historic buildings. With the help of EPA’s Brownfield Assessment and Cleanup programs, Council Bluffs created the Harvester Lofts, which won the Phoenix Award in 2015, and now the Hoff Family Arts and Culture Center. Without the Assessment and Cleanup programs, no developer would be willing to create projects of this magnitude on the previously contaminated ground.

AFTER: Hoff Family Arts and Culture Center. (Photo credit: Pottawattamie Arts, Culture and Entertainment.)“The completion of the $27 million Hoff Center showcases the importance of EPA’s program to identify opportunities and mitigate contamination that may stand in the way of redevelopment. We are incredibly grateful to EPA for its continued support of Council Bluffs and the impact made in our community.”

EPA continues to partner with the city of Council Bluffs, recently providing an additional $300,000 Brownfields Assessment Grant. City officials will use the grant to conduct 23 environmental site assessments. Grant funds will also be used to inventory brownfield sites, develop two site-specific cleanup plans, and support community outreach and reuse planning. Assessment activities will focus on the city’s South Expressway Corridor, part of a Qualified Opportunity Zone. Areas with priority sites include the Arts and Cultural District, 16th Avenue area west of the South Expressway, and Iowa Highway 275 area north of Lake Manawa.

Iowa City – Riverfront Crossings District

On June 15, 2008, floodwaters crested the Coralville Reservoir at 31½ feet, the highest ever recorded. Residents of Iowa City had only five days’ notice before this 500-year flood event covered 1,600 city acres. Volunteers from the city and the University of Iowa filled more than 100,000 sandbags per day, amounting to over 1 million bags by the time the flooding stopped.

Iowa City’s Riverfront Crossings District. (Photo credit: David Doyle, EPA.)Still, nearly 100 homes were irreparably damaged and 20 university buildings flooded. Iowa City suffered over $6.5 million in total property damage, while damage to the University of Iowa was valued at $230 million.

The Riverfront Crossings District (RCD)Exitsustained immense flood damage. In 2009, EPA partnered with Iowa City along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Rebuild Iowa Office, a state agency formed to assist in post-flood rebuilding, to create a Market Study Overview, Transportation Options Memo, and urban design options for the flood-damaged areas of the RCD.

The next year, the city applied for additional EPA assistance and was chosen as one of five cities nationwide to participate in a Brownfields Pilot Project. The project centered on development planning.

Partners and support agencies included:

City of Iowa City Departments of Planning, Transportation, Public Works, and Parks and Recreation

EPA Region 7

Iowa Department of Natural Resources

Johnson County (Iowa) Council of Governments

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

U.S. Department of Transportation

Rebuild Iowa Office

Together, these partners developed a plan for the RCD with six primary goals:

Create a resilient riverfront park system Create a network of green streets Promote sustainable design practices Develop a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented district Enhance Ralston Creek to become a community asset Develop a multi-modal transportation network

When asked about EPA’s role, Iowa City Planner Karen Howard said, “EPA technical assistance was helpful in many ways. It helped us get the ball rolling, so to speak, and think about development and the river in a different way – and think about infill differently, as well. Overall, the workshop and other technical assistance were very positive.”

In 2011, after drafting the initial redevelopment plans, the Iowa City community took the lead. They completed the Riverfront Crossings Park master planExitin 2015. Ralston Creek was restored in 2017. Wetlands and trails were created as part of the restoration. And a nature play area was completed in 2018.

Riverfront Crossings Park in Iowa City. (Photo credit: David Doyle, EPA.)“The difference between what is there now and what was there 10 years ago is incredible,” said David Doyle, community revitalization coordinator for EPA Region 7. “EPA aided in plans for long-term recovery, focusing on how to rebuild in a sustainable way. The city took those plans and expanded them, spending well over $100 million. It’s a great success story, and they plan to continue to build alongside the river and attract new development in the future.”

Today, the RCD is home to retail, restaurants, housing and breweries, with plans to continue building in the area.

“One of the highlights of my planning career was the Riverfront Crossings work that was funded by EPA. The plan has been very useful to the city and is helping transform the area into a cool urban neighborhood,” said Robert Miklo, former Iowa City senior planner.

Looking Forward

EPA Region 7 is committed to assisting communities with improving and revitalizing brownfield sites, regardless of the project scale. While some sites may require continuous support, others may simply require the assurance established by site assessments, which help community partners attract investors. And investment turns dreams into reality. The development of mixed-use spaces at former brownfield sites brings people together to create vibrant, active communities.

As Iowa City, Council Bluffs, and Manchester demonstrate, Brownfields cleanup and revitalization does much more than transform abandoned, contaminated properties; it contributes to millions of dollars in leveraged redevelopment, ultimately transforming the communities within which they reside. Brownfields redevelopment encourages the creation of community through space.","Iowa City – Riverfront Crossings DistrictOn June 15, 2008, floodwaters crested the Coralville Reservoir at 31½ feet, the highest ever recorded.

While trying to achieve these goals, however, the country faces constantly rising public debt, minimal GDP growth, inefficient state-owned enterprises and the devastating effects of state capture, corruption and mismanagement of public funds.

So, as we try to predict what our post-Covid-19 future looks like, let’s consider what realistic, tangible growth prospects are available in South Africa, and whether we’re asking the right questions. For example, do we have the right public-private partnerships in place? What role do we expect government to play in reviving our economy? And what role does the private sector have in this revival?

We need debt – but only with returns

The last decade has seen a rapid – and worrying – rise of public debt. When you put this in a global context, South Africa came out of the 2008 global financial crisis with much more debt in the world market than before. We weren’t alone in this, but in the years since, other countries who had also emerged from 2008’s crisis with significant debt, have managed to grow their economies and compensate for this. In contrast, the South African economy has remained largely stagnant for over a decade now, with growing levels of unemployment, all contributing to rampant debt levels.

As we deal with the economic impact of Covid-19, I wouldn’t pretend to argue with Minister Mboweni about attaining more debt in the process – there is no doubt that it is needed. But, as we accrue this additional debt, we also need to be able to trust that government will spend this borrowed money productively, in areas where it would have the broadest sustainable impact, and not be squandered or lost, as has unfortunately happened in the past. This is the challenge we face as a country.

We also need to consider whether South Africa will ever reach the point where our revenue growth will exceed the growth in the debt we accrue. Countries need debt to grow – to a point – and debt actually isn’t the enemy in this case.

But the question to be asked is whether citizens will get a return on the incurred debt, that exceeds what we will have to repay to service the debt. As citizens, do we trust that our money is getting used correctly, in sustainable initiatives that are more likely than not going to generate a return in excess of the cost of the debt? And how can we use our country’s resources more strategically, to enable this growth? Strong public-private sector partnerships and an understanding of government’s role versus the private sector’s role, come to mind.

Public-private partnerships will work, if done right

There is an ongoing, and yet growing, concern about what we as a country need to do to increase foreign investment in South Africa. Despite the economic challenges we face, investors have their different ambits and are willing to take risks with their money, for the right return. So, a key question for us to ask here is – how do we create the right return for foreign investors, to shore up our international revenue?

There is a lot of talk about public-private sector partnerships playing a role in funding government projects and state-owned enterprises like SAA. Without these initiatives, creating trust and investment into the sustainable enterprises generating returns to all stakeholder, South Africa would be forced to print money to continue to support the economy. However, similar to debt, if this money is not deployed in projects that generate returns in excess of the cost of the impact of this economic support strategy, the same economic spiral will continue.

However, if we could trust the execution of the economic growth initiatives, we’d be in a better position to assess the short- and long-term impact of these various economic strategies. This is where the legacy of state capture and corruption comes to the fore, and our subsequent lack of trust. Edelman’s 2020 Trust Barometer puts South Africa as the country that trusts its government least – just 20 percent of South Africans expressed faith in Government, well below the 49 percent global average.

The reality is that public-private partnerships can work, and Government can regain our trust. We’ve seen this recently in the partnership with our biggest banks to implement the Covid-19 state-backed loan scheme in which banks lent money to organisations in need during the pandemic lockdown. So far, all evidence shows that this has been a productive partnership: instead of attempting to implement the scheme themselves, government sought banks’ expertise, acknowledging they were better placed to perform the credit checks, and gave the banks a guarantee to minimise their risk – allowing them to take the reins and do what they do best.

These are the kind of partnerships South Africa desperately needs to instil trust in future government-led projects, and get our growth back on track. By partnering with the appropriate private organisations, government’s role would be to simply encourage the ease of process, make it as easy as possible to execute on the transaction, and provide some of the necessary financial support in equity and state-backed guarantees.

Take our energy crisis as an example. The job creation potential in trying to help the energy supply situation in this country is immense. Do we trust Eskom to develop a nuclear power plant? Certainly not at the moment, given the legacy created in recent years. It would be easier to place trust in a company that has a reputable history in the industry, with a legacy of great management, executing on a project and delivering a return on the investment.

Trust will unlock opportunity

Having this kind of working partnership with government can unlock significant levels of foreign investment. The problem is it is predicated on the idea that government offers this support and enables the company or consortium to run independently. We need open regulations that enable us to operate this way. If we want to create jobs, there is a lot of opportunity in South Africa to do so, but the existing bureaucratic and unnecessary red tape is getting in the way.

I am encouraged when President Ramaphosa and Minister Mboweni say “we’re at a turning point” and that “now is the time to grow a new South Africa”. However, I have to work harder to trust that the government at large can put politics aside and grow the country towards a new future. Can we achieve what we always set out to achieve, or are we going down the same old roads that lead us nowhere?

To ensure this isn’t the case, government needs to let others in, enter the right private-public partnerships to instil trust, achieve returns on investment, and gather momentum.

As American politician Richard Caroll said, “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will all say: we did it ourselves”. With that in mind, it’s time for Government to take a step back, partner with businesses and people that offer the best shot at success, and enable the private sector to do what we do best for the good of the country.

The pair will be the new faces of the integrated campaign which will include print and online advertising, content and virtual events.

""To partner with Davis and Bashir was an easy decision,"" said Porter Gale, Chief Marketing Officer at Personal Capital. ""Money continues to be a taboo subject, and through the platforms of Davis and Bashir, and their passion for raising awareness around financial literacy, we can spark a conversation that encourages more people to find financial empowerment.""

After a 17-year career as a professional basketball player, Davis is now on a path defined by entrepreneurship, investing, philanthropy, and activism. The founder of several companies, including Sports Lifestyle in Culture (SLIC), The Black Santa Company, Business Inside the Game (BIG) and No Label, Davis will use his passion and influence to be a voice for financial literacy.

""The whole subject of money should be simplified,"" said Davis.

Financial literacy needs a new buzzword, a new platform, and I'm excited to bring an emphasis to financial literacy with a brand like Personal Capital.""

Ruzwana Bashir is also a new face for the ""Financial Heroes"" campaign. Raised in a traditional British Pakistani household, through hard work and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, Bashir broke the glass ceiling and became a successful company founder, entrepreneur and CEO.

HE Dr Al Jaber, who was joined in the virtual meeting by HE Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Technology, committed to working with the ICC and directly with the private sector, in particular to increase the UAE’s in-country value by nurturing the SME sector and creating sustainable jobs.

For the first time, the ICC meeting also included key members from the UAE private sector, who engaged with the group on their views on how to enhance current regulatory and policy challenges in order to empower industrial sector growth and sustainability in the UAE.

Dr Al Jaber said: “We have a formidable opportunity ahead to realise the ambitions of our leadership, play a pivotal role in the future of our national economy and achieve the three national priorities set forth which include empowering national industrial development, ensuring in-country value and raising the competitiveness of our industries.

“A key enabler for success will be an active engagement with both the public and private sector to ensure regulatory and legislative frameworks are optimal, relevant and adapt to the realities of today and are flexible enough to provide the right platform for the change and growth our leadership envisages in the decades ahead,” he said. “We must leverage the fundamental building blocks that are already in place, including our world-class logistics infrastructure, unique energy assets and a leading position in technological innovation and AI education, to drive our economy into the fourth industrial age.”

He added that: “Through our work with the Council and its working groups, we will align on goals and initiatives, identify, consult on and resolve issues at emirate and federal levels, test and prototype policies before they are rolled out and engage with the industries, technology leaders and companies as a listening, constructive partner.”

Her Excellency Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Technology, said: “What is critically important is that we align our efforts in adopting 4IR technologies – including the Internet of Things, real time data analytics and robotics – to enable and support current industries. Our objective must be to drive efficiencies, economies and evolutions in their production and fabrication processes and to position the UAE as a driver of change and development for industry. As part of those efforts, we will establish new industrial clusters that both utilise and develop advanced technologies – supporting home-grown enterprises and attracting investors and investment. As a Ministry, we will work with our partners in public and private sectors to concentrate research and development efforts and output on the technological needs of the industrial sector for the benefit of today’s and tomorrow’s economies.”

The Ministry aims to implement the vision of the leadership by enhancing the contribution of advanced technology to the sustainability of economic growth, raising the efficiency and competitiveness of the industrial sector in the country and supporting strategic industries that contribute to advancing the national economy and increasing the gross domestic product.

Omaha-based Orion Advisor Solutions announced on Thursday an overhaul of its Orion Portfolio Solutions turnkey asset management platform.

The updates will include a new risk-scoring system, turnkey Market Cycle Advised Mandates UMA portfolios, access to Schwab’s custodial services and access to additional strategies from Fidelity Institutional.

Along with the new risk-scoring technology, Orion’s update reduces the platform’s client-facing risk assessment to seven questions.

“Investors demand to see their priorities, market attitudes, and long-term goals reflected in their relationships with their advisors,” said Rusty Vanneman, Chief Investment Officer of Orion Advisor Solutions. “The new technology and expanded partnerships we’ve invested in our TAMP offering break asset management out of its silo and connect it to a more complete and engaging process. We’re proud to have built an experience that excites investors and encourages growth and long-term success for advisors.”

Orion offers advisors its Market Cycle Mandates, a model-based three-mandate diversification process encompassing beta, intended to capture market movements; active management to adjust to market changes, and diversifiers to offer a low-correlation source of returns. The new offering creates turnkey UMA portfolios from these mandates with no platform or strategist fees using predominantly third-party investment strategies.

The updates also include an extension of Market*r, Orion’s automated prospecting and campaign building software, to users of the Orion Portfolio Solutions TAMP. A recently released proposal-generation solution helps advisors tie investment proposals to investors’ needs.

While Orion has an extant partnership with Schwab, the updates expand that partnership to bring Schwab into the TAMP as a custodian.

And with Fidelity, Orion has added eight additional model portfolios to its TAMP and more than 30 model portfolios and model-delivered SMAs to its Communities model marketplace.

That fact, plus Gaggle’s high success in saving student lives (927 in the 2019–20 school year), has resulted in 95% of districts renewing subscriptions to Gaggle’s student safety solution, up from the previous year. In addition, 286 districts across 42 states have implemented services with Gaggle since March.

“The School District of Osceola County utilizes multiple systems to protect its students in an increasingly complex digital world,” said Superintendent Dr. Debra Pace. “Gaggle is one system that the district relies on to monitor the safety of our students’ Microsoft email and OneDrive, and has proven itself on multiple occasions, especially during possible student situations. During the last year, the district was notified of 14 possible student situations, including issues of violence and suicide. Knowing that Gaggle is monitoring the safety of our students is a great comfort.”

For more than 20 years, Gaggle has helped thousands of districts avoid tragedies and save lives while also protecting against district liability. The company helps ensure student safety in digital spaces by providing real-time monitoring of the use of online tools within Google’s G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, and the Canvas learning management system for more than 4.5 million students across the United States.

Gaggle’s machine learning technology watches for specific words and phrases that might indicate potentially harmful behavior. An in-house team of trained safety professionals with backgrounds in law enforcement, psychology, social work, suicide prevention, and crisis management evaluates flagged content for false positives, categorizes incidents, and determines their severity. The team then alerts district personnel to policy violations, inappropriate content, critical mental health issues, and imminent danger to students.

“Gaggle has become an integral part of our district’s strategy for keeping students safe on campus and at home,” said Alvin McQuarters, chief technology officer for Irving Independent School District. “Within 48 hours of deployment, Gaggle notified key district administrators of an incident involving possible student abuse and self-harm. The program has an outstanding notification process that includes vetting, categorizing, and prioritizing potential student situations. In fact, Gaggle’s vetting process includes not only a state-of-the-art search engine, but also real people applying sanity checks to data results prior to sending the notifications to district personnel. This significantly reduces time being wasted by our district personnel chasing false positives.”

About Gaggle| www.gaggle.net

Since 1999, Gaggle has been the leader in helping K-12 districts manage student safety on school-provided technology. Using a powerful combination of artificial intelligence and trained safety experts, the safety solution proactively assists districts 24/7/365 in the prevention of student suicide, bullying, inappropriate behaviors, school violence, and other harmful situations. Most importantly, Gaggle continues to help hundreds of districts avoid tragedies and save lives, while also protecting their liability. During the 2019–20 academic year, Gaggle helped districts save the lives of 927 students who were planning or actually attempting suicide.

214,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/forging-institutional-partnerships-in-higher-education-6594732/,"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Indian Express,Forging institutional partnerships in higher education,"Written by Chandrachur Singh, Bijayalaxmi Nanda and Hena Singh

The importance of education in social levelling and ushering in plurality has been widely acknowledged in the realms of policy planning and execution. Concerns, however, have also been flagged in the Indian context on the extent to which education could tangibly lead to transformative and emancipatory objectives, particularly in the face of inhibitors ranging from the historical exclusions of women and other marginalised communities from education processes, to mundane pedagogy, curricular biases, lack of well-informed educators, academic prejudices and bureaucratic rigidities.

Axiomatically, given the peripheral ways in which we have gone about realising the objectives of social change — guided mostly by the need of appeasing communities for political mobilisation and not by the moral imperatives of adhering to social sensibilities and realities, education in itself has become a site for both reproducing and interrupting inequities. The sudden bubbling of online education in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and resurfacing of the ever-gnawing class and gender divides in society only accentuate such feelings.

This is partly because of the inabilities of both, the advocates of social change and educators to forge epistemological bridges between issues of quality, equity and access on the one end and power differentials that exist in the social set-up on the other. In turn, this not only hinders communicative processes between different classes and categories of citizens, but in so doing it also circumvents the material-discursive apparatuses through which social inequalities get into a constantly replicatory and perpetuating mode. Addressing the issue of social inclusion via education as such necessitates a re-look at the interrelationship between quality, equity and access, particularly in the context of the divides that have only got exacerbated in a digital world.

We believe that one good way of achieving the laudable objectives of equity and access is by having academic institutions committed to excellence. Such an argument is ubiquitous in policy parlance, and yet it needs to be re-emphasised, given that establishing institutions of quality learning is easier said than done. This is because academic institutions are not just about erecting buildings of brick and mortar or creating playgrounds. Instead, qualitative academic institutions are about having sensitive, knowledgeable, competent, skilled, committed teachers and highly-motivated and passionate students and the resulting exchange of cognition and knowledge between and amongst the two. It is about providing meaningful education that could confer agency on individuals. Unfortunately, we somehow continue to be guided by the fallacious understanding that institutions of eminence can be established with the stroke of a pen. The dualities, as such, are perceptible. Despite being the world’s third-largest education system, we are still host to a quarter of the world’s extreme poor and have gender disparities. While unemployment is an issue, ask any corporate recruiter and readily comes the reply — it is not unemployment but employability.

It is in this backdrop that a plausible alternative way ahead in the direction of ensuring equity and access to quality learning could be by encouraging partnerships and alliances between institutions that are perceptibly recognised as higher say in terms of national rankings and those who may not be there. The collaborations could start at relatively smaller scales say, for conducting faculty development programmes, or for taking certain initiatives in pedagogy, or even allowing teachers from eminent institutions to deliver few lectures for students of colleges in remote areas. The acceptance of online modes of teaching and learning would only bolster such initiatives.

We believe that such initiatives would not only be mutually advantageous for the partnering institutions but reinforcing as well, in the sense that while in providing outreach opportunities to the mentor institution they would allow it to fulfill its moral and social responsibilities of providing quality teaching and learning to students beyond the confines of its four walls, for the mentee institutions it would simply be an exercise that could motivate and propel it to catch-up with the best practices. Incidentally, the proposal would supplement the mentoring mission objective of the NEP 2020, which is aimed at pooling outstanding scholars for providing support to university and college teachers.

A recent experience of Miranda House, University of Delhi collaborating as a partner with Rama Devi University-Bhubaneshwar, Odisha, gave us a personal insight into the value of such initiatives. The University Grants Commission’s Paramarsh scheme speaks about a similar purpose where a mentor institution provides regular support and learning to a mentee institution so that they achieve excellence through their mutual synergies. The essence and spirit of this scheme can be captured and made a part of the larger goals of education. A dialogic epistemic community of teachers propelled by regular self-driven development programmes committed to sharing, conversing and creative collaborations will go a long way in enriching inclusive value-based education.

A broad outreach without the pressures of gathering points for promotion or just institutional compulsions is the need of the hour. Energising the teachers by developing in them a passion and commitment to equity and access is necessary. The inter-generational gate-keeping of hierarchised teaching-learning including ranks, positions, teacher and teaching needs to be interrogated as well. The synergies or collaborations can be across the board — local, regional, national and international.

Holistic education can only be provided if the teachers are imbued with a sense of cooperative learning and passion to inculcate that in their students. The online modes now provide an opportunity for extensive networks without much cost or the need for infrastructure. The ethics of sharing, empathy and compassion can only be brought about if each institution remains open and porous for this exchange.

Most importantly, such initiatives would be the most cost-effective, innovative and self-sufficing (atmanirbhar) way of realising the objectives of “developing the capacity of the students and the researchers to compete in the global tertiary education marketplace through the acquisition and creation of advanced knowledge in those areas” — so eloquently expressed as part of the mission statement of “Institutions of Eminence Regulations” of the University Grants Commission.

Regarding the U.K.’s proposal to become an ASEAN dialogue partner, Minh said the bloc acknowledged the country’s significant role both regionally and internationally and in the relationship between the U.K. and ASEAN member countries.

""ASEAN member countries are considering the U.K.’s proposal based on ASEAN regulations, as well as cooperation outcomes and commitments of countries in general that seek to become the bloc’s dialogue partners,"" he added.

Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dung, head of the ASEAN Senior Officials’ Meeting Vietnam, had said last week that many countries have proposed setting up partnerships with ASEAN as the bloc’s role and position have advanced in recent times.

ASEAN currently has partner relationships with 16 countries and blocs; and has eight strategic partners - Australia, China, the E.U., India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and the U.S.

The bloc has 10 members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Within the framework of AMM 53 and related meetings held September 9-12 via online conferences, ASEAN’s current partners continued supporting the central role of the bloc in shaping an open, inclusive, transparent and rules-based regional architecture.

ASEAN and its partners agreed to intensify the role and efficiency of ASEAN-chaired forums, including the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), and the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM+).

They reiterated commitments to multilateral cooperation and the framework of relations between countries on the basis of principles of international law, while stepping up fruitful cooperation in coping with emerging challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic.

Minh said that the topic of strategic competition among major countries has been discussed in ASEAN forums, including the EAS and the ARF.

The ministers affirmed their determination to maintain Southeast Asia as a region of peace, security, neutrality and stability while strengthening ASEAN’s central role, unity and resilience. They will also continue promoting trust building, mutual respect and the rule of law in line with the spirit of the Foreign Ministers' Statement on the occasion of marking the 53rd founding anniversary of ASEAN on August 8, 2020.

The statement ""demonstrates the central role of ASEAN and the bloc doesn’t want to be stuck in competition between countries, affecting the peace and stability of the region,"" Minh emphasized.

Regarding initiatives proposed by China, including the linking of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 (MPAC) with Beijing's Belt and Road initiative and on global security data, Deputy PM Minh said ASEAN is an open community and always welcomes partners' initiatives that contribute to mutual development and build an environment of peace, stability and shared prosperity in the region.

All ASEAN members support the initiatives by China, and ministers have assigned relevant agencies of all sides to research in order to make appropriate proposals, Minh added.

South China Sea

Minh said the South China Sea issue has been mentioned in all ASEAN forums in the spirit of calling for parties to contribute to maintaining peace, stability, security, safety and freedom of navigation and aviation in the region.

ASEAN members have called for all parties to respect international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

The South China Sea is known as the East Sea in Vietnam.

""For countries that are members of UNCLOS such as Vietnam, China and other ASEAN countries, compliance with the convention is as a matter of course,"" Minh said, in response to questions on whether China was complying with UNCLOS.

Minh also said that at AMM 53, ASEAN has stressed the significance and interests of peace, stability, security, safety and freedom of navigation and aviation in the South China Sea, confirming they are the interests of all countries. ""This stance has continued to receive the support of partner countries.""

He added that the participating ministers also agreed on the need to promote dialogue, enhance trust building, refrain from acts that would increase tensions and complicate the situation, avoid militarization and using or threatening to use force, and settle disputes through peaceful measures on the basis of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS.

Minh noted that ministers expressed their hope for full and efficient implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and called for the early completion of a binding, effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) in line with international law.

At the press conference, Minh said the ministers adopted 42 documents at the AMM 53 and related meetings, including the joint communique of AMM 53 and the ARF Hanoi Plan of Action II (2020-2025).

Notably, 10 initiatives raised by Vietnam were passed, including the Hanoi statement on the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the EAS and the organization of a meeting of the EAS expert group on the Covid-19 pandemic.

Minh said that as the ASEAN Chair 2020, Vietnam is actively preparing for the 37th ASEAN Summit slated for November this year, hoping that countries would have achieved better control over the Covid-19 crisis by then.

Vietnam has reported 1,060 Covid-19 cases so far, of which 112 are active. It has confirmed 35 Covid-19 deaths. The country has recorded no new domestic transmissions for ten days.","ASEAN reached consensus on cooperation mechanisms with France, Italy, Cuba and Colombia at the 53rd ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (AMM 53) this week.

But it wasn’t until earlier this year that he realised how important it was to buttress the nation’s food supply.

Photos of snaking queues and emptied shelves at supermarkets flooded the Internet after Singapore raised its disease alert level to orange and Malaysia announced a nationwide lockdown.

While the flow of food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia continued despite the lockdown, the panic underscored the importance of strengthening the nation’s food security.

“I think for many years Singapore has been touted as a place with high food security,” says Mr Yeo, 35, co-founder of Archisen, an agri-tech firm that builds, designs and operates indoor farms using an Internet of Things (IoT) approach.

“But the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of our dependence on food imports. On top of that, panic buying behaviour exacerbated the situation.”

To find new ways of growing food within the country’s urban landscape, companies like Archisen are partnering with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) and relevant public agencies to come up with novel concepts and innovations that maximise homegrown food production.

From mind to market

Collaborations among government agencies, such as the Singapore Food Agency and A*Star, institutes of higher learning and companies in the agri-tech space, are part of efforts to achieve Singapore’s ""30 by 30"" goal. The aim is to produce 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs locally by 2030.

Singapore currently imports more than 90 per cent of its food consumed.

“There is room to improve our food security and mitigate potential disruptions like climate change and pandemics,” says Dr Ralph Graichen, senior director at A*Star’s Biomedical Research Council.

“We need to leverage technology to grow more with fewer resources to overcome constraints of space, climate and manpower,” he explains.

A*Star’s work with Archisen is one example.

Since 2018, A*Star’s Bioinformatics Institute (BII) has been working with the 10-man company to improve its yield of lettuce and kale. These are among a variety of local vegetables that the start-up harvests and sells to leading retailers in Singapore through its flagship brand Just Produce.

BII researchers helped the agri-tech company to develop a yield prediction module to incorporate into its intelligent farm management platform known as Croptron.

Operating like the “brain” of Archisen’s urban farming system, Croptron gathers data such as nutrient media and climate conditions using sensors planted at multiple modular farms.

With the prediction module, the platform is able to use artificial intelligence to analyse the data and recommend the optimal conditions needed to maximise the yield and quality of crops.

Says Dr Lee Hwee Kuan, a BII researcher who worked with Archisen on the crop yield prediction module: “The start-up was interested to engage us because of our wide portfolio of technologies and capabilities, including bioinformatics, analytics and artificial intelligence.”

Archisen is currently supporting the operations of a 7,000 sq ft farm in Commonwealth Capital Building at Buroh Lane. The farm has been the site of the start-up’s urban farming activities and can produce up to 100 tonnes of vegetables a year.

There is room to improve our food security and mitigate potential disruptions like climate change and pandemics. We need to leverage technology to grow more with fewer resources to overcome constraints of space, climate and manpower. Dr Ralph Graichen, senior director, A*Star's Biomedical Research Council

Hungry for change

Such partnerships between research institutes and agri-tech start-ups are increasingly important, observes Dr Graichen.

In 2018, another local start-up Eatobe started working with A*Star’s Biotransformation Innovation Platform (Biotrans) to access the research institute’s know-how and research capabilities.

The Biotrans team discovers novel, sustainable biotechnology and produces high value-added ingredients for food and consumer industries within A*Star’s Singapore Institute of Food and Biotechnology Innovation (SIFBI).

This is where Eatobe houses its pilot scale processing equipment to translate laboratory parameters to industrial application for quicker commercialisation of its ingredients and products.

What’s brewing in Eatobe’s lab? A plan to help our bodies digest and absorb nutrients in whole foods, like grains, nuts and seeds, to address the problem of nutritional gaps and nutrient deficiencies.

Led by founder Patrina Phua and a team of three PhD scientists, the start-up has come up with a way to pre-process these ingredients using enzymes and bacteria.

One of their goals is to supply their grain, nut and vegetable ingredients to major food companies like Nestle and Mondelez to promote nutrient absorption on a larger scale. They also plan to roll out consumer products in the form of snack packets of nuts and grains as complete protein substitutes for animal-derived protein from the likes of milk and meat.

In partnering with A*Star, Eatobe’s objective was to produce a prototype of a dietary source of vitamin K2 — a form of vitamin K linked to bone health. According to Eatobe, their product is the only food source of vitamin K2 other than natto and can be sold as a food ingredient or ready-to-eat product.

“This collaboration empowered us to quickly test the feasibility of different research problems, experiment with different equipment and discuss unresolved research gaps with our A*Star colleagues,” says Ms Phua.

Eatobe was able to produce its prototype of the food source six months after the partnership and went on to secure additional investments to fund its research activities with the technology developed during the partnership.

The company is now exploring ways to produce vitamin B and functional protein from sustainable sources such as aquatic plants and mushrooms.

Sophie’s (food) choice

When Eugene Wang discovered that his daughter, Sophie, was allergic to shellfish, he spent sleepless nights trying to find a protein source suitable for her.

Eventually, he stumbled upon the idea of turning microalgae into protein powder, which can then be used to make protein-rich plant-based products. Thus Sophie’s Bionutrients was born.

The start-up, founded by Mr Wang, now has plans to convert microalgae into food items such as protein flour and plant-based milk.

There’s a sustainable twist to this process.

It does not cause environmental damage, depletes fewer resources than the process of extracting animal-based protein and has a much shorter production cycle than animals reared for food.

For example, the start-up’s strain of microalgae can be harvested in just three days compared to the 1.5-year production cycle typically needed for beef. The microalgae is also fermented in soybean residue and spent grains, creating a closed-loop system that reduces waste and pressure on natural resources.

Mr Wang shares that the company's collaboration with A*Star has helped to speed up the development of its technologies and come up with more ideas for its business. A*Star researchers co-developed and provided guidance on the start-up's microalgae strain selection process, growing technologies, and nutrient extraction processes.

Ms Yvonne Chow, junior principal investigator, SIFBI, says: “While Sophie’s Bionutrients understood the product market well, they were not familiar with fermentation.

“As a one-stop fermentation bioprocess development platform to serve the food industry, our Biotrans team was in the best position to help them establish a process to suit their needs in the shortest time.”

Drawing on Biotrans’ technical expertise, the start-up was able to adopt more sustainable and cost-saving production methods and maximise their microalgae yield.

“These technologies are all extremely unique. None of the other companies in the world can put these together in the way we do,” Mr Wang declares excitedly.

With a fresh crop of advancements in the agri-tech sector, there is reason to be optimistic about Singapore’s journey towards increasing food security and resilience.

“There are tremendous opportunities in public-private collaborations to leverage world-class R&D for the rapid development of urban agri-tech solutions,” Dr Graichen says.

“We are excited by innovations among high potential start-ups in this area as they help to reduce our reliance on food imports and develop Singapore into a leading food and nutrition hub in Asia.”

218,https://schoolsweek.co.uk/how-can-school-charity-partnerships-help-tackle-lost-learning/,"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Schools Week,Tackling lost learning through school-charity partnerships,"“Organisations looking to support schools need to be realistic about what they can deliver”

With the national tutoring programme set to launch soon, a roundtable from earlier this year offers useful insights on making partnerships work effectively for all

With students back in school after a year of disruption, teachers have their work cut out for them. Many will be trying to carefully balance the increased need for pastoral care following this year’s distressing events, with the desire to get young people back on track academically.

How to tackle ‘lost learning’ has been on the minds of many in the sector, and worries will only have increased in light of findings from the Education Policy Institute that even before Covid-19, the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers had stopped closing for the first time in a decade.

One way to address this challenge is through school and charity partnerships. Earlier this year, Action Tutoring and the Centre for Education and Youth brought together 22 school and charity leaders to explore how these connections can be maximised to provide extra support for pupils. Our roundtable event showed that partnerships between charities and schools can be hugely beneficial when they work closely and have trust in each other.

It helps if external staff are informed about the working of the school

Since then the National Tutoring Programme has been announced; a government-funded, sector-led initiative to support schools to address the impact of Covid-19 on pupils’ learning. Action Tutoring hopes to be a part of this initiative, along with many other educational charities, and the roundtable’s conclusions can benefit all those involved in delivering on its promise.

The programme provides a whole new opportunity for partnerships. Throughout this academic year schools will be able to build new links with high-quality tutoring organisations across the country to help pupils who have suffered the most from school closures.

Certain barriers need to be overcome to make the most of these partnerships. School staff are busier now than ever, therefore any external provision needs to cause as little disruption as possible and avoid placing additional administrative burden on teachers. So how can this be achieved? The roundtable event highlighted a number of key recommendations from both school and charity leaders.

Agree on aims and how to achieve them

Organisations looking to support schools at this time need to be direct and realistic about what they can deliver, when, and what their non-negotiables are. They must make sure that goals are agreed on upfront, as one school leader explained: “Alignment is really important. Is it going to be something that we have to rejig what we do? If the answer to that is yes, is it definitely going to be worth it?”

Streamline communication

Nominating key points of contact from the outset is essential. Our roundtable contributors suggested that one ‘link’ person on each side of the partnership was the best way to keep communication smooth. At present, it is vital that partners clearly outline their Covid safeguarding procedures in advance.

It also helps if external staff are informed about the working of the school, so their interventions are in line with school policies. One charity leader explained that understanding expectations around uniform or behaviour, as well as being familiar with the timetable, helped them to operate consistently within these boundaries. They advised “over-communication in terms of logistics”.

Reflect, review, refine

Our roundtable highlighted that it is important to build in appropriate opportunities for reflection on how work is progressing and whether students are getting the right support. Schools and their partners should schedule meetings at key points in the year to make sure everything is on track.

Demonstrate impact

School leaders appreciated clear impact evaluations from charity partners, especially when communicating outcomes to governors or trustees. The design of these evaluations should be drawn up collaboratively and schools should aim to share pupil data, even if it is in an anonymised form. Meanwhile, partners should bolster quantitative findings with rich qualitative information. One school leader explained that they found “before and after quotes” from young people the “most powerful” feedback.

Our roundtable attendees worked around logistical challenges to build strong and successful relationships, which provided young people with tailored support. Using the approaches above, schools and other organisations can work together through this busy term and beyond to help students overcome the turmoil they have experienced in 2020.

Klarna and Snoop are hardly the only example of an effective business-celebrity pairing. Nike’s famous “Dream Crazy” spot caused a 31 per cent surge in sales days after its release and boosted brand value by $6bn, but it wouldn’t have fired people up without NFL star turned social activist, Colin Kaepernick.

The resulting “Get Smoooth” campaign (see video below) was by all accounts highly successful. Klarna became the top trending shopping app on Google Play, added 16 million new consumers and increased new merchant sign ups by 140 per cent globally compared to the previous year. Snoop even became a shareholder.

Last year, rapper Snoop Dogg added fintech payments company Klarna to his list of corporate partnerships, alongside brands like Tanqueray Gin, Just Eat and Corona (the beer, not the virus).

Clearly recruiting an A-lister can be a powerful marketing tool for businesses - when they get it right.

Unfortunately, there’s only a thin line between attracting engagement from a star’s fans and being on the receiving end of cancel culture. Customers are quick to call out inauthentic partnerships - especially ones which jump on a purpose in order to boost profits.

Nothing reeks of using a celebrity just for the sake of it more than Pepsi’s ""Live For Now"" campaign featuring Kendall Jenner. The tone-deaf spot - in which the reality TV star approaches armed police, in reference to the iconic moment Ieshia Evans stood defiant in the face of riot police during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2016 - was called out on social media for trivialising police brutality.

Critics questioned the brand’s decision to add a white celebrity who had never previously engaged in social activism into the mix. Jenner’s army of 77.8 million Instagram followers (at the time) wasn’t enough to counterbalance the backlash - Pepsi apologised the following day and pulled the spot.

The lesson: brands must tread with caution when choosing who will front their business.

So, back to Snoop Doggy Dogg...

In Klarna’s case, celebrity branding was a way to distance itself from traditional banks, which it says “look and act the same”.

‘Smooth Payments’ was Klarna’s communications vision well before Snoop Dogg came along, says senior analytics director Alex Marsh. So to bring to life its smooth payments system, which offers online shoppers a pay-after-delivery service, Klarna tried to find “the smooothest person alive” (Snoop, clearly).

When approaching a celebrity influencer to bolster your marketing, it’s vital to find someone who understands your vision, Marsh says. It’s not about slapping a famous face on a campaign and hoping it’ll generate buzz.

Indeed, when you do have shared goals, it not only minimises the need for any difficult compromises, he says, but also means they can build on what you’re doing and “challenge you with their unique perspectives”.

While it’s important to share a vision, sharing a target audience is not essential.

Marsh says it’s more important to consider how a new partner will resonate with your customers, adding that going out of the box could even help you tap into a new demographic.

Despite not being the first celebrity you’d think of when you hear the words “financial services”, Klarna’s partnership with Snoop Dogg resonated - the fact that the rapper put his money where his mouth is and became a shareholder speaks to its authenticity.

“Look at what defines your brand and the brand of your partner and if they align, chances are it will be a successful collaboration if executed correctly”, Marsh advises.

Washington: Qatar Foundation and Hamad Bin Khalifa University have sealed a trio of agreements with American institutions – including the country’s space agency NASA – that span educational connections, water and climate change research, sport, and heritage preservation, at the latest in a series of annual meetings designed to strengthen ties between Qatar and the US.



The third US-Qatar Strategic Dialogue took place over two days in Washington DC this week, building on the established bilateral relationship between the two countries and opening up opportunities for the two countries to embark on new collaborations.

They include a partnership between Qatar Foundation (QF), Qatar Museums (QM), and the Smithsonian Institute, the world’s largest museum and research complex; as well as the announcement of a Mission Concept Formulation Study between QF member Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) and NASA to analyze the impact of rising sea levels and their effect on Qatar, and how changing climates affect the world’s arid regions. Meanwhile, a further agreement will see two members of the Fulbright Scholars Program in the US spend a semester in Qatar to conduct research at HBKU’s research institutes.

“For Qatar Foundation, partnerships and connections with the US are long-established, and immeasurably valued,” said Dr Ahmad M. Hasnah, President of HBKU, who represented QF at the U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue, signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Smithsonian Institution and announcing the NASA partnership during the meeting.

“From the leading US universities who partner with Qatar Foundation and have branch campuses within our Education City development in Doha, to the myriad research collaborations between our scientists and their US counterparts, these partnerships truly demonstrate how knowledge transcends borders.

“To continuously develop the education we offer, maximize the impact of the research and innovation we deliver, and foster the cross-cultural understanding that makes such an essential contribution to a more harmonious world, Qatar Foundation and HBKU believe it is vital that we build bridges of collaboration, partnership, and knowledge exchange – benefiting each other by sharing with one another. This belief is reflected both in our existing collaborations with partners in the U.S., and in those we have now announced at the U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue.”

By partnering with the Smithsonian Institution, QF and the U.S. organization will combine to building knowledge and skills, and share experiences, in innovation and STEM education at K-12 level; promote connections between sport and science through public engagement activities ahead of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™; and work together to preserve heritage documents, explore opportunities to co-develop and deliver digital education, and look at forming sustainability-focused research collaborations.

The MoU will also see QM and the Smithsonian Institute explore collaborations to mark the Qatar-US Year of Culture 2021, and share knowledge in areas including cultural innovation, digital literacy, digitizing museum collections, and e-learning; as well as organizing conferences and joint training programs, and organizing the Woven Treasures Exhibition at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington D.C. in 2021, which will showcase textiles from Qatar’s Museum of Islamic Art.

Ahmad Musa Al-Namla, Chief Executive Officer, Qatar Museums, said: ""Qatar Museums' partnership with the Smithsonian - a global and esteemed cultural institution - paves the way for Qatar and the United States to further strengthen their ties and collaborate in the fields of arts and culture.

“The collaboration will create exceptional opportunities for knowledge transfer and exchange between both nations as Qatar Museums works to promote Qatar's national heritage beyond its borders and nurture a thriving cultural landscape for an engaged society.”

Through the collaboration between QF and NASA, researchers from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Earth Science Program and Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute at HBKU will work together on a project to design a mission to probe beneath the sand dunes and ice sheets of some of the planet’s driest places.

The project reflects the need for greater understanding of aquifer systems to support Qatar’s water security goals, and will also provide new knowledge about the effects of rising water levels due to melting polar ice caps. The latter is of critical importance for Qatar, where most urban areas are only a meter above sea level.

During their semester at QF in 2021, the two Fulbright scholars will work on research projects and teach at HBKU, with their areas of expertise being Alzheimer’s disease treatments and hydrology, and the application of Artificial Intelligence in civil and environmental engineering.

“This agreement coincides perfectly with our commitment to exploring and establishing joint degree programs with US institutions, not to mention enhancing student exchange and mobility,” said Dr. Hasnah. “We would like to host more US students at Qatar Foundation, and enable more Qatari students and scholars from Qatar Foundation to study in the US.”

PUBG was known to offer high-reach and consumer engagement, two powerful baits for brands.

Experts answer how brands that invested in PUBG will adapt to the current situation and where they will move their marketing monnies.

Gaming industry

It has been two days since the government banned Tencent’s signature battle royale game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) and app clones like PABJE, FAU-G and Pixel’s Unknown Battleground have already started sprouting up on Play Store.Due to the ban, Chinese tech giant Tencent has lost nearly $34 billion (HK$ 261.05) of its market value over the last two days. PUBG was downloaded 34.2 million times until May 2020 of which India accounted for 35.8% — 12.24 million installs, according to data provided by Sensor Tower.PUBG’s ban has not only left gamers in the lurch, it also left a void for brands that invested on in-app ads, event organisers, and influencers who were using PUBG and game streaming to earn a livelihood.The game also attracted advertisers ranging from handset makers to beverage companies. Brands that catered to the young audiences like OPPO, Mountain Dew, RedBull, etc have associated with PUBG in the past. It offered them engagement and high reach.One of the prominent brand partnerships that PUBG saw was with Ronnie Screwvala Productions’ (RSVP) action drama ‘URI: The Surgical Strike.’ Gamers were given an opportunity to launch a surgical strike on Pochinki, one of the most popular towns in the game’s map.While PUBG enthusiasts did not notice the advertisements on the app, it did have some incentive-led ads like ‘watch this ad to earn a scrap coupon’, collect 10 coins and build crates to buy in-game items.Gaming was considered a niche-category for a long time in the advertising industry. However, in 2019, of the $22.6 billion spent on mobile apps in Q2 2019, $16.95 billion was spent on mobile games and Indians were the largest market for mobile games, according to App Annie.So we reached out to a few industry experts to understand what kind of dent will the ban create in the advertising and marketing industry, how brands will reshuffle their monnies and find an alternative that offers the same amount of reach and user base.Explaining how brands will try to find alternatives that offer the same reach, Vaibhav Odhekar – Co-Founder and COO of POKKT Mobile Ads, said, “In the gaming space, all the brands were largely involved in “audience buying” and not site buying (like Candy Crush). So as long as there are players and audiences actively involved in gaming, brands will continue to be happy. POKKT has a gaming audience base of over 252mn+ users in India alone, so we believe that there is a massive reach present in terms of gaming content, advertising opportunities and the effectiveness for brands. Now brands will look at tweaking their targeting strategy to try and capture a larger set of apps, or else surgically approach the top competitors of the likes of PUBG and other banned apps to ensure cumulative audience reach.”Odhekar also pointed out that the majority of Indian gamers play casual games and that is where the maximum advertising is happening. Currently, top 10 apps on Google Play Store are Casual Games.On what led to’s boom, Odhekar added, “Gaming became really big in the first place due to casual gaming, which means most Indian users are playing (and engaging with ads on) games like Candy Crush, Temple Run, Subway Surfer, Ludo, Carrom. And this entire segment is untouched via Chinese app influence.”Brands that did associate with PUBG, did that for its captive audience and large user base.Abhinay Bhasin, Vice President (South Asia), Data Sciences, Dentsu Aegis Network said, “Chinese apps presented advertisers with a unique avenue to reach out to captive audiences offering a fairly large base that created a diversion of spends from platforms such as Facebook and Google onto unique ad formats that the Chinese apps offered. Estimates show that apps like TikTok had over 600 million downloads in India during its lifetime and Alibaba-owned UC Browser had a market share of over 10%. With the ban on these apps and services, brands will ultimately follow eyeballs and engaged audiences. The recent ban on TikTok for example seemed to be a boon for Instagram as they launched Reels in India. Similarly, the desi competitor to TikTok, Chingari, witnessed a record 1 crore+ download on the Google Play Store shortly after an initial ban on Chinese apps was announced. Brands in India have a multitude of sources to reach out to youth audiences such as via Gaming, OTT services, the aforementioned substitutes, etc. It’s far from the end of the world!”Rajan Navani, Vice Chairman & Managing Director, JetSynthesys, and President of the Indian Digital Gaming Society said that most PUBG casual players will switch to other similar games in India so the impact should not be much and it only brought about 2% to overall gaming industry’s revenue.Navani said, “Impact on the overall gaming industry should not be over 2% if one were to include in-app and advertising revenue combined, in the immediate short-term. However, the professional PUBG esport players and other content creators around PUBG streaming will be severely impacted since they derive their livelihood from the game. At a time when the domestic mobile gaming industry is growing rapidly, PUBG’s ban provides an immense opportunity for other international and domestic gaming companies to grow their market share.”According to Manesh Swamy, VP- Creative, Logicserve Digital, PUBG’s ban will not hamper brands’ way of finding ways to reach out to consumers. However, they will now be cautious to associate with any kind of Chinese brand.“As a marketer and advertiser, I feel it won’t affect the industry at large, as we always find ways to meet our clients' marketing challenges and goals. Also, taking into consideration the current reservation against Chinese products and services, even brands would be cautious and not want to associate themselves with these platforms to carry out any marketing activities. I am sure they do not wish to hamper their consumer's loyalty,” said Swamy.With the pandemic-infused lockdown, consumers had to find ways of entertaining themselves within the four walls of their house. As a result, gaming apps saw a spike in users and brands started realising the potential of this industry.Sanjay Mehta, Joint CEO of Mirum India described the foreseeable situation in one word - ‘adapt.’ He said brands and agencies will adapt and find alternatives.Mehta said, “The most impacted sector/brand because of the ban is the brand/app PubG itself and most importantly their Pro-Players, who literally earned from it. India contributed almost 1/4th of the user and being a MOG (Multiplayer Online Game) it majorly ran on a Freemium model. Means their biggest revenue generator was In-game-purchase. Gaming has been one of the biggest contributors for AdEx in India during this COVID period. So gaming is here to stay, and brands have a plethora of games to advertise on. Like Video, casual gaming is also on a high and thankfully Brands have enough options.”PUBG offered brands an opportunity to place in-app advertisements, explore content marketing associations and organise group events around it. So with its ban, what kind of impact will it have on Advertising Expenditure this year?With PUBG, the government also ordered a ban on another 116 apps like Ludo World, Arena of Valor, Chess Rush. The first list came out on June 29 after the Galwan Valley skirmish, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead and an undisclosed number of casualties on the Chinese side. This included the popular short video streaming app TikTok, UC Browser, Xiaomi's Mi Community and 56 others. So how will the ban on all Chinese apps in India impact overall AdEx?Bhasin said Chinese companies contribute around 4-5% to overall Indian Advertising Revenue.He said, “The ban on Chinese apps will certainly have a significant impact on influencer associations that were picking up steam on TikTok or even through gaming influencers and contests. These spends will now have to be realigned to other alternatives. Moreover, the ban on apps is most likely to have a ripple effect onto other investments into AdEx in India by Chinese companies that contribute to roughly 4-5% of the overall Indian advertising economy.”Swamy and Mehta, on the other hand, said the impact will be minimal.“I don’t feel that the ban would affect the overall Ad Expenditure as brands would redirect their strategies to fit in the best manner possible,” said Swamy.Brands and agencies adapted to COVID, they adapted to the TikTok ban and now, they are gearing up to adapt to PUBG’s ban, too.","Brands that catered to the young audiences like OPPO, Mountain Dew, RedBull, etc have associated with PUBG in the past.
So as long as there are players and audiences actively involved in gaming, brands will continue to be happy.
With the ban on these apps and services, brands will ultimately follow eyeballs and engaged audiences.
The recent ban on TikTok for example seemed to be a boon for Instagram as they launched Reels in India.
Similarly, the desi competitor to TikTok, Chingari, witnessed a record 1 crore+ download on the Google Play Store shortly after an initial ban on Chinese apps was announced."
222,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1732131/saudi-arabia,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Arab News,"Saudi rights body empowers women, youth through partnerships, workshops","Saudis ready to enjoy Eid Al-Fitr with health precautions in mind

RIYADH: As many Muslims around the world eagerly await Eid Al-Fitr to celebrate with family and loved ones, Saudis have shared their annual routines on the festive occasion, which for many, are the best part of the whole celebration.

“I wait eagerly for Eid, and I always try a month before to go to the public and popular markets with my sons and daughters before the crowds to prepare for the occasion,” Husain Al-Anazi, a human resources operations supervisor, told Arab News. He buys whatever his family needs such as clothes, supplies and sweets.

On the Eid day, Al-Anazi goes to the mosque, where he performs the Eid prayer, and then returns home “I return to the parents, brothers and children. I greet my mother, sisters and children. Then I go to greet the elderly in their homes, especially my uncles, aunts and some of the elderly relatives,” he added.

After completing the morning tour, he returns home at noon to take a nap until the afternoon to catch up on sleep, since he is used to staying up late during Ramadan. He then goes to the majlis (sitting room for guests) in the afternoon and prepares tea and coffee for visitors.

In the evening, Al-Anazi goes to the meeting place of his relatives, where a special dinner for the family is held in either the house of the eldest relative or a separate rented location. Once the dinner wraps up, he goes to his friends on a break to greet them and play cards.

In the following days, he travels with friends to any place they decide to visit.

My favorite food during Eid is mansaf, a traditional Arab dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt, and served with rice. Asmhan Al-Fuhaiqi

As for Bandar Al-Ghayeb, a security worker at the Saudi Electricity Co., he rarely spends the whole Eid period with his family and relatives, as he works on a shift basis at the company.

He instead visits friends in the neighborhood, who prepare Eid meals (mostly grilled foods). “We don’t eat too much. We eat in a symbolic way, as if we are tasting food.”

Al-Ghayeb said that he also visits some relatives and other friends on the same day after taking a nap. Although he is usually physically exhausted, he feels psychologically comfortable, as it is a day where he is able to meet many people, including friends who he has not seen for years.

Al-Ghayeb is also keen to preserve the habit of “eidiya” every year, where children are gifted money by older members of the family.

The best moments of Eid for Saudi housewife Asmhan Al-Fuhaiqi are the morning of the first day, especially when she starts to put on new clothes.

“Performing Eid prayers has a special feeling. Then we meet together as family members at my father’s house, where we start distributing sweets to the guests,” she told Arab News.

Al-Fuhaiqi added the spirit of Eid shines through when groups begin to light fireworks in celebration.

“During Eid, I would be busy buying supplies, including clothes and accessories, and since I live in the town of Tayma, I cannot get everything I need, so I go with my family to the city of Tabuk (110 km away), which is the closest city to us” she said.

I go to greet the elderly in their homes, especially my uncles, aunts and some of the elderly relatives. Husain Al-Anazi

She added that one of the most difficult things to buy during Eid is clothing, as she has to ensure that the size fits so that she does not go all the way back to Tabuk.

On the night before Eid, she makes sweets and puts them in the reception room before dawn, and perfumes the house with incense and oud.

In the past, Al-Fuhaiqi was keen to go to the prayer hall next to the city, which feels “beautifully different,” however, the situation changed after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, and she instead visits the nearby mosque.

The family then begins to receive guests in their home, distributing gifts to the children and supervising the fireworks. “Although it is risky, I feel that fireworks give a wonderful atmosphere for Eid, so I make sure that I am the one who lights the fireworks myself, not the children.”

I will be very happy during Eid, because we visit many people, and many also visit us in a short period of time.

Ruaa Rashid

She said that her favorite food during Eid is mansaf, a traditional Arab dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt, and served with rice or bulgur.

Saudi child Ruaa Radhi told Arab News that her mother bought her a dress and beautiful shoes a few days ago for Eid, and bought enough fireworks from the market for her and her brothers.

“On the first day of Eid Al-Fitr, we will meet with my grandmother at her house in the presence of my aunts who live in other cities, where we will have dinner together, which is a cooked lamb that my mother and aunts cook,” she said.

Radhi’s maternal uncles usually gift her toys and sweets for Eid every year. “They usually give us light footballs and balloons. Indeed, I will be very happy during Eid, because we visit many people, and many also visit us in a short period of time.”

Nayef Al-Moaini, a Saudi engineer at Ma’aden, said that, for him, the celebration of Eid starts the night before, when preparing the house is one of the most important parts of the annual celebration.

“Celebration of Eid Al-Fitr often includes holding banquets for several days to celebrate the visitors, including our relatives coming from outside the city,” he added.

The second day of Eid is a fixed day for Al-Moaini’s family feast, which includes his uncles, their children and his neighbors.","On the Eid day, Al-Anazi goes to the mosque, where he performs the Eid prayer, and then returns home “I return to the parents, brothers and children.
Then I go to greet the elderly in their homes, especially my uncles, aunts and some of the elderly relatives,” he added.
Once the dinner wraps up, he goes to his friends on a break to greet them and play cards.

THE THIRD PHASE OF JAMES BAY DEVELOPMENT: TAKING PARTNERSHIPS, ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES AND SHARING OF WEALTH TO NEW LEVELS

This article, submitted by Hydro-Québec, will focus on the development of the third phase of the James Bay complex, namely the generating stations namely the Eastmain-1 and Eastmain-1A/Sarcelle/Rupert project. Emphasis will be placed on the development of a new relationship with the Cree that led to an improved project development model.

The Eastmain Complex, the most recent of the James Bay hydroelectric development: Taking partnerships, environmental measures and sharing of wealth to new levels.

When the initial phases of hydropower development in the Baie-James region of Québec was launched in the 1970s, there was no law on the environment, no environmental ministries and no environmental impact assessment process. So consulting affected communities wasn’t on anyone’s agenda and wasn’t yet part of Hydro-Québec’s approach. In the new millennium, with a new phase of development in this region, close-knit partnerships with the Cree Nation have become the cornerstone of project development throughout Québec.

Nadoshtin and Boumhounan agreements paved the way to new developments in Baie-James in the 2000s

The Nadoshtin agreement (2002) between the Crees and Hydro-Québec opened up the possibility of building and operating the Eastmain-1 hydropower project, while the Boumhounan agreement (2002) provided a framework for the Eastmain 1- A/Sarcelle/Rupert project. The key to success for the Eastmain projects was partially diverting the Rupert River’s flow northward.

But Hydro-Québec’s commercial interest in this new project had to be balanced by clear and extensive measures to preserve the surrounding environment and respect host Cree Nation and Cree communities.

In the framework of the Eastmain-1 project, Hydro-Québec made a number of commitments with a view to

reduce the project’s impacts on the environment

protect the Cree way of life and encourage partnerships with the Cree communities

encourage the awarding of contracts to Cree businesses

promote the training and hiring of Cree workers.

built local capacity

“…The company wanted to do more than minimize environmental impact; Hydro-Québec wanted community members to see positive gains from the Eastmain developments…”

From the design stage, which was carried out in concert with the Cree, the Eastmain 1-A/Sarcelle/Rupert project incorporated many environmental protection measures, reflecting the Cree traditional knowledge of the community members they consulted. The Cree of Québec were involved in all stages of the project, ensuring they had a voice in how their land would be impacted.

With input from Cree community members, Hydro-Québec devised a combination of dikes and canals to improve water flow, ensuring that the project, which diverts 71% of the river’s flow, flooded only a minimal land area. They also incorporated a substantial ecological in-stream flow and a series of weirs in the river to protect fish habitats, biological diversity, preserve the landscape, and maintain navigation and other activities in the area.

Furthermore, Hydro-Québec signed an unprecedented water management agreement with the Cree to ensure that the modulation of the ecological in-stream flow was managed in a cooperative manner.

Economic spinoffs

In addition to helping preserve the local environment, Hydro-Québec was committed to bringing growth opportunities to the Cree of Québec. The company wanted to do more than minimize environmental impact; Hydro-Québec wanted community members to see positive gains from the Eastmain developments.

Under the Boumhounan Agreement, an extensive participation program built around information and consultation with Cree stakeholders was put in place. It also made funds available for the Cree to finance fisheries, capacity building and traditional activities projects.

When the Eastmain 1A/Rupert diversion project was completed in 2013, the Cree and Hydro-Québec signed the Reappropriation Agreement, giving Cree land users the necessary support to maintain their traditional activities as long as the Rupert River diversion is in operation.

Post-project consultations: ensuring that measures were effective

The COMEX, a joint committee composed of 3 members appointed by the Government Quebec and 2 members appointed by the Cree Nation government, organized consultations with Cree communities to hear their views on the effectiveness of environmental and social mitigation measures put in place for the Eastmain 1A/Rupert diversion project. Approximately 200 members of the Cree Nation from six communities participated in the consultations organized in November 2012.

The major findings of the COMEX were as follows:

[…]”the Committee is convinced that the Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle Powerhouses and Rupert Diversion Project will have contributed to greater understanding between all the parties concerned, to greater Cree involvement in the development of the territory, and perhaps to empowering them to achieve their long- term economic and community development goals.”

“Compared to previous projects carried out in the territory, the Eastmain-1- A/Sarcelle/Rupert project included more adequate and an unprecedented number of mitigation and compensation measures, for both environmental and social impacts. Many of these measures are aimed at helping Cree land users reclaim the territory. A new approach was developed and the Crees have benefited from the partnerships built with the proponent, thereby forging a new relationship.”

“Hydro-Québec was proactive, exceeding the requirements of the certificate of authorization in an effort to minimize the project’s impacts and ensure greater Cree involvement in environmental and social follow-up activities.”

“Hydro-Québec went to great lengths to ensure that Aboriginal communities derive benefit from the project.”

A new project development model

The Eastmain Complex – the most recent phase of development in Baie-James – added a potential energy output of 8.7 TWh per year, enough to power more than 500,000 Québec homes. The new relationships that Hydro-Québec and the Cree Nation developed over that period have become models for future energy resource development throughout Québec. With considerable untapped hydropower potential and a strong wind potential in Québec, Hydro-Québec’s new and improved project development model holds great promise for the future of clean energy in northeast North America.

The Canadian Energy Compendium is an annual initiative by the Energy Council of Canada to provide an opportunity for cross-sectoral collaboration and discussion on current topics in Canada’s energy sector. The 2020 Canadian Energy Compendium: Innovations in Energy Efficiency is due to be released November 2020.

Greenwood back in?

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got a number of selections wrong against Crystal Palace and two of them were on the right-hand side. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was so inadequate at Luton to the point he had to be told when to venture forward, though Juan Mata scored and so did his replacement, Mason Greenwood.

Greenwood's goal was saveable but he was a threat when he emerged against Palace and had a chance to equalise. As long as United go without strengthening their problem position Greenwood has to start their Premier League games.

Does Lindelof get dropped?

Of his 92 matches as United manager, Solskjaer has never outright dropped United's only Scandinavian squad member and there have been occasions when Victor Lindelof was fortunate to keep his place.

Lindelof was culpable for all three goals against Palace, albeit the penalty award was via a jobsworth official, and there is little or no justification for him to start at Brighton. The caveat is half the United centre halves are either injured or up for sale and the available options are Eric Bailly and Teden Mengi.

Mengi is 18 and with nine minutes of senior football to his name and Bailly has started once in the Premier League in the last 16 months. The Ivory Coast international has at least stayed almost completely free of injury this calendar year and, from his six matches in a partnership with Harry Maguire, United have won all of them.

Will a Van Gaal start be avoided?

United last failed to win either of their opening two Premier League games in 2014 under Louis van Gaal, who was winless in his first three. The standard of the Premier League that season was inadequate enough for United to recover and finish fourth but the competitiveness is becoming more intense with every year now and there are threats to United outside the 'big six' again.

They are already playing catch-up due to their delayed start but can seldom afford any more slip-ups. Leicester, Arsenal and Liverpool already have six points and so could Tottenham by the time they travel to Old Trafford on Sunday week.

Van de Beek to start?

Benching Donny van de Beek was one of Solskjaer's errors last week, particularly given how unfit Paul Pogba appeared following his recovery from coronavirus. Van de Beek played as the 10 at Luton yet Bruno Fernandes is almost certain to resume his playmaking duties and Van de Beek is likelier to start as one of the midfield two.

There is some sense in dropping Pogba to the bench and keeping the experienced Nemanja Matic in midfield with Van de Beek until Pogba is back at his optimum. Alternatively, Van de Beek might partner Pogba in a new long-term partnership.

De Gea to stay in?

Both of United's 'keepers have had encouraging individual starts to the season. David de Gea's instinctive block from Jordan Ayew was a reminder of his peerless reflexes and he finally saved a penalty, only for it to be declared null and void by a robot at Stockley Park. Dean Henderson's superb save on his debut with United 1-0 up at Luton took on greater significance with the final score.

The expectation is De Gea will continue his league duty at Brighton, where Henderson will doubtless start in next week's inconvenient League Cup tie.","As long as United go without strengthening their problem position Greenwood has to start their Premier League games.

Software and blockchain solutions company Tymlez (TYM) has entered a trading halt ahead of a capital raise announcement

Tymlez aims to bring its green energy trading platform to enterprises, with a particular focus on energy trading and healthcare

In an update yesterday, Tymlez announced it had been selected as a partner to develop carbon emission rights trading through its marketplace platform

The company also partnered with Tyalgum Energy to install its green energy marketplace in the rural village of Tyalgum to facilitate trading

However, at the end of FY20, Tymlez had just $130,000 in cash

Based on its ventures and overall goals, the company could certainly benefit from further capital

Company shares last traded for 14 cents on Tuesday, September 1

Tymlez Group (TYM) has entered a trading halt ahead of a capital raise announcement.

The company will remain in a trading halt until the earlier commencement of trading on Friday, September 4, unless the capital raise is announced earlier.

Tymlez is an enterprise software and blockchain solutions company. Just yesterday, it was selected as a partner for a large-scale, multi-year project alongside the Netherlands' largest construction company, District System Operator, along with the National Telco, ICT Group, and others.

The company is currently working to finalise the details before the agreement is signed by the end of this month.

As part of the project, Tymlez will develop and deliver carbon emission rights trading through its energy marketplace platform.

To focus on the marketing and sales of its green energy trading platform in Australia and Asia, Tymlez set up a subsidiary, TYMLEZ Energy, in the June quarter.

Tymlez also announced a partnership with Tyalgum Energy in New South Wales to install and pilot its Green Energy Marketplace into the small village of Tyalgum. Tyalgum chose Tymlez's technology to facilitate energy trading inside the community.

This is a significant step for the company in scaling its technology into commercial and industrial applications to impact the carbon neutral target for major energy consumers. It also marks the first trial of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere.

Additionally, Tymlez filed an application for a $1,358,820 government grant as part of a healthcare initiative with the free university of Amsterdam and Macquarie University of Sydney.

The grant will support the development and testing of its green energy trading platform for medical supplies and personal protective equipment such as masks, goggles and gowns.

But at the end of the 2020 financial year, Tymlez had just $130,000 in cash. Based on its current ventures and goals for green energy trading, the company could certainly benefit from further capital.

That no longer rings true after Wolves completed the a sensational club-record £37million move for the Portugal international on Wednesday, with Semedo becoming Jorge Mendes' eighth client to join the Molineux outfit.

Semedo will now step in for Matt Doherty following the Republic of Ireland international move to Tottenham last month.

Wolves have completed the signing of Nelson Semedo from Barcelona for a fee up to £37m

The 26-year-old Portuguese will replace Matt Doherty who signed for Tottenham this summer

Semedo had been linked with Manchester City and Juventus earlier in the transfer window

But it is the impact of his arrival that he could have at Wolves that is equally as tantilising as the effect of his departure on Barcelona.

However, to first summarise the Portugal defender's summer by just mentioning the agreement between Barcelona and Wolves fails to capture the uncertainty that has all too often shrouded the Catalan giants' transfer window.

The Lionel Messi saga saw extremely public twists and turns of a detailed financial nature which the club have managed to resolve, but Semedo's future seems to have been kept well under wraps for much of the calendar year.

There was hope that Semedo would sign a new three-year contract at the Nou Camp club which was reportedly put on the table at the beginning of the year, particularly after enjoying a rejuventation under former boss Quique Setien.

The right-back appeared to make the position his own ahead of the versatile Sergi Roberto after strong performances during Setien's first few weeks in the job, putting in strong performances against Espanyol, Levante and Leganes.

Unlike Lionel Messi's public transfer saga, Semedo's own indifferences were kept under wraps

Semedo has been at the club since 2017 and was deemed the replacement for Dani Alves

A strong, quick and tenacious full-back who can play on either side, he took to Barcelona's 4-3-3 formation and managed to provide some much-needed width for a side without Ousmane Dembele and that was wrestling with Real Madrid for the title.

Yet throughout his Barcelona career, even with the departures of the likes of Aleix Vidal, Semedo has never appeared to fully convince supporters or coaches, despite appearing to possess all the attributes of a modern full-back and making some 42 appearances last season.

Fast forward to May and his situation dramatically became unstable when Barcelona suddenly broke off negotiations with his representatives, with the Catalan side not able to satisfy his financial demands and Semedo's camp not willing to accept the aforementioned three-year deal.

After signalling his desire to return to Benfica - the club he signed from in 2017 - earlier this summer he was offered around and had reportedly been discussed in vain in potential swap deals with Juventus' Miralem Pjanic and Manchester City's Joao Cancelo, while Inter Milan had also registered an interest in his services.

Semedo appeared to enjoy a rejuvenation following Quique Setien's appointment this year

The man once destined to be the long-term replacement for Dani Alves however was still looking increasingly likely to be one of the first out of the Nou Camp exit door even before Ronald Koeman's appointment as the new boss.

So with the Dutchman now keen to move Semedo out to re-build his side, how could he fit in at Molineux?

Much like Doherty, Semedo appears to prefer prioritising work in advanced areas for his club. He has always looked to get forward and provide the width in Barcelona's typical 4-3-3 system.

Nuno preferred a system of either three at the back or five at the back last season and deployed the explosive Adama Traore in the wing-back role against Pep Guardiola's side on Monday.

But while the formation may take some getting used, Semedo's powerful and aggressive running style makes it hard to knock him off the ball.

But Setien has been sacked and replaced by Ronald Koeman who wants to move him on

Semedo's signing could see him form a dynamic partnership with winger Adama Traore

As such, not only could he regularly get into advanced areas to provide crosses for the likes of Raul Jimenez, but he could form one of the Premier League's most dynamic right-hand side partnership with Traore, who would be able to return to the role that saw him create havoc for opposition defences last season.

There have however been some doubts about Semedo's end product though, managing just four LaLiga assists to go with a solitary goal from 32 matches in 2019-20, albeit in a side that by their very high standards struggled for regular goalscorers aside from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.

But despite his ability to go on marauding runs forward, he tends to play a lot of short passes inside and shows a tendency to link-up play well as opposed to whipping crosses into the box.

That could spell further good news for Semedo's compatriots Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves as well as Traore, who would thrive off constantly receiving the ball in attacking areas, and also helps to explain his rather modest assists return last season.

He is strong, quick and tenacious full-back but largely played in a back four at Barcelona

Statistics from Football Whispers showed that Semedo ranked third for passes completed per 90 minutes a few months ago with 52.35, but ranked only 14th among right-backs in LaLiga for forward passes.

Combine that with the attacking prowess that Traore and Semedo possess and the Portuguese's lack of positional awareness at times, Nuno will be well aware of the danger of the space that the duo could leave behind them and leave centre-backs Conor Coady, Willy Boly and Romain Saiss exploited.

However, if Nuno's main objective was to find someone who has the potential of replacing Doherty's seven goals and five assists from the previous campaign in the current set-up, he may well have recruited the perfect fit.

Semedo may have failed to convince at Barcelona, but should he combine well with the La Masia academy product ahead of him he could be in for the most fruitful spell of his career so far.

He scored once last season but his return of four assists is more of a cause for concern","'Nelson Semedo starts the expected revolution at Barcelona,' Marca's headline read on Tuesday ahead of the Barcelona right-back's move to Wolves.
Semedo will now step in for Matt Doherty following the Republic of Ireland international move to Tottenham last month.
So with the Dutchman now keen to move Semedo out to re-build his side, how could he fit in at Molineux?

Panelists shared concerns about the risk of the pandemic reversing advancements made toward achieving the SDGs. An IAEA survey carried out in April-May showed that the pandemic had disrupted key health services for diagnosing and treating conditions such as cancer and heart disease, particularly in low-income countries. Mr Grossi said that even in pandemic situations, supporting countries to effectively address non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, continued to be a very important area of the IAEA’s work.

“It is a scandal that as we speak half of the African continent does not have access to one radiotherapy unit,” he said. “It is a scandal that 300,000 women die every year from cervical cancer – something that is detectable, treatable and curable. We have the tech, we have the means, and we know what needs to be done. We are working with the WHO, civil society, UNAIDS and others to try to provide access to nuclear medicine to many more countries, and we are training oncologists, radiologists, medical physicists and specialists.”

Last year the IAEA joined the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and other partners to launch the Women’s Cancers Partnership Initiative, to improve access to cancer services for women in low- and middle-income countries. The Agency is also part of the UN Joint Global Programme on Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control, which aims to achieve a 30 per cent reduction in deaths from cervical cancer by 2030 in participating countries. The IAEA’s work to enlarge the access of many countries to nuclear medicine contributes to the WHO’s global strategy for cervical cancer elimination, which includes a target of providing 90 per cent of women identified with cervical cancer access to treatment by 2030.

In direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IAEA launched ZODIAC (Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action) in June, a project that aims to strengthen global preparedness for future pandemics like COVID-19, by establishing a global network to help national laboratories in monitoring, surveillance, early detection and control of animal diseases and diseases that spread from animals to humans (zoonotic diseases), using nuclear or nuclear-derived techniques. For its implementation, close collaboration with international and United Nations organizations, such as the WHO, FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health, is foreseen.

“We have to work hand-in-hand, use the power of diversity and accept that no one size fits all,” Mr Grossi said. “The IAEA is ready to do it.”","The discussion addressed ongoing human health challenges and the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on sustainable development efforts.

This article is free, but to access more of our content, you can sign up for a no strings attached 28-day free trial here.

At PGGM, our roots are in the care and welfare sector – and together with our largest client, the Dutch pension fund Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn (PFZW) – we represent the financial future of people who work in this sector in The Netherlands. We look – together with our clients – for opportunities where we can increase our investments in companies and projects that also have a positive contribution, through their products and services, to global sustainability challenges as defined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We call these investments Sustainable Development Investments, SDIs. Together with our ESG analyses, which focus on the internal behaviour of companies, we believe we can realise our ambition to contribute to a liveable world for the pension participants of our clients.

Honing in on the UN SDGs

Along with others in the asset management and asset owner community, we have seen firsthand this increasing appetite for investing in the SDGs. However, when it comes to investing, the lack of quality, standardised data and definitions with a positive contribution to global sustainability has been a challenge. To accelerate the market adoption of SDIs, we teamed up with APG, AustralianSuper and British Columbia Investment Management to establish the Sustainable Development Investments Asset Owner Platform (SDI AOP), which officially launched in July this year. The overall aim is to create a standard, which will lead to greater efficiencies for financial institutions looking to invest in the SDGs.

At the moment, the focus is on listed equities, with coverage of 8,000 companies. Next year, the universe will include bonds and the coverage will increase to 10,000 companies.

The launch of the SDI AOP comes at a critical time, said Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment, who highlighted that the SDGs are the world’s business plan to meet the growing need for a greener, more inclusive and sustainable future.

“The SDI AOP is a much-needed piece in the puzzle of how we, as investment community, can advance the SDGs. It will help to translate the SDGs into investment goals and make sure that investors and corporates have a standardised way of reporting. Investors can contribute to the SDGs through capital allocation, stewardship and engagement with other stakeholders and governments.”

Combining artificial and human intelligence

Operating under a separate legal entity, SDI AOP maintains the SDI taxonomy and rules of solutions that contribute to the SDGs, while Entis is the data science partner that creates objective and consistent data on the SDG contributions of companies. Entis combines artificial intelligence with human intelligence to translate the SDI rules into an SDI classification. Analytics and index provider Qontigo is acting as exclusive distributor of the data.

“The SDI AOP is a huge step forward by creating a set of easy-to-use and cost- efficient data – as opposed to a piece of required software – that can be incorporated into existing tools for investment decisions and reporting,” explains Ian Webster, Senior Managing Director at Qontigo. “In this way, the SDI AOP allows for a very wide set of use cases and continuous development in the future.”

Tried and trusted by asset owners

For this data to reach critical mass, we believe it is key to share knowledge and experience in analysing investment portfolios in detail on their contribution to the SDGs. The SDI Taxonomy and Guidance is an open-source document that we publish so that other financial institutions could also use this as a framework to invest in line with the SDGs, and can be found here.

As asset owners, we use this data, and therefore we also know the importance of continually researching and refining. The SDI methodology is rule-based, resulting in auditable data. Transparency is served by leaving the consideration of ESG risks to the individual investor’s decision-making process. The SDI Taxonomy and Guidance are continuously refined by a dynamic research agenda which also covers those SDGs where companies’ positive contribution stems from operational improvements rather than their products and services.

At the moment, the focus is on listed equities, with coverage of 8,000 companies. Next year, the universe will include bonds and the coverage will increase to 10,000 companies. The platform is also working on forward-looking metrics and private market classifications. The next step on the agenda would be defining metrics to be able to report on real world outcomes.

We see that the SDGs are no longer a side industry, but have become front and center for the financial services community. At the same time, the industry is struggling to make the SDGs part of standard investment processes. We believe that the SDI AOP can address those challenges and we encourage other asset owners to join us: As Reynolds states: “The SDI AOP is a wonderful example of how we can do more together than individually.”

Son and Kane have already directly combined for a staggering eight goals already so far this season, their partnership flourishing during a Premier League campaign that has proven a goal-fest in its infancy.

Following the fine form of the Spurs strikers we’ve decided to look at some of the most prolific pairs in the division’s history, here are the five Premier League partnerships with the most goal combinations:

Darren Anderton and Teddy Sheringham – 27 goal combinations

Another Tottenham pairing sit fifth in the rankings for most lethal Premier League partnerships, Darren Anderton and Teddy Sheringham having combined for 27 goals during their time with the north London outfit.

The two were key components of the Spurs side during the early years of the Premier League with Sheringham finishing as the division’s leading scorer in its inaugural campaign, Anderton establishing himself as a key figure in the side that same season after arriving from Portsmouth.

Anderton spent more than a decade with the club and remained a regular in the side during both of Sheringham’s stints at Tottenham, the forward spending a four-season spell at Manchester United in between two spells at White Hart Lane.

The duo also featured together on 15 occasions for England, including forming part of the squad that reached the semi-finals of the European Championships on home soil in 1996.

Son Heung-Min and Harry Kane – 28 goal combinations

The blistering start to the season for Son and Kane has seen the pair move into fourth in the all-time rankings, combining for 28 goals including a huge eight so far this season.

Kane has established himself as one of the finest forwards in the Premier League and has twice won the division’s Golden Boot since coming through the academy ranks at Spurs, the England captain having been ably supported by his South Korean teammate since Son’s arrival from Bayer Leverkusen five years ago.

No duo have combined for more goals since Son’s arrival in English football with their 28 goals eight clear of Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne in second place, the two playing arguably their best football together in the opening weeks of the new campaign.

Kane has also proven himself a superb creator as well as goalscorer this season, his seven assists so far the most in the Premier League and the joint-most he has recorded in any season to date – achieving the feat after just five league fixtures.

Robert Pires and Thierry Henry – 29 goal combinations

Arsenal’s French connection was a huge part of the club’s most successful period of the Premier League era, with Robert Pires and Thierry Henry bringing the va-va-voom and wreaking havoc for the north London side shortly after the turn of the millennium.

The two interchanged beautifully down the left-flank with Pires a trailblazer for inverted and prolific wide players, whilst Henry stood as the Premier League’s greatest talent for much of his time at Arsenal.

Henry won a record four Golden Boots during a glittering career with the Gunners but his profitable partnership with Pires proved almost mutually beneficial, the forward scoring 17 goals with Pires netting on 12 occasions.

Their tally could – and perhaps should – have been increased by at least one, their pre-rehearsed passed penalty routine against Manchester City famously not quite going to plan…

David Silva and Sergio Aguero – 29 goal combinations

Two of the most important figures in the rise of Manchester City and the joint-second most successful Premier League pairing, David Silva and Sergio Aguero cemented themselves as iconic figures in English football during a hugely successful spell at the Etihad.

Aguero stands as the fourth-highest goalscorer in the division’s history and as City’s all-time leading marksman, the prolific Argentine regularly supplied by the creative talents of the inventive Silva.

The duo won four league titles amongst a host of major honours during their time as teammates, before Silva called time on his City career after a decade of success last summer.

Aguero remains amongst league’s leading finishers and will hope to increase his goal tally this season, the 32-year-old just 20 goals short of becoming just the third player to reach 200 Premier League goals.

Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba – 36 goals combinations

Leading the way are two players who played brilliantly together during a golden period in Chelsea’s history, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba combining for a record 36 goals.

Drogba was often tasked with being Chelsea’s one-man army in attack for much of his career at Stamford Bridge, where the Ivorian was joined by the formidable forward runs of Lampard from midfield.

Lampard assisted his teammate on a huge 24 occasions with Drogba returning the favour 12 times, a figure which helped establish the midfielder as the fifth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history after netting 177 times over spells at West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City.

Their partnership also proved fruitful in terms of bringing team success to the west London side, lifting three Premier League titles together including back-to-back triumphs in 2005 and 2006.

Partnerships and Professional Development,"The growth of online programming is an exciting opportunity for museums, but it comes with a host of challenges. Here's why partnerships and professional development are the answers. Photo credit: Gerd Altmann on Pixabay

Recently, I’ve been analyzing the efficacy of museum-developed digital programs over their thirty-year history, and I’ve noticed a common theme: Every study extols the benefits of such programs, including increased outreach and engagement with visitors, increased access to resources, increased data collection related to educational programs, and increased interest in physical visits to the museum. But these studies also discuss the host of challenges that come with online learning. A lack of program development resources, institutional constraints, staffing issues, time restrictions, cost, and technological limitations can all hamstring museum staff’s best efforts to create meaningful ways to connect with visitors online.

Whatever else 2020 might bring, online learning is here to stay, which makes it a good time to reckon with those challenges. Fortunately, my research sheds some light on some strategies to tackle them. The good news is they all share a common solution: not trying to go it alone. Establishing the right partnerships and investing in professional development for your education staff can increase the reach, success, and sustainability of your online programming.

Partnerships are an opportunity to creatively leverage resources and explore new ways to engage your audiences. When selecting partners, identify organizations that share your mission or already engage in online programming. Alternatively, consider an organization that may not have a clear connection with your own, but offers the possibility to collaborate on innovative new programs that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. (While not all digital, here’s an interesting look at some creative partnerships museums have with large brands).

Collaborations with private companies, schools, universities, and even other museums can make for mutually beneficial partnerships. For example, the Museum of Modern Art and online learning platform Coursera teamed up to create massive open online courses (MOOCs) as professional development for teachers. Other museums work with universities to develop K-12 programming, leveraging the resources of both institutions. And an example of a museum-museum partnership is the Smithsonian Affiliation, where members work together to design and implement a National Youth Summit.

Partnerships can bring together groups with diverse skillsets and a range of expertise to develop and sustain online programs. But to set your partnership up for success, it’s important to work closely together in designing it. A report commissioned by the College Futures Foundation on beginning and sustaining educational partnerships presents helpful strategies for developing effective online learning partnerships. Its recommendations include defining the goals of the partnership, outlining the benefits and responsibilities of both organizations, and using data-driven decision-making.

Be clear about the purpose of your partnership from the outset. Are you hoping to drive revenue? If so, how will money be divided between the two organizations? Are you hoping your partner organization will assist with developing and hosting the program, but your institution will facilitate? If so, be clear about that from the outset. It is important to have institutional buy-in from both organizations and clear communication about the goals of the partnership. Additionally, be explicit about who is responsible for which tasks in creating and implementing a new program and on what timeline. Finally, data analytics are key for assessing your success and making decisions about the future of the program.

Once you have laid the groundwork for your partnership, get creative. Now is the time for institutions to innovate in the types of online programs they offer and give their staff the freedom to fail forward. Museums are not constrained by state or national learning standards and can therefore experiment with the new affordances offered by teaching in a digital space. Additionally, museums now have an unprecedented opportunity to reach virtual visitors who would otherwise be unable to visit their physical space. By taking risks and thinking outside the box, museums have the opportunity to redesign what online learning looks like and ensure that it serves all learners moving forward.

But for these new ventures to be truly successful, museums need to invest in their education staff.

Educators are one of the most vital components of a successful, sustainable online program. But for many of them, this is also new territory. Museums can set their staff up for success by investing in professional development to support and encourage educators as they develop new programs in an often-unfamiliar format. Professional development can help build educators’ skills and levels of confidence in developing and facilitating new programs and decrease burnout. However, in many institutions, professional development for educators is not equal to the level of excellence expected from front-of-house staff, if it’s even offered at all. Many resources are available to help support museum educators, but they must be given the time and resources they need to learn and grow, in addition to developing and facilitating programs.

Targeted professional development for museum educators should also focus on creating digital programs that are accessible to a wide range of learners. This means utilizing a variety of tools, including closed captioning, alt text for images, selecting colors that are color-blind friendly, testing websites for content accessibility, and offering programs in more than one language. Together we can take advantage of these new opportunities to reach more diverse audiences through successful, sustainable, and innovative digital programming.

Since the beginning of COVID-19, several organizations, such as Cuseum, have been offering a wide range of webinars that can help educators build their online programming skills. Additionally, AAM has published two books that discuss the benefits, challenges, and strategies for developing online programs in museums: Unbound by place or time: Museums and online learning and All Together Now: Museums and Online Collaborative Learning. AAM’s Museum Junction is also a great resource for developing and facilitating online programming. Educators from all types of institutions have come together to support one another during closures and transitions to virtual engagement. But institutions must invest in their staff to encourage the creation of high-quality online programming that is beneficial for learners of all ages.

Between highly trained educators and robust partnerships, we can lighten the load in developing new online programming. These programs allow museums to increase access and education for learners of all ages.

Dr. Rania Al Mashat, launched the People&Projects&Purpose global partnerships video series and celebrated International Day of Rural Women with United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

Aiming to promote global partnerships and awareness of on-ground projects, the video showcases Egypt’s success stories in development through the People&Projects&Purpose narrative with development partners across various sectors through videos, stories, and field visits.

It was also retweeted by the official page of UNIDO on social media to create promotion and marketing for Egypt’s development story on the global stage.

In a tweet, Minister Rania Al Mashat said, “rural women are the frontlines of our economy. This rural women day, we celebrate their role in making a difference and our commitment to sustainable and inclusive development.”

The video comes under the ‘Global Partnerships Narrative’ launched in April of this year, which is used to transparently showcase projects with purpose and their impact on people to boost inclusive growth as a means to promote SDGs and bolster credibility.

Previously, the ministry also celebrated International Day of the Girl with United States Agency for International Development through the STEMs schools project under the ‘People, Projects and Purpose’ narrative.

It also produced the ‘Beyond Food’ video with the World Food Programme (WFP) ahead of its field trip to Luxor, which was retweeted on WFP’s social media pages as well as the executive director of WFP David Beasley.

WHAT IS THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS NARRATIVE?

The new Global Partnerships Narrative aims at highlighting Egypt’s successful cooperation story with its partners to help foster inclusive growth in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The new narrative aims to contribute to ensuring that the promotion of future collaborations is based on an up-to-date, consistent and complete narrative between the Government of Egypt and its multilateral and bilateral partners generated through strong connections and engagement.

It focuses on three pillars: people at the core, projects in action and purpose as the driver.

For the first pillar, Egypt is committed to improving Egyptian people’s lives through public private partnerships that push Egyptians towards realizing their full potential.

As for the second pillar, projects are implemented with various partners, from international development partners, to governments as well as the private sector and civil society across multiple sectors including in education, transportation, water desalination, renewable energy, entrepreneurship, and women empowerment.

For the third pillar, partnerships with purpose to achieve the 17 SDGs is the key driver to generate sustained and inclusive growth in a rapidly changing world.

This is regarded as the second principle of economic diplomacy, which also includes the first principle through regularly organizing multi-stakeholder platforms to ensure that all projects between development partners are streamlined and effectively, and the third principle through mapping ODA financing to SDGs for all projects with multilateral and bilateral development partners","Dr. Rania Al Mashat, launched the People&Projects&Purpose global partnerships video series and celebrated International Day of Rural Women with United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
Aiming to promote global partnerships and awareness of on-ground projects, the video showcases Egypt’s success stories in development through the People&Projects&Purpose narrative with development partners across various sectors through videos, stories, and field visits.

All eyes were on Goldman Sachs and Apple in March 2019, when they together announced the Apple Card, a credit vehicle for Apple’s proprietary payment service, Apple Pay. The Silicon Valley crowd liked that the product centered on an iPhone app that lets users track and sort spending in near real time, with security and other features managed by swipes and the push of virtual buttons. The card also deepened Apple’s financial-services (FS) play in the US$1.35 trillion consumer-facing tech product space, and it posed a legitimate threat to incumbents. The banking industry saw an enormous opportunity in the deal. Within just a few months, Goldman Sachs had extended $736 million in credit, in the form of outstanding loan balances, to Apple cardholders.

And for Goldman Sachs, the Apple partnership is only the beginning. The bank, not Apple, built the guts of the app: the systems for approving customers, setting interest rates, and the like. And now — according to press reports — Goldman Sachs is using its technology to court credit card partnerships with other consumer giants, including General Motors.

Goldman Sachs is onto something. Partnerships remain the surest path to rapid revenue growth for financial-services firms, not to mention the companies they team up with. And around the world, leading companies are translating the venerable credit card partnership model to other financial products and services.

All told, we estimate that such partnerships — focusing on payment methods and credit, checking and savings accounts, mortgage loans, property and casualty insurance, brokerage services, and investment products for consumers and small businesses — generated more than $70 billion in revenues in the U.S. alone in 2019. Some components (for example, point-of-sale lending) have been seeing double-digit growth rates even through the pandemic-induced recession, and we expect the global revenue pool to double from 2020 to 2025. The economic logic of partnerships like these is multifaceted. Acquiring customers via traditional inorganic methods has never been more expensive. Partnerships offer organic growth via product development and expansion into new geographies. They can also help companies meet the changing expectations of consumers, who are prioritizing service, digital access, and brand affinity. And partnerships can help legacy firms combat the threat from nimble, agile fintechs.

All of these issues take on new urgency in light of COVID-19. Over the past several months, corporate revenues have dried up as unemployment has soared. Among FS firms, PwC global research shows that 51 percent of CFOs surveyed in May 2020 anticipated a decrease in revenues/profits of up to 25 percent as a result of the crisis. Now more than ever, both FS CEOs and their counterparts in other industries need growth partnerships to kick-start their revenue engines.

How partnering enables quick, low-cost, low-risk scale

Customer acquisition may be the foundation of growth, but it can also be expensive and difficult. In FS, comparison websites such as NerdWallet, Bankrate, and Credit Karma in the U.S., Check24 and MoneySuperMarket in Europe, and Policybazaar in India, have given consumers a one-stop shopping destination for a growing number of products. Together, sites such as these are now the largest sources of leads for banks, insurers, mortgage lenders, and credit card issuers — and collect a bounty for each successful referral. Affiliate spend is on the rise, generally. Acquiring new customers is challenging in other ways, too. In emerging markets, for example, large segments of the population new to banking are ready for services, but these potential clients are harder to reach and serve through physical branches and commissioned agents, the channels that banks and insurers have historically leveraged.

Now more than ever, both financial services CEOs and their counterparts in other industries need growth partnerships to kick-start their revenue engines.

Teaming up with a company that already has loyal clients or members is, by contrast, an efficient way to acquire new customers. Moreover, in many cases, particularly when it comes to purchase financing, the partnership puts the lender’s name and product in front of consumers at the most relevant moment: when they’re considering — or finalizing — the transaction. For some FS companies, such as the private-label credit card issuer Synchrony, relying on partners to refer new customers is the heart of the business model.

Of course, the partner in the arrangement also profits by filling out its product portfolio and meeting more of its customers’ needs. Companies in sectors outside of FS are eager to package financial products together with the goods and services they already sell — a strategy that cements customers’ relationship with the brand even as it extracts additional revenues from them through finder fees, revenue sharing, and/or data sharing. Google is planning to launch checking accounts. Amazon is offering a secured credit-building credit card, issued by Synchrony, to customers with a poor or insufficient credit history. Separately, Amazon is linking its U.S. merchants to opportunities for working-capital loans from Goldman Sachs and its Japanese sellers to the startup payment processor Paidy. In China, Huawei is launching its own version of the Apple Card.

The enthusiasm for partnerships extends well beyond the tech omnivores. Consumer businesses across the economy have a host of incentives. Yes, well-executed partnerships can grease the skids for sales that might otherwise not occur, which is why retailers and others have turned to online financial companies to offer loans to customers at checkout (e.g., Shopify in the U.S. and Klarna in Europe), but they can also improve the customer experience in other ways. For instance, several large telecommunications clients are offering their customers not just loans for purchasing expensive new phones but also insurance policies for when they lose or break them. And not long after the Apple Card launch, Ally Financial acknowledged the lure of boutique point-of-sale financing when it bought Health Credit Services (HCS), a fintech startup that lends money to patients to pay for medical procedures. HCS leveraged partnerships on both ends of the transaction, relying on doctors to market the loans and banks and credit unions to underwrite many of them.

Credit partnerships are also a powerful tool for reducing the cost of accepting card payments, which are, of course, ubiquitous in the modern economy. The CMO of one gasoline marketing company recently told us that these transaction fees, at nearly 2.5 percent, amounted to the single largest line item on his company’s profit and loss statement. Retailers that put their names on a credit card normally pay lower fees on transactions with that card. (And if a retailer can shift the transaction to a loan, it can sometimes eliminate the fee altogether.) Undoubtedly, Apple hopes that by permanently placing its credit card at the top of the Apple Wallet, users will turn to it when they make purchases at Apple’s App Store, reducing the transaction cost for those purchases.

Of course, banks are only one half of a partnership equation, and there are benefits to be found on both sides. Sometimes the financial institution will be the intermediary for client acquisition, allowing it to profit from the partnership in other ways. Indeed, some incumbent banks are partnering with upstart FS firms to offer additional services to their clients. In the U.K., for example, Barclays has teamed up with Nimbla to offer its small-business customers access to insurance for individual invoices. And in India, Citigroup has partnered with Paytm to launch a Paytm First Visa card, expanding its reach to 300 million urban and emerging-affluent customers within Paytm’s payments ecosystem.

As the COVID-19 pandemic squeezes revenues and expenditures, it’s forcing financial institutions to rethink how they play in some parts of the value chain. They’re looking at a cost-benefit analysis of continuing to own multiple data centers and infrastructure, versus consolidating their expense footprint by off-hosting infrastructure via cloud platforms. Relying on partners who can supply basic capabilities also frees up funding for innovation or more valuable initiatives.

Two ways to partner

In general, FS business leaders take two approaches to partnerships that expand core business lines.

First, some market their products under their own brand name through their partners’ distribution channels. Sometimes the product is jointly branded with the partner that owns the channel — airline frequent flyer credit cards are the classic example. When two powerhouse brands, such as a big bank and a major airline, pair up, each partner can strengthen its own customer relationships, building loyalty as customers accrue benefits from both partners.

Or, banks can provide the behind-the-scenes support that enables the partner to diversify its revenue stream by selling financial products and services under its own brand (as with the Apple Card). The financial institution’s technology and back-office systems power services that carry the partner’s name exclusively. Although tech evangelizers have lately dubbed this banking-as-a-service, which suggests a service that is just one more offering within the partner’s suite of products, it’s essentially another variation of the private labeling that’s ubiquitous in the economy. (Think dairies that package milk with labels for specific supermarket chains, or eyeglass makers that create designs for various fashion brands.) In the U.S. market, Synchrony and Cross River Bank are the epitome of this model. Cross River Bank has grown its revenues fourfold over the past five years alone, maintaining 20 to 30 percent return on equity, while serving fintechs such as Affirm, Best Egg, and Stripe.

Banks are hardly the first financial-services companies to head down this path. Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and TD Ameritrade all started out as discount, direct-to-consumer brokerages and established strong retail brands. Then they diversified by offering their clearing and custody capabilities to registered independent advisor (RIA) firms, which advise high-net-worth individuals and are therefore required to register with securities administrators. For most banks and insurers, following one path or the other is easy.

The question of which path to choose depends primarily on the financial institution’s core capabilities. Some own the customer relationship. Other firms have honed their capabilities in different parts of the value chain, developing capacity for, say, underwriting insurance products or pricing subprime credit cards. WebBank, for instance, attributes its regulatory and compliance prowess to the partnerships it has established with many leading fintechs, including PayPal and LendingClub. Through these deals, it issues loans and credit cards. Sometimes scale matters — either because the business has high fixed costs (mortgage and credit card operations are classic examples), or because it allows the institution to refine analytical models for better underwriting, pricing, and collections.

It might seem like the biggest institutions have an advantage in forming partnerships. They have the capacity, the resources, and the name recognition among consumers. But in fact, their very size often counts against them. Big banks are frequently hobbled by a bureaucracy and a hubris that rub many potential partners — particularly fast-moving tech companies — the wrong way. There might also be a sense among some large tech companies, in the U.S. at least, that smaller banks and institutions are more flexible than big banks and represent a regulatory arbitrage play: U.S. banking regulation treats small banks, especially those with less than $10 billion in balance sheet assets, more favorably than larger institutions when it comes to debit interchange fees. Initially, for example, Google planned to develop its checking accounts with Citibank and a small Silicon Valley credit union. But in August, the search giant added six more U.S. banks to its program, all much smaller than Citibank. These include BBVA USA (whose parent is based in Spain) and BMO Harris (a subsidiary of a leading Canadian bank), along with three community banks and another credit union.

Where to find a partner

One obvious place to find a partner is at the top of the market. Companies with powerful brands are logical prospects. These typically include large retailers, big tech companies, and affinity groups such as the AARP, the American Automobile Association, and institutions of higher learning (for their alumni). Over time, they have earned the trust of their customers or members, and a partnership is sort of a letter of introduction for the FS firm.

Companies with vast client bases — especially those with captive clients — are also good prospects. Brands that command big shares of the market, or that have products that can’t easily be traded for another, such as airlines, health insurers, telecom companies, and internet commerce platforms, promise both scale and exclusive access.

But there’s another field of opportunities here — call them “financial moments of truth.” These moments happen when a consumer makes occasional or rare, but expensive, purchases that make the buyer swallow hard at the moment of transaction, or even walk away empty-handed. These purchases might center on life events, such as weddings and b’nai mitzvah. They might involve big home improvement projects. The financing company Microf, for example, offers lease-to-own loans for installing residential heating and cooling systems directly to consumers and through HVAC contractors. (The company also offers the same product through SunTrust bank as a private label.) Anywhere there’s a big-ticket item for sale, there’s a point-of-sale financing opportunity through the seller.

Healthcare, with its potentially outsized out-of-pocket costs for patients, is an especially ripe, and still largely untapped, opportunity. Every health insurer and drug maker is now looking to launch a lending solution with a financial-services partner. One pharmaceutical company we’re working with aims to speed adoption of its novel medications that aren’t yet covered by health insurance by facilitating prescription financing. In developing countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, drug companies are partnering with private lenders to finance expensive treatment regimens. And in the U.S., a startup called Notable Finance, under the trade name Penguin Pay, allows uninsured or underinsured consumers to pay for their medication in weekly installments.

Deciding which role to play in the partnership

Once a customer-facing company decides that adding a financial product makes sense, it faces a crucial question: Should it serve as the bank, or merely the conduit to the bank? For point-of-sale financing or insurance products, the issue is whether a more seamless integration smooths the transaction. For a consumer agonizing over an $800 phone, for example, would the financial pain points be soothed by the offer of a Verizon-branded payment plan and a Verizon-branded insurance policy, rather than a referral to a separate financing company and insurance carrier?

For the small handful of very large technology companies that aspire to mediate or curate users’ entire online experience, and especially to aggregate their choices in the marketplace, a house-branded credit card or bank account is one more way to reinforce that sense of omnipresence. But there are risks involved when companies that aren’t banks start acting like banks, even when they leave the exposure to loan defaults to their actual bank partner. It’s unclear whether banking regulators respect the division of responsibility set out in the partnership agreement. For instance, nonbank companies must comply with anti-money-laundering and identity-verification rules. Also, regulators in China have capped the amount of money investors could put in fintech Ant Group’s money-market fund on any given day. They’ve also required the nation’s super-apps to back all of their customers’ “reserve funds” (prepayments from online shoppers) with central bank reserves and have mandated a centralized clearing platform for nonbank payments. According to press reports, Amazon abandoned plans to offer Amazon mobile checking accounts, managed by JPMorgan Chase, for fear that regulators would treat the retailer like a bank. Notably, Google will co-brand its checking accounts with the financial institutions that will service them.

For a financial firm, the role played in any particular partnership is often set by its counterparty. Goldman Sachs, having spent more than $1 billion to develop its consumer banking technology for its Marcus by Goldman Sachs brand, certainly wants to build the brand — it offers Marcus loans through Intuit’s accounting software and Marcus savings accounts through AARP. But it’s also willing to work with partners such as Apple and Amazon that would prefer Goldman take a back seat and that have the market power to set those terms. So, even as it looks for new outlets for Marcus, Goldman is simultaneously aiming to become a sort of Amazon Web Services for banking, putting its platform in the service of scale through its partners. At the end of the day, though, FS institutions have to stay true to their own strategic objectives.

Making a partnership work

The most difficult part of a partnership negotiation is usually about the money. But not always: When a customer is clearly being handed off to the FS company, and the referring partner then withdraws from the picture, or if the partnership isn’t intended to last more than a few years, it might be enough to close the deal for the bank to simply pay a referral fee, or bounty, to its distributor.

More often, though, ventures are meant to last, and both partners remain invested in the customer. And usually, these arrangements pose some amount of risk for at least one partner — all of which calls for sharing revenues and costs. For ventures like these to succeed, it’s imperative that both partners have clarity on their economic and strategic priorities. Multiple permutations of revenue-sharing arrangements are possible, but partners need to ensure that the terms are equitable in both the short and long term.

Revenue-share models should be structured to drive FS product penetration and profitability, and track a set of metrics aimed at spurring more sales, improving customer service quality, and increasing the overall share of wallet. A profit-sharing model is best when one of the players is willing to invest during the ramp-up phase to capture a higher upside once the financial business is operating at steady state.

The starting point for each principal in the deal is an expected return on equity commensurate with the risk that it is taking on. (Return on equity for any initiative is the income it generates divided by the net assets allocated to it.) As a rule, if a partner can’t earn the same return via the partnership as it would elsewhere, it’s better off deploying that capital somewhere else. Of course, every rule has its exceptions. For example, in its small-lending partnership with Goldman Sachs, Amazon might expect a return on equity that’s three to five times higher than the lender’s, but that’s in large part because there’s very little equity capital at stake in origination, compared to the bank’s balance sheet–intensive acceptance of credit risk. (The share of actual customer revenues going to Amazon will likely be very small.)

The partnership must then account for returns across all the revenues, and all the costs, the program generates. Generally, each line item is negotiated separately. This, of course, adds complexity, but the complexity is a bulwark against changing circumstances — perhaps a recession, or a spike in call volumes, or competitive pressure that requires a change in interest rates or fees. A detailed sharing structure offers flexibility to respond to the changes without leaving one party or the other at a disadvantage. The agreement should return capital costs in proportion to how they were invested, and then ensure incremental gains on an ongoing basis.

The parties will also have to find a way to gauge the results of the revenue-sharing aspect of the venture rather than simply coming to an agreement and then failing to check in or apply performance metrics. One way to do that is to embrace return on experience (ROX), a dynamic process for investigating the connections between certain company qualities, customer and employee experiences, and the financial results of those experiences.

It’s not easy to successfully execute a partnership — many promising tie-ups are unwound within a few short years. Often, that’s because the results fall short for one party, even as they meet or exceed the other party’s expectations. A lasting partnership hinges on trust. Building goodwill early on can enable partners to set big long-term goals while celebrating small victories along the way. When partners work to be agreeable, collaborative, and responsible, winning partnerships thrive, multiplying value for all.","And now — according to press reports — Goldman Sachs is using its technology to court credit card partnerships with other consumer giants, including General Motors.

We need to step up our efforts. The clock is ticking — and people are dying.https://t.co/0hfUlJsPBF — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 21, 2020

He thanked countries for their firm commitment to multilateralism, and for backing his call for warring parties to lay down their arms during the pandemic.

“I welcome your support of my appeal for a global ceasefire, which I renewed in my address to the General Assembly last month. I look forward to your further advocacy to help end hostilities around the world, including ongoing conflicts within your region”, he said.

Pandemic recovery and climate action

The Secretary-General was heartened that like the UN, ASEAN members agree that a COVID-19 vaccine should be a global public good and accessible to all people.

He stressed the need to work together to protect lives and jobs, and to keep businesses and economies afloat, while highlighting that building back must be inclusive and sustainable.

“Pandemic recovery has the potential to advance climate action for a carbon-neutral world by 2050. Investment in renewable energy remains more cost-effective than the continued reliance on fossil-fuel subsidies and coal power plants”, he said.

“We also need to reverse declining trends of biodiversity, deforestation and land degradation, and end the unsustainable exploitation of marine resources.”

‘Intensified geopolitical competition’

Turning to peace and security, the Secretary-General expressed concern over “intensified geopolitical competition” in the region and beyond.

Mr. Guterres said increasing tensions in the South China Sea require dialogue and refraining from any escalation.

“I reiterate my hope for the early conclusion of a Code of Conduct. I also call for peaceful dispute resolution, in conformity with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea”, he said.

“In the Korean Peninsula, ASEAN’s Foreign Ministers have an important role to play in calling for the parties, especially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to continue what was started. The United Nations stands ready, including in cooperation with ASEAN, to support the process and key parties in their efforts.”

Solve the Rohingya crisis

The Secretary-General also focused on the ongoing displacement of Rohingya and other communities in Myanmar.

Nearly one million Rohingya have sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh, most of whom arrived after escaping a violent crackdown by security forces in August 2017.

Mr. Guterres recalled his previous appeals for action to address the root causes of the crisis and to create conditions for the voluntary repatriation of refugees.

“Beyond solutions for the immediate humanitarian suffering, accountability is an imperative for long-term reconciliation,” he said, underlining the UN’s readiness to cooperate further on the issue.

Scale-up sustainable development

On Wednesday, the UN and ASEAN adopted a new five-year Plan of Action that expands cooperation in areas such as youth, peace and security, cyber-security and action to prevent hate speech.

Other priorities covered are building resilience, including to climate disasters, and dramatically increasing social protection.

As this year marks the start of a Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN chief urged countries to meet this challenge.

A growing number of local governments are coming to see fiber broadband networks as essential infrastructure for the 21st century, infrastructure that is capable of driving and supporting simultaneous progress in just about every area of significance to their communities. This includes economic development, education, health care, environmental protection, energy, transportation, government services, digital equity, and much more. While such benefits may be difficult to measure in monetary terms—as is also true of the monetary benefits of roads, sidewalks, electricity, sewers, and water—they are real nonetheless. For many communities, these benefits are likely to be the primary reasons for entering into a public-private partnership.

Several major legal issues may arise in a broadband public-private partnership project, including confirmation of authority, pre-negotiation project planning and finding potential private partners, and negotiation of the agreement.

Early in a typical fiber project, a group of local champions emerges and launches an exploratory process to determine whether and how the community can obtain an advanced communications system. The champions often include local government officials, business leaders, educators, health care professionals, young people, and a wide range of others. These champions tend to be individuals with lots of positive energy and an ability to inspire and encourage others to follow their lead.

At first, the champions commonly invest many hours obtaining high-level information about fiber broadband initiatives, particularly from individuals who have participated in such projects in comparable communities and are eager to share their experiences. Eventually, the process will reach the point at which more specific information is necessary to understand the community’s unique combination of broadband goals, assets, needs, opportunities, challenges, and potential partners.

At this point, many local governments have found it useful to solicit input through a “Request for Information,” a “Request for Qualifications,” or a similar process (collectively “RfX” processes) that are not constrained by formal procurement requirements.

A good RfX process can be beneficial on multiple levels. First, the process of designing the RfX requires the community’s leaders to form and build consensus around imaginative new visions of the community’s potential. Second, the RfX allows the community to market these visions, not just to prospective partners but also to the community’s businesses, institutions, and residents. Third, the process allows for extensive informal communications between the local government and potential partners, who often compete with each other to win the local government’s support. These communications might not only help the local government test the validity of its going-in assumptions but might also open its mind to even better ideas.

By the end of the RfX process, a local government should have a well-refined understanding of what it wants to do; what it realistically can get and must give in return; what the approximate costs, revenues, and other benefits and burdens will be; and with whom it would like to partner. With this knowledge, the local government can issue a formal Request for Proposals or engage in whatever other procurement process applicable state and local law require it to follow.

Once the local government has developed its short list of the potential partners, negotiations to finalize the agreement can commence. Depending on state and local procurement requirements and the local government’s preferences, the negotiations may proceed with one bidder at a time or with multiple bidders simultaneously. Either way, the local government’s objective will be to achieve the best possible allocation of risks, responsibilities, and rewards for the community.

Although positive network externalities are difficult to measure precisely, a growing body of literature is emerging on useful ways to estimate them. For example, Dr. Bento Lobo, an economist at the University of Tennessee, has estimated that the municipal fiber utility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, produced more than $1.3 billion in economic and social benefits in its first five years and is likely to produce even greater benefit in the years ahead.[1]

Recent months have seen a surge of initiatives to boost affordable connectivity. Telecom companies, for example, are increasing internet speed and capacity at no added cost to their consumers.

Working with partners to ensure the World Bank’s client countries have the infrastructure they need to provide their populations with affordable and reliable internet connections is a top priority, Diop told Devex.

“We all have an interest in accelerating the development of digital access in Africa.” — Makhtar Diop, vice president for infrastructure, World Bank

Diop, former World Bank vice president for Africa, oversees the energy and extractives and digital development departments as part of his practice.

“I see a lot of links between energy and digital,” he said. “It’s not only that energy is needed for digital. But also digital could be a big solution to accelerate access to electricity.”

“Not anymore a luxury good.” Makhtar Diop, vice president for infrastructure at the World Bank. Via YouTube

He described how a telecommunications company might finance rooftop solar panels to power their operations, track consumption on a handset, and have customers use financial technology, or fintech, to pay for the service.

What is the World Bank without international travel? (Pro) For years, the World Bank has faced questions about its liberal travel policies and budgets. Now the institution's leaders are asking how it can continue to provide global expertise and supervision at a time when travel is nearly impossible.

“So it’s a really nice dynamic we are seeing now which is really bringing everything together and leapfrogging,” he said.

Traditionally, telecom operators have not embraced a shared infrastructure approach, which would allow them to expand coverage and reduce costs in the deployment of their networks.

“Each provider has its base station which is proprietary and in fact, it reduces competition and reduces access,” Diop said.

Organizations working on digital infrastructure want to ensure that examples of infrastructure sharing in the context of COVID-19 continue over the long term.

The World Bank and other partners authored a joint action plan in April proposing a number of actions to increase the bandwidth of networks facing a surge of traffic, support digital business models, and enhance the safety and security of digital services.

For example, it explains that countries can free dark fiber, or unused fiber optic cable, and make it available for internet service providers.

As telecom operators and internet service providers work to strengthen digital infrastructure, tech giants are also looking to increase bandwidth, Diop said. Google and Facebook are building undersea cables to improve internet connectivity in Africa. Diop emphasized the need to build the fiber-optic network beyond big cities so that people in rural areas can access faster connections.

“We don’t want this to just be a proprietary infrastructure where people are putting a very high premium to be able to access this,” he said. “We would like it to be open access and to offer a level playing field and not be a club.”

In addition to promoting shared infrastructure, Diop and his team are focused on lowering the costs of handsets.

“We have some countries which have good coverage but unfortunately the cost of the handset is too high,” he said.

Cybersecurity has emerged as another priority. As the African continent gains access to higher speed internet, an increase in cyberattacks has followed, Diop explained.

He also outlined the need for the World Bank to work in closer partnership with the private sector on digital skills initiatives on the African continent, and suggested that it might start with a few countries where they can align their efforts.

In the next year, Diop expects to hold additional conversations with Africa-based philanthropists and companies to invest in the digital sector. These groups know the ecosystem, he said, and could attract further investment.

Diop seemed hopeful that the cooperation resulting from the pandemic might help to address the lack of trust between the private sector and the government that has held back progress on global broadband access.

“I think it’s time now to realize we all have an interest in accelerating the development of digital access in Africa,” he said.","SAN FRANCISCO — The COVID-19 pandemic could help fast-track the partnerships needed to spread broadband internet access, Makhtar Diop, World Bank vice president for infrastructure, said at last week’s World Bank annual meetings.

It has become more common for research institutions across the globe to establish collaborative research and joint degree programmes, often hugely benefiting research and teaching. Individual scholars and students travel more easily and frequently today, too, and their ideas and arguments travel with them.



Moreover, even when physical travel is interrupted, as it is at the moment, academic communities can interact and stay connected remotely.



But internationalisation has also produced new risks, especially in the context of engagement, exchange and collaboration with non-democratic countries.



In an age of ‘democratic retrogression’ and deepening authoritarianism affecting many countries, many members of the global academic community face growing challenges – including censorship and travel restrictions, disciplinary measures and dismissals, criminal prosecutions and even physical attacks, as has been well documented by



Such repression has become increasingly internationalised, not only because repressive governments can extend threats and censorship across borders, but also because marketised funding structures, the casualisation of academic work and an opportunistic approach to building global ties have made academic actors within liberal democracies more vulnerable – and sometimes less willing to stand up for academic freedom and integrity.



This is the case, for example, when universities take funding that comes with



Exporting repression



Against this background, we must be concerned about the terms of our engagement with academic institutions abroad, as well as about repressive governments and institutions’ ability to ‘export repression’ in the field of academia.



At a time when the global pandemic has changed academic life beyond recognition for many of us in the UK and globally, and as we are already overburdened with the challenges arising immediately from COVID, we may feel reluctant to engage with further, more long-term challenges.



Yet, as members of the recently established Academic Freedom and Internationalisation Working Group (



Universities could respond in several ways. Denial – such as that by the Chair of Million Plus group of universities, Bill Rammell, in his



An auditing response of generic and top-down reporting requirements, which spread like viruses through UK higher education, are also unlikely to touch conditions on the ground.



Similarly, the notion that universities must “sensitively balance the need to uphold academic freedom with the importance of internal academic collaboration”– as suggested by then Universities UK president Janet Beer in her letter to the FAC – is equally inadequate and betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of academic freedom.



Faced with such inertia, the UK government, including its security agencies, have pressed British higher education to develop security guidelines and risk management strategies. In



A new code of conduct



However, while there may be a need for draconian measures in rare cases, a national security approach is largely inappropriate as it is founded on false premises.



UK universities are not national institutions under threat, but global institutions so thoroughly internationalised that any attempt to cut them off from foreign influence may make the problem worse.



It would feed the narrative of some authoritarian states that they are vehicles of British ‘soft power’ against their values and even Trojan horses for spying researchers.



A far better response is for a bottom-up process led by academic staff, supported by students, civil society and unions.



The AFIWG has composed a



It is a draft and a model so it can be revised in the coming months of consultation and adapted from the minimum standards enshrined in the model.



These minimum standards include a stipulation that universities must undertake meaningful risk assessment and due diligence when transnational collaboration is being considered before any agreement or arrangement is begun.



In particular, they must ensure memorandums of understanding (MoUs) on international partnerships, including foreign campuses and the affiliation of foreign education or research institutions to UK higher education institutions within the UK, are subject to consultation across the university.



With regard to protecting their staff and students overseas, universities must evaluate academic freedom and the risks associated with its absence, as when planning fieldwork and field trips abroad, and make available enhanced travel insurance to cover politically motivated or arbitrary detention by state authorities.



On campuses at home, universities should ensure that academic freedom requirements, including personal data protection for these members of the academic community, are incorporated within all MoUs with state scholarship programmes. Vice-chancellors and their gifts committees must make all MoUs and summary information on all foreign donations public.



A system of confidential and public reporting is required to enhance protection and accountability. UK universities should establish a confidential and independent internal reporting mechanism to a designated individual on campus for cases or issues of concern, while serious cases and issues, including all those involving a threat to the welfare of the complainant, should be passed to a new, independent ombudsperson.



An academic freedom model in authoritarian times?



This is a model and draft which may have relevance far beyond the UK. It is designed to be revised via debate on campus among staff and students and adopted according to minimum conditions. The duties it imposes are on universities’ leaders – not on staff and students who may be vulnerable themselves.



But there is a risk. If vice-chancellors pass down the code of conduct in the form of new and onerous auditing requirements for staff, or if governments make them matters of national security, academic freedom will be weakened, not strengthened. The way to protect academic freedom is for universities to be held to account by their academics and students.



We must use our freedom before we lose it.

We meet today to discuss an issue that sits at the heart of our development agenda: food security.

We won’t meet our twin goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity without addressing food security.

When families fall further into poverty, cutting back on calories and nutrition, economies suffer, and human capital is compromised together with progress for the next generation.

When people are hungry, forests tend to burn, rolling back environmental gains.

And governments lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people, increasing the risk and severity of fragility, conflict and violence.

Food security is much more than an agricultural issue. It deserves action across government, from trade and competitiveness, to social protection, nutrition and environmental action. This is why I am so pleased to see the participation of so many Ministers at today’s roundtable.

I’d like to make three short points.

The first is that leadership matters. In the early days of the pandemic, consumers and governments moved quickly to secure basic needs, sometimes hoarding food and creating fears that we would see a repeat of the export restrictions that accentuated food price increases in the past.

Thankfully, we learned from the past and moved away, in large part, from this protectionist scenario. The leadership of the G20 and other regional cooperation bodies was decisive. Governments made a concerted effort to keep food moving between countries. As a result, global trade in agricultural commodities has remained relatively stable and strong.

My second point is that short and longer-term food security challenges are interconnected. Unless we invest in stronger, healthier and more resilient food systems, we’ll keep facing repeated and increasingly costly crises.

We cannot afford to neglect agriculture. Globally, two thirds of the working poor work in agriculture.

Rapid phone surveys we’ve been carrying out since the beginning of the pandemic, show that rural populations are particularly vulnerable to reduced incomes and have fewer coping mechanisms than urban populations.

We need policies and programs that boost food producers’ incomes, connect them to markets and encourage them to produce higher-value and more diversified foods. Society at large will be stronger as a result, including in situations of fragility, conflict and violence where agribusiness jobs and rural programs can improve social cohesion.

The same is true of nutrition. We can’t afford to focus solely on empty calories and keep producing ever more ultra-processed foods. Producing calories without nutrition is counter- productive, resulting in the worsening obesity epidemic we see today –even in low-income countries. And as new research by our teams has shown, obesity predisposes individuals to more severe impacts of COVID-19, increasing the risk of death by nearly 50%.

Healthy diets are still too expensive for more than 3 billion people in the world. Our response to the current crisis must support better health and human capital development in the long run.

Today’s food systems are also a significant source of greenhouse gases. Even as we worry about COVID-19, climate impacts are being felt in the form of locust outbreaks, drought, and flooding.

Let’s support climate-smart agriculture so that food systems are less carbon-intensive and more climate-resilient.

Let’s do everything we can to invest in a better future –where food systems are a cornerstone of healthy economies, healthy people and a healthy planet.

This brings me to my third point, which is really a question: What more can we do to respond to rising food insecurity and build more resilient food systems?

At the World Bank, we are helping countries access financing and policy instruments.

We’ve committed many millions of dollars in social protection programs that extend cash transfers and work programs so that people can still afford to eat.

We’ve restructured our agricultural portfolio, unlocked emergency financing, and delivered new projects to help farmers cope with the crisis and keep food production strong.

Through the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, a partnership hosted by the World Bank, we’ve focused on increasing rural incomes by raising agricultural productivity, creating jobs and improving access to markets, and allocated over $55 million of additional grant funding to reduce the impacts of the pandemic.

One of the Bank’s new tools for helping countries take earlier action is the $500 million Early Response Financing (ERF) available through the IDA19 Crisis Response Window. The ERF can mobilize up to $50 million per country during the early stages of an emerging crisis, making use of food security data and forecasts to identify eligible events. Several countries facing emerging food security crises are already considering applying for these funds.

This is an impressive suite of responses. And yet it’s only a drop in the ocean comparing to the need. Emergency financing is already being overstretched. We need to think outside the box or risk running from one costly crisis to the next.

The World Bank proposes to help countries maximize the impact of their spending and transform their food systems to increase food security and reach their 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

This is the aim of our new umbrella Trust Fund, Food Systems 2030. By modernizing the policies and practices that govern agriculture and food, we could steer trillions of dollars in private sector investment toward better development outcomes.

Ministers, I look forward to hearing what you see as priorities for support and policy change at this challenging time.","Esteemed Ministers, it’s a pleasure to welcome you to our Annual Meetings Food Security Roundtable.

The event was presided over by Professor Rita Akosua Dickson, PhD, Vice-Chancellor of KNUST. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Ambassador Tibor Nagy, attended the event virtually from Washington, DC and delivered remarks. U.S. Embassy officials attended the event at KNUST and virtually from Accra to support the launch of the UPI which seeks to strengthen existing ties and foster new collaboration between U.S. and African universities through faculty and student exchanges, joint research, administrative capacity-building and public-private partnerships.

Representatives from the Texas International Education Consortium (TIEC) and Iowa State University (ISU) also participated in the virtual launch, with each institution providing an overview of the projects they are undertaking at KNUST.

TIEC, in collaboration with the KNUST Business School, is implementing “Flexible Learning: Responding and Reimagining Education in Ghana.” In response to the urgent need for virtual education due to the COVID-19 pandemic, TIEC staff has assembled higher education professionals from several universities in Texas to train 30 administrators and faculty to produce quality online and flexible learning. Participants will go on to train other faculty and administrators within KNUST and throughout Ghana. Please visit www.tiec.org/university-partnerships for more information on TIEC’s university partnerships.

ISU is partnering with the KNUST College of Engineering to implement “Institutional Capacity Building through Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Collaboration.” ISU and KNUST faculty and students will partner with the Ullo Traditional Area in the Upper West Region to collaborate on small-scale community development. These projects will promote research-driven solutions to address food security, potable water security, sustainable agriculture, and improved economic opportunity. This ‘learning by doing’ approach will bolster the students’ real-world problem-solving abilities and globalize the undergraduate engineering curriculum at both universities. For more information on this project, please visit the EWB chapter at ISU: www.ewb.stuorg.iastate.edu.

In her welcome remarks, Professor Dickson noted that the TIEC-KNUST project “propels us in our pursuit of building the needed capacity for the establishment of a more resilient and robust e-learning system that ensures seamless academic work all year round and also offer us the opportunity to transfer knowledge to individuals less privileged to access in-person learning experience from our University.” The Vice-Chancellor also endorsed the ISU-KNUST project, saying it “will strengthen our institutional capacity towards achieving our mission as it will position KNUST in an era where academia-community engagement for the socio-economic development of our less privileged communities is paramount.”

Assistant Secretary Nagy applauded the inaugural UPI collaborations in Ghana, stating, “these projects exemplify core principles in American higher education leadership: excellence and innovation in delivery of online education (now of paramount importance as schools rely largely on virtual learning), and hands-on, practical education that when put into action, improves lives.”

Through the UPI, the U.S. Embassy will continue to expand existing links and promote new partnerships at the university level that will strengthen Ghana’s educational institutions as instruments of national development – enhancing the United States and Ghana’s shared goals of regional prosperity, security, and stability.

All protocols observed.

I’m delighted to be with you all today for this launch of the University Partnerships Initiative. Greetings from Accra to our colleagues in Washington, DC and to our partners in Kumasi, in Texas, and in Iowa.

University partnerships are a critical element of collaboration among American and Ghanaian higher education institutions. We estimate that hundreds of these types of partnerships already exist in Ghana, forged through decades of binational academic collaboration. These partnerships have flourished through exchange programs such as Fulbright, which sends Ghanaian students, scholars, and professors to the United States and brings American students, scholars, and visiting professors to study and work in Ghanaian universities.

For these reasons, the U.S. Embassy in Accra was well-poised to implement the new University Partnerships Initiative that is the vision of our Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, who is with us today and who will speak to us in just a few minutes.

The University Partnerships Initiative, or UPI, in which Ghana is one of four African focus countries, seeks to strengthen existing ties and foster new collaboration between U.S. and African universities. Focus areas include faculty and student exchanges, joint research, building administrative capacity, and creating public-private partnerships.

The UPI’s timing was fortuitous. The interruption of in-person learning for Ghanaian students due to COVID-19, and the enormous challenges facing higher education globally, require sustainable e-learning programs that increase access to quality higher education. And as we have seen throughout this crisis, faculty and institutions need support and training.

Fortunately, the U.S. Embassy in Ghana was able to provide funding under the UPI for exactly this type of training, in partnership with the Texas International Education Consortium (TIEC), to build faculty capacity to deliver quality, online, and flexible learning and build a bridge to the next generation of students who will increasingly be virtual learners. The initiative for this joint project, known as “Flexible Learning: Responding to and Reimagining Education in Ghana,” came from KNUST faculty in March 2020 because of their existing relationship with TIEC. This is a superb example of what U.S. and Ghanaian universities can do, working together.

The second project we’re launching today builds on a longstanding partnership between Iowa State University (ISU) and KNUST that was also ripe for UPI assistance. Since 2013, the ISU student group Engineers Without Borders (EWB) has worked on community-driven projects in Ghana, most recently implementing a solar-powered, mechanized borehole that distributes 6,000 gallons of water a day to a Senior High boarding school with 1,000 students. KNUST recently established an Engineers Without Borders chapter, building on the two universities’ MOU signed in 2017. Their joint project – Institutional Capacity-Building through Engineers Without Borders Collaboration in the Ullo Traditional Area in the Upper West Region in Ghana” – further strengthens collaboration between the institutions and engages both ISU and KNUST students through interdisciplinary, bilateral STEM projects that bolster their problem-solving skills via “learning by doing.”

Now that I’ve talked a bit about both of these inaugural UPI projects, I’m honored to introduce the visionary behind the University Partnerships Initiative, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy.

Assistant Secretary Nagy, a retired Foreign Service Officer, spent 32 years in government service, including over 20 years in Africa. He served as U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia (1999-2002), U.S. Ambassador to Guinea (1996-1999), and Deputy Chief of Mission in Nigeria (1993-1995), Cameroon (1990-1993), and Togo (1987-1990). Previous assignments include Zambia, the Seychelles, Ethiopia, and Washington, DC. Following his retirement from the Foreign Service, Ambassador Nagy served as Vice Provost for International Affairs at Texas Tech University from 2003 to 2018, during which time he lectured nationally on Africa, foreign policy, international development, and U.S. diplomacy.

And on a personal note, I’d just like to add that I worked for Assistant Secretary Nagy nearly 30 years ago, in my very first diplomatic posting, when he was our Deputy Chief of Mission in Yaoundé and I was just out of university myself and serving at our Consulate General in the Cameroonian city of Douala. In addition to being my boss, he was an early model and mentor, and one of the reasons I’ve dedicated much of my career to fostering U.S. relations with Africa. And so it’s a personal pleasure and honor for me to share some screen time with him today. Assistant Secretary Nagy.","Please visit www.tiec.org/university-partnerships for more information on TIEC’s university partnerships.

247,https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/opinion/the-importance-of-collaborative-partnerships-in-achieving-responsible-minerals-supply-chains/,"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",EURACTIV,The importance of collaborative partnerships in achieving responsible minerals supply chains,"By Julian Lageard, Director Government, Markets and Trade at Intel Corporation

Take a quick inventory of all the technology around you. If you own a smartphone, a laptop or desktop computer, a wearable smart device or even a microwave, there’s a good chance that those technologies were manufactured with some amount of tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold. In the world of minerals, these are often referred to as “3TG.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies 3TG as conflict minerals while other organisations such as the EU and OECD refer to “responsible minerals” to cover other serious abuses in supply chains like forced labour and toxic pollution in mines.

In 2016, as the EU responsible minerals regulation was being finalised, the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) was established.

It is a not-for-profit public-private partnership bringing governments, supply chains actors (including downstream 3TG consuming sectors such as technology and automotive industry) as well as civil society together to accompany the EU Regulation.

The EPRM’s founding strategic partners were Philips, Solidaridad, Diakonia, Intel, the International Peace and Information Service (IPIS), the Netherlands and the UK. The EPRM goal is to increase the demand for and supply of 3TG from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).

Since its inception, many organizations have joined and contributed to the collective efforts, bringing their own expertise and innovative ideas. Germany is the current EPRM chair and the OECD, European Commission (DEVCO) and UNEP are also part of the Partnership.

Even though the legal obligations under the EU Responsible Regulation do not go into effect until 1st, January 2021, the EPRM is not only operational but proactively working to ensure that the regulation is complied with to secure responsible sourcing and production.

By working together as a group rather than as individual interests, we helped develop, implement and finance projects that are delivering concrete results around the world, including:

The Artisanal Women’s Empowerment Credit and Savings Project (AFECCOR): This project promotes women’s economic empowerment by providing women (and men) in artisanal gold mining communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with access to credit and savings, as well as the ability to provide loans to members from savings group funds.

Tin Working Group (TWG): The TWG is working to implement responsible tin mining practices and international best practices in Indonesia. Currently, the TWG is focused on land reclamation and occupational health and safety efforts.

Mthandazo Women Miner’s Association: This project assists the Mthandazo and women gold miners in Zimbabwe in navigating risks and challenges that arise amid conflict. The scope of the project currently encompasses many activities, including the registration of women miner groups, legal training, dispute resolution, training in responsible sourcing, and much more.

We are already seeing the positive impact these projects have had on the lives and livelihoods of people in local communities. When considered separately, each of these projects on its own demonstrates the power of collaboration and innovative thinking in solving complex societal and environmental challenges.

When taken as a whole, the EPRM’s work proves that well-designed public-private partnerships can be a powerful accompanying tool to regulation and legislation.

Just as no one person or organization can implement all of EPRM’s projects, no one law can solve all the problems we face in conflict regions around the world. We must work together — across national divides — to create a smart mix of policy, regulation and implementation.

As an international technology company and a leader in global supply chain security, Intel has an interest in ensuring and facilitating the ethical, responsible and sustainable sourcing of 3TG and other materials, regardless of whether or not they impact our business directly.

It is clear that the role of collaborative partnerships is key which is why Intel decided to be one of the founding strategic partners of the EPRM.

In line with our 2030 RISE goals, part of our corporate responsibility is not only to the industry but also to our customers and the communities from which 3TG are sourced, many of them located in CAHRAs. Intel has committed to making all of its minerals supply chains responsible by 2030.

This is our opportunity to improve sustainability and make a positive change in the lives of people in local communities in higher-risk countries, such as Rwanda, Colombia, Indonesia and the DRC.","In the world of minerals, these are often referred to as “3TG.”The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies 3TG as conflict minerals while other organisations such as the EU and OECD refer to “responsible minerals” to cover other serious abuses in supply chains like forced labour and toxic pollution in mines.

Prior to the introduction of the new PPP Law, which was first mooted back in 2017, the legal framework in Vietnam in relation to PPPs was found in various legislative instruments as illustrated in the diagram below:

Vietnamese laws are generally drafted in relatively broad terms, with the intention being, in common with many other jurisdictions, that the Government and its ministries implement decrees, circulars and directives to give greater specificity and refinement to the broadly-framed laws. However, with ministries and government departments empowered to independently issue these clarifying regulations, it has been the case in the past that overlapping provisions have led to grey areas and conflicting interpretations resulting in a lack of certainty, particularly for foreign investors seeking robust and predictable frameworks within which to make their capital investments.

In the context of PPP projects, with ring-fenced project financing and long concession periods, a transparent and unified legal framework is preferable in order to facilitate predictable behaviour and decision-making and ultimately, the efficient allocation of risk. The PPP Law, which will become effective on 1 January 2021, represents a consolidation of the existing complex legal framework as well as an evolution in the approach to foreign investment.

A unified, well-developed framework for implementing PPP projects will be crucial if Vietnam is to successfully achieve its significant infrastructure goals and overcome its current infrastructure bottleneck. The application of the PPP Law to upcoming road projects will be a true test of whether enough has been done to address the expectations and concerns of foreign investors, particularly as countries grapple with the consequences of a global pandemic.

New regime

PPPs are not a new phenomenon in Vietnam, however, in the past investors, contractors and financiers have had to navigate a complex framework of legislative instruments to understand the legal provisions applicable to their particular infrastructure project. The introduction of the PPP Law will, for the first time, elevate and codify provisions relating to PPP projects at the law level (as passed by the National Assembly of Vietnam), and in doing so, potentially reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity of the legal framework applicable to a particular infrastructure project.

Whilst this article focuses on the key provisions in the PPP Law, we also note that changes have also recently been made to the Law on Investment and the Law on Enterprises. Notable provisions in the PPP Law include:

Applicable projects (Article 4) – The PPP Law specifically stipulates five sectors in which PPP investments are permitted, being (i) transportation; (ii) power grids and power plants (except for hydro-power plants and State monopolies as prescribed by the Electricity Law); (iii) irrigation, clean water supply, water drainage, sewerage and waste treatment; (iv) health care and education; and (v) IT infrastructure. To qualify, a project's value must be at least VND 200 billion (approximately US$8.5 million), except for health care and education projects where the threshold is half that amount. The lower threshold also applies to projects within localities with difficult socioeconomic conditions. The permitted sectors for PPP projects prescribed in the PPP Law is much narrower than those expressly permitted under Decree 63. Under the PPP Law, the equity capital contribution of the private investors must be at least 15% of the total investment capital.

The permitted sectors for PPP projects prescribed in the PPP Law is much narrower than those expressly permitted under Decree 63. Under the PPP Law, the equity capital contribution of the private investors must be at least 15% of the total investment capital. Standard Form Contracts (Article 47) – The Government will provide standard form contracts for use for certain types of project agreements in PPPs (being BOT (build-operate-transfer), BTO (build-transfer-operate), BOO (build-own-operate), O&M (operate-maintain), BTL (build-transfer-lease) and BLT (build-lease-transfer). Importantly, in line with international practice, the PPP Law no longer recognises the BT (build-transfer) model as a form of PPP investment. Although it is unclear as to how detailed these contracts will be and the extent to which commercial negotiation will be permitted by the Government, these documents will hopefully form a useful baseline and streamline procurement processes, noting that it is overly simplistic to seek a ‘one-size-fits-all' approach to PPP risk allocation.

Bid security (Article 33) – The PPP Law requires investors to lodge bid security (at a rate of between 0.5% and 1.5% of the total project investment value). This bid security is in addition to the general security to secure performance under the PPP documentation (at a rate of 1% and 3% of the project value) and will be forfeited if the investor withdraws from the tender process, violates the bid procedures (where such violation leads to bid cancellation) or if appointed the successful proponent fails to sign the contract documentation within 30 days (other than due to force majeure).

Government performance guarantees – Unlike Decree 63, the PPP Law does not expressly provide that the Government will grant guarantees in respect of the contractual obligations of State-owned enterprises. It remains to be seen whether the Government will, nevertheless, continue to provide such guarantees, consistent with market practice or whether financiers and investors will need to get comfortable in the absence of guarantees applying in respect of State-owned enterprises.

It remains to be seen whether the Government will, nevertheless, continue to provide such guarantees, consistent with market practice or whether financiers and investors will need to get comfortable in the absence of guarantees applying in respect of State-owned enterprises. Foreign currency guarantee (Article 81) – Consistent with current practice, the Government provides foreign investors with a guarantee in relation to the availability of foreign currency to fulfil the investors' needs in respect of the project, including capital transactions, loan repayments and transfer of profits. However, unlike previous transactions where the Government would typically guarantee 100% of these foreign currency needs, the PPP Law stipulates that such guarantees will be limited to 30% of project revenue after subtracting project expenses, which reflects the more recent Vietnam market position. The exposure to foreign currency risk could be challenging for international financiers, many of whom do not hold significant reserves of the local currency, and a local capital market that is still too small to finance complex, large-scale energy and infrastructure projects.

Risk-sharing mechanism (Article 82) – The PPP Law provides that where actual project revenue is greater than 125% of the revenue forecasted in the financial model, the State will receive 50% of the revenue in excess of the 125% threshold. Conversely, for BOT, BTO and BOO style contracts, where actual project revenue is less than 75% of the revenue forecasted in the financial model as a result of changes in planning, policies or laws and other measures such as concession extensions or tariff adjustments have not addressed the shortfall, the State will share 50% of the downside below the 75% threshold. Whether this is satisfactory to foreign investors remains to be seen and will need to be evaluated on a project-to-project basis, particularly as in other jurisdictions, more comprehensive downside protection is offered where revenue is adversely impacted by government actions.

Whether this is satisfactory to foreign investors remains to be seen and will need to be evaluated on a project-to-project basis, particularly as in other jurisdictions, more comprehensive downside protection is offered where revenue is adversely impacted by government actions. Governing law (Article 55) – Generally, project documents in previous projects have been governed by the laws of other agreed foreign jurisdictions, particularly English law and Singaporean law, which have an established system of case law and jurisprudence. This is important as PPPs involve complex legal documentation and investors rely on legal systems with substantial case law to provide guidance on the various contractual mechanisms in PPP documentation. The practical effect of the PPP Law is that project documents entered into between a State authority and project parties will be governed by the laws of Vietnam. This is potentially a significant change as concepts, which are well established in other common-law jurisdictions such as liquidated damages and consequential loss exclusion may be more difficult to establish under Vietnamese law. There could also be a mismatch between project documents and financing documents, if a foreign law governs the latter.

Local content (Article 28) – Under the PPP Law, investors committing to use domestic contractors, goods and materials are eligible for preferential treatment during the bid evaluation process. This is a step further than Decree 63, which is silent on the matter, but does not go as far as mandating local content.

Current pipeline

According to some reports, there are approximately 100 major infrastructure projects with an estimated value of approximately US$21 billion in planning that are earmarked for delivery via the PPP model in Vietnam. Over half of these projects are in the roads and bridges sector.

The flagship road project, which the Government is currently procuring, is the 2100km North-South Expressway running the entire length of Vietnam from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City.

In May 2020, the Government considered converting a major phase of this project, the 654km Eastern section (costing approximately US$5 billion), which was originally offered as eight PPPs to investors in 2019, into a public investment given difficulties in raising debt from local commercial banks. However, the Government eventually retained five of the roads as PPPs and started calling for bids in July 2020 in respect of the following sub-projects:

A road connecting National Highway 45 with Nghi Son in Nghe An province;

The Dien Chau-Bai Vot expressway;

The Cam Lam-Vinh Hao road, linking Khanh Hoa province with Binh Thuan province;

The Nha Trang-Cam Lam road in Khanh Hoa province; and

The Nghi Son-Dien Chau road, connecting Khanh Hoa province with Nghe An province.

Prequalification was in September 2020. The winning bidders are expected to be announced soon.

Opportunities / Conclusion

With attractive underlying fundamentals, including strong economic growth, political stability and an expanding middle class, the infrastructure sector in Vietnam undoubtedly represents a significant opportunity for foreign investors, contractors and financiers. Indeed, according to some reports, Vietnam requires more than US$600 billion to reach its infrastructure goals by 2040. With its emergence as a low cost manufacturing hub, it is expected that Vietnam will need to continue to invest in infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector, to facilitate and sustain this continued growth in its economic activity.

PPPs offer an ideal framework for utilising private sector finance whilst also deriving the benefit of domestic and foreign expertise, know-how and innovation, both technically and technologically, and will no doubt be utilised more frequently by the Vietnamese Government going forward so as to free up an already stretched state budget and allow the roll out of many more projects.

What remains to be seen is whether infrastructure procurement under the PPP Law will offer adequate protection and an appropriate risk profile to encourage foreign participation and investment, particularly for projects that involve market risk, which is invariably difficult to predict in emerging economies particularly in respect of major road projects, which are outside of densely populated cities. Part of this will be dictated by the implementing regulations and standardised contracts, which will be released by the Government under the PPP Law in due course. As always, it will be important for infrastructure investors, contractors and financiers to be supported by competent legal advisors who are familiar with this challenging legal landscape and the relevant State authorities in Vietnam.

The online show boasted the group’s largest crowd ever with more than 1,600 registrants. And that first was in line with other milestones, which participants celebrated in a 3-day series of video meetings, lectures, workshops, award ceremonies, and even a dance party.

Under the outgoing two-year president Kimberly Dowdell, the group doubled its membership, created the NOMA Foundation Fellowship, added key new corporate members such SOM, Kohler and General Motors, and launched its own directory of professionals.

“I focused my presidency on openness through the #ALLinforNOMA campaign to gather a broader spectrum of members so that together we could talk about how to ensure no group will ever feel left out again,” said Dowdell.

Partnering with the 111-year-old civil rights organization, the NAACP, to recognize justice, equity and inclusion in architecture was another win for the organization.

The 2020 SEED/JEDI awards were created to highlight built and conceptual projects in architecture, community design, and economic development, which exemplify justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. (Dowdell is a cofounder of the Social, Economic, and Environmental Design (SEED) Network, established in 2005.)

SEED/JEDI winners:

Other highlights included the announcement of the Phil Freelon Professional Design Award winners:

Vision Category – Honor Award: Perkins & Will, Yanel de Angel, NOMA, FAIA, Principal, Resilient Planning at Multiple Scales, Autonomous Municipality of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Focused on climate change impacts, the plan focuses on a two-phased approach: 1) Restore the ecology and 2) Develop a social and civic infrastructure.

Built Category – Honor Award: Moody Nolan, Inc., Curtis J. Moody, FAIA, NOMA, NCARB, LEED AP, Architect of Record / Design Architect, Columbus Metropolitan Library – Martin Luther King Branch, Columbus, Ohio

Unbuilt Category – Honor Award: AECOM Detroit, Pierre Roberson, NOMA, AIA, Principle Design Architect, YMCA Flint, Flint, Michigan

Small Projects Category – Honor Award: SmithGroup, Dayton Schroeter, Principal Design Architect, Society’s Cage, Washington, D.C.

The conference also featured a formal welcome for the incoming president Jason Pugh. Dowdell inducted Pugh as the 2021-2022 president by “passing the staff,” a tradition from NOMA’s founding in 1971. A licensed architect and certified planner, Pugh is an associate architect and urban designer for Gensler’s Chicago office. Pugh has a passion for helping develop underserved communities and the next generation of designers and architects. He previously served as the president of the Illinois NOMA chapter 2015-2016, and also served on Chicago’s Associate Board of the ACE (Architecture, Construction, and Engineering) Mentor Program. Pugh has a B.A. from Howard University, one of seven Historically Black Colleges and Universities with an architecture accreditation, and a Master of Science in Architecture and Urban Design from Columbia University.

“I’m honored to lead NOMA into our 50th year and start the next half-century of programming and progress,” said Pugh, NOMA incoming president. “One of the main goals for the next two years is to build upon the great work and progress President Dowdell and membership have accomplished during her tremendously impactful administration. We want to find ways to bolster the programs and initiatives launched by both the National Executive board and our local NOMA chapters to date, and ensure it dovetails with our expanded platform to Educate, Elevate, and Empower our membership base and chapters across the country.”

While Dowdell’s #ALLinforNOMA platform of inclusion is opening new doors, the organization’s history remains a galvanizing force: “There is still a focus on the issues facing Black architects because that is where we still see the greatest disparities. I hope that those who have joined us feel more clarity and commitment to the future of diversity, equity and inclusion in architecture.

By Stephen Wright, AIA, LEED AP and Dan Elkins, AIA

Companies and their people want to be back at work. To bring them back on-site, feeling safe in the space is just the beginning; employees are now used to working remotely, so an office building needs to draw tenants in with amenities and features that can’t be replicated at home. A strong ongoing partnership between a building owner and their architect can help create a socially activated yet socially distant environment that offers a true separation between work and home life. While tenant spaces are key, shared spaces in the building matter, too.

Partnering with an owner’s architect that takes a holistic approach to updating all aspects of a building can allow landlords and building owners to steward their buildings more effectively, use design to create real value and ensure that employees will want to come back when they can.

In the most iconic buildings, owners typically work with their architects to make minor refreshes on a regular basis to shared and public spaces, keeping the building appealing to potential new tenants in between major redevelopments — and when companies are looking for new leases following the pandemic. As tenants contemplate a return of their workforce, now is a time when partnering with an architect for ongoing services could help support that return to work as needs arise — indirectly supporting tenant retention and attraction goals.

For many buildings with challenging leasing scenarios, it’s tempting to think that a major renovation may be needed. In some cases, it is. But in others, everyday design solutions can make all the difference in the leasing process. A thoughtful partnership between a landlord and their architect can address these needs and deliver a productive environment for occupants, a pleasant experience for visitors, and a profitable tenant mix for the owners. And when business owners are weighing how and when to bring back their workers, knowing the building will be safe and refreshed can take some weight off their shoulders.

Provide an exceptional experience: Keep building interiors fresh throughout the building life cycle

The owner-architect partnership can improve new leasing outcomes as well as keep existing tenants happy, retaining their revenue for the building. There is a continual long list of design needs that crop up throughout the life cycle of the building: spaces that need to be leased, common elements that need to be refreshed, or spec suites that need better curb appeal. While a landlord could hire different architects for each need, there’s a lot of ramp-up time involved for each project, cutting into time better spent improving the building.

Consider the services that can be provided more effectively with a holistic design approach, particularly from an architect with experience working in your building:

Supporting leasing updates. Leasing requests for floorplans and test fits are time-sensitive, often including urgent requests for customized marketing-ready plans. Speed matters when potential tenants are interested in the space, so rapid response from an owner’s architect is critical when potential rent-paying prospects are waiting to be delighted by your building. Curating spec suites to delight a particular set of prospective tenants. Some spec suites are less “destination” and more “Dilbert.” Spec suites should match the standards of the building and continue the experience from the high-quality lobby and common areas. Updating spec suites can improve the broker tour experience and help attract top tenants. Updating non-glamorous common spaces. In between repositioning projects, some landlords choose to focus the budget on spaces that provide a wow factor for future tenants: the lobby, tenant lounge, game room, fitness center or cafeteria. But in that process, some of the less glamorous common elements go untouched, like restrooms and corridors. A strong partnership on an ongoing basis can allow these “forgotten elements” to be refreshed over time as budgets allow. Creating value by making previously unrentable space available for leasing. Sometimes an architect who knows a building well can help a landlord actually expand the rentable square feet of the property through creative design solutions. For example, at 231 S. LaSalle, our team transformed an entire floor previously used to store outdated mechanical equipment into a light-filled space, now fully leased. Continuing the building’s narrative with each tenant’s space. Tenants will likely want to make changes that require a careful review of the building’s floor plans and systems or call for new amenities that were not in the original repositioning budget. A strong partnership with an architect who knows the building inside and out can go a long way to avoiding mishaps — and maintaining the integrity of the overall space.

Curating long-lasting, attractive office buildings

Ultimately, it takes consistent ownership vision to continually cultivate a destination-worthy tenant experience throughout the entire life cycle of a building — especially now, when a positive building experience could make all the difference in enticing new and existing tenants back to the office.

From financial to operational, businesses throughout the United States have had to tighten their belts and look for ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs, earn more sales, keep customers and make every dollar count.



Infinit Accounting ( https://infinitaccounting.com ) knows firsthand the type of impact that the right strategic accounting partner can have on a business, having a long-standing track record of helping it's clients grow, prosper and succeed, no matter what direction the market moves.

This fall, the company highlights the importance of outsourcing accounting as a strategic measure aimed at improving overall operational performance in today's turbulent markets.

Putting Money to Work

More than ever before, organizations are feeling the pinch. As of August 31st, 2020, more than 163,000 US-based businesses had closed up shop, with CNN reporting that over half of these shutting their doors for good.

According to leadership at Infinit Accounting, planning for unknown risks and market downswings represents a key opportunity for accounting firms to help their clients succeed. As a strategic financial partner, Infinit takes a 'hands-on' approach to client success, helping its clients plan for and financially navigate the ups as well as the downs.

Part of this strategy involves risk management, cash flow optimization, precise accounting, reliable bookkeeping, accurate financial projections and capital management. According to Infinit Accounting, many businesses can do a lot more to make its money work for them in a way that provides more value and is in alignment with short, mid and long-term goals.

Leveraging Outsourced Accounting to Power Growth Initiatives

Growth is a common goal of most businesses, yet a major challenge to those businesses without a tight grasp on its numbers. It is here where the financial expertise of a CFO can make a real and impactful difference. Yet, according to Infinit Accounting, many companies lack a dedicated internal finance department and expertise to optimize the financial facets of its business. Outsourced accounting services can help bridge this gap, empowering companies with the financial data, forecasts, and advice needed to make decisions based on accurate data.

Customized Strategy and a Client-centric Approach to Accounting

Creating Opportunity, Minimizing Risk, and Reducing Costs

Infinit Accounting explains that every service they offer is customized to meet the unique and diverse needs of its clients. The company explains that although 'cookie-cutter' packages and productized services are rampant in the industry, these types of offers are often a disservice to the client. By working closely with clients to formulate tailored strategies, their team can better understand which types of solutions and approaches will provide the most value to the client and that will by synergistically in alignment with their goals.

254,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19474/keep-your-partnerships-positive-by-understanding-how-to-manage-third-party-risk,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Finextra,Keep your partnerships positive by understanding how to manage third-party risk,"The payment industry has a long tradition of outsourcing, partnering, and collaborating across a wide set of organisations. Many parties are involved each time a customer buys something with a plastic card, pays a bill or sends funds overseas. The wider business world is waking up to the concept of the extended enterprise. This is when several organisations work together to achieve something that none of them could have realised alone.

Collaboration is one of the strengths of the payment industry. Third party collaboration can be massively beneficial to all parties involved but it may also bring with it a greater sense of security risk. After all, a partnership is only as strong as its weakest link, so if one partner has a weaker security set-up than the others it can be a danger to all parties.

Unlike a traditional supply chain, where value – and risk – travels up and down a set of organisations in a linear fashion, the extended enterprise is a complex network of relationships. Risks arise from the underlying outsourced activity, but also from involvement with third parties. Being interconnected, all organisations are affected by the culture and practices of others in their network.

Indeed, in one high-profile case, attackers breached the security of a large US retailer via their air-conditioning vendor and stole the data of millions of credit and debit cards. This type of risk is hard to monitor for, short of completely self-isolating your business from others, which is very difficult, however this risk can be managed.

Effective risk management within an extended enterprise is no longer merely understanding your organisation’s supply chain in a linear fashion and managing it as such. It’s about understanding the network of different relationships your organisation may be part of, and how you manage the risks that arise together.

PCI SSC issue guidance

Back in August 2014, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) released Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance to help organisations and their business partners reduce risk by better understanding their roles in securing card data.

The PCI SSC defines a ‘third-party service provider’ as an entity that is not a payment brand (i.e. card scheme) directly involved in the processing, storage or transmission of cardholder data on behalf of another entity.

Various businesses could fall into this category, depending on the services they provide. For example, those securing cardholder data, installing or otherwise supporting point of sale equipment, protecting the cardholder data environment (e.g. at a data centre), or those who may have incidental access to cardholder data or the data environment, such as providers of managed IT services.

The PCI SSC makes clear that the use of third-party service providers does not relieve an organisation of ultimate responsibility for its data security compliance. Nor does it exempt them from accountability and the obligation for ensuring that its cardholder data and cardholder data environment are secure.

So, while an organisation may outsource a function, it cannot outsource the responsibility or liability for PCI compliance.

Four steps for managing third-party risk

The PCI SSC’s Information Supplement: Third-Party Security Assurance has set out a four step guide to help businesses trying to manage their third-party service providers. The guide has been designed to be used throughout the lifecycle of the relationship and its steps are as follows:

1. Due diligence

This includes determining the scope of the services provided and conducting due diligence on the prospective partner. This involves investigating the financial stability of the partner, its reputation, experience in providing the proposed services and so on, as with any tender.

Organisations should also conduct a risk assessment to understand the level of risk associated with engaging the partner and inform the mitigating controls. Areas to assess include security governance, physical security, access authorisation, incident response, malware, segregation and security controls.

2. Engagement

Setting expectations, being clear on roles and responsibilities and effective communication are critical as a basis for good risk management throughout the engagement. Organisations may also have to request evidence and obtain information about PCI DSS compliance from their third parties at this stage.

3. Written agreements, policies and procedures

Document agreements with third parties in writing. This seems obvious but organisations have encountered difficulties when third parties have outsourced services they have agreed to provide. The risks of these nested or downstream relationships can be hard to control, especially if your organisation is unaware of them.

Evaluate all national, state and industry-specific requirements that may apply. Include specific provisions around breach notification, termination of contract, post-termination considerations and what happens if the third party loses their PCI DSS compliance status.

4. Maintaining relationships and monitoring

Third party relationships are potentially significant, so dedicate sufficient resource across your organisation to managing them. This will involve almost every function of your organisation, such as colleagues in the legal, finance and IT departments, as well as those in front-line risk management and procurement.

Establish and maintain a monitoring programme for third-party compliance with PCI DSS. Undertake regular reviews with third parties. Share business plans and changes in strategic direction and encourage them to do likewise.

By understanding and following these four steps, third-party risk should be better managed, reducing the chances of a malicious cyber-attack succeeding. Collaboration is so vital to any industry and mitigating any risks brought about because of it should always be one of the top priorities of a company. That way, it ensures that everyone will have a safe and beneficial partnership the helps every company involved meet their goals, without fear of security risks.","card scheme) directly involved in the processing, storage or transmission of cardholder data on behalf of another entity.

A few days ago, the US Ambassador in Kingston, Donald Tapia, gave an exclusive interview to the Jamaica Observer. In it he said that the country has to make a decision as to whether it is going to look East to the “two headed dragon” or North to the United States when it comes to deciding where its economic priorities lie.

His words, spoken in the context of the country’s future 5G telecommunications needs, were a sharp reminder of how US thinking about the region seeks to link the ideological with the economic and commercial.

Reiterating his Government’s position that it will reassess how it interconnects and shares information with countries that ‘compromise’ their 5G security, Mr Tapia was quoted as saying: “As for consequences, it’s gonna affect banking, any financial transaction from this island”, while adding “that your financial institutions and the finance of Jamaica stops… that’s the consequence that you are looking at long term. That’s major.” The Ambassador also told the publication that in the event of any type of natural disaster “we cannot and will not move into a communist Chinese network because it gives them the opportunity to download all the data that we have”

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese Embassy in Kingston responded, describing in a statement the Ambassador’s comments as “interfering in other countries’ domestic and foreign policies and forcing small and medium-sized countries to choose sides”.

Setting aside the obvious thought that Jamaica should be left to determine which 5G system might provide the best technical and developmental outcome, Mr Tapia’s apparently transactional intervention is unlikely to go unnoticed elsewhere in the region. His thinking could equally be applied to every Caribbean nation exploring future telecommunications options.

His remarks contrast unfavourably with the more nuanced language deployed at a media briefing prior to the US Secretary of States’ visit to Guyana when US officials advised non-attributably that Washington was not saying “do not deal with China” but “make them deal on transparent, 21st century, above-board terms”.

Anyone who has ever worked in or with the Caribbean ought to understand that instructing rather than awaiting a considered sovereign outcome is likely to generate resentments located in a much darker past.

If the US believes that private sector investment in infrastructure and trade can deliver renewed economic growth, greater stability, and by extension enhance its security, it needs to be seen to do so in the spirit of partnership rather than for ideological reasons or as an economic bulwark against China.

As Margaret Myers, the Director of the Asia and Latin America Programme at the Washington based Inter-American Dialogue recently pointed out, threats from the administration and members of Congress to withdraw security and development assistance will result in a few short-term ‘wins’ but reinforce the view of a hegemonic United States. The US, she wrote recently, should talk more about what it can do with the region rather than what China should not. Reducing dependence on China, she believes, will require extensive investment in the region, along with a commitment on the part of the US to building and nurturing productive partnerships.

Currently, however, the impression created by the Trump Administration is that by securing the economic stability of near neighbors they can become a part of an ‘Americas First’ strategy that will strengthen both the US and the hemispheric economy by encouraging US corporations to play a central role replacing China as a development partner.

To this end, and following Mr Pompeo’s recent visits to Suriname and Guyana, the Chief Executive Officer and a delegation from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has travelled to Suriname, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti and Guyana to meet with government and private sector; the new President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Mauricio Claver-Carone has said that his candidacy was a signal of a stronger commitment from the US to support the region and its institutions; the preferential trade arrangement, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) has been renewed by Congress; Jamaica and Guyana are participating in the ‘Growth in the Americas’ initiative; and Washington has increased its security cooperation and military presence in the region.

In this context, a recently published commentary by Vicki Assevero, a senior Caribbean fellow at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington, adds a footnote. She observes that a July 7 Memorandum sent by the White House to Secretary Pompeo requires that he “certify to the appropriate congressional committees that the provision of support under title II of the [BUILD] Act in a less developed country with an upper-middle-income economy furthers the national economic or foreign policy interests of the United States”.

Ms Assevero makes the interesting suggestion that this White House exception for upper middle-income economies ‘may be a harbinger of a more profound understanding of the Caribbean’s challenges’, observing that if the US were ‘to lead the Atlantic community in a new pragmatic classification of the region’ such leadership would not only reap significant good will, but also help accomplish US goals.

If this is correct, the US may be moving to address the biggest development headache the region has. That is the much complained about graduation of the region as upper middle-income countries – Haiti is the only exception – out of eligibility for concessional development assistance, despite its vulnerability to everything from climate change to the economic impact of the pandemic.

If pursued multilaterally and without political conditionalities, it could break the cycle of Caribbean underdevelopment, opening the way for an economic and Caribbean social renaissance in the complex post COVID world.

As this is being written President Xi is enunciating at his Party’s Fifth Plenum, China’s long-term national policy objectives and international approach and in a few days’ time the US will go to the polls. Irrespective of the outcome, concern about China’s role in the Americas and its growing global reach will remain on Washington’s agenda and for its part China will continue to seek a role as a major development partner.","His thinking could equally be applied to every Caribbean nation exploring future telecommunications options.

Growing up, neither Olympic skier Bode Miller nor tennis star Monica Seles attended what most Americans think of as a traditional 8am-3pm school experience. Although having very different backgrounds, both shared commonalities in the types of physical, mental and emotional stresses put on young people training to be elite athletes. And yet, both not only met, but exceeded the unique demands placed on them because their childhood education consisted of blending schooling with lots of outdoor physical activity as well as special attention paid to mental health, resilience and civic engagement.

2020 has pushed many parents to the breaking point trying to provide for their families while also having to run virtual school. Covid-related home schooling often consists of nothing more than children staring at screens for stretches of time, disengaged. In fact, a recent study found that despite no changes in cost per student, two-thirds of school districts did not expect teachers to track student engagement or monitor academic progress. As a result, millions of children are faced with increased anxiety, and struggling with behavioral and mental health needs that are going unchecked.

But the choice between mental health and physical health during the Covid-19 pandemic is likely a false dichotomy.

There are education models that exist bringing the two together by providing online education and in-person engagement. Further, intentional focus can be put towards learning emotional wellbeing, resiliency and community involvement through curriculums that are personalized to small learning groups.

This is exactly what Bode Miller, Monica Seles and others have been doing in partnership with Kirk Spahn, founder of ICL Academy, an online middle and high school for grades 7-12 that partners with industry experts to serve as master teachers. ICL Academy has created blended education programs tailored to kids on non-traditional paths – small groups ranging from elite student athletes to aspiring artists to a technology and entrepreneurship academy.

As Bode explains his perspective, “Change happens in kids when they apply themselves and they’re passionate about what they’re doing. Personalized learning leads to independence, which leads to self-motivation and self-sufficiency.”

In 2015 Kirk and his father, Chancellor Stephen Spahn of the Dwight School (a private pre-K-12 school in New York City) co-founded the Dwight Global Online School. Before that, in 2001, Kirk co-founded the Institute for Civic Leadership (ICL), an educational nonprofit organization. Major partners and champions of ICL have included Novak Djokovic, Tim Draper, Michael Strahan, Alicia Keys and Malcolm Gladwell. And thus, ICL Academy was born out of a partnership between Dwight and ICL, marrying the academic rigor of the Dwight Schools with the focus on civic engagement and leadership of ICL. Each program designed thematically to provide students with that personalization Bode talks about using an online learning experience, tailored to allow students to pursue passions and refine skills beyond the classroom.

With more than 20 years of experience in education and youth engagement, Kirk Spahn has watched the 2020 school year play out all over the country and directly states that it’s “not sustainable, and it’s not helping students reach their potential.” But the goals of ICL Academy go beyond current challenges and demand. “The future is blended and will require an abundance of skillsets, and for Americans to be competitive in the global economy our children need to be learning for the future,” he adds.

Although many parents didn’t consider hybrid or online learning models in the past, the failures of our current traditional system are compounding every day, and demand for educational opportunities that help students build social-emotional skills is growing. For their part to meet demand ICL Academy now offers 30 courses and is using rolling admissions to accept new students in grades 7-12 for their “microschools.” The backbone of which focuses on providing the infrastructure for kids to be active and engaged, mentally and physically, while working in college-style lessons and on project-based assignments.

For someone like Bode Miller, the concept of practicing hours a day, doing lessons with a small group of peers, while simultaneously learning how to build a house or care for animals is nothing new. But for most Americans the ease of following a traditional model meant leaving education to teachers in large classrooms. 2020 has made that custom almost impossible for most. And the ICL team believes with student engagement so low, but civic engagement at an all-time high, there is no better time to improve on the system, than now.

The pandemic has highlighted how important an intentional online learning program is to this generation of students, who are technologically adept and global in scope. “Education was already on the precipice of undergoing a massive transformation, and Covid-19 has forced the issue,” says Kirk Spahn. With an emphasis on the behavioral and mental benefits of small classes and personalized education , it does reason that the pandemic is an ideal time to scale flexible courses geared towards children’s passions and learning styles.

At the end of the day, everyone involved agrees that engagement is the key to learning in 2020 - and going forward. By allowing students to learn skills that go beyond the classroom, and purposefully focusing on the overall wellbeing (mental, emotional and physical) of each child, students can face disruptions like Covid-19, without losing their ability to learn and develop.

“The kind of flexibility and personalization that ICL Academy offers is a game changer for someone like me as a student athlete,” said Bode Miller, who recently announced he will even be lending his name to one of ICL’s schools. “I am proud to partner with ICL Academy to help the next generation of leaders pursue their passions and stay engaged with their education.”

Our mission at Yad Ezra’s Giving Gardens is to provide educational opportunities and resources to address hunger in our Jewish community at its roots, with a focus on healthy and sustainable practices. The pandemic has not dried up our resolve. We have capitalized on the nicer weather and have been hosting classes, providing a socially distant way to interact with people safely and provide the community with knowledge. This year, more produce than ever has been brought in from local community gardens. We have been able to extend our reach through partnerships with the Hazon Garden Relief Initiative, as well as with partner gardens like the Bowers School Farm and the Farber Tamarack Farm.

As Giving Gardens flourishes, an increased volume and value of produce goes to Yad Ezra’s clients every year. Every Yad Ezra delivery gets a taste of the Giving Gardens in their package.

The pandemic has tested the reach of communities around the world. In Metro Detroit, we are so fortunate that our community has come together to help our own as well as our neighbors and friends. At Yad Ezra’s Giving Gardens, we are proud to share some of our partnerships which have been developed over the past few years and have quite literally begun to bear fruit.

Judaism emphasizes the importance of community in so many ways. One of the most compelling arguments is the Talmudic passage that defines an appropriate city in which to live. In order for a city to be habitable, it must accommodate the needs of all its members, assuring there is appropriate care for everyone (Sanhedrin 17b).

Our Lady of La Salette Church is our neighbor — the church has been a landmark in Berkley since the 1920s. The land behind the church was not being used; it was a flat, expansive lawn. Giving Gardens has a new productive partnership with the church. They have allowed us to farm their land, which we call the Genesis Garden. The farmed plot has doubled our growing space, adding more than 5,000 square feet of garden space. The Genesis Garden is currently growing beans, peas, zucchini, cucumbers, radish, turnips, lettuce, tomatoes, eggplant, basil and peppers. All these vegetables will be harvested and distributed to our clients. Not only does this allow us to offer more food, it also raises the amount of fresh nutritional choices to food insecure families who often otherwise eat less nutritional foods.

Since the middle of June, Giving Gardens has been participating in a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) partnership. Generously funded by an anonymous donor, the Central Detroit Christian Farm and Fishery and Fisheye Farms have sold Yad Ezra 15 and two full shares, respectively, of their farm harvest. This amount of fresh produce is enough to generously supplement the grocery distribution of approximately 35 people. Additionally, for every two shares Yad Ezra receives, one share is donated to a family in the neighborhood in which the CDC farm is located. Our Giving Gardens team has organized a trial of this 20-week partnership with the 35 Yad Ezra clients who are also members of our Giving Gardens Club. Each client has been receiving a weekly distribution of farm fresh produce to supplement their regular Yad Ezra grocery delivery. The farm produce is delivered to Yad Ezra and Giving Gardens volunteers and staff divide the shares and deliver the produce to our clients/club members.

This is truly an innovative way for Yad Ezra to engage in a community effort that helps the farmers, who cannot otherwise distribute all of their harvest during these times, and gives healthy, fresh food to food-insecure families in our community. We hope that this test program will serve as a model for others. The ripple effect of helping our clients, helping a local business, and helping feed people in other communities is rewarding.

Giving Gardens was started at Yad Ezra with an amalgam of goals that were all rooted in the concept of partnership. We had partnered for years with master gardeners who grew produce on our property, and we have embraced the culture of partnership and teamwork that is an inherent part of the urban farming and community farming culture, as well as celebrating and supporting partnerships of other Jewish and community organizations that work toward sustainability and community education.

We are proud of what Giving Gardens gives our clients and welcome any who are interested to join us — opportunities abound!

The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has emphasised the key role of building effective partnerships with Commonwealth organisations in achieving the organisation’s strategic goals for 2022-2025 during the CPA webinar.

The CPA webinar on ‘The Commonwealth in 2025: Building effective partnerships,’ was attended by more than 40 Commonwealth organisations and partners representing a wide range of disciplines.

The Chairperson of the CPA Executive Committee, Hon. Emilia Monjowa Lifaka MP, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Cameroon, opened the webinar and spoke of the challenging times that all organisations are facing with the external flux and uncertainty of COVID-19.

“The CPA will prioritise its strategic objectives and will continue to work closely with partner organisations in the Commonwealth,” said Hon. Litaka.

The webinar event provided an opportunity for the recently appointed CPA Secretary-General, Stephen Twigg, to meet virtually with representatives of many Commonwealth organisations and external partners.

They discussed the upcoming work of the CPA and in particular, the new CPA Strategic Plan 2022-2025.

Mr. Twigg spoke of his commitment to engage and consult with as many Commonwealth partners as possible during the planning for the new CPA Strategic Plan.

“The CPA recognises the importance of consultation with organisations at local and regional level as well as national and international [events],” said Twigg. He spoke of the challenging global context due to COVID-19 and of the opportunities that new technology can bring.

“Technology has the potential to engage with a much wider audience and can increase the engagement of citizens with their Parliaments and Parliamentarians,” he said.

He spoke of the critical importance for global progress, mentioning the values enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter, the Commonwealth Latimer House Principles, and the CPA’s Benchmarks for Democratic Legislatures. They provide a framework for good governance in the Commonwealth.

“Democracy, the rule of law and human rights are all fundamental principles that we must work towards achieving and the UN Sustainable Development Goals provide us with an ambitious set of targets for the wider Commonwealth family to realise,” concluded Twigg.”

The webinar featured a question and answer session facilitated by the Secretary-General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, Dr Joanna Newman MBE, which fielded questions from different Commonwealth organisations including the Commonwealth Local Government Forum, the Commonwealth Equality Network and the Commonwealth Businesswomen’s Network.

263,https://www.busiweek.com/global-partnerships-for-an-african-recovery/,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Uganda,Global Partnerships for an African Recovery,"Landry Signé and Ameenah Gurib-Fakim,

WASHINGTON, DC/PORT LOUIS – The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected developed and developing countries alike, despite vast disparities in initial response capacities. Global leaders were especially concerned about the disease’s potential implications for Africa, given the continent’s lack of financial and medical resources, weak health-care systems, fragile economies, and vulnerable populations.

But preparation and cooperation among African leaders and African Union agencies, particularly the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have resulted in many successes – including increased testing capacity, resource mobilization, and coordinated policies to prevent and contain the coronavirus’s spread and promote economic recovery.

Despite these successes, Africa is still facing significant challenges. These include a continued rise in COVID-19 cases, a need for greater testing capacity and improved health infrastructure, difficulties acquiring medical and food supplies, weak social-welfare systems that are struggling to support vulnerable populations during the economic crisis, and high government debt coupled with a need for increased spending.

Although African countries are capable of continuing their progress on the long road to recovery, external support would greatly bolster their efforts. Aside from humanitarian principles and solidarity, a strong and rapid African recovery is in the world’s interest. As long as the virus is unchecked in some regions, no part of the world can be safe from it. Moreover, if COVID-19 further weakens fragile African states or causes health or economic disasters on the continent, a migration crisis or increased threats to international security could ensue.

We therefore propose six ways the world can cooperate with Africa to improve the continent’s crisis response, accelerate its economic recovery, and build momentum for its post-pandemic development.

First, external partners can provide sufficient resources and investment to enable effective COVID-19 responses and inclusive post-pandemic economic recoveries. Although multilateral and bilateral partners have already provided some financial support in the form of debt relief, loans, and grants, African governments need much more. Some estimate the continent’s pandemic-response funding gap at about $100 billion annually over the next three years. Given Africa’s health-care and economic vulnerabilities, additional financial support and debt relief are critical.

Second, partners should support and invest in the African Continental Free Trade Area, which is one of Africa’s best economic-recovery plans. The AfCFTA aims to increase intra-African trade significantly, and thus develop regional value chains, local manufacturing, and sourcing of intermediate and final goods. By reducing the continent’s vulnerability to external shocks through decreased dependence on non-African trade, the agreement will foster economic diversification and resilience, thereby promoting Africa’s integration and assisting its recovery. In addition to backing and investing in the AfCFTA, partners can provide expertise regarding trade regulations and manufacturing capacity.

Supporting private-sector growth is a third way to unlock Africa’s economic potential, representing a significant opportunity – in terms of both trade and investment – that will benefit Africa and global businesses. Although both the formal sector and the large informal sector are currently struggling, owing to lockdowns and economic restrictions, private firms will be crucial to Africa’s recovery and future development. External partners can support African businesses through increased investment, including in small and medium-size enterprises that are today trying to stay afloat and pay their employees. International partners can also help to improve the business environment, for example by overseeing a mandatory regulation process.

Next, external partners can support Africa’s efforts to embrace the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and achieve a successful digital transformation. During the pandemic, technology has enabled real-time medical forecasting and modeling, better communication between leaders, and the virtual operation of businesses. But Africa’s technology infrastructure, specifically Internet access, lags severely, and the continent has benefited less from digital technology than the rest of the world. Partners can help accelerate the 4IR in Africa by sharing technological innovations, collaborating in adapting them to African contexts, and providing investments that will unleash young African innovators’ technological potential and enable existing innovations to be scaled up.

Fifth, the world can help to ensure that no African is left behind, including through job creation, skill-building, social protection, and gender equality. Vulnerable groups such as those living in urban slums or rural areas, youth, women, and the poorest families need extra government support, but social-welfare systems are weak, especially in fragile states. External partners should therefore give special consideration to assisting the most-affected countries and communities by channeling resources toward these populations, instead of giving unconditional aid to governments, and by collaborating with African leaders to create innovative policies that benefit these groups.

The final priority is to help Africa address its fragilities and bridge the gaps between policy goals and outcomes, including through evidence-based policy research. Ineffective institutions, corruption, and a lack of accountability can undermine even perfect policies. Partners can monitor projects or provide experts to assist in implementation, and can promote good governance through measures and indicators such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, the Fund for Peace’s Fragile States Index, or the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators. Research institutes and think tanks such as the Brookings Institution are playing an important role in this effort.

Each of these six proposals can help Africa to combat and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but they are also critical for realizing the continent’s potential and accelerating its future development. By collaborating with external partners to secure additional resources, develop new initiatives, and invest in key sectors, African countries can mitigate the virus’s immediate impact and hasten economic recovery while building resilient systems for long-term growth and success.

265,https://thefintechtimes.com/partnerships-in-fintech-in-the-middle-east-and-africa-dikla-wagner-from-israel-and-insurtech/,"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Fintech Times,Partnerships in Fintech in the Middle East and Africa: Dikla Wagner from Israel and Insurtech,"Partnerships and collaborations have been important for highly-skilled and innovative sectors such as fintech and its wider ecosystem to foster solutions in an ever-changing world. The Fintech Times is celebrating October and is speaking with Dikla Wagner from Munich Re about her own company and professional journeys through partnerships. She is based in Israel and discusses specifically on insurtech.

Dikla Wagner is the Head of Tech Scouting for Munich Re in Israel. Munich Re is one of the world’s largest reinsurance companies. It is 140 years old, with a turnover of more than €33 billion from the reinsurance business alone. It was named one of the pillars of the German economy.

Prior to her role at Munich Re, Dikla was a serial entrepreneur and investor, with over 14 years of experience in the Israeli ecosystem. She is a lawyer and economist. Dikla started as a co-founder of two start-ups. After that, she joined a local VC and led investment and analysis.

Along her way, Dikla has supported and mentored over 100 start-ups and entrepreneurs in their journey for success, with a mission to share the nation’s start-up stories and promote Israeli tech. She is a key opinion leader on insurtech (tech for insurance), and a speaker on the topics of outcome innovation, cyber, IoT, and more.

Describe your company journey in Israel

I am on the hunt for new technologies, new business models and revenue streams. As Munich Re’s Head of Tech Scouting in Israel, I am seeking out new technologies that can be put to immediate use by Munich Re, its subsidiaries and its clients – insurance companies.

We are also looking for something else: we are dealing with questions such as how to build new business models and new revenue streams for ourselves and for our clients.

We will look for InsurTech technologies, but also way beyond insurance, at other ecosystems: AI, cyber. Why? Because we can understand complex technologies and this exposes us to wider opportunities. One of our goals is to push the boundaries of insurance and look for innovations that will change the trajectory of the industry for years to come, or expand and have effects beyond insurance. That is a challenging task. To succeed, you need to have a deep understanding of the insurance world and the tech/start-up scene. And so Wagner meets with hundreds of Israeli start-ups and partners each year, checking to see which ones can offer the right product or software for Munich Re and its clients, or with which ones a collaborations will be disruptive. “The goal is to explore beyond the obvious in innovation – to come up with disruptive ideas and concepts that will bring value to us and our clients, and effect real change. Five years ago, we did not imagine the tech shift the industry would go through; now we are living the change. And we want to lead the change. For that, you need to be open to embracing new ideas, collaborations and products.”

Can you give us a glance into the InsurTech ecosystem in Israel?

The InsurTech ecosystem in Israel is growing very fast. We have around 100 companies in this field.

Israel is home to the worlds’ leading InsurTech companies and has seen mega-investment rounds: such as Lemonade, which raised $350 million from SoftBank; Next insurance that raised $250 million led by Munich Re, and recently announced another $250 million round led by CapitalG with participation from Munich Re; and then there was Hippo that raised $150 million. We definitely believe that this list will grow, thanks to the talents and the real hunger that Israeli entrepreneurs have. We also believe that Israeli start-ups will become more sophisticated with their solutions, leveraging tech capabilities and advantages in their business use cases. For many years, the greatest challenge for Israeli start-ups was to scale outside of Israel, but the leader of the market has proven us wrong.

Looking at the start-up maps attached and created by Startup Nation Central, we believe that the section in the map labelled “Technologies for risk reduction” has the greatest potential for growth. We are identifying additional companies in the Israeli market that can develop solutions for risk mitigation and reduction. Those companies are not addressing insurance companies today, but their technology is highly attractive to us. We believe it is a matter of time and adduction for those companies to join the insurance sector and develop offerings for carriers. And that is part of our role here in Israel.

How have partnerships and collaborations played a role in that?

Partnerships and collaborations have absolutely played a major part in opening up innovations to us.

Munich Re is leading and initiating quite a number of innovation projects, mostly because we have a deep understanding of market and client needs. We try to think five years ahead, looking at the horizon and not only at the here and now. We believe in the power of innovation for the short and the long term.

However, we also deeply believe in the power of collaboration:

First of all, with start-ups – since we appreciate the dynamic, fast cutting-edge tech that can build rapidly and aim to change the world.

But also with partnerships with other giants. I always say that in innovation 1+1=3 – the power of combining two different sets of expertise into one partnership outweighs the value of both. We are looking to do that in several strategic fields.

Post-COVID-19, what do you think will be the biggest two trends and how are they relevant to insurance?

We see two big trends:

The speed of digitisation! Everyone understands that they need to ensure business continuity and the digital enablement of their own workforce and products. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that for many, returning to work will be a process that could take a year or more, and that they cannot go back to the way they were. Instead, companies will want to seize the moment to reimagine and reinvent the future, building new muscle and capabilities to come back strong. Even well-run companies may find that they need to reinvent themselves more than once.

For insurance, that means we have to accelerate digital-product building. If we think about buying behaviour, it has changed dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic, i.e. people that had never purchased goods online have now set up Amazon accounts. We therefore need to adjust and accelerate digital-product development and building.

Changes in distribution channels – it is clear that we can no longer rely on one distribution channel. We need to find new/additional disruption channels. This applies to various different players along the supply chain: OEMs, manufacturers and suppliers, and it also applies to insurers.

We need to rethink our distribution strategy. This goes for carriers as well as for brokers.

What advice and recommendations do you want to give future businesses in the region who are looking to grow?

For any insurance company, I would recommend starting this innovation journey today! It does not have to be major projects or budget, we can start with small steps. The first step will be to learn where the biggest pain point is, and to start from there.

For insurance companies that are already innovating, I would strongly recommend to always stay updated on the different technology trends and latest development in the market. Technologies are changing very rapidly: what you know today will change tomorrow. A specific tech can be around for only a very limited time.

When insurance companies ask me where they should start innovating, I have to admit my answer has changed following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 has opened our eyes to what the world is going through. The pandemic has shown the world how vulnerable it is to very large risks, climate change being a major one.

We see the year 2020 as a year to prepare for the future, and Munich Re is very active in this. We are working on learning how we, our clients and the other organisations can become more resilient – how can we prepare for the future, starting today!","The Fintech Times is celebrating October and is speaking with Dikla Wagner from Munich Re about her own company and professional journeys through partnerships.
For many years, the greatest challenge for Israeli start-ups was to scale outside of Israel, but the leader of the market has proven us wrong.
Those companies are not addressing insurance companies today, but their technology is highly attractive to us.

The FinTech Times is celebrating October and speaking with Michael Lahyani from Property Finder.

Michael Lahyani is the founder and CEO of Property Finder Group, the largest and most searched property portal in the Middle East. A pioneer in innovation and technology, Michael was the first to introduce a real estate classified in the Middle East, prior to launching Property Finder in 2007. The company has grown exponentially through the years into an immersive and culturally diverse team and generates over six million monthly website hits across its eight countries of operation.

Describe your company journey

Over a decade and a half ago, in 2005, I had just relocated to Dubai from my hometown Geneva and was of course searching for a new house in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It was then that I identified a gap in the real estate market – everyone in the region, relied solely on manually browsing through newspaper classifieds for property, which needless to say is an exhausting and cumbersome process – that paired with having to physically visit each shortlisted property in the search for your perfect home. Shortly after, I decided to launch Al Bab World, that served as the UAE’s first printed real estate classified, which in 2007 moved entirely online and was rebranded to propertyfinder.ae – a dedicated platform that facilitated a smooth and seamless journey for property holders and seekers. We then started expanding and making our presence across new markets and territories, starting with Qatar in 2012; Bahrain, Egypt and Lebanon in 2013, followed by Morocco and Saudi Arabia in 2014. We acquired Lebanon’s realestate.com.lb, Saudi’s eSimsar.com and Bahrain’s Bahrain Property World as well as 40% stake in Turkish property portal, Zingat to strengthen our operations within these countries.

In 2018, Property Finder secured funding of $120 million by US private equity firm, General Atlantic, to primarily invest in product and technology development. In May 2019, we acquired our UAE competitor, JRD Group, which operates JustProperty.com and CRM technology platform, Propscape.com, thus further expanding our market share.

How have partnerships and collaborations played a role in your professional journey?

Partnerships have a huge role to play, and I would categorise our partners into three key groups: our clients, our brand partners, and the government.

At the very core of our business model, we consider each and every one of our clients to be a partner of the company. At Property Finder, our direct clients are professional and licensed real estate brokers who advertise their property listings on the portal, and we are their partner in ensuring they receive a great and rewarding ROI, in return for their advertising spend. Our clients have supported us for the longest time – some of them have worked with us from the very start, for 15 years and they have consistently increased their spend on the portal, year after year.

The reason we have been able to develop and maintain such strong relations with these professionals is because each one holds the same level of value and importance to us as a partner. We understand their business, we understand their needs, and we build and tailor our services accordingly, to curate a product that caters to their needs. We really consider our clients like our true partners – if they do well, we do well. If they don’t do well, we don’t do well – so yes, I would say that our biggest partnership is our clientele.

Another key factor to take into consideration is brand partnerships – we have done numerous partnerships over the years. Partnerships help you gain credibility and brand awareness. In the early days, we partnered up with Yahoo!, when it was one of the biggest platforms here. Yahoo! acquired Maktoob and we then partnered with them as their official real estate partner, which basically meant that anyone who searched for properties on Yahoo! was directed to Property Finder’s listings. We did this with a few key business players including the likes of Khaleej Times and Arabian Business, where we used our data to power their property sections. These relationships and partnerships were established at a time when we needed some strong brand associations. We also partnered with Google, we invested in this partnership that in turn resulted in generating great ROI for us. We wrote a few White Papers about how we used Google services and guidelines, which helped us streamline our operations and build better UX UI websites.

Property Finder also has partnerships with the government of course, one of the latest ones was a product we launched in partnership with Dubai Land Department, Mo’asher, which is Dubai’s first official sales and rental price index. The launch of Mo’asher has boosted the city’s position in the Global Real Estate Transparency Index. According to JLL’s Global Real Estate Transparency Index 2020, Dubai, which was ranked 36th, further strengthened its position as the Middle East & North Africa (MENA)’s most transparent real estate market, climbing three places up the global ranking. This is a huge achievement for us, having reached this level of association with the government, that our data, coupled with the governments, and our technology is used to develop a tool that is helping the UAE’s real estate market make its mark on a global scale.

I would say every relationship and every discussion, would be the start of a new partnership for the company – whether with clients, other brands, the government, or our investors.

How have partnerships with your consumers and understanding their needs allowed for Property Finder to grow?

Very simply put – if you do not understand your consumers, the people who come to your website, who use your services, you cannot build a product that serves their needs. When people search for real estate, we can broadly categorise them into different personalities, or cohorts. There are those searching for property to rent, those looking for a place to own as their own home, people looking to buy from an investment perspective, and those who are searching for a short-term solution. This is of course a very broad categorisation, each sub-group in turn has several other tiers – individuals starting a family, young professionals, expats have lived in the UAE for several years, those who have just arrived in the country, and many many more. Each one has different needs, which is why understanding the consumer is crucial to build the right product for them. This can be achieved through data, testing and consumer focus groups, which we, at Property Finder use to analyse consumer behaviour and demand, which helps us build products to cater to our customers.

What advice and recommendations do you want to give future businesses in the region looking to grow?

The Middle East is a very small, and I would say close knit region, despite its large population. Here, your reputation will precede you. When dealing with partners, we have found that partnerships hold different value throughout their lifetime. Sometimes, at the beginning they are very valuable and over time, may become less valuable for the company’s goals. You can always end a partnership, but what is extremely important, and I cannot stress this enough, is that you end partnerships on good terms. You must honour your partnership until the very end, and be true and transparent to your partners throughout your relationship with them. Never leave a bitter taste to any of the people or teams you work with because you most certainly will, and I guarantee this, come across these people again in the future. You only have one reputation, and you should cherish that reputation. Always behave professionally, and behave with ethics in all your dealings – this would be the number one advice that I would give entrepreneurs in this region, or anywhere in the world.","The FinTech Times is celebrating October and speaking with Michael Lahyani from Property Finder.

As much as the sport can be an art form, it's also a wonderful storybook, one that has more twists and turns than your average novel.

It is often an unpredictable whirlwind, a form of entertainment that leaves us with anger and questions. Yet, at the same time, it is a joy to watch and provides us with some of the happiest moments we'll enjoy.

When your team scores a last-minute winner, you feel on cloud nine. If they concede in the dying embers, it feels like the world itself is about to crash and burn.

Unless you're a die-hard supporter of sports, you're unlikely to know what it means to be in that situation. Let us tell you for free, it's an absolute rollercoaster.

Football, in its current form, isn't what it traditionally was. We have no fans in the stadiums and the game is being dominated by VAR, predominantly not for the greater good either.

This Saturday, for example, we saw Liverpool have what they thought was a last-gasp winner against fierce rivals Everton ruled out for offside. The technology was to blame with replays showing he was apparently onside.

The Premier League hasn't done a particularly good job when it's come to VAR, so let's cast our minds back to simpler times when technology was merely a pipe dream.

Here at GIVEMESPORT, we decided to compile a list of the strangest and most unlikely player and managerial partnerships we've ever seen.

So without further ado, here we are...

Rafa Benitez and Cristiano Ronaldo

We start with a modern classic. Rafa Benitez went from managing one of the greatest club sides we've ever seen to being mugged off by Mike Ashley at Newcastle. The Spaniard spent a period of the 2015/16 campaign at the Bernabeu and managed the great Ronaldo on 24 occasions. He was superb under Benitez, scoring 25 goals and registering eight assists.

Arsene Wenger and Glenn Hoddle

This is such an unlikely pairing considering where their respective careers have gone. Hoddle went onto manage England and Tottenham but he was previously coached by Arsenal legend Wenger in the late 80s and early 90s at Monaco.

Wenger gave the attacking midfielder enormous freedom in the middle of the park, something he later replicated with players like Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry in north London. Hoddle played 76 times under the Frenchman, finding the back of the net on 27 occasions.

Roy Hodgson and Roberto Carlos

This one really does defy belief. How on earth was Roy Hodgson ever in charge of a talent like Roberto Carlos? We'll tell you how - they were together at Inter Milan. Hodgson took charge of the Italian giants between 1995 and 1997, managing the rampaging Brazilian on 23 occasions. Roberto Carlos, who went onto win the World Cup, contributed to four goals under the current Crystal Palace boss.

Diego Simeone and Alexis Sanchez

This is another cracking partnership, one that's hard to figure out ever happened. Just imagine Sanchez under Simeone now - his bullish attitude would fit right in with that they've built at Atletico Madrid. But where was Alexis coached by the Argentine before? River Plate. Sanchez played 15 times for Simeone in 2008, scoring just the once.

Sam Allardyce and Fernando Hierro

Allardyce and Hierro, you're having a laugh, aren't you? Remarkably this really happened. The Real Madrid legend who scored 124 goals for the Spanish outfit somehow ended up in the north of England at Bolton during the final stages of his career. Hierro went and played under Allardyce throughout the 2004/05 campaign, featuring on 32 occasions. He didn't find his shooting boots, though, scoring one goal.

Sir Alex Ferguson and Gerard Pique

This is another classic. Although it's easier to remember Pique's spell in England, it's quite incredible to think that he did actually feature under Sir Alex at Manchester United. The Spanish defender has become a mainstay of their national team and has won pretty much everything there is to win in football. Pique featured 23 times for Ferguson between 2004 and 2008.

Roberto Mancini and Kieran Trippier

Okay, this one is a little bit cheeky because Trippier didn't actually play under Mancini, but he was rising through the ranks at Manchester City when the Italian was in charge at the Etihad. The England international is now at Atletico Madrid but was picked by Mancini for one of the Citizens' pre-season tours in 2010.

Jose Mourinho and Fabinho

Liverpool's hard-working midfielder had an incredibly short stint at Real Madrid during 2012/13 but only ever managed one appearance for the first-team. He played for their B side on a regular basis but Mourinho only ever called on him to make a 14-minute cameo towards the end of the season. As it happens, Fabinho is now one of the shining lights in Jurgen Klopp's Reds and worth a whopping £54m.

Nigel Pearson and Harry Kane

Harry Kane is one of the finest goalscorers on the planet and it's difficult to picture him in any shirt but a Tottenham or England one. However, before he truly burst onto the scene he played under Chris Hughton at Norwich and then under Nigel Pearson while he was on loan at Leicester. Kane played 15 times for the Foxes, scoring twice.

Sir Bobby Robson and Ronaldo Nazario

Ronaldo Nazario became such a legend at Real Madrid that it sometimes becomes difficult to remember him playing for Barcelona. However, that's exactly what he did in the 1996/97 season where he lit up world football for Bobby Robson's side. The great Brazilian striker found the net on 47 occasions in 49 matches under Robson. He also claimed 12 assists - simply stunning.

Pep Guardiola and Ibrahim Afellay

Yep, Afellay really did play for Barcelona during one of the most iconic periods in their history. The Dutchman eventually ended up at Stoke and Olympiacos. He played under Guardiola an incredible 33 times, scoring twice and assisting a solitary goal. Very strange.

So there have it, 11 of the craziest combinations we've seen in football. From the vintage partnership of Wenger and Hoddle to the new era with Benitez and Ronaldo, we've seen some truly remarkable manager and player link-ups.

Sunday’s rather painful watch may have conjured up familiar themes surrounding Tottenham but it also maintained a very modern trend in the continued brilliance of Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min as a partnership.

Gareth Bale’s arrival to north London has opened up the conversation as to whether or not Spurs will have the best front three in the Premier League once the Welshman is up to speed but there is compelling evidence that they already have the best two.

Against West Ham, before it all went south, Kane set up Son in the first minute with the South Korean returning the favour seven minutes later for the pair’s fifth and seventh goals of the season, respectively.

According to the Press Association, no goalscoring partnership in Premier League history has a better goals per 90 minutes than any other pair in the division’s 28-year history.

Based on statistics that only count goals when both players are on the field at the same time, among partnerships with at least 5,000 minutes together, Kane and Son average 1.34 goals every 90 minutes.

That’s from a total of 122 goals over 8,222 minutes with Kane scoring 78 and Son 44. That puts them top of the pile ahead of Liverpool’s Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah with 1.28 and Thierry Henry and Robert Pires, during their Arsenal pomp on 1.21.

Kane and Son’s growing understanding on the field is also emphasised by the fact they have assisted 28 goals for each other, the highest number of any current Premier League players with Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero in second on 20.

The 43-year-old quarterback announced both partnerships Wednesday morning. The first is a licensing and brand collaboration deal with IMG that will help grow TB12, the lifestyle brand Brady launched with business partner Alex Guerrero. The second will give Fanatics exclusive rights to sell his autographs, collectibles and memorabilia.

“Quite simply, Tom Brady is one of the greatest athletes the sports world has ever seen,” Fanatics Executive Vice President Victor Shaffer said in a statement. “His worldwide popularity has skyrocketed throughout the years, and he has built an incredibly loyal fan base that is now expanding in his latest move to Tampa Bay. We look forward to creating an amazing shopping experience for his fans, including the widest assortment of his officially licensed items ever offered.”

At 43, Brady remains one of the most popular players in the league—the six-time Super Bowl champion is the top selling player for all NFL merchandise since the start of the season, according to Fanatics. The Buccaneers, who made a splash in the offseason by signing Brady and former teammate Rob Gronkowski, are currently 4-2, in first place in the NFC South.

Under the IMG deal, the global sports and talent management company will help Brady and Guerrero, who has studied Chinese medicine, grow TB12’s presence in retail and ecommerce. That includes a focus on the digital and experiential channels that may bring TB12 to more people.

TB12 is currently combining virtual and in-person training at its performance centers in Boston, Foxboro and Tampa. The company aims to help clients prevent injuries, recover from injuries and perform at their peak by focusing on hydration, nutrition, functional strength, conditioning and more. Brady, who has written a book on his training philosophies, has a strict diet of avoiding sugars, some fats and certain vegetables. The quarterback is also unconventional with weight training, preferring resistance bands over weights.

Story continues

“Our mission at TB12 is to empower people to live pain-free and perform their best,” said John Burns, CEO of TB12. “Together with IMG, we will further democratize the principles that Tom and Alex have perfected over the years and share them with new audiences to become the world’s most trusted authority on health and wellness.”

The Fanatics deal will create an expanded collection of Brady memorabilia associated with the Buccaneers, the team Brady joined last offseason after 20 years and six Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots. It will also bolster Fanatics Authentic, the rapidly-growing memorabilia arm of Fanatics. The world’s largest online seller of licensed sports apparel, the company has broadened its reach into memorabilia in recent years. Its exclusive Fanatics Authentic athletes include Zion Williamson, Joe Burrow, and Aaron Judge.

The timing is also perfect for both sides. The pandemic has produced a rush of new interest in sports collectibles, including trading cards and autographs.

Columnist: Nyadroh Setor

Ghana has in recent years made a leapfrog in its educational frontier, access to both primary and second cycle institutions is almost ubiquitous in the country.



While this feat is commendable, the conversation must not end with access. Secondary education has become a key platform for young people to enter the world of work. Arguably, the question of how best to equip our young people with the skills they need to perform or create a dignified work in a dynamic world has never been more important. A recent publication by the Mastercard Foundation reports that of the 98% of young people who enroll at the primary level in Sub-Saharan Africa only 9% make it to tertiary level. Currently, secondary education is inadequate and has proved inefficient in its results. Inadequate, because it fails to provide facilities for that education which is essential.



The over a 100,000 unemployed graduates currently engaged under Nation Builder’s Corps to be retrained is a proof of how the current educational system has been inadequate. I must emphasize that this is not a recrimination but only a discussion about a path forward in improving our educational system.



We need to re-imagine existing structures of our schools to the needs of the diverse cohorts of students and provide flexible pathways into, between and beyond secondary education. Secondary education must aside producing a literate population have key structures for tackling the environmental causes of low productivity and producing the knowledge needed to harness Ghana’s economic potential.



Government has sought to keep young people in school through the School Feeding Program but then we need to do more to ensure that they are not just coming to school to eat but we are also enhancing their experience and broadening their horizon. The biblical narration by John the Apostle explains this phenomenon where after Jesus fed the multitude and they saw that neither He nor His disciple were no longer there, the multitude sought to look for Him. But Jesus knowing that said “… ye seek Me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled” We must consciously seek to focus our attention now on prioritizing equipping our schools with multi-sports infrastructure (i.e. basketball courts, long tennis courts, football pitches, swimming pools et cetera) instead of investing in building fence walls. An illuminating statistics published by Statista in 2020 revealed that in 2018, the global sports market was valued at approximately 471 billion U.S. dollars. The question now is what are we doing that would churn out the great sports personalities like Lebron James, Roger Federer, Naomi Osaka, Asamoah Gyan, Ferdie Adoboe et cetera.



It is not enough to just seek to produce a literate population but we must also seek to nurture and amplify the skills and talents of our young ones which will not only harness Ghana’s economic potential but also reduce unemployment drastically in the country. Also aside the many benefits of having sports facilities in our schools research has shown that it can be a veritable tool to boosting school enrolment and reducing out of school children.



It is also critical that we integrate traditional education with respect to the traditional setting because it is intertwined with life activities in the community into secondary education. We must begin to form partnerships with community and community craftsmen to provide further outlets for our young children which will give them an opportunity to learn something of engineering (i.e. construction of boat, plumbing, carpentry, welding et cetera), tropical agriculture (i.e. fishing, mushroom and snail farming et cetera) and of tropical medicine and hygiene whiles establishing resource centers that validate the knowledge acquired through these studies.



It is also vital to note that, participation in some of these numerous activities in the community would help participants invariably learn new things.



This is essential to building the resilience and synergy that will create the innovation, and prosperity in the informal sector and in accelerating Ghana’s route for technological and economic growth towards achieving the Sustainable Developmental Goals SDG’s and African Union agenda 2063. Only with a population so educated can we hope to face the tremendous problems and raise the standard of life of every Ghanaian.

The aspects of Climate Change are a pressing environmental concern in cities and is creating an additional stress on urban infrastructure and lifeline services.

In this scenario, adaptation and mitigation to climate risks in cities is an important aspect of the Indian government’s efforts to fulfil its commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In India most of the cities are vulnerable to these climates induced natural hazards.

The next day — Sunday — was the busiest of their working week and they couldn’t risk a hangover.

Jon and Peter are Roman Catholic priests who have been in a celibate relationship for at least two decades.

Today they, like me, are celebrating a landmark in the Church’s history as Pope Francis offers his clearest support to date for gay rights by endorsing same-sex civil partnerships.

‘Homosexual people have the right to be in a family,’ the 83-year-old Pope says in Francesco, a newly released documentary film. ‘They are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable over it.’

Pope Francis has offered his clearest support to date for gay rights by endorsing same-sex civil partnerships

The Pope’s pronouncement goes some way to repairing his reputation as a progressive pontiff. Indeed, for liberal and younger Catholics, any reform has been a long time coming.

But for traditionalists among the estimated 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide, Francis’s words are seismic.

They threaten a schism with the Vatican like no other — and nowhere more so than in Africa, where homosexuality is illegal in many countries.

The continent is home to almost 200 million Catholics and the Church is growing strongly.

Between 1980 and 2012 (the last year for which data is available), the number of Catholics in Africa grew by 283 per cent, compared with just 6 per cent in Europe (with 277 million Catholics and an ageing population).

Bishops in Africa are predominantly social authoritarians who have made plain their feelings on homosexuality.

Take the words of Cardinal Robert Sarah, of Guinea, who in 2015 declared that ‘Western homosexual and abortion ideologies, and Islamic fanaticism’ are to the 21st century what the twin ‘beasts’ of Nazi and communist ideology were to the 20th century.

He is unlikely to agree with Pope Francis’s new stance.

Nor are the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria, who last year decreed that ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) were disordered sexual orientations that could not be accepted as a normal way of life’.

In fact, the Pope’s words have already sparked a bitter row — and not just in Africa.

In the United States, which has about 51 million Catholics, Church leaders have lost no time in making their feelings known.

Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, yesterday said the Pope’s statement ‘clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church about same-sex unions’.

And in South America, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global Catholic population (including Argentinian Pope Francis), homophobia is no less widespread. There, Catholic priests have combined with Evangelical churches to organise anti-gay marches in countries including Colombia and Peru.

In the Philippines, with 75 million Catholics and growing, Bishop Arturo Bastes said yesterday that he had ‘very serious doubts about the moral correctness’ of the Pontiff’s position.

Seasoned Vatican observers are already asking whether a fragmented Church globally will be Pope Francis’s legacy, although his supporters argue that this was a carefully considered intervention.

Even on his own doorstep, he faces a battle with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.

Even on his own doorstep, he faces a battle with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. (The pair pictured together in 2013)

Catholicism and homosexuality have long had a troubled relationship. In 1986, when the Church was under the stewardship of the popular but deeply conservative Polish John Paul II, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith described homosexuality as ‘a strong tendency ordered towards an intrinsic moral evil... marriage is holy while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law’.

For traditionalists, little has changed since that hardline edict.

In 2003, the Congregation updated its teaching on whether there should be legal recognition for gay people, saying same-sex marriage was ‘deviant’.

The document added: ‘Respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.’

As for gay men and women adopting children, the document described this simply as ‘violence’ against children.

Those harsh words were drafted by German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger — who, two years later, became Pope Benedict XVI.

After resigning in 2013, Benedict indicated that he would live in quiet seclusion in the Vatican as the Pope Emeritus. But he soon emerged as a backseat driver and arch-critic of his successor’s attempts to modernise.

In a biography published this year, 93-year-old Benedict accused opponents of wanting to silence him, while associating gay marriage with the Antichrist. Now, by speaking out in favour of civil partnerships, Pope Francis is directly challenging his predecessor.

In the past, he has tried to make his sympathies clear but in a less high-profile fashion. A decade ago, as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, he opposed same-sex unions in Argentina — but five years ago, when asked about gay priests, he responded: ‘Who am I to judge?’

He continued: ‘A person once asked me... if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: “Tell me, when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?”.’

There was more of the same in the final draft of the 2014 Synod on the Family in the Vatican, which contained, at the Pope’s instigation, a reference to the ‘gifts and qualities’ of homosexuals.

Predictably, traditionalists launched a fightback against what they called the Lavender Mafia in the Vatican, shamefully using the revelations about paedophile Catholic priests to conflate child sex abuse with homosexuality.

The sin of ‘homosexuality itself’, not paedophilia, they argued, lay at the ‘root of the scandal’.

In August 2018, American Cardinal Raymond Burke declared: ‘There is a homosexual culture, not only among the clergy but even within the hierarchy, which needs to be purified at the root.’

The new papal view seems certain to stretch Burke’s loyalty to breaking point.

Some Vatican critics are cynical about the timing of the new documentary, seeing it as a ploy to divert attention from a growing financial scandal in the Holy See.

Last month, the Pope effectively fired Cardinal Giovanni Becciu, the powerful head of the office that oversees the canonisation of saints. He has been accused of embezzlement of Vatican funds, which he denies. Last week, a 39-year-old Italian woman linked to the Cardinal was also arrested.

Francis, his critics say, is a shrewd political operator who knows a controversy over civil partnerships will overshadow the stench of financial corruption at its heart.

The real test for gay Catholics such as me will be if Pope Francis one day permits civil partnerships to be blessed in church. That might drive traditionalists from the faith — but we can do without their hatred for ‘deviants’ who simply wish to have our loving relationships recognised by the Church to which we belong.","Today they, like me, are celebrating a landmark in the Church’s history as Pope Francis offers his clearest support to date for gay rights by endorsing same-sex civil partnerships.

The University of Law (ULaw) has cut deals with four universities to prepare students to sit the new solicitor super-exam.

ULaw will guarantee places on its upcoming Solicitors Qualifying Exam (SQE) prep course to graduates at the universities of Southampton, Surrey, Leicester and Birkbeck, it was announced this week. ULaw will also continue its existing partnership with Chester University to support students through the SQE, a two-part national assessment due to come into force from September next year.

During their undergraduate studies, ULaw will support students with a range of workshops, including how to answer multiple-choice-questions (MCQs), the proposed format of SQE1, as well as looking at the skills needed to pass SQE2.

ULaw revealed the first details of its SQE courses, which includes a masters option, earlier this year. Students will get to pick their ULaw SQE course of choice upon graduation, the statement says. ULaw will also guarantee places for students at the four universities who choose to qualify under the current system, the Legal Practice Course.

The law school giant’s new university tie-ups follow similar combinations struck up with the universities of Exeter, Reading, Liverpool, East Anglia and, most recently, Sheffield.

Peter Crisp, pro vice chancellor external at ULaw, said:

“We are delighted to be entering into these new partnerships. We look forward to guiding future generations of students through the forthcoming changes to qualifying as a solicitor and supporting them to achieve their career goals.”

It was announced last week that new SQE provider BARBRI had joined forces with Manchester University and King’s College London to offer graduates discounted SQE1 course fees and on-campus SQE workshops.

Market rival BPP University Law School is expected to follow with its own SQE course update in the coming months.","Students to receive super-exam study supportThe University of Law (ULaw) has cut deals with four universities to prepare students to sit the new solicitor super-exam.

(Bloomberg) -- Robert Fritzshall had to be pushing 80, Bethany McLean thought, so she was a little surprised to hear him talk about expanding his law practice.His office was a bit dusty and cluttered with papers. There were files on the floor. She was concerned that he didn’t see the need to carry malpractice insurance. But she doesn’t remember anything being a red flag.“He was charismatic, enthusiastic,” she said. “A little eccentric.”Besides, she needed the job.The global financial crisis hadn’t eased up. Despite graduating near the top of her class and serving on the law review, she’d been biding her time at a Chicago-area WhirlyBall, booking children’s birthday parties.And he needed some help. Fritzshall & Associates comprised only Fritzshall, a legal intern, and his legal secretary, after the previous associate departed suddenly.McLean was thrilled when he extended her an offer, even if it was part time. When he agreed to get malpractice insurance, she accepted.It looked like her break.But within weeks, McLean would realize that Fritzshall was no longer capable of managing his practice. His cases were in disarray. Expanding was a fantasy. She recognized the signs of dementia from her grandmother’s decline.The experience would be the most harrowing and painful of her career. But it’s one that’s becoming a growing challenge confronting a profession in which many are working into their 70s and 80s.Over the last ten years, the number of lawyers practicing over the age of 65 has increased more than 50%. In 2020, roughly 14% of American lawyers were over 65, compared to 7% of workers generally. Meanwhile, more than one in nine people over 65 are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, the most common type of dementia. The risk increases dramatically with age.Recent, comprehensive data on how often disciplinary bodies and lawyer assistance programs confront the issue is non-existent, and there’s no way of knowing how often colleagues intervene without assistance from a professional organization.But Diana Uchiyama, executive director of the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program, says she’s seen a significant increase in outreach related to cognitive decline in the last year. She’s had at least two such calls in recent months as lawyers emerge from a year of pandemic-induced isolation.Lawyers who are relatively high functioning in early stages of dementia are often in denial about the need to step down, said Alex Yufik, a forensic psychologist who has worked on such cases. They’re adept at hiding it, tapping their intellectual reservoirs to redirect conversations when they’re confused or unable to answer questions, he said.Lawyers and other professionals often develop “routines, practices, conversational and social skills over many years, which are reinforced and rehearsed over a career to the point where they can function almost automatically,” said Kendra Basner, a partner at O’Rielly & Roche LLP who counsels clients on legal ethics.Colleagues are generally ill-equipped to distinguish between signs of of normal aging and something more. And the decision to intervene can be a heartbreaking and even risky one, especially if the aging lawyer is a friend, mentor, boss, or someone powerful in the profession.Getting involved in a case of substance abuse or mental health problems can mean saving someone’s career. In the case of progressive dementia, intervening almost always means ending one.“Even when the issue is right in front of their faces, many find excuses to avoid having the uncomfortable conversations and making the hard decisions,” Basner said.Tish Vincent, chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, said it’s partly a cultural issue of lawyers tending to think they’re invincible.Lawyers “need to stop encouraging denial,” said Vincent, who is both an attorney and a clinical social worker.Spotting the IssueFrederick Emery Jr., an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Maine, was within a year of retirement when his colleagues started to notice something wrong.When they elevated their concerns to agency officials, they were told that “if there were no appreciable performance issues,” they should just “monitor the situation as the AUSA progressed toward retirement,” according to a 2015 ruling by a U.S. district court in Maine.Much of Emery’s case load was transferred to another attorney within a few months. But it was already too late.He had botched an IRS dispute with a bankrupt taxpayer because of dementia, the government said in an appeal asking the district court to set aside Emery’s loss. The underlying case involved more than $500,000 in tax liabilities.The government eventually confirmed that Emery had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, coupled with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Three physicians agreed that the onset was prior to the summary judgment proceedings, the court said.But it still declined to undo the bankruptcy court’s summary judgment order discharging the debt. The government’s argument about Emery’s mental decline came too late. The IRS ultimately abandoned its efforts to challenge the bankruptcy court’s ruling.Emery had been “a responsible and highly respected member of the bar and the bankruptcy court for many years,” the court said.Cognitive ReservesForensic psychologist Yufik handled a case involving an 85-year-old attorney, whom he said he couldn’t identify for confidentiality reasons, when he worked at the Elder Abuse Forensic Center in Los Angeles.An auditor reviewing financial documents noticed signs of neglect in an estate the lawyer was managing. The lawyer’s daughter also called the center, saying her father was bouncing checks and falling behind on monthly bills. She was worried that her father might be the victim of financial abuse.She was right: Yufik said he soon discovered that two former clients had persuaded him to sign documents handing over control of his finances. When his daughter presented the documents to her father, he told her he didn’t recognize them.The lawyer could chit chat with strangers and recite poetry—which in his younger days, he composed—and was able to dress himself appropriately and prepare meals. But his bedroom was in “complete disarray,” Yufik said. There was uneaten food accumulating, and dirty laundry strewn about. It smelled of urine.Although the lawyer could explain basic legal concepts and understood things like his obligation to pay taxes and the importance of health insurance, he was unsure of where his money was held, how much income he was earning, or whether his bills were being paid. The cognitive decline rendered him an easy target, Yufik said.RoutinesRobert Fritzshall would put on a suit every day and take the train to downtown Chicago like he had for years.He was a creature of habit, lunching at the same restaurants over and over. He would regale McLean, his new associate, with old stories and introduce her to acquaintances around town.Part of the self-denial common to lawyers in the early stages of dementia has to do with how closely their identities are hewed to their careers and professional status. “It’s where they have found success, it’s where their friends are, it’s where they are comfortable,” Basner said.One’s identity as a lawyer is “so intertwined with their sense of self,” Vincent said, they will cling to their professional identities “until their dying breath.”Fritzshall had been a respected member of the Chicago area’s legal community—the prosecuting attorney for the Village of Skokie for 13 years, an arbitrator for 12 years, and president for a time of the North Suburban Bar Association. He also served on Skokie’s Village Board of Trustees, Planning Commission, and the theater board for the Performing Arts Center.But that had all been before McLean met Fritzshall.SidewaysPersonal injury and workers’ compensation cases were the bread and butter of Fritzshall’s practice when McLean joined in July 2010. She was unfamiliar with those areas of law, but didn’t have to study his files for very long to realize something was wrong.He was missing irretrievable deadlines and failing to tell clients about significant developments. He didn’t know several cases had been dismissed for failure to prosecute.In one instance, after he accepted a settlement and opposing counsel filed an affidavit indicating that the parties had reached agreement, Fritzshall denied it.McLean said she found opposing counsel were often frustrated and seemed to think he was playing games with them.Before long, she discovered that about half a dozen attorneys had preceded her at Fritzshall & Associates and quickly left, some within weeks.When she raised her concerns, Fritzshall was aloof.McLean reached out to the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program. Although there were plenty of resources and protocols for lawyers struggling with substance abuse or mental health disorders, she found the state bar at the time seemed to lack any systematic approach for dealing with Alzheimer’s or age-related dementia.“It would have been easier if he had been a drug addict,” she said.Ethical ResponsibilitiesA lawyer’s duty to report or otherwise intervene when another lawyer is impaired varies by state. At least a dozen states have ethics opinions on the topic, applicable whether the impairment is due to substance abuse, mental health issues, or age-related decline, and the American Bar Association has issued its own guidance. Case law may also come into play, depending on the jurisdiction.The ABA’s Model Rules provide at least a rough proxy for most jurisdictions.Among other things, rules may require lawyers to report misconduct that calls fitness or truthworthiness into question. They also demand that supervising attorneys take reasonable steps to ensure subordinate attorneys comply with ethical rules, while prohibiting blind reliance on a supervising attorney’s direction.Most states have adopted some version of the relevant rules. But there are notable exceptions. California, for example, has rejected the mandatory misconduct reporting requirement, which the state’s bar journal once referred to as the “snitch” rule.Even if not required, larger law firms often have protocols in place, including internal reporting systems and monitoring when necessary. But for lawyers working alone or who only have subordinates, it’s a lot less likely there will be anyone able to intervene informally, if at all, before serious issues arise.The Last ResortMcLean eventually gave up on the lawyers’ assistance program and started calling the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission’s ethics hotline. But she hit a dead end there, too.She knew filing a formal complaint would likely end Fritzshall’s career, and wondered what the consequences would be for her own future. But his clients were real people, and she said she couldn’t just abandon them.Less than three months after she was hired, McLean mustered the courage to tell Fritzshall she intended to resign and report him to the disciplinary commission.“I figured, if going to the ARDC would do me in, this wasn’t the career for me,” she said.She had him on speaker phone, with his intern at her side. The intern had been working for him for about a year and adored him, McLean said. At her fingertips was a list of his active cases—at least 20—detailing the errors she’d identified, along with approaching deadlines.She told him she was confident that the ARDC would know whether her concerns were warranted.“He turned on me,” she said.DenialIn his formal response denying the allegations, Fritzshall stated, in essence, that McLean was inexperienced and simply didn’t know what she was talking about.She remembers reading it and feeling disheartened, like it had all been “a stressful waste of time.”The ARDC administrator filed a petition against Fritzshall alleging incapacity in August 2011. Fritzshall was initially responsive, but after he stopped appearing at conferences or otherwise complying with the investigation, the allegations were eventually deemed admitted.McLean didn’t hear from the ARDC again until they called to ask her to testify at his hearing in June 2012. By then, Fritzshall had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s-type dementia, according to a letter from his physician that’s referenced in the hearing board’s report.More issues had surfaced. Another associate quit after three weeks when Fritzshall couldn’t afford to pay her. He’d stopped paying rent on his office space. He’d overdrawn his trust fund account multiple times. He’d even bounced a check for $31.71 to a court clerk.His wife had been encouraging him to retire, to no avail, according to testimony at the hearing.When McLean testified before the hearing board, she remembers one member asked something to the effect of, “You left the clients? You just quit?”I called you first, she said.HindsightIn hindsight, there were perhaps earlier signs of Fritzshall’s cognitive decline.In 2005, he’d been suspended for six months, stayed by probation after one month. He’d mismanaged client funds, failed to pay medical lienholders in a timely manner, and misrepresented to an administrative law judge that he had authority to settle a matter when he didn’t, according to the disciplinary findings.Fritzshall told the hearing board that he didn’t remember making the misrepresentation, but admitted he lacked his client’s authorization at the time.Although the misrepresentation was ultimately found to be dishonest, he wasn’t found to have engaged in any fraud or deceit. His trust account had never gone negative, and he’d never written a bad check. Although there were a handful of significant delays in paying lienholders retained for client cases, they all ultimately received the money they were owed.No clients complained or testified against him. The client whose case he’d settled without permission ultimately accepted the same amount of money. When her bankruptcy estate paid him about $16,600 in fees, he cut her a check for about $10,700. He told the hearing board he just wanted her to have it.His mismanagement of client funds was attributed to bad bookkeeping.The review board cited numerous mitigating factors in issuing him a lighter penalty than the conduct otherwise warranted. It was Fritzshall’s first disciplinary action in his 50 years of practicing law. He had already modified his bookkeeping practices and reduced his caseload.The commission also considered the implications of a lengthier suspension: Fritzshall had told them that at his age, he’d be unable to rebuild his practice if suspended for a year.His probation, which he completed successfully, was conditioned on implementing new trust account procedures.The Last ActIn May 2013, Fritzshall was finally placed on disability inactive status. He died in hospice care in October 2015. He was 86.While the hearing board report and Illinois Supreme Court order adopting the board’s recommendations are public, the underlying record of Fritzshall’s proceeding is sealed. The ARDC, citing confidentiality rules, said it couldn’t comment.By the time of the hearing, Fritzshall—with the help of his wife, who was by then his power of attorney—had sold his practice and moved to Wisconsin.The lawyer who purchased his practice had spoken to him after taking over. She told the board that sometimes he was still “very lucid and at other times not.”Two weeks before Fritzshall’s hearing, the Illinois Supreme Court had modified its rules “to allow lawyers facing minor misconduct charges to petition the Court for permanent retirement status.”The change was made “in response to the challenges presented by an increasing population of aging lawyers” in order to provide “a reasonable and dignified option for senior lawyers who should retire from the practice of law while preserving their dignity and hard-earned reputations,” according to the ARDC’s 2012 annual report.But given the seriousness of the ultimately uncontested allegations against Fritzshall, it’s unclear whether he would have been able to take advantage of the new rule even if he had petitioned for permanent retirement status.‘A Preventable Mess’Bud Rubenstein, now 93, knew Fritzshall for most of their lives. Their fathers were law partners. When they joined the military, they were stationed together in Japan for almost a year. They sold shoes together and even attended the same law school, the University of Illinois at Chicago.Rubenstein said he had no idea that Fritzshall had been living with dementia. Fritzshall visited after Rubenstein moved to Arizona, but he doesn’t think they talked much after 2000.“It’s a terrible thing to practice when you have that disease,” he said, “but you’re not sure when you’re in it.”Rubenstein said he voluntarily retired his own license in 2012.Steven Fritzshall, Robert’s son, still practices law near the same courthouse where his father spent so many years advocating for his clients. Steven didn’t know how his father’s career ended until Bloomberg Law contacted him. He said he was shocked. They had been estranged since 1990, he said.Steven recalled seeing his father on a crowded street near the courthouse once, long after they had stopped talking. Robert didn’t say hello.“He walked right past me,” Steven said. He wondered aloud if his father recognized him.“The whole thing is sad,” he said.“We have an obligation to represent clients to the best of our human ability and with a competent state of mind,” he said. “There’s no excuse, zero tolerance—these are innocent people.”Steven said he hoped his father would have said the same thing.McLean still practices law, as an assistant public defender in Kane County, Ill., just west of Chicago.As frustrating as it was at the time, McLean said she’s not bitter about the ordeal. Ultimately, the ARDC pursued the matter, and she recognizes now that there had to be due process, which takes time. She said she just wishes there had been better resources and another way to intervene quickly.She said she feels badly when she thinks about the impact on Fritzshall’s legacy.“He had this whole career, and I was seeing it in its final throes,” McLean said. “It seemed like a preventable mess.”To contact the reporter on this story: Holly Barker in Washington at hbarker@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bernie Kohn at bkohn@bloomberglaw.com; Jay-Anne B.

(Submitted)

The Fraser Valley Bandits are the new official naming rights partner of Basketball BC’s youth leagues, club championships and 3X3 development initiatives.

Formerly known as the Metro League, Basketball BC’s Langley-based U12 and U13 boys and girls competitive leagues, will now be known as the Bandits Youth Basketball League (BYBL). The league was born in the early 2000s in response to the demand for a competitive league that catered to youth in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley who had yet to enter high school programming.

“We are excited to grow our partnership with the Bandits. Ultimately, this collaboration is built on the foundation of creating more pathways for British Columbia’s youth basketball players to play,” stated Lawrie Johns, executive director of Basketball BC.

“By aligning forces on the BYBL, club championships and future 3×3 projects, we will work toward opening doors for more youth to access the game, to develop their skills and to be exposed to current and past coaches and players from BC that have led successful amateur and professional careers.”

With two seasonal editions of the BYBL, the league has typically featured a combined 500 boys and girls playing organized and competitive basketball on weekends in the fall and spring.

“Over the past two years, Basketball BC has helped connect our team with important leaders in the community and we look forward to supporting their programs and working to add to the track record of success that they have seen with their programs,” stated Bandits vice-president Dylan Kular. “We are excited to further align our organizations and to position the BYBL, the Basketball BC Club Championships and future 3×3 events as staples in the fabric of Canada’s flourishing basketball community.”

Basketball BC’s 2021 provincial club championships will also be presented by the Fraser Valley Bandits. An annual fixture, the championships cover a variety of age groups. U13 boys and girls championships are typically hosted in the spring, while U15 and U17 championships are hosted in the summer. Historically, the club championships have hosted 40 to 50 teams from across the province as part of a platform for showcasing some of British Columbia’s top youth basketball players. Club championships have occurred at the Langley Events Centre in the past.

Further bolstering the grassroots alignment is a joint dedication toward promoting the sport of 3×3 basketball by assisting with awareness and participation efforts, such as Basketball BC’s Summer Slam 3×3 tournament, which was set to take place in Kelowna this past summer and was going to host competing boys and girls teams with divisions from U12 to U18, but was cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

Future 3×3 basketball tournaments hosted by Basketball BC will be presented by Bandits, who will assist with operational and promotional efforts to spur attendance, participation and the overall exposure of 3×3 basketball events. Currently, there are 182 countries and regions that participate in 3×3 competitions across the globe, resulting in more than 430,000 players playing the sport and the rise of 3×3 basketball as the “number one urban team sport in the world,” according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).

The sport has also recently become a regular activity in the BC Summer Games.

As part of the naming rights partnership, and in advance of collaborating on future 3×3 events, the Bandits and Basketball BC will be releasing a “3×3 Basketball Guidebook,” which will be a free and downloadable document available for use by the public.

The guidebook will serve as a preliminary source of information that can be used by players, coaches and parents looking to learn more about the merits of 3×3 basketball, how the sport translates to 5×5 play, online resources featuring 3×3 drills and lessons, as well as testimonials from notable Canadian coaches and players.

Strategic partnerships for sustainable development wanted

This article is part of a series on Transformative Leadership published by University World News in partnership with Mastercard Foundation. University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content. This article is part of a series onpublished byin partnership withis solely responsible for the editorial content.

Five years ago, when United Nations member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the resolution made it clear that tackling the current global challenges would require collaborative partnerships.The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which lie at the heart of the 2030 Agenda are a call to action for everyone to work together to eradicate poverty, protect our planet and improve the lives of people around the world.With their expertise in generating innovation, developing capacity and sharing knowledge, academia and research institutions can help to advance progress across all three dimensions of the Sustainable Development Agenda – economic, social and environmental – and help transform the SDGs from goals to reality.For this reason, they are also natural partners for United Nations agencies which promote scientific and technical knowledge, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).FAO works to improve food security and nutrition for all and its collaborations with academia and research institutions go hand-in-hand with its mandate. These partnerships enhance FAO’s work in a variety of ways, including helping the organisation to respond effectively to serious threats to food security and livelihoods.In two recent examples, such partnerships have been essential to FAO’s response to two transboundary pests: the fall armyworm ) and the desert locust ).While the increase of transboundary plant pests can be attributed to a variety of elements such as trade, climate change, land degradation and the changing conditions of agro-ecological environments, limiting their spread strongly depends on two areas that academia excels in: the development of innovative approaches and the diffusion of knowledge.Originally from tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, fall armyworm (FAW) is a pest that is now present in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Near East, Asia and the Pacific. Its ability to travel long distances has allowed it to reach 100 countries in less than four years, and it is estimated that it will soon spread to other regions. Once it finds a new habitat, it is there to stay.The FAW is a polyphagous insect pest and it causes considerable yield losses in maize as well as in more than 80 other crops. It is estimated that, for 12 African countries alone, FAW could cause losses of 8.3 million to 20.6 million metric tonnes of maize annually, equivalent in value to US$2.5 billion to US$6.2 billion and enough to feed 40 million to 100 million people. Academia and research institutions have helped FAO to assist governments and farmers by raising awareness about the armyworm and how to sustainably manage the pest.In response to the rapid increase in the pest’s numbers, FAO launched a Global Action for Fall Armyworm Control to ensure a strong coordinated approach at country, regional and global levels.At the same time, FAO’s partnerships with several research institutions, including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (Nigeria), the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (Kenya) and the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Brazil) helped to advance efforts to develop sustainable control techniques in different regions where the pest had appeared.FAO also worked with universities to develop tools and training which would help those dealing with the problem first hand.In South Africa, FAO partnered with North-West University to identify solutions that reduce the impacts of FAW larvae in crop plantations and would be readily available to all farmers. Tests on FAW control practices are run using locally available materials and techniques and successful results are then shared with researchers and farmers through publications and farmer training.Together with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences , FAO established a South-South cooperation project which promotes sustainable management of FAW in Asia and Africa through the development, transfer and extension of innovative biologically-based integrated pest management techniques.The project engages farmer field schools or other complementary extension services to teach people how to manage the pest through natural biological controls (existing predators, pathogens and parasitoids) instead of highly hazardous pesticides.Taking advantage of increased digital literacy worldwide, FAO and Pennsylvania State University collaborated to create the “Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System ” (FAMEWS), which provides real-time information and alerts on FAW infestations and migrations.The app offers information on which actions should be taken to manage the pest at each stage, including suggestions on locally available biological management methods.A different kind of threat is that posed by the current upsurge of desert locusts on which FAO and its partners are collaborating in support of affected countries. The desert locust is the most destructive migratory pest in the world, posing a major threat to food security and rural livelihoods. Able to rapidly travel long distances, desert locusts are ravenous eaters that target food crops and forage: a single square kilometre of a swarm has the capacity to consume the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people.FAO’s technical experts worked with more than two dozen academic and research institutions on a wide assortment of activities to help countries facing desert locust invasions, including migration modelling, climate prediction, capacity development and early warning.Again in partnership with Pennsylvania State, FAO developed eLocust3m , a smartphone app that provides critical information for early warnings and pest-control activities. eLocust3m allows users to upload data on desert locusts, which is then assessed and validated by in-country national locust centres and shared with the Desert Locust Information Service at FAO headquarters.A collaboration with experts from the European Commission and with the Belgian institutions UCLouvain and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research helped FAO to monitor changes in vegetation over time in possible habitats of the desert locust.Using data from MODIS and the PROBA-V satellites, the project provides spatial-temporal variations of the green vegetation, covering a surface of 60 countries. As greenness maps become available every 10 days, users are able to track the development of vegetation and the impacts of desert locusts on it.The examples above are but a few of the ways in which academia and research institutions actively contribute, in cooperation with FAO, to furthering progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals: the innovation, scientific and technical knowledge that they offer make them strategic partners for all areas of the 2030 Agenda.","GLOBALStrategic partnerships for sustainable development wantedThis article is part of a series on Transformative Leadership published by University World News in partnership with Mastercard Foundation.

Without strong alliances that are based on providing market-leading technology and improving customer experiences, propelling sales is out of the question. Yet, there’s a more profound value in developing rich relationships between partners and vendors: delivering mission-critical solutions to help customers in a pragmatic way.

Working Together to Deliver Solutions

Within the high-tech marketplace, businesses are searching for cutting-edge solutions that will protect stakeholders, customers, visitors, and employees; and their exploration for solving unprecedented security and operational challenges has been intensified by the current global health crisis. Partnering with reputable and forward-thinking tech innovators becomes valuable when it allows for both integrators, developers and end users to benefit from a holistic, end-to-end solution that — in the end — grows business for all parties involved.

How to be differentiated is the goal that drives most organizations looking to push past competition. When it comes to strategic security solutions, for example, technology plays a major role in making that happen. New products and options that break through with real results rarely emerge, despite seeing countless iterations of existing technology. This is why entering a partnership program with the right provider can become a mutually beneficial business initiative: integrators organically evolve into trusted advisors and technology authorities, while customers realize that they are gaining a strategic advantage by implementing cutting-edge technology.

Building on Open Platforms & Compatibility

On this front, the technology landscape for integrators has inevitably shifted to adopting products that can leverage cloud-based platforms. Systems with cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) models at the core allow for enhanced collaboration, quick and easy configuration, improved scalability, and reduced overall storage and licensing costs. The possibility for more seamless deployment opens up.

But, with a look at what’s really changing the game for providing mission-critical solutions, the industry-leading approaches to the next generation of intelligence software focus on developing secure platforms that create synergy across the entire system. Through providers that are committed to building on an open architecture, integrators will be able to more rapidly bring new platforms to market with increased interoperability. It’s vital for wide-scale adoption. Systems harnessing this platform-based intelligent security software can interface with third party infrastructure and underpin tools from all strategic partners. This is ideal for most organizations so data can be infinitely collected, processed and analyzed. By following this model, integrators evolve to better position themselves within the marketplace. They will be able to swiftly work with customers to optimize applications on existing systems, and establish an interconnected platform that’s both powerful and practical; one that has the capability to connect all the dots and execute functions universally.

Full Support for Go-to-Market Teams

By leveraging open and intelligent platforms, security personnel and operators will be equipped with the critical information they need to better handle complex situations and improve incident management. Yet, what’s more from a collaborative partnership between integrators and providers is the trusted support. Providers that prepare integrators to stand out and make sense of all the noise show commitment and know-how. More so, they provide the tools to help end-users overcome any confusion or inconveniences. Readiness programs take the entire process of integrating intelligent security solutions to the next level. For partners, operations, sales and marketing teams typically receive extra support to bolster customer relations and encourage future business engagements. A fully educated sales force results in more robust projects, and teams will be empowered to sell integrated systems more effectively — even when operating remotely.

All in all, software providers offer technology platforms that are applicable to an end-user’s operational and security needs. As a partner, one of the cornerstones to ensure continued success is targeted guidance, whether that’s through training, technical support, sales enablement, co-marketing programs or special incentives. Typically, as certain milestones are met, providers will subsequently offer additional benefits and incentives to continue the trajectory of success and achieve more high-level objectives. With this added support, integrators can provide real solutions and help customers take control of their most mission-critical operating models and safety goals.

Collaboration Leads to Mutual Success

Systems integrators can’t become customer champions without a strategic partner that understands the full scope of a project, including an end-user’s needs and various implementation factors. The success of any partnership hinges on this understanding, one that requires mutual effort stemming from active collaboration and organizational alignment. Groundbreaking technology leaders are always innovating, so working together with teams at all levels of an organization results in a more cohesive strategy for the customer — and intelligent security solutions that are more effectively integrated with streamlined processes and positioned for future system developments.

When COVID-19 disrupted so many industries, there was no playbook for the retail industry and anyone associated with it on what to expect and how to move forward — including brands with teams dedicated to building retail partnerships.

Many companies perhaps considered giving up on wholesale and retail partnerships, but for some, conversely, challenging times can provide an opportunity to focus on relationships and build a partnership strategy that can adapt to trends.

In this interview with Lyndsey Arnold, vice president of partnerships at Thinx Inc, provides insight into how the brand secured five new retail partnerships since mid-March — during the height of the pandemic — and how brands can apply this success to their businesses.

Q. What steps did you take at the height of the pandemic to maintain contact with your brand partners and build on those relationships during a tricky time for many businesses?

Lyndsey Arnold: Relationships are more important now than ever before. We launched our wholesale business in 2018. Since then, we have built out great partnerships with large department stores, including Nordstrom and Selfridges, as well as dozens of amazing independent retailers and boutiques throughout the world. This was a key time for us to stay in contact with all partners, even the ones that hadn’t ordered from us in months. The smaller stores were most likely to have long-term effects from the shutdown, so we did what we could to support them, like working quickly to help get our product available to their online stores, even if we previously didn’t have online sales terms with them.

Even if a retailer hasn’t ordered with you in a while, stay in contact, and check in on them. On top of that, it’s essential to be empathetic — we’re all maneuvering a difficult time, so be understanding and lenient with payment and general business processes. It’s a great time to take a step back and work with them on a long term plan, as well as a contingency plan; this will make them see that you truly value them and their partnership.

Q. Thinx created a new strategy for wholesale; can you explain some of the thinking behind diversifying your channels and portfolio?

Lyndsey Arnold: We had to get creative and embark on a new plan. The strategy that we came up with will allow us to exceed our wholesale goals by 130 percent this year.

Part of the strategy was to expand the channels where we sell and diversify our portfolio. We’ve been successful in traditional brick-and-mortar retail spaces, such as Nordstrom’s lingerie and underwear department, but our product can also live next to pads and tampons, so this was the time to focus more on drugstores and online channels.

Actively monitoring retail’s online presence, as well as anticipating the reopening of stores, we saw the opportunity to highlight our essential products to buyers at stores, such as London Drugs in Canada. They have a strong business, online and off, and we knew they were looking to expand their product offerings.

With that, I encourage businesses to get creative and think outside the box. There is likely a clear channel that your product or service fits in, but where else can it go or be helpful? Think about what consumers are looking for right now and how you can contribute to the market in a different or unique way.

Q. As consumers migrate from an in-store experience to e-commerce, what is product education’s role in a DTC world?

Lyndsey Arnold: Thinx offerings are all essential — we make absorbent underwear for periods and light-to-moderate bladder leaks — and they don’t stop for a pandemic. We also do most of our business direct-to-consumer, so in a time where people are being told to stay home, our products can be delivered to your door. Additionally, people who have been curious but too nervous to try our product finally found the courage to do so as they spent more time at home. For these reasons, our DTC business also saw a lot of growth during the height of the pandemic.

Beyond saying we also have a product that works and people need, we had already been heavily focused on product education since the beginning of the year, and that work really came to fruition when the pandemic hit. For those of you who are not working with period underwear, the takeaway is to consider how you can best educate consumers about your product or service — what is it they may not know about the brand that would be key to them? Also, think about why they need it and how it will benefit them right now.

Q. What advice can you give to other businesses regarding reacting to trends and adapting quickly?

Lyndsey Arnold: In March, Congress passed the Cares Act to help businesses and individuals financially navigate what was happening. With this bill, we were able to start offering our underwear in the HSA and FSA store, meaning individuals can use their flex spending accounts to purchase.

We also monitored the quickly shifting trends as everyone began to shelter in place and start working remotely. One of the biggest trends was, of course, how loungewear became the new “uniform,” so we sought out ways to offer our underwear to retailers that were looking to expand their offerings, as well as known go-to stores for comfort wear. With that, we quickly increased our Amazon offerings, which previously only included Speax by Thinx and Thinx (BTWN), to include our core Thinx line. We also sought out new partnerships with stores like Urban Outfitters and Free People, knowing that they would be looking to increase their comfort offerings.

This is a reminder that you always have to be ready to react quickly to what is happening in the world. It’s important to have alternative sales and promotional strategies that keep inventory flow active, even if it wasn’t your first choice. Always be prepared with a second and third contingency plan. Sometimes you have to be willing to relinquish some of your pride to maintain the health of your business.

As brands look forward to what the next few months of business looks like, it might feel easier to stay within comfort zones, but those that get creative, stay motivated, look for new opportunities and most importantly, are kind, have the potential to start new relationships and build on existing ones to get through the pandemic in partnership.","By Lyndsey Arnold, vp of partnerships at Thinx, Inc.

With a $1 million-a-year grant, the Arizona CEAL COVID Consortium is working with over 30 community leaders and organizations to identify and combat COVID-19-related health disparities.

As the pandemic rages on, it continues to reveal the ugly prevalence of significant health disparities in our country. Being all too familiar with this reality, Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy, chief of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine — Tucson, and his colleagues reached out to other colleagues doing similar work at ASU, NAU and the Mayo Clinic and created the Arizona CEAL COVID Consortium, which is being referred to as the AC3. The study has two major goals:

1. To conduct urgent community-engaged research and outreach focused on COVID-19 awareness and education, address widespread misinformation about COVID-19 and provide an evidence-based response to the disease.

2. To help educate and facilitate the inclusion of people of diverse backgrounds, especially African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos and American Indians/Alaska Natives, to participate in clinical research for COVID-19.

Parthasarathy spoke about how some communities still do not fully understand the ways and the importance of various protective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These communities are often the same communities that face social determinants of health that put them at higher risk of getting COVID-19.

“They may not have a car so they have to travel on a bus — there are 10 other people on the bus breathing the same air. They may have smaller households, breathing the same air as other people,” Parthasarathy said. “They can’t work over Zoom, they have to go in person. Right by virtue of that social determinant, they are more likely to contract the disease and end up in the hospital.”

They may also be more impacted by COVID-19 because of the other health conditions like diabetes, which are more prevalent for poorer communities. Having another health condition like diabetes with a COVID-19 infection can lead to a higher risk of complications.

Given these social determinants of health putting certain communities at a higher risk of contracting and being hospitalized by COVID-19, it is of hyper importance that these communities to implement the basic but important safety precautions like hand washing, social distancing, wearing masks and routine disinfection.

The AC3 team is working with community leaders to provide trustworthy information in a culturally competent manner. Their mission is to educate and provide resources to communities that need them.

“These communities and community leaders are the boss. Each of these community leaders, organizations and members have the right to take this information or say ‘I don't want to do this.’ We are not giving the medications or vaccines,” Parthasarathy said.

By engaging with members of the community, they can help identify barriers and provide accurate information and resources to help address those barriers. For example, if a community member needed to know where they could find COVID-19 tests, the team could help find sites administering those tests, as well as potential rides to get to those sites.

The second goal of the study is extremely important for the development of safe treatments. This is because the African American, Latinx and Native American communities have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cannot come to conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of these clinical trials if they do not include participants from these backgrounds.

The team, however, understands that many minority groups may have a mistrust of these studies especially given the historical context where scientists have taken advantage of these groups in the past and actively harmed them.

“We want the approval and blessing of various community leaders in order for us to do something that helps their community that they are in agreement,” Parthasarathy said. “We will engage them about what they trust and mistrust, and how they can help participate. This is all voluntary.""

With the partnership between these universities and communities, the AC3 hopes to help engage underserved communities and combat some of the health disparities that plague this country.

Genentech is a biotechnology company dedicated to the pursuit of groundbreaking science to discover and develop life-changing medicines for people around the world. These include the first targeted antibody for cancer, and the first medicine for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. As one of San Francisco’s largest employers, Genentech created a robust transportation network of shared and sustainable commute options for their employees, including commuter buses, carpools, vanpools, and a fleet of ferries. The first battery electric bus was introduced in 2018, with plans for the entire fleet to be electric by 2025.

Lyndel will be participating in a thought-provoking plenary with fleet executives discussing their forward-looking stance on the “new normal” for urban mobility, taking place at ACT Virtual on November 10.

ACT News caught up with Lyndel to learn how running clean, electric buses is a big part of the equation for Genentech on the path to sustainability.

ACT News: You will be participating in an upcoming ACT Virtual panel on November 10, “Setting a New Bar for Sustainability in Urban Mobility.” Please tell us some of what you plan on sharing with attendees related to how you are seeing the urban mobility landscape evolve.

“In the upcoming panel, I will share how we at Genentech have altered our services to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions.”

Lyndel Fusello: As everyone is aware, the world has taken many unprecedented turns in 2020. The pandemic has unfortunately shifted many people back into their personal vehicles, making it more important than ever to show riders that safe, reliable and sustainable transportation is still available to them. In the upcoming panel, I will share how we at Genentech have altered our services to operate safely under COVID-19 restrictions and how the pandemic has affected our long-term electrification and sustainability plans.

ACT News: Genentech began operating battery electric commuter buses to shuttle employees to and from the South San Francisco corporate campus in 2018. How is the deployment of electric buses addressing Genentech sustainability goals, and what are the plans to expand EV bus service?

Lyndel Fusello: Genentech has established many aggressive goals towards reducing C02 emissions and sustainability is a driving force for both the company and our transportation team. To contribute to these goals, our team has a keen focus on getting as many people out of their cars as possible to reduce traffic congestion and improve employee’s productivity and wellbeing while commuting to and from work. The addition of electric buses takes this one step further, by allowing us to provide an environmentally clean and quiet method for achieving these outcomes.

“Sustainability is a driving force for both the company and our transportation team.”

Our team has a very ambitious electrification roadmap that includes transitioning 80-100% of our bus fleet from diesel to electric by 2025 (currently we are at ~36%). To support this vision, we have already built out our bus yard with the appropriate infrastructure to accommodate for full electrification, and plan to convert an additional parking lot to support any future electric fleet growth. In addition to our bus fleet, we have committed to converting our entire field sales fleet of ~1300 passenger vehicles to PHEV or BEV by 2030, and replacing half of our 30+ medium duty campus service vehicles to PHEV or BEV by 2030. We have formalized this strategy by participating in The Climate Group’s EV100 initiative.

ACT News: Running cleaner electric buses is a key part of the equation on the path to zero emissions, but Genentech has also successfully optimized bus routes and partnered with other companies to further environmental goals. What are some of the milestones that have been achieved?

Lyndel Fusello: Optimization and efficiency are key in our bus service planning. We have set some firm standards for route and run utilization and pride ourselves on running consistently full buses. To do this, we not only evaluate our ridership daily and make adjustments, but also have launched unique programs to contribute to high utilization; one of these being our Bus Share Program. The Bus Share Program allows us to partner with other nearby companies that are traditionally too small to create their own transportation programs, and sell our unused seats on our buses to them. This not only provides their employees with a sustainable commute method but also allows us to maximize our seat capacity.

“Our team has a very ambitious electrification roadmap that includes transitioning 80-100% of our bus fleet to electric by 2025.”

In addition, we have also been running shuttles from our campus to BART & Caltrain stations for over two decades. Along the way, it became clear that employees at other companies could benefit from this service and we began opening them up to the larger business district free of charge. Currently, over 50% of the riders on these routes are non-Genentech employees.

ACT News: What have been some of the technical challenges and lessons learned from the deployment of the first electric buses at Genentech?

Lyndel Fusello: We have definitely had some growing pains over the last couple years, but none that we didn’t learn from! The biggest lesson I’d say is in regard to infrastructure: think long term. Infrastructure is not cheap, and doing it in pieces is not financially sustainable. Really spend some time planning your vision for your program, and then build infrastructure to meet your end goal. Make sure to also educate yourself on vehicle, infrastructure and energy incentives and rebates. This can really help decrease your overall costs.

Additionally, don’t be afraid to utilize experts and people who have gone before you! We are all learning as this is a relatively new technology in our industry, and we can benefit from listening to each other’s experiences and mistakes. There are also a good number of companies and consultants available now to help you with this.

“The biggest lesson I’d say is in regard to infrastructure: think long term.”

Lastly, take your time evaluating and testing the vehicle makes and models out there. Just because a vehicle was selected by one company does not mean it will be the best fit for your environment or your passenger needs. You are best equipped to make that decision.

ACT News: What are your hopes for the clean transportation sector?

Lyndel Fusello: This is a loaded question, but mainly because I have so many high hopes for where clean transportation is going. A big desire of mine is to have a wide variety of product on the market that is universally compatible with all charging infrastructure. Many manufacturers are close to releasing new electric coaches and this could really change the game. I also hope to see shared infrastructure being the norm. As mentioned before, infrastructure is not cheap and if we could share it, we could help move everyone forward in their electrification goals. Lastly, I hope to see some change in policies surrounding clean transportation. If the world continues to favor cars and car access over every other mode, we are going to be limited in what we can accomplish. We need leaders like California, making vehicle policies and regulation that supports the change from ICE to EV for all vehicles and we need policies that rebalance the space allocated to each mode (HOV lanes, bus only, bike/pedestrian spaces).

ACT News: What advice would you offer to young professionals interested in pursuing a similar career path?

Lyndel Fusello: Take every opportunity that is presented to you and run with it. Whether that is just sitting in on a meeting and listening, or being given a project to own, make the most of it. Learn from your colleagues, ask questions (there are no dumb ones!), research and take it all in! To me, that is the best way to learn and grow in this exciting field.

ACT News: What is the next challenge you have planned?

Lyndel Fusello: My next challenge which I’m extremely excited about is electrifying our onsite shuttle fleet. Currently we have 12 shuttles that are gasoline powered. The goal is to convert 100% of the fleet to electric by 2025. To do so, we are exploring performing gasoline to electric conversions on our current vehicles and keeping a close eye on the market for suitable vehicle options for us.

ACT News: What other leadership roles do you hold in the community and/or what volunteer efforts do you support?

Lyndel Fusello: Since a young age, I have actively participated in volunteer efforts for the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention as it holds a close place in my heart. Additionally, ever since joining Genentech, I have been exposed to many more great organizations to volunteer for. This last year, the whole Genentech Transportation team participated in a stair climb up the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.","An ACT News Virtual Executive Interview with Lyndel Fusello, transportation program manager for bus operations, on the driving force behind the electric bus program at Genentech.

The Marvel Universe has many complex heroes, each with their own unique gifts, personalities, and goals. It's actually quite common to see these heroes team up, but some of the combinations fans have gotten to enjoy aren't exactly a match made in heaven.

RELATED: 10 Strongest Marvel Heroes Who Don't Need Their Main Power To Win A Fight

While there have certainly been some strange team-ups, many of these were actually quite successful despite having no business working together. Perhaps the powers complement each other, or maybe a common goal was more important in the grand scheme of things. These heroes have proven that just because they don't connect well with another, it doesn't mean they can't work effectively.

10 Wolverine And Deadpool

Wolverine and Deadpool are known for their partnership, but it's not exactly a pairing anyone would make lightly. The fact is, Wolverine is far too grim and gritty for Deadpool's over the top humor and fourth-wall-breaking.

It's probably why the pair work in some way. Wolverine would likely just as quickly cut his head off as he would team up with him, though, but since they both have their healing abilities in common, they are a pretty unstoppable force.

9 The Champions

The Champions are a strange combination of younger characters who have found that they actually have a few common goals. For starters, they are all fascinated by the superhero world. Plus, they are just starting their careers.

RELATED: DC: 10 Times Misfit Hero Partnerships Actually Worked Out

A character like Nova doesn't really have many connective points with someone like Ms. Marvel or Miles Morales, yet they have formed a close bond even despite their differences. They are an effective team of young misfits from across the Marvel Universe.

8 Luke Cage And Iron Fist

Luke Cage and Iron Fist are well established as the main two behind the Heroes For Hire. But looking back at their early careers, these characters are from completely different backgrounds. A martial artist from an ancient society doesn't mix well with an ex-con, turned local hero.

RELATED: 10 Strongest Marvel Heroes Who'd Be Useless Without Their Main Power

Yet, despite their differences in humor, fighting styles, and origins, these men have come to bond as best friends. It's difficult to imagine them apart as they are far more effective fighting side by side.

7 Spider-Man And Captain America

Spider-Man and Captain America are definitely a pair that wouldn't choose to work together. Well, Spidey would certainly follow Cap's lead, but Steve Rogers can get a little bit tired of the web-heads constant bad jokes.

There's a lot of respect between these heroes, and that means they work really well together. Their combination of strength and agility also complement one another. In terms of personality, though, there's a real clash here.

6 Black Widow And Winter Soldier

The Black Widow and the Winter Soldier have such different backgrounds. One is an assassin trained from childhood. The other fought in WWII before being taken by the Soviets. The only link is their connection to Russia and their work as mercenaries.

The two have come to form both an effective team and a romantic connection. Their skills and training may be similar, but their outlook on life and how they have ended up in their positions are so different; surprisingly, they continue to be linked to one another.

5 War Machine And Shuri

Shuri has become a leading member of the Wakandan family, contributing to her athleticism and brilliant mind. As an inventor, scientist, and ruler, Shuri has made many key allies across the world.

RELATED: 10 Marvel Heroes Who Were Also Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.

When Wakanda was attacked, it makes sense that heroes like the Fantastic Four came to the rescue. But it was a brief partnership with the surprise savior War Machine that was both unexpected but incredibly useful.

4 Falcon, Inhumans, And Mutants

The Falcon has done a brilliant job of taking on Captain American's mantle, but he has switched between both identities a few times in recent years. He has used his fantastic gifts and heightened role for good, though.

He actually teamed up with both the Inhumans and the mutants to smuggle them out of the city after Hydra's takeover began. It was a heroic effort from Sam Wilson, who is an ally to the Inhumans but certainly not normally someone who actively works with them.

3 Uncanny Avengers

The Uncanny Avengers was set up to bring together the X-Men and the Avengers after fighting so violently. The team consisted of heroes from both groups, some of whom have defined their respective teams.

They didn't last very long as a group, but while they were together, they did make some breakthroughs and help contribute to the defeat of villains like the Red Skull. Ultimately these two teams were brought together as one.

2 Hawkeye And Ant-Man

Hawkeye started to use Dr. Pym's growing formula at one point in his career and became a new version of Goliath. For a while, as he was known at the time, Yellowjacket was unhappy with this change.

Eventually, he came to like Hawkeye in the new role and worked with him on many occasions, giving him his blessing. Clint would take on many other roles in the years following, but it's still strange that Hank allowed this to happen.

1 Captain Marvel And Alpha Flight

Captain Marvel is a cosmic hero that is perhaps more powerful than most of Earth's heroes. Alpha Flight is a team dedicated to protecting Canada and is considered their version of the Avengers. When news broke, Carol Danvers would be their new leader.

Along with Abigail Brand, Captain Marvel has turned the team into the first line of defense from cosmic threats. It's a strange move for the team, considering how they had already been established, but the odd partnership seems to be working out.

287,https://digiday.com/marketing/we-look-to-those-as-growth-levers-how-fitness-start-up-obe-is-using-brand-partnerships-to-boost-awareness/,"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Digiday,How fitness start-up Obé is using brand partnerships to boost awareness,"Finding creative ways to acquire new customers is paramount for new companies and fitness start-up Obé is betting on partnerships with endemic brands (like athletic clothing brand Athleta and weight loss company WW) and non-endemic brands (Samsung and HBO Max) to do so.

“You can play the Facebook and Instagram game and, obviously, we do, but what’s more interesting for us is marketing partnerships,” said Ashley Mills, co-founder and co-CEO of Obé. “We look to those as growth levers and opportunities for us.”

Founded in 2018, the fitness company offers virtual on-demand classes like pilates and yoga for a $27 a month subscription. It’s unclear how many subscribers Obé has as the company declined to disclose the figure. This past spring, with the surge in demand for online workout classes due to the coronavirus pandemic, Obé saw membership grow 80% month-over-month from March to May. Since then, membership growth has evened out to 30% month-over-month, according to the company.

Even with the increased demand for online classes, Obé has continued to build out its partnership strategy to bolster its growth. As previously reported by Glossy, the company’s partnership with HBO Max, which kicked off earlier this summer around the streaming platform’s launch, played a part helping Obé turn its classes into must-see events with custom Sex and the City, Game of Thrones, Euphoria and Sesame Street themed classes for members. Doing so helped increase awareness of the new streaming platform as well as Obé, according to the company.

On-demand workouts at home is an increasingly competitive category. Obé, co-founded by Mark Mullett and Mills, is one of a number of at-home fitness companies with virtual classes (see: Peloton, Mirror, etc.) that have cropped up in recent years. The company’s differentiation approach to the burgeoning fitness media landscape is to be “where entertainment meets fitness,” said Mills. “We dive into lifestyle in a bigger way and have fitness classes with entertainers who entertain you.”

Using partnerships with other brands, especially endemic ones like Athleta and WW, likely helps boost the perception of Obé as a lifestyle fitness brand as well as help to increase subscribers.

By partnering with Athleta, for example, Obé is able to reach customers who shop the brand and offer deals to get them to try classes out. Customers who do will likely notice that Obé instructors are outfitted in Athleta gear. At the same time, Obé customers who don’t shop at Athleta are then introduced to the brand. As for WW, Obé has been integrated into WW’s “Wellness Wins” program where members of WW who meet goals can redeem free Obé classes for doing so.

“Partnerships are a much more creative way to introduce your brand to new customers,” said Nik Sharma, CEO of Sharma Brands and direct-to-consumer brand strategist. “It’s beneficial to both parties. Unlike paid advertising, where you’re spending money to get new customers and putting up something on Facebook or Instagram that’s like, ‘Come buy us,’ partnerships allow you to create new products to get new customers in intuitive ways.”

That said, using partnerships with other brands to help boost awareness as well as subscriptions is just one part of the company’s marketing strategy. Aside from Facebook and Instagram ads, the company has tested new channels like CTV, Snapchat, TikTok and linear TV in recent months. Obé spent $562,000 on media placements during the first six months of 2020, per Kantar’s data; that figure does not include what Obé spent on social media ads as Kantar doesn’t track social spending.

The fitness company isn’t alone in trying to use a partnership strategy to acquire new customers. Disaster emergency kit company Judy recently partnered with bathroom fragrant Poo-Pourri on new kits — which have Poo-Pourri, hand-sanitizer, hand wipes, a whistle and a glow stick — to help both companies acquire new customers, per Sharma who is an advisor to both brands.

“[The strategy] is not super standard,” said Sharma. “But it allows for cross audience pollination and can increase customer lifetime value.”","Even with the increased demand for online classes, Obé has continued to build out its partnership strategy to bolster its growth.

In this Q&A, Shimon Senderowitz, head of HR innovation and analytics at ADP, discusses how and why the traditional relationship between HR and IT is changing, why these new partnerships need executive-level support, and what business and technology considerations organizations must address for successful HR-IT collaboration.

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW Shimon Senderowitz, head of human resources innovation and analytics, ADP

This conversation has been edited for clarity, length, and editorial style.

Q: How would you describe the traditional relationship between HR and IT?

Senderowitz: The traditional relationship is very straightforward. The technologies that HR implements have been mainly practitioner systems — essentially, big file cabinets. There are systems for recruiters to use. There are systems for people who administer learning to use. And, of course, there are the big, core HR systems to manage all basic transactions. Some of these systems have an employee-facing component, but they are limited in scope.

Now we’re working on implementing what we call employee experience type systems, which represent multiple perspectives at a whole new level. First, these systems need to be more fully integrated into other technologies used in organizations. They also require a different level of sophistication. For example, they need more user-experience designers because they are designed to be integrated into the flow of work.

Before, systems were designed around what practitioners actually needed and how they liked to do their work. Now it’s a very different lens. It’s about how people do their work in general, and it’s beyond the specific tasks that they’re doing. It’s all built around the role of an employee or candidate versus the role of a recruiter. That means that you have to consider many different perspectives to get the requirements right.

Another element is that, historically, the employees on the IT side who were aligned to help with HR were programmers with technology skill sets based on the company’s tech stack. Most systems were built on similar stacks, and as long as the users in HR provided good requirements, the tech team could build it with the expertise they already had in-house.

Now we require IT employees with a much wider skill set that traditional IT teams simply don’t have, and we also can’t be limited to a specific tech stack because solutions need to be wide-ranging. That means that either IT and HR have to forge new relationships, or those IT teams have to upskill and expand their own teams to service the needs of today’s HR organizations.

From an HR-IT relationship perspective, it was very transactional in the past. It wasn’t as strategic. Interactions were mainly at the lower levels because they really didn’t require senior-level involvement.

That’s changing, because now we’re talking about very strategic systems that are more fully integrated into the organization’s talent-management and technology strategy.

Technology teams need to be more aligned with HR and dedicate more resources to HR than ever before — and to do so at higher levels — because, again, the conversations are increasingly going to be strategic, rather than tactical.

Q: Why is it important for these collaborative relationships to happen right now?

Senderowitz: There’s a strong push for these employee experience type systems. People are demanding it; it’s happening everywhere. And there is a gap on both sides.

On the HR side: HR doesn’t always know how to solve for these needs, so they need IT to come and help them understand what’s out there based on what HR is looking to accomplish at a high level, not based on specific requirements. That’s my role, in essence, because although I sit on the HR side, I am a technologist.

On the IT side: Tech teams need to be able to understand the business, not just the requirements. I look for my partners in IT to have a strong domain focus and curiosity to understand what we do and how we do it on the HR side.

So with the conversation shifting from “Here are the requirements for System X” to “How do we reengineer Process Y,” it can no longer be a discussion between lower-level HR and IT professionals. Again, it’s now more senior-level executives who are brainstorming how to change things.

Here’s an example. One hot new HR technology involves internal mobility — the ability to be proactive and recommend open jobs to existing employees based on their skill sets and backgrounds. In the traditional process, recruiters post jobs, candidates see the listing and apply, recruiters review the applications, and if they like a particular candidate, they can make the introduction. The new technology turns the traditional process upside down. Now a hiring manager posts a job and candidates are automatically matched — and now the hiring manager is the first one to make a decision on that candidate. So there has to be higher-level involvement, because it’s going to fundamentally change how we do things.

Q: What does an organization’s top leadership need to do to enable effective HR-IT collaboration?

Senderowitz: It’s important to establish governance. Organizations can establish a working group or council to take on this initiative within the business. It’s important to ensure that key leaders are invited to participate. Having this level of participation can help create more accountability and a deeper level of understanding of the HR goals and how IT is helping to solve for them. This group should meet regularly to discuss those goals, progress on specific initiatives, and, when necessary, remove any obstacles that come up. With that level of collaboration, it’s not just HR having a vested interest and asking IT to come help. It’s the other way around as well.

Q: Can you provide an example of how such collaboration enables improved employee experiences?

Senderowitz: For instance, when talking about building a chatbot, instead of being a conversation about “What is the HR chatbot going to look like,” it’s a conversation about “What is your company’s chatbot going to look like, and how does the HR component fit into it?”

The same conversation plays out when talking about portals, when talking about employee self-service and manager self-service. It’s a much broader conversation right now about the role that someone is in, rather the specific transaction someone executes on. We’re not talking about HR transactions that an employee has to be able to self-service. We’re talking about employees and the things they need to do, or managers and the things they need to do.

HR has gotten more sophisticated in using data to understand the employee experience and how to make it better, and using data to make better people decisions.

So we’ve developed systems that are designed around managers and their role as managers, and around the chief operating officer and the role of the COO, or around whatever role you have in the organization. That way, we can talk about it holistically. When you have that conversation, you need more people involved and you need to think about the solutions differently.

Q: Could you talk a bit more about HR chatbots, and about some other new and relevant technologies?

Senderowitz: Sure. Chatbots are virtual agents that not only provide a support perspective — answering questions like “Where can I find my pay stub?” and “What’s the policy on tuition reimbursement?” — but also provide conversational AI tools that can serve as a virtual coach or help you execute full transactions. So you can ask questions like “I need to have a difficult conversation with an employee; what advice can you give me?” You are not just automating a transaction; you’re taking on a function that was traditionally done by a skilled HR professional. But it’s important to remember the limitations: You are replacing those professional skills and expertise with a machine that does not yet have human-level intelligence.

HR has also gotten more sophisticated in using data to understand the employee experience and how to make it better, and using data to make better people decisions. So analytics is big. HR is producing so much data right now. There has to be a lot of data governance. There has to be good infrastructure behind the scenes to collect and manage and

organize that data.

Q: What other considerations do companies need to know about building effective relationships between HR and IT?

Senderowitz: First, there are the people, and how and where they work. For instance, in some organizations, data scientists sit within HR. In others, they are centralized within IT. But that’s a skill set that’s been reserved, even in the last few years, for more front-line functions, not necessarily for HR. So do you enable HR by hiring such people — and it’s an expensive skill set — or do you give your HR department access to those people who are doing it throughout your organization?

It’s fairly easy for an IT person to understand what a core human capital management or recruiting or learning system needs to look like for a practitioner, to understand the requirements and build a system to do it, because it’s pretty much black and white. But now IT people are building algorithms that are, for example, screening résumés. From a technical perspective, the IT employees can figure out what they have to do if they have that skill set. But it’s harder for them to evaluate whether it’s actually working, because they’re not recruiters; they don’t know how to evaluate the résumés.

That collaboration needs to be tighter to get the developers to understand what the recruiters look for, what they value, and how they value it.

Another example, coming back to the chatbot: Many HR transactions are very sensitive. Someone calls because they have a sick child and they need to change their medical plan, or there was a loss in the family. An HR person has the intuition to have the right tone for that conversation.

Now you’re developing a chatbot that’s going to handle that conversation. Guess what? That chatbot is cold. It has no human intuition. Also, the person who programs it is an IT person and may not know the tone and the persona that needs to go into that conversation. That means the HR person needs to have a lot more input into how the conversation should be conducted, the type of dialogue, and so on, because when using a chatbot, you drop all the cues that trained HR people pick up and adjust accordingly.

So you could see how, in the past, when we needed to build a system, we would give IT detailed business and technical requirements, and if they followed it to a T, it would be fine. Now that’s just not good enough. You can’t write that down on a piece of paper. You need to feel it, you need to experience it.

That’s why some of these jobs are now done within HR. HR hires technical people, and HR people are learning some of those skills because they bring the other side to the conversation. It used to be that, as we’ve discussed, HR systems were mostly back-end systems. Now they’re all front-end systems. It’s a whole new way of thinking. And the only way that you can be successful is through a close relationship between HR and IT.","And, of course, there are the big, core HR systems to manage all basic transactions.

289,https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/tip/5-steps-to-build-partnerships-with-IT-distribution-companies,"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",TechTarget,5 steps to build partnerships with IT distribution companies,"Editor's note: IT distributors are an important segment of the IT channel ecosystem that act as intermediaries between vendors and channel partners. In this article, Scott Ford outlines five steps for channel partners to build successful partnerships with IT distribution companies.

1. Evaluate distributors There are plenty of distributors in the IT industry. This is a good thing, because as a channel partner, it gives you choices and keeps prices competitive. But if you don't choose your distributor partnerships strategically, you could be missing out on benefits. Rather than engage with IT distribution companies at random, make a list of what is most important to your company, then begin researching current or potential distributors and see how they stack up against your list. Some elements you might consider include the following: Price

Free shipping threshold

Location of warehouses

Inventory availability

Cutoff times for ordering

Customer reps or teams

Return policies

Credit terms

Presales support

Availability of platforms such as Microsoft 365 Whatever your list ends up including, compare distributors and determine where your energies and dollars are best spent.

2. Select a primary distributor Once you've held tryouts, it's time to pick your team. Your company should register with a few distributors, because doing so guarantees some will offer things that others don't and some will have inventory in stock when others don't. Nonetheless, you will need to pick a primary. The reason you should select a primary distributor is because the more love you show them, the more love they show you. When you increase the frequency of business and number of interactions you do with your distributor, they might lower your pricing or free shipping threshold and invite you to events, for example. They may even show more of a willingness to make exceptions or concessions when you need them most. How you engage your primary distributor truly has an impact on the type of relationship you have.

3. Explore offerings that are not top priority Distributors do a pretty good job of marketing goods and services to their clients. Most of the time, however, if those marketing emails are unrelated to something your company already does or is thinking about doing, they get deleted. It's not a bad idea to look at those emails from your distributor. They might highlight products or services you don't currently offer. While you might not want to offer every possible solution out there, you might be surprised at what's available. Reading up on those offerings might spark an idea. It is also important to note that, although you may think you will never offer whatever it is the distributor is marketing to you, you should at least be aware of it. Even if you won't offer it, some of your competitors will, so it's important to stay up to date on what's going on in the technology ecosphere. So, the next time you log into your distributor's website, don't just click the same buttons you always do. Check out new areas of the website -- even areas that don't apply to you at this moment -- and read about things your company hasn't yet considered doing. Regardless of whether you sign up for anything new, at least you'll be better aware of what is available. Everyone gets something different out of distributor relationships, but if all you are doing is ordering parts, you are missing out on a lot.

4. Take advantage of distributor-hosted training IT distribution companies will regularly offer training sessions and demos for various products and services. This is a great opportunity for you, your sales team and, in some cases, your engineers to learn more about your company's current and future offerings. If you see a training event that is relevant, attend it. Furthermore, keep in mind you can be proactive about this: You can always contact your reps at the distributor and ask them if they have upcoming trainings on specific solutions. The reps will be more than happy to share the training schedules.

Many of Marvel's most well-known villains aren't exactly easy to work with. In fact, it's not actually that common to see them team-up. While hired hands is always an option, it's more likely that a villain will fly solo, asides from a few grunts to carry out commands.

There are instances where villain team-ups can actually prove to be fruitful, though. Despite the egos at play and the various goals that each villain has, a few incredibly surprising partnerships have formed that actually allowed these villains to get a much-needed advantageーeven though normally these characters would never even be seen together.

10 The Cabal

During Norman Osborn's dark reign, he created a group that could stand against the Illuminati. Consisting of villains from across the Marvel Universe that represented different factions, the Cabal was born.

Street-level thug the Hood, mutant Emma Frost, Asgardian Loki, sorcerer and scientist Doctor Doom, and Atlantean Namor joined the group. Their partnership was productive in many areas and helped to secure Osborn's leadership for quite some time.

9 Madame Masque And The Hood

Speaking of the Hood, the character also made quite the odd ally during this time period. Creating his own gang of criminals, his right-hand woman happened to be the mercenary Madame Masque. The two seemed like an odd pairing.

However, there was a romantic spark, but there was a clear loyalty between the two. The partnership came to define the Hood at the height of his power, despite the characters really representing different things.

advertising

8 Venom And Carnage

Venom and Carnage are essentially sworn, enemies. They may both be symbiote, but that's about where the similarities stop. Carnage has always been more violent, considering his host is actually a serial killer, but Venom is hardly friendly.

RELATED: Captain America: 5 Marvel Villains Who Should Be Able To Beat Him (& Why They Can't)

Eventually, the pair had to get over their constant fighting, though, when a new symbiote threatened to wipe them both out. They teamed up for a little while, making a fearsome partnership once their common enemy was defeated, though, they became foes again.

advertising

7 Magneto And His Group Of Villains

Magneto is a well-known leader, having been responsible for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for some time. However, to take on the Red Onslaught, Magneto had to bring in some newfound allies if they were to stand a chance.

He rounded up well-known villains, including Loki, Doctor Doom, Carnage, Jack O'Lantern, Mystique, Enchantress, and even Deadpool! The group co-existed long enough to defeat some sentinels and make a real impact in the battle against the Onslaught.

advertising

6 MODOK And Nightshade

Nightshade is known for her battles against heroes like Luke Cage, but her past has actually crossed paths with MODOK and aim. Despite their very different methods, the pair actually could offer something to one another.

Nightshade is a fantastic scientist, specializing in various forms of chemistry. MODOK could provide all the resources that she needed. The partnership didn't last long, but it certainly allowed both of these villains to benefit.

5 Ultron And The Phalanx

Ultron is a terrifying villain in his own right and is known for working with a huge army of robots that he has created. But there's also an alien species known as the Phalanx that he once managed to take control of.

RELATED: Fantastic Four: 5 Marvel Villains Who Should Be Able To Beat Them (& Why They Can't)

Robotic in their own nature, Ultron then used this newfound power to infiltrate the Kree. Therefore, he made a lot of allies and a lot of enemies, but this forced partnership with the alien species brought him to new heights.

advertising

4 Madame Hydra And Viper

The Hydra Council is something fans are quite familiar with now, but before its creation, there were many rivalries between the villainous group leaders. Viper often fancied herself the head of Hydra.

But, a new Madame Hydra emerged, forcing her to revert to her Viper title. This new Madame Hydra eventually extended an olive branch, and Viper accepted. The Council came together and surprisingly worked quite well, despite the various personalities.

3 Kingpin And Killmonger

Kingpin has his sights set on all sorts of things. He is a crime lord for a reason as he can always see the bigger picture. Erik Killmonger happened to be a part of that picture when Kingpin wanted to put together a group of mercenaries.

Killmonger eventually became a pawn in Kingpin's game, although this eventually fell apart. For a while, though, the two worked together well, with Kingpin providing the cash and Killmonger providing the kills.

advertising

2 Red Skull And The Juggernaut

The Red Skull is always looking for new ways to tear the Avengers apart. One such way was when he hired the Juggernaut to help take down the Hulk. This resulted in the team brainwashing the Hulk to attack Earth's mightiest heroes.

It was a plan that paid off for the time being, and this mutant and Hydra combination was a success. Down the line, Juggernaut would work alongside Sin the new Red Skull, although against his will during the Fear Itself storyline.

1 The Thunderbolts

The Thunderbolts are quite literally designed to be a team of misfits. Villains looking for redemption, or sometimes brought in against their will, there have been many formations of the group over time.

A few consistent members and a couple of rosters stand out, but each team has proven that they can get the job done in the field, despite the infighting that will probably occur afterward.

But sometimes extraordinary events means they have to team up with unlikely foes.

The villains of the DC Universe are sooner likely to stab one another in the back than they are to actually team up and fight alongside each other. It's very rare to see a partnership with villains who aren't usually known for their team bonding skills. After all, most bad guys are solitary figures looking out just for themselves. There are some exceptions, though, like Captain Cold and Heatwave, who are actually a lot better working together.

RELATED: Superman: 5 DC Villains That Should Be Able To Beat Him (& Why They Can't)

Others like Harley Quinn and The Joker have been partners for most of their career, even after they have split up countless times. But there are some villains that really don't have any business working together and yet they somehow form a partnership that's not only successful but could actually be beneficial to both of them long term. Other times though the allied villains won't last long despite the tremendous success they have.

advertising

10 Riddler And The Penguin

The Riddler and The Penguin are two of Batman's most well known enemies. Sure, they have teamed up alongside other foes like Scarecrow or The Joker, but they have also consistently formed a partnership that really shouldn't work; yet it does.

While this is an alliance that has also been seen on screen thanks to the Penguin and Riddler of the Gotham universe, in the comics the two have teamed up on so many occasions, to combine both their business acumen and love for showmanship. It's certainly an unlikely pairing that has had some degree of success.

advertising

9 Superman's Villains And The Man Of Steel

Superman usually wouldn't be caught dead teaming with the likes of Lex Luthor and his other terrible rogues. However, when General Zod was a proven threat to the Earth itself, these villains actually worked alongside Superman.

This was of course the most shocking for Lex himself, however they all had a common goal and a distrust of Kryptonians. Zod has therefore proven to be the Man of Steel's ultimate foe, considering how many characters had to join forces to stop him.

advertising

8 Harley Quinn And Poison Ivy

Harley Quinn has had a number of allies over the years, with the most notable being the clown prince of crime himself. But in recent years Quinn has become known for her unlikely pairing with another Gotham City criminal, Poison Ivy.

RELATED: Teen Titans: 5 DC Villains The Should Be Able To Beat Them (& Why They Can't)

The two do not represent the same thing at all, with one looking out for the environment and the other searching to create chaos. Yet, their partnership not only works, it's actually bloomed into a fully fledged romantic relationship. Few other villains have managed to have such a long lasting and successful time together.

advertising

7 The Legion Of Doom

The Legion of Doom is the ultimate example of villains coming together in makeshift partnerships in order for their collective goals to be fulfilled. Over the years the Legion of Doom has created some very unique team ups.

It's always strange when mystical threats like Black Adam come face to face with assassins like Deathstroke and they actually work alongside each other, but the whole point of this team is for egos to be set aside for the common good—even if it usually not for very long.

advertising

6 Sinestro And The Lantern Corps

Sinestro is the sworn enemy of the Green Lantern Corps. This is largely thanks to the Yellow Lanterns that he set up representing the complete opposite of hope—in the form of fear. Yet, when the time came for the Emotional Spectrum to be protected, they did what was necessary.

All of the different Lantern Corps from across the galaxy, with many of these actually being villains, teamed up after the Black Lantern Corps had risen to create chaos. Throughout the event Sinestro could even be seen saving some of the Green Lanterns.

5 Cheetah And Circe

In many iterations of the character, Cheetah was actually given her abilities thanks to the sorcery of the witch Circe. The two, therefore, don't get along, with Cheetah feeling that she has been cursed by a force so powerful that she actually held her as a servant for some time.

RELATED: Justice League: 5 DC Villains That Should Be Able To Beat Them (& Why They Can't)

Fast forward though and the unlikely pair were eventually brought together. Circe amended her magic so that Minerva could change between being the Cheetah and being human. Circe allowed this to happen so that they could meet the common goal of defeating Wonder Woman.

advertising

4 The Rogues

The Flash has quite the colorful roster of villains. Fans have become so intrigued by these antagonists that DC eventually put them together in a team known as The Rogues. They really have only one thing in common. Their hatred for the scarlet speedster.

Despite the mixture of personalities, from the Mirror Master to Heatwave, this team has constantly rallied around Captain Cold and have been quite successful. Their partnerships only seem to last for short bursts though, until they are back to solo work.

3 Gorilla Grodd And Lex Luthor

Gorilla Grodd is a savage beast, which is why even Lex Luthor and Superman once teamed up to take him down. But Grodd is also an incredibly intelligent animal and Lex has sought his assistance a number of times.

Not only he is a more trusted member of the Legion of Doom, but Lex and Grodd have actually found themselves teaming up on a number of occasions, especially when the Kryptonians are involved and Lex needs a capable ally to take on the otherworldly foes.

advertising

2 Shadowpact

The Shadowpact are a team or magic users from across the DC Universe. While none of them are natural allies, they teamed up when they were being hunted down one by one, due to their use of magic.

One character that was particularly shocking in this partnership was Enchantress. The witch had caused a lot of problems for other magic users but she put her troubles aside in order to overcome this huge threat to them all.

1 Neron And Black Manta

Neron may be a horrible, demonic beast that many people in the DC Universe would fear, but for Black Manta he is an opportunity to rise in power and hopefully gain what he believes to be rightfully his.

Black Manta created a deal with Neron, allowing himself to be turned into an aquatic monster. This transformation worked for the pair for a while, although eventually Manta returned back to his previous form, since he never quite achieved victory.

292,https://www.thehrdirector.com/features/csr-2/charity-partnerships-good-business-good-people/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The HR Director Magazine,"Charity partnerships: Good for business, good for people","Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, charities and businesses have collaborated in ways that have been more meaningful and more impactful than ever.

There is no better time for you to dust off your CSR strategy and seek out a charity partnership that can make a real difference.

The World Busines Council for Sustainable Development defines Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as “a continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce as well as the environment, local communities and wider society”.

An integrated CSR strategy may be seen as a ‘nice to have’ and not a top priority, especially at a time when businesses are adapting to working through a pandemic. But, in our experience, a well-chosen charity partnership can bring your CSR strategy to life and have an extremely positive effect on your business.

At the Youth Adventure Trust, we are proud of the long term partnerships we have established with businesses, large and small, over the years. We don’t have an off-the-shelf proposition, instead we focus on developing bespoke relationships which have maximum impact both for the partner organisation and the vulnerable young people we support. We actively look for partnerships that ‘make strategic sense’ for everybody involved, helping to elevate the CSR strategy from ‘nice to have’ to an integral part of the business plan.

A CSR programme typically focusses on four main pillars:

1. Responsible business for all your stakeholders

2. The environment

3. The health and wellbeing of the workforce

4. The communities around your company.

A charity partnership which embraces your CSR strategy can result in measurably improved business outcomes:

Better brand recognition and financial performance: Research shows an increase of between 5-40 % in revenue for companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact and 55% of consumers are willing to pay more for products from these companies.

A competitive edge: A visible CSR policy sets companies above their competitors and can be an important element in the tendering/decision making process – long running product promotions such as Fairy and Make A Wish are testament to the value of such charity partnerships.

Improved staff recruitment: A socially responsible business is more likely to attract top talent. Research shows that 90% of prospective employees agree a company active in the community is likely to be a good employer, 88% of millennials say they want to work for a socially responsible company and 75% of them would take a pay cut to do so.

Better staff retention: A clear commitment to your CSR policy can improve staff retention rates. 83% of people say that they would be more loyal to a business that enables them to contribute to solving social and environmental problems and 88% say their job is more fulfilling when their the opportunity to make a positive impact on social and environmental issues.

Staff development: Encouraging employees to support their local community through a clear volunteer policy provides opportunities for employees to learn and develop teamwork, communication, confidence and leadership skills that will improve their workplace performance.

A simple and active employee engagement program, developed with a charity partner, can help your staff feel respected and committed to the business goals and values. With everybody in the business pulling together to support the community, employees are given a higher sense of purpose, loyalty and motivation.

Actively engaging team members with a charity partnership, asking them to put their expertise to good use for a different purpose to ‘normal’, encouraging them to give their time and enabling them to fundraise in support of your chosen cause can unify, strengthen and engage teams.

So, choose your charity partner wisely: Make sure the partnership objectives match your organisational values and that the relationship ‘makes sense’; Be realistic when setting out the terms of your charity involvement; Staff engagement will be crucial in getting the most out of your charity partnership; Consider how you will measure the success of your partnership and how it fits in to your CSR strategy.

We are delighted to be supporting the Youth Adventure Trust for the next 3 months, a charity helping vulnerable young people fulfill their potential, build resilience and lead positive lives through adventure based programmes, enabling young people to challenge themselves, experience success, grow in confidence and develop skills that will last a lifetime. theHRIDRECTOR will donate 25% of all monies received through the sale of our Platinum and Silver Subscriptions , plus any single issues purchased.

293,https://greenvillejournal.com/community/partnerships-may-provide-answers-to-greenvilles-affordable-housing-problem/,"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Greenville Journal,Partnerships may provide answers to Greenville’s affordable housing problem,"“If you know anything about real estate and affordable housing, you know it’s not cookie-cutter.”

That’s the assessment of Bryan Brown, who serves as president and CEO of the Greenville Housing Fund, the nonprofit organization launched two years ago to address the area’s housing affordability problem.

By “cookie-cutter,” Brown means that there is no single solution to the problem. In the eyes of those addressing the problem on the ground, increasing the availability of affordable and workforce housing will require a variety of approaches, with the city and county working alongside nonprofits and the private sector to find as many ways to meet the demand as possible.

So, rather than travel blind, Brown and other stakeholders decided to come up with a plan.

Released in September by the Greenville Housing Fund in partnership with the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority (GCRA), the “Affordable Housing Strategic Plan” lays out a roadmap for where Greenville wants to go with regard to affordable housing — and how it plans to get there.

Conducted in partnership with Thomas P. Miller and Associates, the plan found Greenville County will need to produce 10,000 new affordable units and preserve 3,000 more over the coming decade.

“Fair warning, this is an ambitious but realistic plan,” said the introduction to the plan, which was penned by Brown and John Castile, executive director of the GCRA. “[But] without a sound strategy and a clear commitment, the affordability issues of today will grow and become more costly to resolve.”

Here’s how they hope to solve that affordability issue.

Housing preservation

In the affordable housing world, so to speak, there are properties that are referred to by the Biblical name of NOAH.

This has nothing to do with an ark, however. Instead, NOAH is an acronym that stands for “naturally occurring affordable housing.”

“We’re talking about looking at the existing housing stock in the city and county and preserving as many of the affordable units as possible,” said Matthew Reuff, director of economic development and community resiliency with Thomas P. Miller and Associates.

What’s happening nationwide now, and especially in Greenville, is developers looking to snatch up such properties, fix them up and drastically raise the price point.

“If they can find it, put a little money in it and then double the rent, that’s a huge incentive for them,” Brown said. “They’ll stop taking rental vouchers in many cases, and then those affordable units are gone entirely.”

Related: City and county team up to tackle affordable housing in the coming decade

The goal, then, is to identify and invest in such properties and improve them to market-rate quality but keep the price point low enough to meet affordability needs.

Compared to building out an entirely new development, these fix-up jobs are a far cheaper and faster means of providing affordable units, and can be applied to properties such as old apartment buildings and old motels, among others.

Housing production

The primary goal when it comes to producing more affordable housing is to leverage private resources to meet the need, Brown said.

In Greenville’s case, given the unmet and new demand, the best method is to focus on large-scale multifamily developments with private-sector developers.

“The reason the private sector is interested in working with us on these affordable housing strategies is, for one thing, it’s good for the community,” Brown said. “But from a financial perspective, it’s good for business. In other words, we need to do good work but also need to understand what the market returns need to be in order to attract the private sector.”

One such developer that recently partnered with the county to provide affordable housing is Lighthouse Living. Its project, The McClaren, a nine-story complex overlooking Academy Street at the corner of Rhett and Wardlaw Streets, will offer 20% of its units as affordable housing.

David Mann, president and founder of Lighthouse Living, said new developments needs to include affordable units if the city aims to keep growing economically.

“Otherwise it would be really hard to get people to work there, because they wouldn’t be able to live there,” Mann said. “You’re talking about firefighters, teachers, policemen, nurses, restaurant GMs, waitstaff, college grads starting out. They’re not going to want to constantly commute in, and if the only people who live there are the ones who make a lot of money, who’s going to take the jobs that support that hyperlocal economy?”

To help provide market returns to developments with affordable units like The McClaren, the city and county can utilize “housing tools” that might not otherwise be available to a strictly private sector developer.

These incentives “may be applied to a variety of rental or homeowner housing development scenarios,” the strategic plan notes. “Some may be more appropriate for small affordable housing developments while others serve to spur large-scale affordable housing development projects.”

These tools are numerous and varied in their effects, including local and federal grants, property donations, subsidized loans, tax credits, down payment assistance for families looking to purchase their first home, opportunity funds, land banks, rental assistance, tax abatement and more.

In the case of The McClaren, the county was able to provide a special source revenue credits to reduce property taxes for a negotiated period, with Lighthouse agreeing to provide affordable units in exchange.

But Brown said financing is just one of numerous ways to spur creative partnerships, mutually beneficial scenarios and incentives to get the housing produced.

Location, location, location

Not every location is suitable for affordable housing, however, especially if land value is too high.

“Obviously the higher the land value, the harder it is to make affordability pencil out in terms of making a real estate transaction work,” Brown said.

But on the flip side, affordable housing should be developed in a variety of neighborhoods, whether that be urban, suburban or otherwise.

“Having diverse affordable housing options through the salary spectrum is truly important for a sustainable community,” said John Castille, executive director of the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority, during a meeting in October.

Part of what the Greenville Housing Fund does is operate a land bank, looking for strategic parcels to acquire and possibly use as an equity contribution into a partnership structure that makes affordability work.

Look to The Mosaic at West End, a 4.5-acre proposed downtown residential community developed by Saint Capital in partnership with the Greenville Housing Fund and the Greenville Housing Authority.

“That’s an example of where we had acquired some vacant land, and the developer had acquired some additional land, which we combined for this project,” Brown said. “It’s a great site, right on the doorstep of downtown.”

APPLICATION FOR REZONE –PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PD)

Designed to be a rental community with a blend of 2- to 3-story townhomes and 1- to 3-bedroom apartments, a full 25% of its units are planned to be reserved for affordable housing. Entering into ownership agreements for such developments can help assure affordable housing in perpetuity, Brown said, as opposed to a deal that expires in a set period of time.

In a proposal to the city’s Board of Zoning Appeals, Saint Capital said The Mosaic at West End aims to be “an example of how vacant and underutilized land can be transformed into a collaborative development that both accomplishes the goals of private development, protects against the loss of affordable housing, and even increases it.”

Brown said any property that is produced or preserved as affordable housing should contribute to the neighborhood, its quality of life and its condition.

“When you include affordable housing in a development, nobody should be able to point to any one door and say, ‘That’s the affordable unit,’” Brown said. “If that’s happened, we’re doing it wrong.”

Where things stand now

Despite the challenge ahead of them, Brown and other local stakeholders are confident Greenville is well positioned to meet the need.

“One of the things you can say about Greenville is we are a very inclusive community, one that embraces the notion of public-private partnerships,” Brown said. “That’s really what we’re talking about here. It’s all about the kind of partnership efforts that meet community needs while honoring the financial interests of our partners.”

The strategic plan has set a 10-year deadline, and even though Brown can’t predict the future, he is confident about one thing.

“Inaction results in a bigger problem to solve,” he said. “So the more we do now, the more we help ourselves avoid bigger issues in the future.”

What is affordable housing?

Housing is considered “affordable” if a family spends no more than 30% of its gross income to live there, including utilities like water, gas, trash and electricity.

What is workforce housing?

Housing for families with incomes that are at 80% or lower than the area median income.

Difference between workforce and affordable housing?

Often they are the same thing, as most low-to-moderate-income families are working and in need of affordable housing near their job.

Before COVID-19 hit, Greenville had more than 50,000 “cost-burdened households,” or households that spend more than 30% of their total income on housing.","Released in September by the Greenville Housing Fund in partnership with the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority (GCRA), the “Affordable Housing Strategic Plan” lays out a roadmap for where Greenville wants to go with regard to affordable housing — and how it plans to get there.

295,https://gulfbusiness.com/why-partnerships-are-key-to-achieving-the-gccs-smart-city-ambitions/,"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gulf Business,Why partnerships are key to achieving the GCC’s smart city ambitions,"Over the last decade, GCC countries have embarked on major national transformation programmes to stimulate economic growth by transforming into knowledge-based economies and creating opportunities for the development of smart cities that are adaptable to future change.

Effective thought-leadership and efficient implementation of smart city strategies at a national level have enabled the Gulf’s cities to leverage technology to boost citizen wellbeing and deliver more efficient, sustainable and inclusive urban services.

In line with these national plans, KPMG has forecast that the Middle East and Africa’s smart city market will double from $1.3bn in 2018 to $2.7bn by 2022, driven by the pursuit of greater efficiency and lower costs for governments, businesses, and consumers.

“Smart cities create an abundance of opportunities for digital innovation, helping build new economic ventures, improve service delivery and facilitate citizen engagement,” explains Younus All Nasser, assistant director general of Smart Dubai.

“Smart and dynamic growth through collaboration between government entities, private companies, academia and citizens is essential in order to transform the future of our cities and achieve greater happiness for the people of our nation.”

Each Gulf nation has its unique vision of what a smart city looks like, and each city is keen to work with international partners to implement the next level of smart city solutions.

Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh has become the fifth smartest city among the G20 capitals, according to the 2020 Smart Cities Index. This progress is driven by ambitious smart city developments such as the $500bn mega-city NEOM, with the developer recently announcing the establishment a 5G-network infrastructure.

And with Saudi Arabia aiming to increase the number of Hajj and Umrah pilgrims to 30 million by 2030, the process of transforming Makkah into a smart city has picked up pace in recent years.

Similarly, Bahrain is working on its smart city infrastructure, which began with the development of Bahrain Bay, the kingdom’s landmark $2.5bn waterfront community.

The government of Kuwait has accelerated the digitisation of several of its e-services platforms as the country aspires to transform itself into a hub for trade, finance and tourism as part of its 2035 vision.

Mobile telecommunications companies are acting as a catalyst in the country’s smart city transformation – Kuwait was among the first GCC countries to implement 5G. The South Saad Al Abdullah smart city project is billed as the Middle East’s first green and ‘smart’ development and will be home to around 400,000 people.

Meanwhile, the UAE’s smart city projects such as Masdar City, The Sustainable City, and the Zayed Smart City Project are good examples of the UAE’s early adoption of innovative smart city solutions.

The UAE is already implementing 5G and exploring the futuristic transportation method hyperloop.

Other smart government services include the UAE Pass, the first national identity and signature solution that enables users to identify themselves quickly and access a range of government services, and Dubai’s Smart City initiative, which will transform 1000 government services into smart services.

According to Simon Penney, Trade commissioner for the Middle East at the UK’s Department for International Trade, the UK is keen to partner with the Gulf to help make the region’s smart city ambitions a reality.

“By working with different partners, with different skillsets, the Gulf’s smart city projects will continue to thrive,” Penney explains.

“The UK is one of the global leaders in the development of world-class smart cities technologies, and we have a proven track record of working with other countries to help them to achieve their smart city visions. In fact, British technology companies are already involved in a wide variety of projects across the Gulf.”

For example, CrowdVision is a British company involved in delivering real-time data to help manage crowds and ensure the safety of millions of Hajj pilgrims in Makkah.

The software company also provides crowd control and queuing management software for Muscat International Airport in Oman. These technologies are particularly relevant to help ensure social distancing in busy public areas during the current pandemic.

CrowdVision’s COO Stuart Mills believes that the Gulf is an important market for the company because businesses within the region are very receptive to world-class technologies and are often thought-leaders in the way that technology can be leveraged to the greatest effect.

“Our solution is a great example of British technology being deployed in the Gulf to help crowd management and keep people safe during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he explains.

Meanwhile, with the UAE’s population growth expected to double by 2027, the country aims to leverage advanced technologies and smart city transport solutions to reduce transport costs and congestion and to enhance its position as a global logistics and transport hub. One important initiative is Dubai’s Smart Autonomous Mobility strategy, which aims to transform 25 per cent of all journeys in Dubai into driverless journeys by 2030.

Earlier this year, British Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) developer BeemCar signed an memorandum of understanding with Dubai’s Road Transport Authority (RTA) to step up collaboration to develop futuristic mobility solutions through PRT built on suspended transport technology.

“The region is clearly very ambitious and taking on a global leadership role in smart city mobility. We are equally determined to ensure that all of its citizens enjoy the benefits of our next-generation PRT system that solves the perennial problem of inner-city congestion, safety and pollution,” BeemCar’s CEO Robin Brownsell explains.

BeemCar’s mobility solution uses ultra violet lighting in the ceiling and floor to sanitise the inside of the vehicle in 30 seconds, ensuring a Covid-19-free environment for passengers.

For Gulf economies looking to leverage international expertise and innovation within the smart city value chain, partnerships will certainly help them realise their goals.","Similarly, Bahrain is working on its smart city infrastructure, which began with the development of Bahrain Bay, the kingdom’s landmark $2.5bn waterfront community.

The Northern Illinois Food Bank will hold a Pop-Up Market at CLC's Grayslake Campus on Dec. 1, 15 and 29. Courtesy of College of Lake County

The Lake County community has more of a reason to visit College of Lake County's Grayslake Campus thanks to the college's many partnerships.

Northern Illinois Food Bank continues its Pop-Up Markets, the Lake County Health Department will offer two drive-through COVID-19 testing days, and CLC's Women's Center is hosting its annual holiday giving tree.

Pop-Up Market

Every two weeks, the Northern Illinois Food Bank takes over CLC's parking lot 3 at its Grayslake Campus to offer approximately 50 pounds of food to families in need. Since the event began on Oct. 20, around 3,000 families have benefitted from the partnership.

""It's a cross section of society,"" said Northern Illinois Food Bank Pop-Up Market manager Mike Keane. ""There's no trend of a certain gender, race, creed or color that comes to mind when I look out at all the cars lined up.""

The drive-through food assistance will continue at the college campus at least through the month of December. Look for the market from 2 to 5 p.m. Tuesdays, Dec. 1, 15 and 29. Volunteers are still needed for all days. Dates for other Pop-Up Market locations are available on the food bank's website.

COVID-19 Testing

During the month of December, parking lot 3 at the Grayslake Campus will also serve as a mobile COVID-19 testing site. On Saturday, Dec. 5, and Monday, Dec. 14, the Lake County Health Department, in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Public Health, will conduct up to 500 tests each day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or until supplies run out. Participants will always remain in their vehicles. The test is free; however, providers will ask to see photo identification. No appointment is needed to receive the test and all are welcome, regardless of symptoms.

Holiday Drives

While CLC's Women's Center staff have just wrapped up its Thanksgiving Drive, resulting in 50 families and 200 individuals receiving gift cards, they are already on their next project -- the annual Holiday Giving Tree.

For the past 17 years, the center has collected and distributed gifts to children all over Lake County, and they are not letting the pandemic disrupt their mission.

""For many of the children, these are the only gifts they will get for the holidays,"" said women's center specialist Tammy Burns. ""Every year I see the happy children talk to their thankful parents. Times were difficult for these parents before COVID, and now many are just trying to survive.""

Collection efforts do look a little different this year. There are two giving options: Gift purchases and monetary donations. There is an Amazon wish list for children younger than 13. All gifts are under $30 and will be shipped directly to CLC. As gifts are purchased, they are removed from the list. Monetary donations are accepted in increments of $25 at the Lancerzone bookstore, online or in person.

Online purchases should be shipped to ""Grayslake Pick-Up Lancerzone."" These gift cards will be used to purchase gifts for the children and donations are tax deductible. Those wishing to donate have until Dec. 4 to make their purchases.

The College of Lake County is a comprehensive community college committed to equitable high-quality education, cultural enrichment and partnerships to advance the diverse communities it serves in northeastern Illinois.

Offered at three campuses in Grayslake, Vernon Hills and Waukegan or online, college classes are affordable and accessible to help each student achieve academic, career and personal goals. More than 70,000 students graduated with degrees and certificates since the college opened in 1969.

The Hut Group has announced new global Ingenuity partnerships in fashion and beauty, in addition to accelerating its sustainability drive with the launch of THG Eco

Manchester-based THG Holdings, which floated in September, has unveiled a series of new client-wins, across fashion and beauty, partnering with BWX, Lulu Guinness and Orlebar Brown.

The group also announces the launch of THG Eco, which will be the driving force behind the group’s bold sustainability action plan.

Orlebar Brown is a Luxury swimwear brand, part of the CHANEL Group, whch will expand its presence in Japan, China and South Korea, as part of an end-to-end D2C partnership with the British-born brand.

Australian wellness and natural beauty business, BWX, is partnering with THG Ingenuity to drive its D2C strategies for its brand portfolio, which includes Sukin, Andalou Naturals, and Mineral Fusion, to expand into Europe, Asia‐Pacific and North America.

The ASX‐listed company will initially target five priority markets and increase to 14 markets in financial year 2022.

Lulu Guinness, the Iconic British brand, best known and loved for its retro-flavoured accessories and red lip logo, is growing its D2C audience in Japan via its partnership with THG Ingenuity, maximising on THG’s international infrastructure and end-to-end ecommerce expertise in the region.

The partnership will allow Lulu Guinness to continue to accelerate the brand’s presence in the market and meet customers’ increased desire for its products.

Building on the continued momentum within the Ingenuity Commerce pipeline, the THG today also launches THG Eco, which will be the driving force behind the group’s bold sustainability action plan.

Eco embodies the group’s sustainability goals and will accelerate ongoing activity that will reduce THG’s impact on the environment and create and implement innovative new sustainability practices.

THG’s vertically-integrated business model means the group is well placed to embed sustainability and best practice at the heart of product design, manufacture, delivery and customer journey.

The group said it is committed to the ongoing development and expansion of sustainability into its unique fully end-to-end model to create enduring positive change for its customers and Ingenuity partners.

THG’s recent attainment of CarbonNeutral certification is the first milestone on the group’s new sustainability action plan, with THG Ingenuity also gaining CarbonNeutral certification as part of its pledge to create one of the world’s first ‘green’ ecommerce platforms.

The CarbonNeutral certification represents a significant first step in THG’s commitment to reducing its climate impact and maintaining business growth in an innovative and sustainable manner.

It means THG has balanced out emissions by supporting low carbon sustainable development projects which reduce the equivalent amount of CO2, while the group take steps to reduce emissions in the longer-term.

Founder, chairman and chief executive of THG, Matthew Moulding, said: “I am delighted to announce meaningful progress on THG’s sustainability strategy, in conjunction with our new THG Ingenuity partnerships.

“Each of our brand partners offers something unique to their audiences, yet they are united in recognising the power of THG Ingenuity and the potential gains our platform can bring to their growth models.

“With regards to THG Eco, for all businesses, the threat of climate change means that reducing the environmental impact of their operations is no longer a choice – it has become a pre-requisite.

“At THG we are very aware of the challenge we are all faced with, which is why the launch of THG Eco is so important and will ensure we’re fulfilling our responsibilities to the planet and to the people around us as we continue to pursue our ambitious growth plans.”","The group also announces the launch of THG Eco, which will be the driving force behind the group’s bold sustainability action plan.

The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) once again brought leaders from across the sector together for high-level talks aimed at strengthening cooperation between the public and private sectors.

The 42nd Plenary Session of the United Nations specialized agency’s Affiliate Members focused both on immediate priorities for tourism’s vital restart and on the longer-term task of ensuring the sector continues to be a key pillar of sustainable development.

The event provided a unique, high-level platform to allow Members to share their best practices and proposals for recovery. With the theme “Recovering Tourism. Rebuilding Trust. Reinforcing Partnerships,” the Session echoed the wider priorities of UNWTO, above all restoring confidence in international travel and promoting collaboration at every level. Participants were encouraged to make use of the new Affiliate Members Virtual Corner, launched to coincide with the Plenary Session.

Tourism needs the support of governments and international organizations to grow back and grow back stronger and more resilient, benefitting many millions of people and businesses worldwide

The Plenary Session focused on laying the foundations for UNWTO’s Programme of Work for 2021. This roadmap includes continuing to make tourism a key pillar of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and further enhancing sustainability and inclusivity across the whole of the sector. UNWTO’s Affiliate Members, who include businesses, academia and civil society actors, will play an important role in the United Nations specialized agency’s work in the challenging months ahead.

UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The engaged participation of every part of our sector will be needed to restart tourism and drive recovery. From the start of this crisis, tourism has led the way in adapting to the new reality and putting public health concerns first. Now, tourism needs the support of governments and international organizations to grow back and grow back stronger and more resilient, benefitting many millions of people and businesses worldwide.”

Making good on UNWTO’s pledge to lead by example, this hybrid meeting again demonstrated that international travel is safe and that tourism is proactively adapting to the new post-COVID reality. In all, more than 200 delegates took part in the Plenary Session, either in-person or virtually, with the diversity of tourism on full display

Celebrating tourism at its best

Against the backdrop of Plenary Session, the UNWTO Affiliate Members Distinction Awards show how tourism is living up to its status as the ultimate people-first sector. The event celebrates those stakeholders who that best embodied the spirit of solidarity and determination that underlined the sector’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. IFEMA, was recognized for its response to the crisis, in particular for allowing its exhibition spaces to be repurposed for healthcare. At the same time, CNN was recognized for its inspirational communication campaigns, including its work bringing the UNWTO #TravelTomorrow campaign to a global audience of millions.

Other Affiliate Members recognized at the 2020 Awards include Chameleon Strategies for its work in Asia, and both Facility Concept and the Africa Tourism Partners Company for advancing UNWTO’s work in Africa. The Xcaret Group was recognized for its work restarting attractions and theme parks, while IATA was commended for its work in support of the global air transport sector. Alongside these, CaixaBank was recognized for its support for tourism businesses of all sizes, with the Ayuntamiento de Madrid leading by example in fostering public-private partnerships for response and recovery.

The ceremony also highlights tourism’s wider contribution and the role Affiliate Members are playing in advancing this. EGEDA was recognized for its work promoting the Sustainable Development Goals, the Seoul Tourism Organization, was commended for its work promoting tourism as a tool for peace and reconciliation, while the Royal Commission for Al Ula was singled out for its promotion of inclusive community development through tourism.","The above was the theme for the 42nd Plenary Session of the United Nations specialized agency’s Affiliate Members.

299,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/doj-cryptocurrency-guidance-outlines-56866/,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",JD Supra,DOJ Cryptocurrency Guidance Outlines Enforcement Partnerships (Part II of II),"Matt Stankiewicz continues with this two-part posting on DOJ’s cryptocurrency guidance.

DOJ’s Cyber Digital Task Force’s report, “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,” provides a comprehensive on the growing partnerships between DOJ and other offices within the executive branch. We’ve seen the expansion of these partnerships in other legal areas, and the continued advancement of these relationships continues to build an impressive prosecutorial force

FinCEN

FinCEN has long been involved in the cryptocurrency industry, as one would expect. FinCEN is tasked with implementing and administering the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”). FinCEN regulates money services businesses (“MSBs”), the ambit of which cryptocurrency exchanges fall under, along with various other crypto-related services. FinCEN even directly addressed “virtual currency” all the way back in 2013, during the early infancy of the industry.

As the report explains, the DOJ’s relationship with FinCEN falls into two main categories: crime prevention and investigatory assistance. FinCEN is responsible for receiving and analyzing information relating to money laundering and terrorist financing, through suspicious activity reports (“SARs”). FinCEN also acts as a conduit for financial intelligence information obtained from its foreign counterparts.

To highlight this partnership, the DOJ discusses a collaboration between FiNCEN And the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California. After a parallel investigation with DOJ, FinCEN fined Ripple Labs Inc. in 2015 over $700,000 as a civil monetary penalty for violations of the BSA. Ripple Labs created and sold the cryptocurrency XRP. Ripple Labs failed to register with FinCEN and willfully violated several requirements of the BSA by selling XRP. Ripple Labs also failed to implement an AML program. At the time of the violations, it was the second largest cryptocurrency in market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin.

Ripple was not happy with being highlighted in this report, and the San Francisco-based tech company has since threatened to relocate overseas.

OFAC

OFAC is tasked with administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions. These sanctions schemes target malicious actors to serve US foreign policy interests and national security goals. Put very simply, US Persons – a broad definition – are restricted from transacting with sanctioned parties. Unsurprisingly, these sanctioned entities are constantly seeking ways to circumvent these limitations and restrictions, and have turned an eye towards cryptocurrency in attempt to facilitate those desires. OFAC has followed suit and turned their attention to the industry as well, even having gone so far as to sanction individual Bitcoin wallet addresses, as well as the Venezuelan Petro as a whole – the cryptocurrency developed by the government of Venezuela.

The DOJ’s relationship with OFAC has grown significantly in recent years in general. Its joint focus on crypto comes as no surprise as sanctioned entities continue to explore it as an option to help circumvent restrictions. In August 2019, the DOJ and OFAC worked together against several Chinese nationals for their roles in fentanyl distribution. The DOJ had previously indicted and charged several of these entities for their roles, and coordinated with OFAC to have all of them sanctioned pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. OFAC has further worked with the DOJ to pursue criminal charges against North Korean entities associated with ransomware and the hacking of a prominent cryptocurrency exchange.

SEC

The SEC has been something of a boogeyman in the crypto industry for years, as investors worried whether or not their favorite cryptocurrency would be considered a security or not. The concerns came to a head as initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) grew exponentially, and billions of dollars poured into unregulated and unregistered investment offerings. As such, the SEC has devoted significant resources into this area, and has released a variety of guidance to help issuers and investors better understand what is and what is not a security, with their interpretation tailored to virtual assets.

The DOJ has maintained a strong working relationship with the SEC for several years now. Long time readers of our blog know, as we’ve written expansively on their teamwork in prosecuting violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). As such, these two are a frightening tandem for would-be securities violators. Look no further than the 2018 case against AriseBank and its executives. While the SEC filed civil complaints to halt an allegedly fraudulent ICO, the FBI and SEC coordinated a search of AriseBank’s place of business and a executed a freeze order. Meanwhile, the DOJ brought a criminal case against the CEO and COO where the two plead guilty, while a corresponding civil action by the SEC led to disgorgements of millions of dollars.

CFTC

The CFTC takes their authority from the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides an expansive definition for “commodities.” The CFTC has released guidance to that end, concluding that certain cryptocurrencies fall under their ambit as “commodities.” This conclusion has been buttressed by a handful of court rulings determining the same. The clearest implication of the CFTC’s jurisdiction occurs when there is fraud or manipulation in cryptos traded in interstate commerce – these are the “pump-and-dump” schemes that plagued the altcoin boom.

We know the CFTC has maintained a strong relationship with the DOJ, especially as of recent. So it’s no surprise that the two are working well together in the crypto industry. The two pursued parallel proceedings against Blake Harrison Kantor and Nathan Mullins, among others, peddling ATM Coin in the US. The conduct involved a fraud scheme that convinced customers to purchase binary options and/or transfer funds into ATM Coin. The two then misappropriated much of these funds. In the CFTC action, Kantor and Mullins were forced to pay over $4 million, while the DOJ action resulted in 86 months’ imprisonment.

Even recently, the DOJ brought charges against BitMEX and several of its executive team for BSA violations. In its press release, the DOJ noted its partnership with the CFTC and thanked their investigators for their work and expertise.

IRS

Put simply, the federal government wants their cut. The IRS has declared that cryptocurrency will be treated as “property” for tax purposes, and noted that cryptocurrency trades (even crypto-to-crypto) are considered taxable events. The IRS has provided various other forms of guidance relating to the tax treatment of crypto, including guidance relating to “hard forks” and the resulting assets.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)

The OCC “charters, regulates, and supervises national banks and federal savings associations.” Specific to cryptocurrency, the OCC has issued guidance relating to crypto-asset custody services for bank customers. In this guidance, the OCC has noted that holding private keys for their customers represents a modern version of a traditional banking activity.

State Regulations

Outside of the federal government, state regulators are pursuing their own regulations and frameworks as well. New York has been at the forefront of this work with their Bitlicense and other endeavors, including it’s Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative.

International Regulation

The Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) is an intergovernmental organization focused on combating terrorist financing, international money laundering, and various other threats to the international financial system. The US is a founding member and has been a key player in pushing for international guidance for cryptocurrency. Over the past several years, FATF has continued to provide guidance and international framworks for handling cryptocurrency while minimizing money laundering and terrorist financing activities. This report notes that DOJ attorneys have played an instrumental role in drafting many of these documents.

Ongoing Challenges

Privacy and anonymity will continue to be a major battleground for enforcement, as I’ve written about in the past. This has always been a central tenet of the technology since its inception. As such, as regulators continue to improve on their own resources to “follow the money,” there are several in the industry fighting to stay one step ahead. This has led to a variety of innovations that the DOJ highlights in this report.

The DOJ has focused a lot of its regulations on crypto exchanges, as they tend to be the major gatekeeper as the conduit between fiat and crypto for many people. As such, they’re tasked with complying with KYC requirements, along with reporting and monitoring activities. That said, we’re now beginning the see the rise of decentralized exchanges, and this DeFi movement will remove that centralized exchange from the equation. How regulators will deal with this new challenge is still to be seen.

Outside of exchanges, there are a variety of other ways for individuals to transact with cryptocurrency, or exchange fiat to crypto. These include peer-to-peer services and crypto-kiosks (essentially, crypto ATMs). These are all required to adhere to certain KYC and AML requirements.

Mixers and tumblers are another threat that will be difficult to deal with. Put simply, these tools obfuscate that origin and destination of cryptocurrency transactions. These tools operate as an intermediary in multiple transactions, and all of the transactions send their coins into the mixer, and the mixer then randomly transmits the coins to their intended destination. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to identify who was the actual intended recipient in a transaction. Earlier this year, the DOJ announced an indictment and arrest of the operator of Helix, a mixing service that helped launder nearly $300 million worth of Bitcoin. The DOJ warns that these services are considered MSBs, which mean they are subject to a variety of regulations.

In this same vein, we’re continuing to see a rise of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Monero is one of the older examples, but other types are continuing to pop up. While Bitcoin maintains a public ledger, where every transaction is available for the world to see (although anonymized based on wallet addresses, which can ultimately be linked to individuals or entities with some leg work), privacy coins keep their transactions hidden from the public. So while Bitcoin was previously used on Darknet marketplaces, we’ve seen a shift to these privacy coins to further hide the source and destination of these funds. The DOJ identifies these coins as a “high-risk activity” and does not liquidate any of these seized funds, to prevent them from returning to the stream of commerce.

Conclusion

Overall, the report provides welcome clarity on the enforcement priorities of the DOJ and the US federal government as a whole. The report is more of a historical look back at prior actions in the cryptocurrency industry with the accompanying descriptions of how they came about and under what legal authority they were brought. While there are still plenty of questions left unanswered, this report does offer guidance for practitioners moving forward.","Matt Stankiewicz continues with this two-part posting on DOJ’s cryptocurrency guidance.

300,https://gulfbusiness.com/how-school-university-partnerships-can-strengthen-the-uaes-education-sector/,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gulf Business,How school-university partnerships can strengthen the UAE’s education sector,"One of the UAE’s highest priorities has always been education. As a result of the keen focus over the years, the nation has seen the rate of adult literacy zoom from 54 per cent among men and 31 per cent among women in 1975 to 95 per cent today for both genders. This is commendable, given that the education system itself is relatively new, compared to those in several other parts of the world.

As an industry, it has grown and aimed for continuous improvement. The nation’s commitment to education has helped diversify the economy and prepared a new generation of young people possessing skills that are sought after in the global marketplace.

Recent reports state that the UAE education market is expected to grow from $4.4bn in 2017 to $7.1bn by 2023.

Additionally, the Ministry of Education (MoE)’s Education 2020 strategy is designed to bring significant qualitative improvement in the education system, especially in the way teachers teach and students learn.

There are several ways to achieve this, however one of the most effective routes, is via collaboration between educational institutions. In other words, school-university partnerships are a fundamental link to strengthen teacher education reform.

Historically, various studies have supported this claim, having concluded that, with a clear agenda and goals, all parties benefit.

At one time, such partnerships were limited merely to managing the school to university transition. However, today’s collaborations focus on areas well beyond that in several ways:

• Enhanced learning opportunities for students – When schools collaborate with universities, it opens up a completely new window of opportunity for students. The most obvious one is having better-prepared students for higher education. It allows students a view into a world beyond school, a chance to ask questions and seek out new educational and career opportunities. At the same time, such partnerships can also assist the school with their high school student recruitment efforts.

• Sharing of best practices – Across all industries, sharing of best practices is an excellent way to improve performance and productivity. The education sector is no different, and school-university partnerships can greatly improve learning and teaching outcomes. Some examples of best practices are collaborative teaching initiatives and joint professional development which can result in better-prepared teachers entering the workforce, which in turn results in improved learning outcomes.

• Professional development opportunities – The quality of teaching has long been recognised as a key factor contributing to student achievement, and classroom teachers often benefit from having access to professional development opportunities as a result of school and university collaborations. These could include workshops and training which will allow exposure to new techniques and teaching methodology, understanding expectations of college instructors or even networking, which can help create mutually beneficial ties.

Universities provide students with the skills to compete in increasingly global workplaces and are agents of social mobility. They can bring about tremendous impact in the society, however working closely with schools can ensure that an early start is made.

Equally importantly, such interactions prepare university academics for the new students each year, all of whom are more evolved and digitally able than the batch before them, thereby resulting in a better connect between the two.

An example of such a school-university partnership is the memorandum of understanding signed by Heriot-Watt University with Taaleem Education, which provides private K-12 English language education in the UAE. The agreement is targeted at creating mutually beneficial educational opportunities for staff and students in the next three years.

Under the MoU, Heriot-Watt University will provide Taaleem staff and students with invitations to events such as guest speaker series and experience days, organise faculty development workshops for professional staff, provide work experience opportunities to Taaleem students for two weeks each year and appoint a designated admissions team member to support Taaleem students through applications and enrolment.

Meanwhile Taaleem will include Heriot-Watt University at all their student career fairs, permit the university to communicate with Taaleem students and parents with regards to higher education and distribute Heriot-Watt’s publications in Taaleem schools.

In it he said that the country has to make a decision as to whether it is going to look East to the “two headed dragon” or North to the United States when it comes to deciding where its economic priorities lie.

His words, spoken in the context of the country’s future 5G telecommunications needs, were a sharp reminder of how US thinking about the region seeks to link the ideological with the economic and commercial.

Reiterating his Government’s position that it will reassess how it interconnects and shares information with countries that ‘compromise’ their 5G security, Mr Tapia was quoted as saying: “As for consequences, it’s gonna affect banking, any financial transaction from this island”, while adding “that your financial institutions and the finance of Jamaica stops… that’s the consequence that you are looking at long term. That’s major.” The Ambassador also told the publication that in the event of any type of natural disaster “we cannot and will not move into a communist Chinese network because it gives them the opportunity to download all the data that we have”.

Unsurprisingly, the Chinese Embassy in Kingston responded, describing in a statement the Ambassador’s comments as “interfering in other countries’ domestic and foreign policies and forcing small and medium-sized countries to choose sides”.

Setting aside the obvious thought that Jamaica should be left to determine which 5G system might provide the best technical and developmental outcome, Mr Tapia’s apparently transactional intervention is unlikely to go unnoticed elsewhere in the region. His thinking could equally be applied to every Caribbean nation exploring future telecommunications options.

His remarks contrast unfavourably with the more nuanced language deployed at a media briefing prior to the US Secretary of State’s visit to Guyana when US officials advised non-attributably that Washington was not saying “do not deal with China” but “make them deal on transparent, 21st century, above-board terms”.

Anyone who has ever worked in or with the Caribbean ought to understand that instructing rather than awaiting a considered sovereign outcome is likely to generate resentments located in a much darker past.

If the US believes that private sector investment in infrastructure and trade can deliver renewed economic growth, greater stability, and by extension enhance its security, it needs to be seen to do so in the spirit of partnership rather than for ideological reasons or as an economic bulwark against China.

As Margaret Myers, the Director of the Asia and Latin America Programme at the Washington based Inter-American Dialogue recently pointed out, threats from the administration and members of Congress to withdraw security and development assistance will result in a few short-term ‘wins’ but reinforce the view of a hegemonic United States. The US, she wrote recently, should talk more about what it can do with the region rather than what China should not. Reducing dependence on China, she believes, will require extensive investment in the region, along with a commitment on the part of the US to building and nurturing productive partnerships.

Currently, however, the impression created by the Trump Administration is that by securing the economic stability of near neighbours they can become a part of an ‘Americas First’ strategy that will strengthen both the US and the hemispheric economy by encouraging US corporations to play a central role replacing China as a development partner.

To this end, and following Mr Pompeo’s recent visits to Suriname and Guyana, the Chief Executive Officer and a delegation from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has travelled to Suriname, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti and Guyana to meet with government and private sector; the new President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Mauricio Claver-Carone has said that his candidacy was a signal of a stronger commitment from the US to support the region and its institutions; the preferential trade arrangement, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) has been renewed by Congress; Jamaica and Guyana are participating in the ‘Growth in the Americas’ initiative; and Washington has increased its security cooperation and military presence in the region.

In this context, a recently published commentary by Vicki Assevero, a senior Caribbean fellow at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington, adds a footnote. She observes that a July 7 Memorandum sent by the White House to Secretary Pompeo requires that he “certify to the appropriate congressional committees that the provision of support under title II of the [BUILD] Act in a less developed country with an upper-middle-income economy furthers the national economic or foreign policy interests of the United States”.

Ms Assevero makes the interesting suggestion that this White House exception for upper middle-income economies ‘may be a harbinger of a more profound understanding of the Caribbean’s challenges’, observing that if the US were ‘to lead the Atlantic community in a new pragmatic classification of the region’ such leadership would not only reap significant good will, but also help accomplish US goals.

If this is correct, the US may be moving to address the biggest development headache the region has. That is the much complained about graduation of the region as upper middle-income countries – Haiti is the only exception – out of eligibility for concessional development assistance, despite its vulnerability to everything from climate change to the economic impact of the pandemic.

If pursued multilaterally and without political conditionalities, it could break the cycle of Caribbean underdevelopment, opening the way for an economic and Caribbean social renaissance in the complex post COVID world.

As this is being written President Xi is enunciating at his Party’s Fifth Plenum, China’s long-term national policy objectives and international approach and today the US will go to the polls. Irrespective of the outcome, concern about China’s role in the Americas and its growing global reach will remain on Washington’s agenda and for its part China will continue to seek a role as a major development partner.

What is so far missing is any significant Caribbean political intervention on why partnership is preferable to enmity or how the roles of China and the US in development might be reconciled to the region’s advantage.

These remarks were made by Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science, Innovation and Technology Development, Professor Amon Murwira in remarks presented on his behalf by his deputy Raymond Machingura.

Professor Murwira said corporates reaping profits in Zimbabwe, should in return make tangible corporate social responsibility investments across various sectors.

He was making an acceptance speech following a donation of a consignment of 15 beds by Providence Human Capital, a subsidiary of Innscor Africa, to Manicaland State University of Applied Sciences.

“As government, that is the only sure way we are going to realize Vision 2030: Public Private Partnerships. Brick by brick, together, we will build this Zimbabwe,” he said.

He said such investment and collaborative partnerships were key to the realization of Upper Middle Income Country status by 2030.

Strengthening collaborative relationships will unlock value and also ensure benefits cascade to communities- in this case access to a health facility, said Professor Murwira.

“This gesture we are witnessing here is an apt manifestation of business with character. Your sensitivity to issues affecting the communities that you work in, is greatly appreciated and it will not go un-noticed.

“By donating to MSUAS, you have assisted the student and staff here but more so, you have assisted the community which is going to be served by this institution.

Authorities at the University also said corporate sector and individual support is greatly appreciated as they are pre-occupied with adequately equipping the health facility.

Manicaland Provincial minister, Dr Ellen Gwaradzimba said her mandate to develop the province was focused on intensifying new practice of collaboration.

She said through this deliberate approach resulted in significant benefits that have made tremendous impact on the lives of the people we serve.

Dr Gwaradzimba said through these partnerships the province will develop a world class institution and a research beacon of the country at large.

“Our presence here is a testimony of the fruits of strategic collaboration of Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science Innovation and Technology Development and Providence Human Capital.

“We greatly treasure your presence here and look forward to develop our province Manicaland as we strive to create an Upper Middle-Income Economy by year 2030 as championed by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa,” she said.

Dr Gwaradzimba also appealed to the private sector in Manicaland Province, to intensify their PPP engagements, especially with fledgling institutions like Manicaland State University of Applied Sciences.

“This is your institution and this is the time to live indelible imprint on the development of the province at the same time doing business professionally with our institutions.

“It is my prayer that our continued collaboration and synergies underpinned by mutual trust, hard work and respect will culminate in the sustainable development of our Province and our motherland Zimbabwe as a whole,” she said.

Speaking at the handover ceremony, the Chief Executive Officer of Providence Human Capital, Dr Chipo Ndudzo highlighted that the donation was the beginning of a collaborative relationship.

“Our choice of Manicaland State University of Applied Sciences (MSUAS) is a deliberate one. It is a young University, starting from the ground and as a company we need to grow together and this event is the genesis of a strategic relationship,” said Dr Ndudzo.","MUTARE- Achieving national development goals hinges on extending private public partnerships, across all sectors of the economy, a top government official said yesterday.

303,https://pressoffice.mg.co.za/content/P3gQ2MGx1rbqnRD1,"Sun, 08 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Mail and Guardian,Public-private partnerships can place SA back on track,"Central in government’s economic growth plan is to boost the South African economy, cut our extremely high unemployment rate and avoid further downgrades by credit-rating agencies. While trying to achieve these goals, however, the country faces constantly rising public debt, minimal GDP growth, inefficient state-owned enterprises and the devastating effects of state capture, corruption and mismanagement of public funds.



So, as we try to predict what our post-COVID-19 future looks like, let’s consider what realistic, tangible growth prospects are available in South Africa, and whether we’re asking the right questions. For example, do we have the right public-private partnerships in place? What role do we expect government to play in reviving our economy? And what role does the private sector have in this revival?

We need debt – but only with returns

The last decade has seen a rapid – and worrying – rise of public debt. When you put this in a global context, South Africa came out of the 2008 global financial crisis with much more debt in the world market than before. We weren’t alone in this, but in the years since, other countries who had also emerged from 2008’s crisis with significant debt, have managed to grow their economies and compensate for this. In contrast, the South African economy has remained largely stagnant for over a decade now, with growing levels of unemployment, all contributing to rampant debt levels.

As we deal with the economic impact of COVID-19, I wouldn’t pretend to argue with Minister Mboweni about attaining more debt in the process – there is no doubt that it is needed. But, as we accrue this additional debt, we also need to be able to trust that Government will spend this borrowed money productively, in areas where it would have the broadest sustainable impact, and not be squandered or lost, as has unfortunately happened in the past. This is the challenge we face as a country.

We also need to consider whether South Africa will ever reach the point where our revenue growth will exceed the growth in the debt we accrue. Countries need debt to grow – to a point – and debt actually isn’t the enemy in this case.

But the question to be asked is whether citizens will get a return on the incurred debt, that exceeds what we will have to repay to service the debt. As citizens, do we trust that our money is getting used correctly, in sustainable initiatives that are more likely than not going to generate a return in excess of the cost of the debt? And how can we use our country’s resources more strategically, to enable this growth? Strong public-private sector partnerships and an understanding of government’s role versus the private sector’s role come to mind.

Public-private partnerships will work, if done right

There is an ongoing, and yet growing, concern about what we as a country need to do to increase foreign investment in South Africa. Despite the economic challenges we face, investors have their different ambits and are willing to take risks with their money, for the right return. So, a key question for us to ask here is – how do we create the right return for foreign investors, to shore up our international revenue?

There is a lot of talk about public-private sector partnerships playing a role in funding government projects and state-owned enterprises like SAA. Without these initiatives, creating trust and investment into the sustainable enterprises generating returns to all stakeholders, South Africa would be forced to print money to continue to support the economy. However, similar to debt, if this money is not deployed in projects that generate returns in excess of the cost of the impact of this economic support strategy, the same economic spiral will continue.

However, if we could trust the execution of the economic growth initiatives, we’d be in a better position to assess the short- and long-term impact of these various economic strategies. This is where the legacy of state capture and corruption comes to the fore, and our subsequent lack of trust. Edelman’s 2020 Trust Barometer puts South Africa as the country that trusts its government least – just 20% of South Africans expressed faith in government, well below the 49% global average.

The reality is that public-private partnerships can work, and government can regain our trust. We’ve seen this recently in the partnership with our biggest banks to implement the COVID-19 state-backed loan scheme in which banks lent money to organisations in need during the pandemic lockdown. So far, all evidence shows that this has been a productive partnership: instead of attempting to implement the scheme themselves, government sought banks’ expertise, acknowledging they were better placed to perform the credit checks, and gave the banks a guarantee to minimise their risk – allowing them to take the reins and do what they do best.

These are the kind of partnerships South Africa desperately needs to instil trust in future government-led projects, and get our growth back on track. By partnering with the appropriate private organisations, government’s role would be to simply encourage the ease of process, make it as easy as possible to execute on the transaction, and provide some of the necessary financial support in equity and state-backed guarantees.

Take our energy crisis as an example. The job creation potential in trying to help the energy supply situation in this country is immense. Do we trust Eskom to develop a nuclear power plant? Certainly not at the moment, given the legacy created in recent years. It would be easier to place trust in a company that has a reputable history in the industry, with a legacy of great management, executing on a project and delivering a return on the investment.

Trust will unlock opportunity

Having this kind of working partnership with government can unlock significant levels of foreign investment. The problem is it is predicated on the idea that government offers this support and enables the company or consortium to run independently. We need open regulations that enable us to operate this way. If we want to create jobs, there is a lot of opportunity in South Africa to do so, but the existing bureaucratic and unnecessary red tape is getting in the way.

I am encouraged when President Ramaphosa and Minister Mboweni say “we’re at a turning point” and that “now is the time to grow a new South Africa”. However, I have to work harder to trust that the government at large can put politics aside and grow the country towards a new future. Can we achieve what we always set out to achieve, or are we going down the same old roads that lead us nowhere?

To ensure this isn’t the case, government needs to let others in, enter the right private-public partnerships to instil trust, achieve returns on investment, and gather momentum.

As American politician Richard Caroll said: “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will all say: we did it ourselves.” With that in mind, it’s time for government to take a step back, partner with businesses and people that offer the best shot at success, and enable the private sector to do what we do best for the good of the country.","For example, do we have the right public-private partnerships in place?

Indians elated by projections of a post-COVID-19 economic recovery must remember that these projections are predicated on India maintaining an open economy. New Delhi may feel bullish about the recent projections by global investment conglomerates Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that India’s economy will bounce back in 2021 and grow at over 5 percent in 2022.

But this optimism is only partly based on faith in the revival of animal spirits once the economy is reopened after months of closure. Another key assumption, however, is an Indian economy that trades more with the world and offers a level playing field to investors.

Rising protectionism, arbitrary taxation, and excessive regulation that target foreign investment do not project the image of an India that is open and welcoming. These factors could limit India’s potential and hinder growth.

All countries use the “infant industry” argument to protect domestic companies, but one of the legacies of colonial rule in India has been the Indian state’s distrust of foreign corporations. India’s paradox is that the country needs foreign investment and technology, but the state makes it difficult for foreign companies to enter and operate in the Indian market.

Political opposition within India to the entry of large scale foreign enterprises comes from organizations like the Confederation of All India Traders, a group claiming to represent 70 million small retailers, and groups like Swadeshi Jagran Manch that oppose all foreign investment.

This opposition is the reason why India still prevents foreign investment in multi-brand retail.

Therefore, when Walmart first entered India in 2007 it was as part of a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises to set up wholesale stores across the country. A decade later in 2018, Walmart entered the e-commerce market when it bought a majority stake in Flipkart, an Indian start up e-commerce platform.

Amazon entered the Indian market in 2012 and today has 40 odd offices, 67 shipping centers, 1,400 delivery stations, and a work force of more than 60,000 in addition to 155,000 contractors. Today, Amazon and Walmart, through its ownership of Flipkart, together own 70 percent of India’s online shopping market.

However, instead of making it easier India has made it tougher for e-commerce companies like Amazon and Walmart to operate freely.

For a start, they operate with a handicap: as foreign e-commerce entities they cannot own inventory or discount merchandise. As a Bloomberg Quint column noted this is akin to operating “with one hand tied behind their back.”

Further, in December 2018, the Indian government announced Personal Data Protection rules according to which any foreign firm operating in India in the digital and internet arena would have to follow India-specific rules and regulations when it came to data security and privacy of individual data. To build an innovation-centered economy, India needs to allow free flow of data, not restrict it.

These rules affect technology companies like Microsoft, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter, and entertainment companies like Netflix, as well as foreign portfolio investors. But they are especially problematic for e-commerce companies as they restrict their trade practices like offering huge discounts.

Both Amazon and Walmart are also facing anti-trust cases filed by Indian regulators that charge both companies with violating Indian law that forbids foreign e-commerce companies from giving preferential treatment to certain sellers on their platforms.

Another grievance of foreign companies has been the lack of a level playing field for foreign investors. In August 2020, Future Retail announced it was selling its entire business to Reliance. Amazon filed a lawsuit arguing that this was a breach of a contract that Future Retail signed with Amazon in 2019 when Amazon invested $200 million in that company. Amazon won an injunction from a Singapore tribunal, but in November 2020, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), approved the Future Retail-Reliance deal.

If India seeks to attract investment, the message foreign companies receive in India should be one of a level playing field, not that you can only be successful if you partner with large Indian corporations.

Foreign investors seek stability in markets, as well as the political, economic, and social spheres. Stable taxation policies and limited regulatory policies are a key part of this. The Indian state, however, has a strong regulatory streak combined with the notion that the only way to resolve its revenue crunch is to tax companies as much as possible.

One such example is that of retroactive taxation. In 2007, Vodafone purchased a Cayman Islands-based investment firm that held a stake in Hutchinson Essar India Ltd. The Indian government sought capital gains tax from this purchase and the dispute went to India’s Supreme Court where the apex court held that “the government’s tax jurisdiction didn’t extend to the Cayman Islands.”

Instead of accepting this, in 2012, the Indian government changed its tax code “giving itself the power to go after M&A [mergers and acquisitions] deals all the way back to 1962 if the underlying asset was in India.”

Vodafone challenged this retroactive taxation and in 2020 an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague sided with Vodafone and termed India’s tax demand a “breach of fair treatment.”

If New Delhi accepts the decision and moves on, it will help the country regain some of its prestige with foreign investors.

With almost 20 percent of the world’s workforce, the majority of which is unskilled, employment generation and skill development have long been the key focus of every Indian government. This is what led to a manufacturing policy that favors MSMEs (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) instead of large-scale enterprises like in China.

While opposition to foreign companies comes from the mom and pop stores, e-commerce may help solve many problems.

For those who are concerned that companies like Amazon and Walmart will wipe out the small businesses, they would do well to remember that these conglomerates actually learned from their experience in China – and from their Chinese competitor Alibaba – of the benefits of training and supporting SMEs (small and medium enterprises).

This explains why Amazon has set aside $1 billion, of its total $6 billion investment in India, to help MSMEs. In 2019, Walmart announced its Walmart Vriddhi Supplier Development Program (Walmart Vriddhi) to help train 50,000 Indian MSMEs to supply to the global market.

Foreign companies are also more likely to invest in research and development (R&D), which is critical to boosting economic growth rates. Global expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP stands at 2.29 percent, but India spends less than 0.63 percent.

Foreign companies, whether in pharmaceuticals or technology, have demonstrated that they are willing to invest in R&D. In 1998 IBM set up a research lab in India and General Electric’s largest research lab outside of the U.S. is in India.

India has long sought self-sufficiency in the economic arena, but it has often bordered on protectionism. Seeking to build your own brands and ensuring that your domestic companies are not wiped out by foreign competition is a noble goal. Preventing competition within the Indian market and using regulation to benefit indigenous companies is not the way to build a global economy.

Wematter Launched Gravity 2021

Swedish 3D printing firm Wematter revealed its latest Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) additive manufacturing (AM) system. The new Gravity 2021 is the newest iteration in the series of SLS Gravity machines and promises a high degree of automation, alleviating a lot of the user’s work. The novel printer enables an ecosystem that supports design engineers producing durable 3D printed components in an office environment or workshop. Gravity is Wematter’s most advanced product with over 400 unique components and hand-built at the startup’s facility in Linköping.

When it comes to the machine’s hardware, it is the recoater mechanics that have undergone the biggest change. By further encapsulating the construction, no moving parts are worn during operation. Thanks to this, two out of ten steps are also saved during each cleaning of the machine’s build-chamber, reducing the set-up time for each job started.

With the advent of the much-awaited National Education Policy 2020, India’s education system seems to have its foot on the pedal of several reforms in education. Due to be fully implemented by 2035, the 15-year plan proposes to touch and reform every aspect of education from early learning to revitalizing higher education research.

Agile, fast, and scalable - EdTech trends had long fueled global education even before the COVID-19 rendered every other learning mode practically unusable.

The pandemic might just accelerate the leap into revolutionary new education models to close the achievement gap and the digital divide, caused by the sudden onslaught of the digital education wave.

The education ministry is leveraging public-private partnerships with silicon valley giants to leapfrog into the next education revolution. Here are four core initiatives that the education department is front-ending to bring the NEP 2020 vision to fruition:

Integrate Artificial Intelligence Into Active Classroom Learning

A few weeks ago, a heartening video made the rounds on Whatsapp, of a classroom in a remote rural location in Kerala using Augmented Reality to conduct a class on animals to a group of preschool children, as a testimony to how our ecosystem is ever-ready to adapt. Technologies like Augmented Reality, fueled by artificial intelligence, are all set to entirely change learning and teaching experiences by moving into immersive, free-flowing, multisensory 3D worlds, and mainstream curriculum boards in India are certainly watching this trend.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the national level board of education in India for public and private schools, has partnered with IBM to integrate Artificial intelligence in the high-school curriculum for the current academic year.

Developed in collaboration with IBM, Australia’s Macquarie University, and Indian implementation partners – Learning Links Foundation and 1M1B, the AI curriculum structures the course framework around and robust assessment methods for teachers, and problem-based learning outcomes for students.

Envisioned as a part of CBSE’s Social Empowerment through Work Education and Action (SEWA) program, the new curriculum will be introduced in nearly 200 schools across 13 states in India.

Jumpstart Teacher Training For Online Delivery

We might be nearing the end of the traditional classroom, even if there is a semblance of normalcy after COVID-19 because the scaling capacity of online education is simply mindblowing. Is it any surprise that one of the world’s largest silicon valley companies sees a wise investment in this area?

The Central Board of Secondary Education had cemented a partnership with Google as part of its $10 billion investment into India’s teachers. One of the top goals of Google’s initiative is ramping up education, and this partnership aims to support over 1 million teachers to improve their online education delivery across nearly 22000 schools in India.

The company is also spearheading vernacular language education in India.

Build Digital Life Skills

Building 21st-century skills are among the top goals for learning outcomes, and now digital life skills have clambered to the top of the list. Responding to the spike in screen time for kids, the Central Board of Secondary Education has partnered with Facebook to launch a curriculum for digital safety and online well-being of kids, focusing on preparing kids for the future of work in globally seamless and diverse working communities. Teachers are an integral part of this initiative.

Strengthen Virtual Classes

In addition to the efforts of the Union education ministry, several state governments are rapidly scaling up efforts to close the achievement gap. States like Kerala have revitalized the medium of television for learning, while Telangana and Delhi are building dedicated e-resources for online learning. Indian multinationals like Reliance have released the first augmented reality-enabled glasses Jio Glass in India to answer the demand surge for remote communications using video and augmented reality.

In September 2004, India announced a ground-breaking education initiative with former president Abdul Kalam inaugurating the first phase of EduSat, a collaborative project of the Union Ministry of human resource development with ISRO, IGNOU, and several State departments. EduSat was the mega-initiative that would help schools all over the country, through distant classroom education from school level to higher education with satellite-based two-way communication.

16 years on, EduSat has practically vanished from public consciousness, making us wonder:

Would EduSat have been more successful had it been driven by extreme necessity, like the COVID-19 is now driving online education?

At the risk of sounding cliched, the pandemic could indeed be the silver lining that presents us with the inescapable necessity to make the NEP a grand success, turning India into the global knowledge superpower it could genuinely be.","The pandemic might just accelerate the leap into revolutionary new education models to close the achievement gap and the digital divide, caused by the sudden onslaught of the digital education wave.

309,https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2020/11/taiwan-hospitals-partnerships/,"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Taiwan Business TOPICS,Hospital Partnerships Stay Strong Through Pandemic,"Amid the disruption caused by COVID-19, Taiwan’s hospitals have turned to online tools to maintain valuable partnerships with Southeast Asian countries forged under the New Southbound Policy.

As one of the flagship programs of the Taiwan government’s New Southbound Policy (NSP), the One Country, One Center (1C1C) project enables Taiwan to share its vaunted healthcare expertise with its regional neighbors. However, the onset of COVID-19 this year has presented a serious challenge to the project by curtailing international travel and in-person exchanges. Rather than halting progress on this initiative, the Taiwanese hospitals involved in 1C1C have continued their work by moving largely to an internet-based model.

Launched in June 2018, the 1C1C program is now in its third year and covers seven NSP countries, linking them with eight hospitals in Taiwan. National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) focuses on Indonesia, National Cheng Kung University Hospital serves India, Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) works with Thailand, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital serves Malaysia. Meanwhile, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital focuses on the Philippines, Veterans General Hospital and National Yang-Ming University serve Vietnam, while Shinkong Wu Ho-su Memorial Hospital partners with Myanmar.

Although 1C1C was initiated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the program is run by the Health and Welfare NSP Coordination Office at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), which oversees and manages each hospital-country partnership. Under CIER’s supervision, the program seeks to fulfill four main objectives: capacity building through training medical personnel, strengthening epidemic control by creating cooperative networks, establishing market connectivity, and cultivating supply chains involving Taiwan firms.

Each 1C1C hospital provides medical training and business matching services to its partner institutions. Despite the program’s name, multiple Taiwanese hospitals may work with the same country, making a broader range of expertise available while the designated partner hospital acts as the main coordinator for other participating institutions.

For instance, while NTU Hospital (NTUH) works with nine hospitals in its partner country, Indonesia, it also cooperates with health institutions in Vietnam and the Philippines. CCH focuses chiefly on Thailand but is also active in Myanmar and Indonesia.

The work that Taiwanese hospitals are undertaking under the NSP often builds on their previous experience in Southeast Asian countries. For example, NTUH helped Vietnamese institutions perform their first liver transplant in 2009 and has also been cooperating with Indonesian hospitals since 2014 in training doctors and holding symposiums. CCH has operated free clinics in northern Thailand with a local partner since 2009.

Participating in the 1C1C program enables hospitals to expand on their involvement with partner countries. In the Philippines, NTUH has helped perform extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, a method of providing an artificial heart during periods when patients are experiencing severe respiratory difficulties or while undergoing heart transplants. Veterans General Hospital has assisted Vietnamese institutions in performing several types of operations, including liver transplants and cardiovascular surgery.

These exchanges had come to a halt after the outbreak of COVID-19 due to restrictions on international travel. In response, participating hospitals have started holding web-based seminars, mostly focusing on COVID-19.

Among the webinars NTUH has conducted was one explaining Taiwan’s COVID-19 management, while others covered antibody testing and critical care for COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CCH has also hosted webinars on COVID-19, including prevention and treatment of the virus and the potential use of alternative and traditional medicine.

“Webinars benefit us as well as our partners as they allow us to overcome geographic restrictions and communicate more effectively with diverse speakers,” says Nina Kao, CEO of the Overseas Medical Mission Center at CCH. “We even ran a Facebook live stream while the seminars were happening and uploaded the videos to our official YouTube platform for people who could not join in time.” On the other hand, she notes, they have also faced some challenges with this new format, such as unstable internet connection in the less-developed or remote areas of partnering countries.

Chu Chia-yu, CEO of NTUH’s International Medical Service Center, says that his hospital holds three to four webinars a week with hospitals in Mongolia, Indonesia, and Guatemala. “I hope that next year we can travel to other countries and have face-to-face meetings,” he says. “There will be more meetings conducted over the internet, but we still need in-person workshops for hands-on training.”

Following a policy change last month enabling overseas medical trainees to come to Taiwan once again, hospitals such as NTUH and CCH will resume hosting visiting doctors from Southeast Asia. They will need to undergo two weeks of government-mandated quarantine and one week of self-health management upon their arrival, and their training period has been extended from the previous one month to three months.

Playing matchmaker

The second major component of the 1C1C program is to match Taiwanese medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies with interested buyers in the NSP countries, with the Taiwan hospitals acting as the intermediary. This system allows the companies to broaden their market reach while also bolstering Taiwan’s medical reputation among NSP countries. The hospitals and companies also hold forums and attend exhibitions in those countries.

“In the past, the relationship between hospitals and companies was not as partners but as buyers and sellers,” says Roy Chun Lee, Deputy Executive Director of the Taiwan WTO and RTA Center at CIER. “But through the NSP, we’re pushing hospitals to serve as a spearhead and lead trade activity. The hospitals and companies have to create a partnership.”

CIER brings together the hospitals and companies based on relevant factors. “We determined which company was interested in which country and tried to bring the right person to the right centers,” says Lee. “We encouraged hospitals to share information with interested suppliers. In 2019, you could see there was a lot of transformation.”

The export of Taiwan-made medical and pharmaceutical products to NSP countries has grown rapidly in recent years, raising the growth rate of overall exports to those countries. This trend has continued this year as the pandemic has raised demand for medical products.

Taiwan’s exports to the seven 1C1C countries fell by 12.6% in 2019, partly due to the US-China trade dispute, while exports of medical and pharmaceutical goods increased by 7.5%, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In the first half of 2020, exports to the 1C1C countries fell by 12.3%, while exports of medical and pharmaceutical goods rose by 13.6%.

Lee explains that the NSP raised the profile of partnering countries among Taiwan’s suppliers and vice versa. “Our suppliers were originally not really interested in or didn’t understand the potential of Southeast Asian countries,” he says. “This program actually generated interest by sharing some of the risks and removing some of the earlier uncertainty.”

Among the pandemic-related products made by Taiwanese companies are antibody rapid tests, electronic stethoscopes, surgical face masks, and personal protective equipment.

The program is not without its challenges. The lack of official diplomatic relations between Taiwan and NSP countries is a complicating factor.

“During this COVID-19 pandemic, many of our collaborators in Indonesia asked for help in providing tests, masks, and PPE (personal protective equipment),” says Chu of NTUH. “We can’t provide that without government relationships.” While NTUH was not able to send its partners masks directly, the Taiwan government later sent shipments of masks and PPE to various countries, including those in Southeast Asia.

Chu says that these partners also asked Taiwan to supply vaccines – not just for COVID-19, but for malaria and dengue fever as well. “We cannot provide these vaccines without their government’s approval,” he says.

Nevertheless, some interaction between the health ministries of Taiwan and the NSP countries does take place. “Health ministries are professional ministries and less intertwined with foreign policy and international politics. It’s relatively easy for officials such as deputy ministers to visit their counterparts and meet with their officials,” says Lee.

Another challenge is understanding the local needs of partner countries while also making them aware of Taiwan’s healthcare strengths. “We have a lot of good stuff but it’s not necessarily matching the demand from Thailand or Indonesia or India,” says CIER’s Lee.

“For example, Taiwan’s universal healthcare scheme is one of the best, but not many people outside of Taiwan understand its advantages or the factors underpinning this success,” he says. “If they don’t understand, they won’t request further information and they don’t really know what Taiwan can do.”

Lee notes that Indonesia is building its own national health insurance scheme, but that Taiwan isn’t clued in on what they need to implement it. “For example, do they need a cloud medical system or smart medicine system? We don’t know what their exact priorities are. We have started picking this up, but we need a much broader understanding,” he says.

Despite the challenges, 1C1C has been a relative success and there are plans to widen its scope to cover more countries in Southeast Asia, as well as to increase the number of participating Taiwanese hospitals. That expansion will likely happen in 2022, when the program’s second four-year phase begins and a new budget is allocated.

Lee expresses optimism about the project’s future progress. “Out of the NSP’s five flagship programs, I’m confident the medical and healthcare program is at the top in achieving the intended goals of the NSP by creating bilateral awareness and understanding through soft power,” he says.","National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) focuses on Indonesia, National Cheng Kung University Hospital serves India, Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) works with Thailand, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital serves Malaysia.
Meanwhile, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital focuses on the Philippines, Veterans General Hospital and National Yang-Ming University serve Vietnam, while Shinkong Wu Ho-su Memorial Hospital partners with Myanmar.
Each 1C1C hospital provides medical training and business matching services to its partner institutions.
For instance, while NTU Hospital (NTUH) works with nine hospitals in its partner country, Indonesia, it also cooperates with health institutions in Vietnam and the Philippines.
This system allows the companies to broaden their market reach while also bolstering Taiwan’s medical reputation among NSP countries."

Policymakers, business leaders, development partners and scholars will discuss how to create strategic partnerships between the youth, governments, private sector and the civil society at the 26th Nigerian Economic Summit starting on Monday.

The focus of the discussion will be to build resilience for Nigeria’s households, businesses and the general economy.

The Summit with the theme “Building Partnerships for Resilience” is organised by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group and the Ministry of Finance, Budget and Economic Planning.

The 26th Nigerian Economic Summit will provide a robust engagement platform for participants who will deliberate on topical issues especially those related to recent developments; and in particular the need to amplify the voice of the youth and the issues they have raised in the past few weeks.

“It has become apparent that the level of investments in the youth will determine the pace of economic growth, development, and security of the nation.

“Governments at all levels, especially the sub-nationals and all stakeholders need to refocus youth development programmes from mere prescriptive employment drives to improve the wealth creation capabilities of the youth and find ways to ensure that empowerment policies and programmes adopt a broader and more holistic framework.”

The organisers said a number of sessions and design workshops at the 26th Nigerian Economic Summit will focus on the youth and how their potentials can be harnessed for economic growth and development while highlighting the role of Nigeria’s sub-nationals as frontiers for national development.

Some of the youth sessions at NES#26 include Unlocking the Productive Potential of Nigerian Youth, Empowering Nigeria’s Youth, Our Youth Bulge – Risk or Opportunity and Rethinking Sub-National Competitiveness amongst others.

Some of the speakers at the sessions will include the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland QC, who will deliver a special address, Chairman of First Bank Nigeria, Ibukun Awosika, and CEO of Connected Development, Hamzat Lawal, amongst others.

Furthermore, some of the panellists that will be speaking at the “Opening Plenary: Nigeria’s Turning Point” include Kayode Fayemi, Governor of Ekiti State; Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State; and Funke Opeke, CEO, MainOne.

Other speakers include Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair GAVI; and a former Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, who will be speaking at an all-female plenary session: “Women in Leadership: Towards the Global Goals.”

Discussions at NES#26 will be anchored on three pillars – Collaboration, Execution and Impact that will be dimensioned across five sub-themes: Mapping the Future; New Trends, New Opportunities, New Horizons; Embracing Technology and Innovation; Building Resilience and Charting the Path to Recovery.

The 26th Nigerian Economic Summit is expected to be a ‘Big Conversation for Action’ that combines in-person and virtual dialogues for stakeholders across the civil society, public and private sector to reflect on the state of the Nigerian economy and rethink the country’s economic fundamentals.","ADVERTISEMENTPolicymakers, business leaders, development partners and scholars will discuss how to create strategic partnerships between the youth, governments, private sector and the civil society at the 26th Nigerian Economic Summit starting on Monday.

According to Statistics South Africa, the agriculture sector expanded by 15.1% and was the only positive contributor to the country’s GDP (gross domestic product) in the second quarter of 2020.

Khakhu Mutheiwana, who runs the Vhaluvhu Farm near Soekmekaar in Limpopo credits the partnerships she has made in the agriculture sector for the success of her farm. She also says partnerships such as these will help the industry stay afloat and continue to positively contribute to the country.

One such partnership she has established is with McCain, which started in 2018 – when they subsidised her labour and land preparation costs in the financial year, Mutheiwana explains. “McCain’s intervention enabled my farm’s continuity as we strived to become self-sustainable.”

She continues that technical advice is extremely beneficial to upcoming or emerging farmers who, like herself, do not come from a farming background. “McCain’s standard contract comes with access to technical advice and since our partnership, I have gained valuable potato and sweet potato production knowledge from the company’s technical advisory programme.”

McCain, one of the largest suppliers of frozen foods in South Africa, has three commercially operating farms across three different growing regions in the country, providing rewarding employment opportunities for local people and stimulating rural economies through the purchase of local goods and services. McCain is the largest employer in Delmas, a small maize farming town in Mpumalanga, and an integral part of the community.

Farms bring job opportunities in the community

Mutheiwana, who started farming in 2016 after growing up in a family that farms, currently employs 35 seasonal workers in the Soekmekaar area. The farm started out growing cabbages and butternut. However, as Mutheiwana grew into the business and understood agriculture better, she realised that potatoes were a staple in South Africa. She decided to start growing them on a small scale.

‘Farming is a capital intensive business to start from scratch, and food production can never be a one-person business.’

Mutheiwana notes that while farms play an essential role in creating job opportunities in the community and inspire other young people, especially females, to get into farming, it is not without its challenges. “Factors such as climate change come with diseases and various pest infections. More research and advanced farming technologies will accelerate South Africa’s global competitiveness in terms of agriculture. On a smaller scale, challenges like access to credit, transport, storage and infrastructure make it difficult for upcoming farmers to participate in commercial agriculture.”

She continues that covid-19 did not only impact the industry as a whole but certainly her day-to-day activities on the farm. “Covid-19 did not only inconvenience or slow down daily activities on the farm but came with a high price tag in terms of precautions and restrictions based on government regulations that must be met for optimal operation of the farm.”

Food security is everyone’s business

A decline in farmers in South Africa has meant an impact on food security in the country, with the number of commercial farmers in the country set to drop from 40 000 in 2011 to 15 000 by 2026. The loss of farmers would also lead to job losses in rural areas, where farming and agriculture is the most significant employer.

Mutheiwana says that the issue of food security should be everyone’s business with the government at the forefront. “There is a huge gap between the number of new and emerging farmers versus retired or retiring farmers. Farming is a capital intensive business to start from scratch, and food production can never be a one-person business. It required partnerships and most importantly, active involvement from the government.”

She continues, “We cannot ignore our country’s history. With the majority of us coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, it becomes impossible to venture into farming without valuable partnerships to assist not only with pecuniary but with technical knowledge as well. There are great opportunities for young people in farming, but the active participation of the government in assisting aspiring and existing young farmers is what our country needs.”

Gaining valuable production knowledge

While food security and job opportunities are key factors in agriculture, Mutheiwana encourages sustainable farming practices for the prosperity of the industry. “In our farm, we utilise contour ploughing to prevent soil erosion. We also rotate crops to promote healthier soil and improve pest control. We also integrate livestock and crops for the availability of abundant manure fertilisers in our fields.”

When it comes to the future of the Vhaluvhu Farm, Mutheiwana cites her short-term goals as being able to acquire equipment instead of hiring. “We are lucky to have sufficient water on the farm and a sizable portion of arable land. We are currently only using 30% of the farm. We intend to gradually increase capacity by installing further irrigation systems and opening new fields to increase production in terms of tonnage,” she concludes.","The agricultural sector plays an important role in South Africa by providing job and food security to many people in the country, particularly those in rural communities.
Khakhu Mutheiwana, who runs the Vhaluvhu Farm near Soekmekaar in Limpopo credits the partnerships she has made in the agriculture sector for the success of her farm.
She also says partnerships such as these will help the industry stay afloat and continue to positively contribute to the country.

Middlesbrough defender Marc Bola.

At the other end, there is still a lack of cutting edge and attacking firepower, yet Boro created enough chances to win this match, with Blackburn continuously producing last-ditch blocks to keep the visitors out.

The stats show Boro recorded 20 shots at goal, yet only three hit the target.

Former stopper Aynsley Pears was awarded Blackburn’s man of the match and made one fine save to keep out Marcus Tavernier’s deflected effort.

Yet there were other chances to score, as Dael Fry sent a couple of late headers wide and Britt Assombalonga failed to hit the target.

Still, the fact Boro were creating opportunities and dominated large parts of the match is encouraging.

Warnock’s side have switched between a back three and a back four this season depending on their opponents.

The Boro boss likes his side to match opponents up and go man-to-man, which is part of the reason behind their defensive improvements.

Against Blackburn, Warnock opted for a 4-3-3 formation, selecting Anfernee Dijksteel and Marc Bola as the full-backs, with Djed Spence and Hayden Coulson in front of them.

The quartet were full of energy on the flanks and often interchanged positions seamlessly as Boro transitioned from defence to attack, or vise versa.

For the second match running, Coulson and Bola linked up particularly well on the left, with the former now looking back to somewhere near his best after a tricky spell under Warnock.

A lot of credit must go to Bola too, who looked well out of his depth after arriving from Blackpool last season but now appears a real asset.

In the first half, talented Blackburn playmaker Harvey Elliott, who is on loan from Liverpool, found it difficult to make an impact as Bola kept the teenager under wraps.

It wasn’t until the second half, when Elliott switched to the left, that the midfielder found space to deliver a low cross which Ben Brereton and Sam Gallagher were close to converting.

That was probably the best chance for both sides and the only moment where Boro noticeably switched off at the back.

The squad is young and low on numbers, but does appear to have a good mix of youth and experience.

Jonny Howson, George Saville and Paddy McNair have been praised by Warnock for the way they lead by example, while goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli can always be heard repeatedly barking out instructions.

Up front, club captain Assombalonga is working his socks off for the team and is a big influence in the dressing room, even if he would like more goals to his name.

A goal was the only thing missing from Boro’s performance at Ewood Park, yet Warnock’s side continue to make progress.

(Photo by Ernesto Lozano, PASO Colombia, One Earth Future)

Emilse was first displaced from her home in Colombia when her father was killed in 1981. Her family resettled and farmed rice and sesame, but ongoing violence in the country forced them to move again in 2002. Lacking options to support her family’s livelihood, she joined tens of thousands of other displaced people in growing coca, a crop eventually processed into cocaine and sold to violent criminal groups.

Fourteen years later, in 2016, a deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) not only brought peace, but also opened the door to a new approach in dealing with the problem of illicit crops. The agreement called for a program that would provide incentives to farmers who volunteered to replace their illicit crops with legal ones.

It quickly became evident , however, that scaling the program quickly enough would require more than just government intervention. So the government turned to an emerging trend in international partnerships: civil society joining business to collaboratively solve social problems. In late 2019, it established a partnership between the PASO Colombia program (part of the US-based One Earth Future Foundation), the UN Multipartner Trust Fund for Sustaining Peace in Colombia, and local businesses. This partnership created a pipeline for economic support, agriculture extension training, and market development. And ultimately, it gave Emilse and others new opportunities to grow food crops that support both their families and peacebuilding in the region.

This illustrates one way government agencies and other organizations that work internationally are starting to change how they operate. When core institutions of the post-war world, such as the United Nations and the World Bank, came into being in the 1940s and 50s, an average of four international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) formed for every formal, state-based international organization. The ratio has risen sharply in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. At the same time, governments and international governmental organizations have become increasingly aware of the complexity and interconnectedness of many international problems, and have realized that solving complex problems requires collaborative work from all sectors. This is especially true in the case of peacebuilding—arguably the ultimate complex problem. Organizations like the World Bank , the United Nations, and the US government have acknowledged that military force alone can never achieve peace; rather, peace requires multiple interventions that address different aspects of instability.

But of course, working across sectors is challenging. An assessment of civil coordination between NATO civilian and military organizations in Afghanistan, for example, bluntly concluded: “The importance of a comprehensive approach was recognized, but one did not materialize.” The US State Department’s “Stabilization Assistance Review” report identified consistent failures of coordination arising from issues with strategy and process, and assessments of UN work have argued that there are so many uncoordinated groups operating alongside each other that they should best be conceptualized as “organized anarchy.” These assessments have identified problems such as misaligned incentives; tensions that occur when people are trained to think in one way, then asked to incorporate other perspectives (such as a development worker asked to think about security dynamics); and resistance to hierarchy.

We need new processes to unlock the potential of multisector coordination. Over the past several years, our organizations, One Earth Future and Partnerships for Social Change, have been working with UN agencies and other groups to develop a model called Innovation in Partnerships. Used in the recent UN75 Global Governance Forum, it led to 20 new partnerships to support progress toward the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It identifies partners and engages them in dialogue that leads to commitments to action, and is based on three guiding principles: shared goals, open acknowledgement of differing incentives, and collective impact strategies that reduce or remove hierarchy and centralized strategy. In practice, organizations have to manage achieving all of these simultaneously while maintaining an emphasis on action to move the goals of the partnership forward. This can be a challenge when the demands of the different principles collide, but it’s nevertheless possible.

Principle One: Shared Goals

It’s important that partners have a shared understanding of the goal they are working toward. Complex systems by definition resist linear theories of change, so a collective response must agree on a strategic end goal, then monitor collective performance against it.

This is easy to say but difficult to do in practice. That’s because the organizations that participate affect how the group defines the goal, and the negotiation of the goal is itself a political action that can generate winners and losers. At the same time, understanding the intended goal can help identify who needs to participate. Our model thus starts with a convener or project leader who says, “This is the problem we want to address.” For example, a project may form around the need to combat tax evasion as a cause of inequality, as the Good Global Citizens project does. Stating the problem lays the foundation for identifying who is well-positioned to play a direct role in solving or addressing it. For example, participants in the tax evasion project include NGOs interested in transparency and accountability, big financial institutions like the International Monetary Funds, and international entities that work on financial flows like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. From there, the initial community can refine the goal to something discrete.

Principle Two: Open Acknowledgment of Differing Incentives

Partners often agree at the strategic level that they share the same ultimate goal but don’t adapt lower-level, internal decision-making processes (such as resource allocation or measurement) to meet that goal. A related, but often unstated issue in international contexts is the fact that state and INGO home offices impose different pressures on collaborators and incentivize them in different ways. Ignoring these differences—or worse, assuming they don’t exist—is a recipe for misalignment and often failure.

Partners should formally share their incentives and restrictions during project planning. Some could be reluctant for political or strategic reasons to release information showing that the project failed to meet its goals. Knowing that constraint upfront allows other partners to weigh their strategy against it, and help shape the partnership’s goals and information-sharing practices accordingly. Obviously, discussing these issues openly requires a high degree of trust between participants, so sometimes it’s most effective for the project lead to hold quiet, bilateral discussions with some participants to understand what they’re comfortable disclosing.

Principle Three: Models of Collective Organization That Reduce Hierarchy

One reason for the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of the 2001-2014 NATO partnership in Afghanistan was the US military’s push for a unified decision-making structure that European partners and civilian agencies resisted. This illustrates a challenge with approaches that try to develop a unified hierarchy: Relatively few partners are willing or able to surrender their autonomy. And so collaborative projects face a dilemma. Without some structure for developing collaborative approaches, there’s no real coordination, yet overly restrictive or hierarchical approaches reduce the willingness of other groups to participate.

An alternate approach, explored in previous SSIR articles on leadership and capacity building, is based on network administrative structures that maximize information-sharing and improve the ability of participating organizations to make the best decisions they can. Participating organizations are accountable to their own commitments through public awareness of those commitments, but there is no formal mechanism for forcing compliance. This can work well in small, limited partnerships, as well as more complex, cross-sector partnerships.

Partners should develop information-sharing mechanisms that inform each other’s decisions. They should share their independent plans and commitments, and collectively track and discuss activities. Some groups may update their progress and track what they have achieved via an online platform; others may simply hold regular meetings. Partnerships sometimes form working groups to address specific tasks or participate in global events to showcase progress and build momentum. Whatever paths partners take, it’s important to remember that maximizing each partner’s individual priorities as part of the collective whole encourages ongoing participation.

Implementation in Action

As we mentioned at the beginning, it’s important to balance the multiple, competing priorities that emerge from these principles with a bias toward action. Partners should work to resolve tensions between the different principles as they go, and—while maintaining an emphasis on network structures—ensure that there is some form of accountability tied to next steps.

The Partnership Dialogue for Connectivity—a project emerging from the recent UN75 Global Forum that we facilitated and that aims to improve the ability of people everywhere to access broadband connectivity—offers a good, step-by-step example of how to implement the process.

1. Identify a project lead and an initial project scope. The distributed nature of the network means the project lead has no formal authority and is therefore not the project manager. Instead, the project lead organizes the initial participants and the problem domain, then works iteratively to develop the final group of participants and problem scope.

In our discussions with UN entities as a part of the Global Forum, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) expressed a desire to develop a partnership to improve digital connectivity. As a body of the UN focused on improving information and communications technologies, it made sense for ITU to act as the project lead for the Partnership Dialogue for Connectivity. It had the knowledge and connections to set the scope and identify who to include in the first round of outreach.

2. Identify and solicit participants. Next, the project lead reaches out to potential partners across a variety of sectors and holds a scoping meeting. During this first meeting, participants finalize their understanding of the basic problem the project will address and devise an agreement in principle about what the basic solution looks like. Because this approach can easily lead to the accidental exclusion of important voices, groups should carefully assess who’s missing from the room and take steps to fill any gaps.

With the Partnership Dialogue for Connectivity, the ITU reached out to a range of companies, civil society organizations, and governmental groups to gauge their interest and formulate the initial group. Partners included Facebook, the Global System for Mobile Communications Association, Microsoft, SpaceX, the UN Global Compact, UNICEF, European Middle East, and Africa Satellite Operators Association, Alphabet’s Loon, and the World Economic Forum. The group framed its problem statement in terms of how COVID-19 made digital connectivity a condition for participating in the global economy, and the need to reinforce the digital infrastructure to allow access to telework, e-commerce, remote learning, and telemedicine. This first meeting helped develop a shared, concrete goal and develop some initial discussions around differing incentives.

3. Suspend planning to allow for shifting participants. In addition to defining the problem, the first meeting helps clarify what kinds of capacities and skills the project needs to succeed and whether any organizations don’t want to participate in the ultimate project. An interim period between this and the second meeting allows the project lead to talk to participants bilaterally about their interest and who else needs to participate. It also gives the project leader an opportunity to discuss participants’ personal and institutional needs, separate from the strategic goals of the project, and to bring in new partners.

In the case of the Partnership Dialogue for Connectivity, nobody dropped out between the first and second meetings, and nobody needed to join—but partnerships shouldn’t necessarily expect that result. This stage is important to filling in gaps and ensuring that the right partners are engaged.

4. Hold a second meeting that culminates in a formal agreement. In this meeting, participants share their personal and institutional interests and limitations, and volunteer actions they can take. With better information about what others are doing to solve the problem, partners can make better decisions about how they can contribute.

With the Partnership Dialogue for Global Connectivity, participants committed jointly and collaboratively to work together and with other willing partners to improve digital connectivity on a global scale. They also agreed on next steps, such as developing a shared methodology to build infrastructure for digital connectivity. As things progress, partners will share information about planned activities, target areas, and priorities via a central platform, and then jointly determine a way forward based on overlapping interests and best practices.

5. Execute the plan. Once partners have created an agreement about what they will do, the project lead works with the participants to make sure the plans are detailed and include target areas, country representation, milestones, budgets, and desired outcomes.

The Partnership Dialogue for Global Connectivity undertook the first four steps of this process in the four months leading up to the UN75 Global Governance Forum. It’s now moving into a more active stage; participants are developing a work plan to promote connectivity in specific areas while sharing best practices and knowledge with other partners. As the partners execute these plans over the next three years, the ITU will measure the overall impact of their work on connectivity, including progress against the Sustainable Development Goals.

6. Accelerate, broaden, and scale. Some partnerships are sufficient to achieve the shared goal from the beginning, but as partnerships go on, groups often realize they need new partners or have opportunities to accomplish more than they set out to do. As a project matures, partners will also identify new ways to work. While this stage still lies ahead for the Partnership Dialogue for Global Connectivity, the group will likely bring in new, in-country partners and INGOs to expand connectivity.

While the challenges the Colombian government faced in transitioning farmers away from coca production are very different from the post-COVID, digital connectivity challenges the United Nations is facing, both problems have lacked any single-sector solution and have needed groups to work together in a cohesive fashion. Thanks to the partnership between the Colombian government, civil society groups, and local businesses, Emilse is now one of more than 1,500 women and 400 men growing legal crops as part of a new and growing local economy. And while the digital connectivity partnership that emerged from the Global Forum is just beginning its implementation phase, it’s on track to expand connectivity to 10 regions, providing new physical and administrative infrastructure to improve access to online communications. Both partnerships have been guided by principles that most other international partnerships are missing or that commonly break down over time. By working through shared goals, differing incentives, and issues related to hierarchy, international partnerships tackling complex problems have the potential to move beyond agreements that sound good in principle to coordinated, effective, real-world action.","So the government turned to an emerging trend in international partnerships: civil society joining business to collaboratively solve social problems.

Targets for 2030 include providing universal health coverage (UHC) and eliminating the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Such an agenda would be a monumental feat even under the best of circumstances, and experts now worry the novel coronavirus pandemic will put the achievement of these health goals — and the rest of the SDGs — in jeopardy.

“COVID-19 is driving us even farther off-course from achieving the vision and promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said at the World Health Summit, an annual global health conference.

Beyond the direct risks presented by the coronavirus, measures to control its spread are disrupting global and local health systems — putting millions at risk and hindering progress on health-related SDGs. Still, even in the midst of the pandemic, we’ve seen public and private partners achieve significant gains to advance public health. Africa was declared free of wild polio in August, after a lengthy vaccination and surveillance program led by governments, multilateral health bodies, and private-sector supporters. And last month, the leaders of 194 countries signed on to a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health threat.

“We’re at a critical moment,” notes Trey Watkins, executive vice president of global health and corporate responsibility at GCI Health, and former health advisor in the U.N. Secretary-General’s office. “On one hand, we see incredible progress. But on the other, COVID-19 has reiterated that we have to evolve our ways of working and collaborating if we are to truly address some of the world’s biggest challenges.”

A similar message rang clear from experts at the World Health Summit in October: The piecemeal, largely siloed efforts so far employed to advance public health are no longer enough. A truly collaborative, global effort is needed not only to combat the pandemic, but also to ensure it does not erase decades of progress around health and well-being.

“Collaboration and innovation are the key ingredients to support countries’ efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate progress toward the SDGs,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at the Summit.

This cannot be the sole responsibility of the public sector or multilateral bodies such as the WHO. Participation from the private sector — particularly companies in the healthcare industry — is critical, Guterres added. “We need global solidarity every step of the way,” he said. “We must join together as governments, the private sector, civil society and all partners.”

Public-private partnerships can strengthen multilateral efforts, even when government support is found wanting

Expert calls have not fallen entirely on deaf ears, as a record number of collaborative funding and programming initiatives launched in recent months to coordinate a global pandemic response.

The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, for example, brings global partners together in a first-of-its-kind effort to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

For the first time, the WHO opened up funding channels to private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world through the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, created in partnership with the U.N. Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation. The fund had raised or committed more than $238 million — and disbursed over $220 million — as of November.

“Financial accessibility is one of the biggest barriers to health, both in the U.S. and abroad, particularly for marginalized groups,” said Loyce Pace, executive director of the Global Health Council and member of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's COVID-19 Advisory Board. “Financial access and inclusion has to evolve from traditional corporate responsibility or philanthropy to a better way particularly in the age of COVID-19.”

To fulfill their responsibility to meet the moment, healthcare companies in particular must combine their capital with relationship-building that allows for the sharing of innovation and resources, both locally and at scale.

For example, the Medtronic Foundation is leveraging its own network of nonprofit and government partners to maximize impact and scale during this historic time.

""We’ve looked at how we can support the public-sector response through nonprofit partners that have existing relationships with governments,” Jessica Daly, director of global health for the Medtronic Foundation, told TriplePundit. “But we also looked at scale: How could we really contribute to efforts that were happening at scale?”

In addition to pledging capital to the WHO Solidarity Response Fund and the CDC Foundation, the Medtronic Foundation partnered with the WHO and CDC directly to place and activate funds in areas at greatest need. “It's been important for us to plug into existing platforms and then to also support coordinated public-sector actions so that we could be complementary and leverage the strength of our resources,” Daly said.

A six-year veteran of the Medtronic Foundation, Daly previously led partnerships for the CDC in areas such as HIV/AIDS prevention and the Ebola crisis in West Africa, so she understands what’s possible when the public and private sectors break down silos and come together. “I've seen from both perspectives — the perspective of the private sector and the perspective of the public sector — how much they need each other and the power of a strong collaboration, which is sometimes difficult to achieve and easier said than done,” Daly told us.

“In the case of an emergency or a pandemic, you need to be able to move with speed and agility,” she continued. “Sometimes the public sector is constrained in their ability to act quickly and to be nimble and flexible with their resources. At the same time, those simple, flexible, private-sector resources can't reach the scale and sustainability that the public sector can. When these are able to come together, it really shows the power of collaboration.”

From response to recovery: Closing gaps in the healthcare system

Calls to “build back better” from the COVID-19 pandemic have spurred national efforts to expand the social safety net and begin to decarbonize economies in the fight against climate change. Similar rallying cries are beginning to spread across the healthcare sector, as stakeholders call for recovery plans that root out and address existing shortfalls within healthcare systems.

In markets including the U.S., for example, the pandemic has laid bare existing disparities which leave broad segments of the population — namely rural communities, people of color and those with lower incomes — underserved. Overall, people of color continue to be more likely to contract COVID-19 and experience adverse health outcomes, and the American Medical Association — the largest group of doctors in the U.S. — recently recognized racism as a “public health threat.”

“COVID, in and of itself, is revealing the fractured way which people of color and underserved populations are experiencing healthcare,” Daly said. “Even with a lot of really well-intended efforts, we still haven't been able to make the progress we want to make in reducing disparities. This is where I think the public sector is such a critical collaborator with nonprofit organizations and the private sector …. because we need to make more progress than we've made.”

Similarly, on a global scale, some fear that so-called “vaccine nationalism” — countries refusing to participate in vaccine collaborations or taking steps to hoard vaccines for their own people — could hinder global efforts. “Let me be clear: Vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it,” Ghebreyesus said at the World Health Summit. “The only way to recover faster, be it lives or livelihoods, is to recover together.”

Pace of the Global Health Council agreed. “Who gets treated? Who will have access to treatments and later to a vaccine? This is a very important conversation, and there’s a real opportunity for companies to step out and lead in that way,” Pace said.

At the World Health Assembly, an annual meeting of global health ministers held in November, Dr. Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to Ghebreyesus, noted key points of progress stemming from the global Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator — including the development of rapid tests and life-saving treatments. But he noted that access differs widely across nations and within communities, warning the discrepancies could worsen without “urgent action” to close the ACT-Accelerator’s $4.5 billion financing gap.

The ways in which companies, nonprofits and communities come together on a fix could prove to be a testing ground for future collaborations around public health, and stakeholders already have examples to follow.

“The world is changing, and communities are demanding more of us than ever,” Watkins reiterated. “In the face of nationalism and inequity, we must unite in solidarity and purpose to nurture meaningful engagements and identify sustainable solutions.”

Every team has their go-to players when it comes to creating goals. The old reliables who set them up and put them away week after week.

Some players just click and build up a rapport. They’re always able to find each other in dangerous areas, as if connected by a telekinetic link. Footballers like David Beckham and Dwight Yorke, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry, or Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.

Which double teams are connecting the most in the current Premier League campaign?

Top five Premier League assist to goal partnerships so far:

Harry Kane to Son Heung-min – 8

It’s the strike partnership that has taken the Premier League by storm this season. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have been in sensational form in the first 11 matches of the campaign, scoring a combined 18 goals.

That’s not overly surprising given the quality of the two players. But what is surprising is that Son is Tottenham’s top scorer with ten goals, while Kane has turned provider. The striker is the top assist maker in the league right now with ten goals created and eight of those have been for Son alone.

Last season the top assist to goal scorer partnership was Adama Traore to Raul Jiménez with seven, which makes the Spurs duo’s current tally all the more remarkable.

Son is no longer the ‘support act’ – he is undoubtedly Spurs’ headliner

Lucas Digne to Dominic Calvert-Lewin – 3

Another linkup that has flourished this season and will continue to do so is that between Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lucas Digne, with the Frenchman setting up three of his teammate’s 11 goals this season.

Everton have consistently been trying to get the ball wide left so Digne can use his excellent crossing and passing skills to set up Calvert-Lewin in the penalty area. All of the Englishman’s goals have come from inside the box, while six of them have come as a result of shots in the six-yard box.

Calvert-Lewin is repeatedly showing up right in front of goal to score, so the combination of his poaching and Digne’s incisive passing is a huge weapon for the Toffees. It’s unsurprising, then, that they have struggled to open up the opposition when Digne is missing, with the team scoring just two goals in the three games he’s missed.

The pair have already equalled Everton’s top assist to goal scorer partnership from last year, which was Digne and Richarlison.

Mateusz Klich to Patrick Bamford – 3

Leeds United have been one of the most entertaining teams to watch in the Premier League this season, as their games are guaranteed to feature a lot of high quality chances – at both ends of the pitch.

But for now we will just focus on the Whites’ attack, which has scored 16 goals in 11 games. Half of their goals have been scored by Patrick Bamford, putting him joint-fifth in the scoring charts. Three of those have assisted by Polish midfielder Mateusz Klich.

Only Liverpool (174) have created more chances than Leeds United (161), while Klich is the team’s second biggest shot creator (21) behind Jack Harrison (23). As impressive as Patrick Bamford has been this season, however, he’s only scoring 22% of his shots, the lowest conversion rate of any of the top ten scorers thus far.

Ranking the six Premier League players with the most goal involvements so far this season

Jack Grealish to Ollie Watkins – 3

When Aston Villa spent £30 million on Ollie Watkins in the offseason, this is exactly what they had envisaged would happen: a linkup with Jack Grealish that would result in goals galore. So far the pair have combined for three goals and you wouldn’t bet against them combining for a few more as the campaign goes on.

Privacy Settings

Grealish is creating 2.9 chances per 90, the third best in league behind Bruno Fernandes and Kevin De Bruyne among players who have played at least 500 minutes. One would imagine that with Watkins’ ability to get in behind opposition defences, they will be finding each other an awful lot in 2020/21.

Son Heung-min to Harry Kane – 3

The budding relationship between Son and Kane is indeed reciprocal, with the Korean setting up three goals for the England striker.

That means the pair have teamed up for a phenomenal 11 goals in 11 matches, meaning they will surely smash the Premier League record for goal combinations sooner rather than later.

11 – Only Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton (13 in 1995/96) & Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson (12 in 2018/19) have combined for more Premier League goals in a season than Harry Kane and Son Heung-min this season (11). Synchronicity. pic.twitter.com/R8fSs08pWS — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 6, 2020

They likely won’t be able to maintain this incredible level of production for much longer, but while they are Spurs are firmly in contention for Champions League qualification and a possible title tilt.

316,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2020/transformational-partnerships-for-peace--resilience-and-gender-e.html,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",UNDP,"Transformational partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality","At the start of 2020, many of us imagined the year would be remembered as the beginning of the UN Decade of Action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and for marking the anniversaries of UN Security Council resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women, peace, and security (WPS) and the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We saw a world in which trust in institutions was at an all-time low, and considered how we could support the reinvigoration of systematic parliamentary, civil society, and people’s partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shattered many assumptions. But the hard lessons learned from it, from response planning and implementation to recovering forward better efforts, have affirmed the power of partnerships for advancing and reshaping the WPS agenda as we deal with the COVID-19 crisis, including partnerships between parliaments and civil society. This was the key takeaway of a recent event commemorating the 20th anniversary of UNSCR 1325, hosted by the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Women, Peace and Security in partnership with UNDP and Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS).

Many of the most effective COVID-19 responses have been those involving strong women’s leadership that enlisted deep grassroots support. In Sierra Leone, the Parliamentary Female Caucus with UNDP’s support joined hands with community-led organizations and women groups to map out more gender-sensitive ways to respond to the pandemic. Based on these dialogues, the caucus has advocated for the diverse participation of women in the fight against the pandemic. It has also urged dedicated support for women-led micro-businesses, hit hardest by lockdown measures, and women community-organizers who have been at the forefront of keeping communities safe. Looking ahead, the caucus is emphasizing the need for well-resourced projects for community revitalization after the pandemic has passed.

Similarly, among the most progressive recovery visions are those that include a recommitment to the complementary visions of the SDGs and the WPS agenda. Such visions recognize that inclusive processes with strong participation and equal leadership opportunities for women can lead to better and more sustainable outcomes of peace processes, crisis response and building back from COVID-19. In its recommendations to the recent Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy by the UK Government, a civil society organization network GAPS advocated for a holistic approach that brings together security, peacebuilding and development.

In many places, women MPs and women-led civil society groups engaging in peacebuilding and dialogue are forging new pathways for women’s political participation as we look to the post-COVID-19 era. Parliamentary cross-party groups, can play important roles in cultivating relationships between decision-makers in parliaments and a diverse representation of women peacebuilders, advocates and civil society. In Kyrgyzstan, the cross-party Forum of Women MPs together with women’s organizations and gender experts, with the support of the UNiTE campaign, have established a Council on Women's Rights and Countering Gender Violence in the Kyrgyz Parliament to jointly monitor the implementation of gender-based violence and gender equality laws. In the UK, GAPS has served as the secretariat of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on WPS, which has provided a platform for an inclusive dialogue on WPS in the country.

For women’s organizations to build and maintain the capacity needed to engage with decision-makers, and to support women’s leadership and full participation more broadly, they need steady and flexible funding. The Government of Norway, which has put partnerships with civil society for gender equality and peace at the cornerstone of its domestic and foreign policy, has championed various instruments that make such funding available directly to women’s organisations. Through budgetary oversight, parliaments in donor countries can help ensure their governments maintain steady levels of impactful and gender-responsive development assistance that reaches and serves those who need it the most.

UNDP, with the support of Norway, is proud to encourage stronger collaborations between parliaments and civil society for more a peaceful, sustainable and gender-equal society. Our Global Project on Parliaments and Civil Society as Partners Supporting WPS is working to empower parliamentarians to find new possibilities and ways of working with women peacebuilders in the grassroots, local government and the media. The project spotlights the societal benefits of having women represented in decision-making and leadership, both numerically and substantively. This work stands alongside other UNDP efforts to make parliaments more gender-sensitive and fit-for-purpose SDG16+ institutions--those that are effective, accountable to people, and invite a systematic and diverse participation of those for who the achievement of the SDGs will make the most difference.

The recently published “Women, peace and human security: a guidance note on parliamentary engagement during and post-COVID-19” charts the ways in which parliaments, civil society and development partners can work together so that 2020 is remembered not only as the year of COVID-19, but also a year where there was decisive action and across the board commitment to see the world we want realized.","We saw a world in which trust in institutions was at an all-time low, and considered how we could support the reinvigoration of systematic parliamentary, civil society, and people’s partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality.

The new listing builds on the IAEA’s success in establishing private partnerships to address critical laboratory equipment needs by highlighting opportunities for manufacturers and suppliers. The initiative is part of ongoing efforts to modernize the IAEA’s nuclear applications laboratories, which support the Agency’s 172 Member States with applied research, training and laboratory services that draw on nuclear techniques to help address challenges in food security and agriculture, human health, and climate and the environment.

Earlier listings on the UNGM, in 2018, generated expressions of interest from a number of companies and ultimately resulted in IAEA partnerships with Hopewell Designs Incorporated for a gamma beam irradiator, used to provide uniform and precise calibration of dosimeters; MetaSystems, Inc. for an imaging platform for the new IAEA Biological Dosimetry Model Laboratory; and Thermo Fisher Scientific for an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer for the Food and Environmental Protection Laboratory’s use in discovering information on the geographic, chemical, and biological origins of substances.

Through the new listing, the IAEA seeks to obtain items including an atom trap trace analysis system for the Isotope Hydrology Laboratory and a mass spectrometer for the Animal Production and Health Laboratory. Through this UNGM initiative the IAEA is seeking interested businesses, who could make a donation or a cost-free loan to meet laboratory’s requirements. Obtaining such equipment through partnerships can help the IAEA maximize the efficient use resources, while manufacturers and suppliers gain exposure for their newest technologies with hundreds of scientists and trainees from around the world who visit and work in the IAEA’s laboratories every year.","The IAEA has published on the United Nations Global Marketplace (UNGM) portal an updated list of laboratory equipment it needs to continue support its Member States in the use of nuclear applications.

There are currently two COVID-19 vaccines under accelerated review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory authorities that have reported safety and efficacy data in phase three clinical trials.¹ Unlike the common flu vaccine, each of these COVID-19 vaccines poses similar and unique challenges in terms of procurement, distribution, administration and management. At Microsoft, we have been working with public- and private-sector organizations around the world to help support this monumental task of delivering vaccines as quickly as possible, but also in a secure and equitable manner. Technology plays an essential role in the secure, safe and equitable distribution of the vaccine and strategic partnerships will enable us to achieve our goals and meet the challenges ahead. In this blog, we will go into more detail on some strategic partnerships that are enabling the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Partnering towards better outcomes

With COVID-19 vaccines soon to be available, Microsoft and its partners are actively working with customers to deploy vaccine management solutions that enable registration capabilities for patients and providers, phased scheduling for vaccinations, streamlined reporting, and management dashboarding with analytics and forecasting. These offerings are helping public health agencies and healthcare providers to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals in an efficient, equitable and safe manner. The underlying technologies and approach have been tested and deployed with prior COVID-19 use cases, including contact tracing, COVID-19 testing, and return to work and return to school programs.

Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) has deployed over 230 emergency COVID-19 response missions globally since the pandemic began in March, including recent engagements to ensure the equitable, secure and efficient distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. MCS has developed an offering, the Vaccination Registration and Administration Solution (VRAS), which advances the capabilities of their COVID-19 solution portfolio and enables compliant administration of resident assessment, registration and phased scheduling for vaccine distribution. It enables the tracking and reporting of immunization progress through secure data exchange that utilizes industry standards, such as Health Level Seven (HL7), Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and open APIs. Health providers and pharmacies can monitor and report on the effectiveness of specific vaccine batches, and health administrators can easily summarize the achievement of vaccine deployment goals in large population groups.

Additionally, several of our partners have leveraged the Microsoft cloud to provide customers with additional offerings to support vaccine management. These offerings also apply APIs, HL7 and FHIR to enable interoperability and integration with existing systems of record, artificial intelligence to generate accurate and geo-specific predictive analytics, and secure communications using Microsoft Teams.

Meeting the needs of a global population for fair and equitable vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring calls upon the very best that the Accenture, Avanade and Microsoft partnership has to offer. Using Accenture’s strategic consulting, industry and implementation expertise, coupled with Microsoft’s cutting-edge data, cloud and technology capabilities, means Accenture is building robust, scalable and dependable solutions for vaccination authorities around the world.

EY has partnered with Microsoft to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end solution that helps manage the manufacture and distribution process of the vaccine. The EY Vaccine Management Solution is built on multiple Microsoft technologies: Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Power BI and Power Platform to enable patient-provider engagement, supply chain visibility, and Internet of Things (IoT) real-time monitoring of the vaccines. Additionally, the EY Vaccine Analytics Solution is an integrated COVID-19 data and analytics tool supporting stakeholders in understanding population and geography-specific vaccine uptake.

Mazik Global has leveraged its expertise in the healthcare industry and technology solutions to create MazikCare Vaccine Flow. Vaccine Flow is built on Power Apps and utilizes pre-built templates to implement scalable solutions to accelerate the mass distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Providers will be able to seek out specific populations based on at-risk criteria to prioritize distribution. Patients can self-monitor and have peace of mind to head-off adverse reactions. Most importantly, the ability to monitor inventory levels as well as the temperature of the vials will enable providers to help get the vaccine to patients quickly. MazikCare Vaccine Flow is available in Microsoft AppSource.

Microsoft and its partners utilize robust capabilities of Microsoft’s highly secure cloud-based technologies to deliver solutions that address the most urgent challenges the healthcare industry is facing today. Learn more about Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare and the breadth of our partner capabilities.

Collaborating toward a successful outcome

To achieve the goal of an efficient, equitable and safe delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, close collaboration across agencies and partners will be the key to success. It is imperative that implementations be delivered on time and customized to meet the needs of every government and healthcare customer. As much as possible, newly introduced technologies should integrate with existing systems of record to keep workflow changes and costs to a minimum.

Microsoft and its partners are committed to doing our part to help the global community address this historic challenge. Together, we look forward to helping our customers embrace the power of digital, and the power of human innovation to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in a prioritized manner.

The company’s Nutella brand has joined forces with Loop and Carrefour for a reuse pilot scheme in Paris, France. Through the new scheme, shoppers will be able to purchase a specially designed reusable Nutella jar from one of the ten pilot stores or the Carrefour website for which they pay a deposit. Carrefour will then collect the empty jars for washing and reuse.

Ferrero’s in-house design team worked closely with Loop’s experts to develop the new pilot Nutella jar, the first of its kind. The result of this collaboration is a specially designed jar that the company says is durable, safe, hygienic – featuring an optimised label and seal that can be removed during the wash cycle.

After signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment in 2019, which is led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the UN Environment (UNEP), Ferrero has also now become a member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, taking part in the New Plastics Economy initiative.

Ferrero will look to play an active role in New Plastics Economy Initiative, working on shared R&D and innovation projects including efforts to continue driving the transition to a circular economy for plastic.

In the field of packaging design, Ferrero’s R&D department has created a new recyclable packaging for Kinder Happy Hippo that reportedly meets the CEFLEX recyclability guidelines for flexible films and with an improved recyclability profile. The new packaging, featuring a new polypropylene mono-material structure, is now available for purchase.

Ferrero has also announced its membership of the 4evergreen alliance – an industry group that aims to boost the contribution of fibre-based packaging to the circular economy. Through the 4evergreen alliance, Ferrero hopes to engage with industry members from across the fibre-based packaging value chain.

“We are continuing to make good progress on our journey to make 100% of our packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. These are important steps forward that underline our commitment to working in collaboration with others and we look forward to sharing further updates on our progress soon,” said Fabio Mora, global packaging director at Ferrero Group.","As part of its drive to make 100% of its packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025, Ferrero has revealed four new projects.

Partnerships are the essence of any organization as they promote new perspectives, increase creativity and ultimately, lead to better outcomes.

At Stop Foodborne Illness, or STOP, we know about collaborative partnerships. For more than 26 years, affiliating with like-minded organizations to prevent foodborne disease is the mainstay of our success and continues to provide beneficial results today.

The mission to prevent illness and death due to contaminated food resonates with our allies and aligns with their goals to coordinate and expand efforts. At any given moment, STOP is working with a diverse spectrum of individuals and industries to move the needle on foodborne illness prevention. Today, STOP’s work is focused on constituent services and food safety policy with the overarching goal of public health. Below are examples of current collaborative projects that are uniquely effective.

Alliance to Stop Foodborne Illness

The Alliance to Stop Foodborne Illness (Alliance) is an initiative of STOP, leading food companies, and other organizations committed to the goal of preventing foodborne illness. For 25 years, Stop Foodborne Illness has communicated the compelling personal stories of people and families who have experienced serious foodborne illness or the death of loved ones. The goals of communicating these personal stories are to make clear why food safety must be a central value of the food system and to help motivate people in both the food industry and government to do their best every day to reduce hazards and prevent illness. Through the Alliance, STOP and leading food companies are collaborating to expand the reach and impact of personal stories to strengthen food safety cultures and prevent foodborne illness.

The Alliance to Stop Foodborne Illness has a mission to:

Forge partnerships between STOP and leading food companies to build trust and support strong food safety cultures.

Collaboratively design and implement innovative, well-tailored programs that make compelling personal stories an integral motivational element of food safety culture and training programs.

Expand the reach and impact of personal stories through outreach to the small- and medium-size companies that are key contributors to modern supply chains.

Current Alliance members: Costco, Cargill, Conagra Brands, Coca-Cola, Yum! Brands, Nestle USA, LGMA, Empirical Foods, Maple Leaf Foods, Mars, Walmart, Wegmans, and Amazon.

Constituent/Advocate Engagement

Working with those who have been impacted by severe foodborne illness is base to our prevention work. We engage our constituent/advocates in many projects and continually seek additional opportunities.

STOP’s new website houses a navigational map for anyone who is in crisis, post-crisis or managing the long-term consequences of surviving severe foodborne disease. This structured, informational composition was created by constituent/advocates that are sharing their lived experiences. This incisive work provides incredible insight into the journey that may lie ahead and how to manage the potential labyrinth.

With our partner, Center for Science in the Public Interest, we have created a national platform for survivors of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis to speak about their experiences surviving these diseases.

The Alliance has created multiple working partnerships with individual constituent/advocates.

STOP’s speaker’s bureau provides opportunities for our constituent/advocates to share their personal stories with large groups in person or virtually.

A recent college graduate who is a constituent/advocate is leading the creation of a new program for the organization.

Dave Theno Fellowship

Dave Theno Fellowship is a partnership with Michigan State University (MSU) that provides a recent public health, food science, animal science or political science graduate (undergraduate or graduate degree) the opportunity to conduct two distinct research projects, engage in STOP programming, participate on coalition calls and earn a certificate in food safety from MSU.

STOP is working with MSU to create a new course for its Online Food Safety Program that focuses on food safety failures and the impact of those system breakdowns on consumers.

Early Detection of Foodborne Illness Research

In conjunction with North Carolina State University, Michigan State University, Eastern Carolina University and University of Michigan, STOP is engaging in research to identify gaps in knowledge and application of the 2017 Infectious Disease Society of America Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diarrhea (IDSA) for healthcare workers. Our early findings have identified that most healthcare workers do not know about nor follow the IDSA guidelines, which include reporting of cases of infectious diarrhea and identification of the pathogen for identification and prevention of potential widespread outbreaks.

To support this research, STOP is completing a systematic literature review with the intent to publish.

Recall Modernization Working Group

STOP has been convening a group of experts comprised of individuals from academia, Alliance members, external industry partners, food industry associations, public health organizations, and industry consultants to deep dive into food recalls to define the current landscape, discuss systemic changes necessary for expedient and efficient execution of recalls for both industry and consumers and develop recommendations on how to accomplish those changes.

Everyone is susceptible to foodborne illness; thus, we need a varied, coordinated approach. Each of these partnerships helps our colleagues meet their goals while promoting prevention of foodborne illness by straddling both industry and consumer focused work. Executing our mission takes many forms and that requires diversity in partnerships, a shared vision and tangible, sustainable results.","At Stop Foodborne Illness, or STOP, we know about collaborative partnerships.

323,https://www.philasun.com/commentary/black-white-partnerships-dedicated-to-change/,"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Philadelphia Sunday Sun,Black/White partnerships: dedicated to change?,"By George Burrell

George Burrell

At this inflection point, governments, corporations and institutions have acknowledged systemic and institutional racism and white privilege. White American leaders are projecting greater diversity in workplaces and investing billions in spending with Black and Brown owned businesses.

The intent is to diversify blue collar to c-suite workforces and improve the quality of life for Blacks across the economic spectrum, including poverty, education and healthcare disparities.

However, to deliver transformative change and not just incremental progress, systemic racism must be addressed with sustained intentionality and wealth must be redistributed.

Without intervention by Black leaders, incremental progress will remain the norm and shotgun spending in protected class procurement programs will be exhausted in three to five years. At that time, a new normal will be proclaimed, symbolized by Black TV commercials, business success stories and major contributions to national Black leadership organizations. Philadelphia, however, will remain the poorest big city in America because rising tides do not lift all boats.

With no disrespect to White women, the resources necessary to transform the Black experience in Philadelphia are controlled by white men. White CEOs, including women, must become leadership voices for transformative change and wealth redistribution and must build trust based professional and personal relationships with Black leaders.

CEOs must do five things: (1) reimagine goals to address systemic racism and the organizational structure necessary to produce outcomes; (2) fund a study to quantify the economic impact of reducing poverty; (3) expand the quality and dollar value of work awarded to Black businesses; (4) view Black equity in the context of shareholder value, not philanthropy; and (5) restate mission, vision and core values.

A Black/white partnership, which is essential to transformative change, can bring powerful political and advocacy resources to reducing poverty, minimum wage increases, a fair education funding formula; and other transformative changes, not “best we can get” compromises.

The minority majority on Philadelphia’s City Council and Black legislators in Harrisburg are essential partners who can recruit white elected officials to the partnership. Black partners must advocate visions, like former Mayor Street’s Neighborhood Transformation Initiative. Families in unsafe neighborhoods with failing public schools deserve leaders who are resolving generational dilemmas, not asking for patience.

Black business procurement programs, behavioral health and social service programs need to establish transformational goals and with greater transparency report performance data. For example, procurement programs measure performance, based on annual percentage increases in spending. No data is reported on how spending impacts Black businesses, who are negatively impacted by the quality and dollar value of work prime contractors award.

Program sponsors should leverage prime contractors to improve the quality and dollar value of work awarded to Black businesses and make those factors significant in decisions to award contracts to prime contractors. Those directives would change prime contractor behavior. If program sponsors implemented programs, like sheltered markets, Black business capacity and growth would be accelerated without impacting efficiency.

Service delivery programs report outcomes, based on clients served, with no indication of their impact on poverty, healthcare disparities, etc. Service programs must challenge themselves to be more productive change agents and public advocates. Similarly, Black and white leaders must stop running in place and calling it progress.

Changing gears: a new administration

President-elect Joe Biden will lead a country where Americans — who were self-sufficient last year — have learned what it means to live with uncertainty. Recovery will put the experience behind many, but with or without empathy for failed Black businesses and Black families, left behind the eight ball? Recovery will not address systemic racism or their circumstances.

The President-elect was believable in the campaign, but the Black community cannot rely on “got your back” and diversity. Outcomes, focused on Blacks across the economic spectrum, not just the middle class, are what measures transformative change.

As transition unfolds, Blacks are concerned with (1) no public Zoom call with Black leaders and undefined references to Black equity; (2) the evolving composition of the White House staff; (3) a talented cabinet, but our folks headed to the traditional posts and number two seats; and (4) publicly concluding that half the Trump voters were “good people.” So what?

Unifying America is a challenge, but George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and police misconduct also were on the ballot.

Systemic racism should be addressed in the inaugural and Congressional addresses. A systemic racism task force, chaired by the vice president, should be appointed to draft a plan that addresses unconscious bias, wealth redistribution and a partnership with state and local governments to address education, poverty and criminal justice reform. Systemic racism must be pursued as a mission impossible in a country where nothing is impossible.

The President-elect campaigned on experience and bipartisan compromises, but Senator Mitch McConnell leads a team focused on Republican power, offended by Black Lives Matter and manipulated by Trump. Where is there turf for unity without compromising Black Americans and Biden voters?

Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt were cited by the President-elect, as role models for unity, but each compromised Blacks to pursue the greater good. President Harry Truman, against political advice, ended military segregation. President Lyndon Johnson signed civil rights legislation, knowing southern states would flip.

Joe Biden will have to make greater good decisions, which reduce themselves to courage and risk vs reward. Some will present unconscious bias intersections. In that context, Blacks expect the administration and Democrats to begin seriously leveling the playing field, so to paraphrase James Brown, “if you open the door, I can get it for myself.”

Black Lives Matter and progressives bring energy and vision to Democrats. They will not be sick and tired of being sick and tired, nor silent on core issues. Conversations can be held about where issues fit under a big tent, but mandated silence in the pursuit of power is a non-starter. Black Lives Matter and progressives should be welcomed and empowered by Democrats.","However, to deliver transformative change and not just incremental progress, systemic racism must be addressed with sustained intentionality and wealth must be redistributed.
White CEOs, including women, must become leadership voices for transformative change and wealth redistribution and must build trust based professional and personal relationships with Black leaders.
A Black/white partnership, which is essential to transformative change, can bring powerful political and advocacy resources to reducing poverty, minimum wage increases, a fair education funding formula; and other transformative changes, not “best we can get” compromises.
Outcomes, focused on Blacks across the economic spectrum, not just the middle class, are what measures transformative change.
Systemic racism must be pursued as a mission impossible in a country where nothing is impossible."

Amidst the uncertainty surrounding Brexit back in January, the Coronavirus pandemic sent shockwaves across multiple industries causing many to come to a grinding halt and others to make drastic decisions to remain operational. What's more, the UK’s business landscape has shifted exponentially with organizations of all sizes feeling a sense of anxiety and lack of confidence towards its ability to bounce back to a pre-Covid state.

For example, a recent report from Nexus Global surveyed senior business managers across the UK to gauge their sentiments towards the current climate. Among its findings, the report revealed that UK businesses are least confident about the health of the country’s economy.

Yet, as we emerge into a new era, this year has also presented huge opportunities and given us a greater sense of camaraderie; instilling the notion that we will navigate this new landscape if we stand together.

Benefits of partner-driven growth

For businesses, partner-driven growth has been a strategy for organizations of all sizes and verticals; whereby they look to take their vendor-supplier relationships further to become certified partners. As a result, experiencing significant gains for each company involved in the partnership.

The hunt for tech partnerships is rife as companies look to digitally transform their businesses in-line with the repercussions of the global pandemic. As a result, their focus has shifted towards solutions that deliver complete business outcomes, rather than multiple out-sourced solutions. This creates a unique window of opportunity for strategic tech partnerships. What’s more, with the buyer’s journey becoming increasingly digital too, partners will need to offer a mix of services that cross cloud platforms and apps that suit the needs of customers.

Reach new verticals

For example, now that cybersecurity has become a priority for many organizations, due to the rise in malicious attacks on home-based workers, strategic partnerships between tech companies have opened up brand new markets. Take insurance as an example - cloud-based platforms that provide a complete virtual workplace can now be completely insured in terms of cybersecurity. Here, insurance companies can expand their offerings to brand new cloud markets, while cloud tech companies can ensure their platform is as secure as possible, providing insurance to their customers for the first time.

Untapped niches and undeveloped segments become viable potential markets with the power of tech partnerships. More and more, we are witnessing companies learn to seek potential partnerships based on the possible outcomes they envision their combined partner force could deliver, rather than assessing the company's solution offerings alone.

Enable new experiences

When forming a partnership, you are ultimately leveraging expertise in different areas to supply a greater and comprehensive offering to your clients by offering additional solutions and services. This could be through combining the skills and resources of other specialists to provide and achieve more for all involved to enable new experiences you otherwise would never have even realized.

In the current Covid climate which we find ourselves in, the need for robust remote working solutions are hugely sought after. It goes without saying that, transitioning an entire workforce to a remote-working model overnight proved a brand new experience for many business leaders. This was a great example of how a business can work together with a tech partner to deliver the cloud solution that will enable their entire company to work remotely effectively and efficiently, without compromising on security.

Facilitating an ecosystem to provide end-user benefits

In today’s digitally connected world, tech ecosystems are a key factor in breaching new markets and competing effectively. A network of organizations, including suppliers, distributors, customers, and competitors delivering products and services contributing to a common mission, makes up a tech ecosystem. Working around an ecosystem ultimately puts the customer's end-to-end journey at the forefront. With one common goal, service providers can work together with one another helping to shape the customer’s relationship with the company.

It is important to prioritize the end customer and their experience with your company when engaging with partners. This will allow your business to build strong relationships with existing customers that encourages the spread of positive word of mouth, resulting in a new, larger and more loyal clientele base.

How to avoid the common pit-falls of a tech partnership

Selecting the right partner

True strategic partnerships produce a mutual, two-way synergy. Therefore, it is critical the partner must compliment your own business goals and aims. Whatever the primary goal, this could be to grow a client base, reach new investors or improve solution offerings, one thing remains certain: the goals between the partners should be in alignment. After all, partnerships prove most effective, the longer the relationship. By avoiding bitter disputes, it is essential to choose the right partner by considering the goals and aims of the partnership over their immediate offerings to you and your customers needs.

Building a partner program

A reliable partner program will no doubt boost your overall image as a professional company that has plans to disrupt the market and grow as a result. A partner program should outline incentives, everyday communication and engagement, sales and tech support, business planning and structure from both sides. Without a robust partner program, the boarding process can become problematic when explaining how the company works with others.

During a period of such uncertainty and economic anxiety, now is the time that businesses need to come together, utilize their resources and customer bases to drive their overall growth. Instead of turning on each other, companies can look to reach out for mutual support as they navigate the ever-changing financial landscape. Tech partnerships are a highly effective way for companies to raise their business profile and reap the long-term benefits of a strategic collaboration.

Both small or large businesses will have suffered in the past few months. Coming together has already proved a lifeline for many to not only survive, but to thrive. Opening up new possibilities by reaching new verticals and enabling new experiences are just a few of the surefire ways employing tech partners can help scale a business in a fast and sustainable manner during a time of unpredictability and unrest.

This collaborative of agencies and organizations are committed to improving the overall environmental performance of the state of Nevada by working directly with businesses to reduce energy usage, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the amount of water used during business operations. This will help make Nevada a cleaner state, reduce its direct impact on natural resources and achieve its climate action goals.

Partners include greenUP!, WNC, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Incline Village General Improvement District, Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful, Envirolution, GreenACTnv and GRN Vision. Combined, these agencies and organizations support businesses across the state in becoming certified in the Nevada Green Business Program.

The program utilizes the GreenBizTrackerTM database to collect outcomes that measure the impact certified businesses are having toward resource conservation, pollution prevention and environmental protection goals. Through education, networking and collaboration, the Nevada Green Business Network will assist in finding new ways for businesses to be more efficient, healthy and attract new customers.

WNC was recently selected by the Environmental Protection Agency as a national grantee of the 2020-22 Pollution Prevention Grant Program. In addition, greenUP! received a Source Reduction Assistance grant for the same grant period. As part of the grant commitments, WNC and greenUP! will partner to train manufacturers in Pollution Prevention techniques.

“Western Nevada College looks forward to working with our partners to prevent pollution through implementation of best practices,” said Dr. Georgia White, director of Professional and Applied Technology at WNC. “We are also funding internships to provide students with technical knowledge and work-based experience as WNC continues to document businesses and environmental results through GreenBizTrackerTM.”

The network has set a goal to certify 75 businesses and manufacturers by 2022, providing assistance to a wide range of sectors and creating a comprehensive directory of green businesses on the GreenBizTrackerTM database.

“The Nevada Green Business Program and Network will help assist businesses to improve their bottom lines while reducing the use of hazardous materials, water and energy,” said greenUP! Board President Donna Walden. “We are most grateful to EPA for providing continued funding and to our partners who will accelerate this important work and enhance environmental performance in Nevada.”

GreenBizTrackerTM is a web-based and mobile tool that motivates businesses to make voluntary behavior and facility changes that net positive and measurable environmental outcomes. Easy-to-use resources and tools, as well as one-on-one assistance from program partners, are provided to the businesses to help them along the way. As a business moves through an online checklist of verifiable environmental actions, metrics are calculated such as greenhouse gas emissions reduced, energy conserved, gallons of water saved, tons of waste diverted from the landfill and hazardous materials reduced. Once businesses have completed the checklist, they are green certified and added to an online, searchable directory, which the public can use to find and patronize these businesses.

Despite much talk about the need for deep and equitable partnerships between organizations in the Global North and Global South, extensive technical collaboration between such organizations is rare.

With the support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, AidData is working to overcome this challenge by investing in several new research partnerships with leading organizations on the African continent. The ultimate aim is for data and evidence to be incorporated into the public-sector decision-making across sectors and at multiple levels of government—starting in Ghana.

A new $600,000 grant from the Hewlett Foundation will help AidData “bolster its engagement with policy makers, influencers, and researchers in Africa.”

What will AidData bring to these partnerships? Expertise in using satellite imagery to measure a variety of development outcomes (e.g., economic activity, conflict, crop yields) over geographic space and time; new approaches leveraging machine learning (ML) in order to generate causal and predictive results from big data sources, including satellites; and new studies on social diffusion and social networks in low- and middle-income country contexts.

“The potential development applications and opportunities associated with satellite data, ML, and social networks are best harnessed when they are deployed with partners in low- and middle-income countries,” said Ariel BenYishay, AidData’s Chief Economist and head of the Research and Evaluation Unit, who will be leading the new initiative.

There are four planned activity streams: combining satellite imagery and within-household impacts that may not be directly visible from space; evaluating how governments can extend their reach via social networks; giving statisticians in Africa access to satellites and artificial intelligence (AI); and leveraging and strengthening existing policymaking and researcher networks to build the skills necessary to make good use of social network analysis, geospatial analysis, and artificial intelligence.

The team is starting in Ghana, where AidData has worked before, and where it is already building strong relationships with two partner institutions. One of these organizations—Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) —is helping to shape decisions from inside government. The other—Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana)—is a think tank influencing government policy from the outside.

With CDD-Ghana, AidData will develop new ways of measuring development outcomes within households, such as women’s empowerment and girls’ schooling experiences. CDD-Ghana and AidData will also work together to evaluate how government institutions can more effectively disseminate information—about things like health and safety precautions and farming techniques—to the people who they are trying to reach. AidData will help GSS assess its readiness to integrate ML and satellite imagery into its ongoing efforts to measure poverty over geographic space and time.

“AidData, CDD Ghana, and GSS each have a remarkable track record of pioneering cutting-edge ways to use data to inform decision-making,” said Norma Altshuler, Program Officer, Global Development and Population, with the Hewlett Foundation. “Their partnerships have tremendous potential to help Ghana’s government deliver more effective programs. Part of the reason why is how they will work together. They’ll focus on opportunities that truly advance each partner’s goals, and they’ve invested in aligning on nuts and bolts like clear communications and equitable distributions of authorship and budgets. At the Hewlett Foundation, we’ve learned how important it is to get partnerships right, and we’re excited to support and learn from their partnership experience.”

Rather than re-inventing the wheel, AidData will seek to strengthen existing African policymaking and researcher networks.

“Organizations with a strong on-the-ground presence have higher levels of credibility with the governing authorities and they’re better positioned to work through local agents and channels of influence,” said BenYishay. “As a research lab based in the Global North, our aim is to reinforce and add long-term value to the work of local policy research partners.”

This new grant builds upon an earlier, 18-month award from the Hewlett Foundation that allowed AidData to identify and evaluate partnership opportunities with more than 225 organizations in 17 sub-Saharan African countries.

“There are many organizations—inside and outside of government—in Africa that are already doing outstanding work to bring granular data and rigorous evidence to bear on the design, implementation and evaluation of policies and programs,” said BenYishay. “We’ve decided to focus our partnerships on joint collection and analysis of data that can help national and local leaders on the continent solve a specific set of policy and programmatic challenges.”

“The current practice areas and research priorities of CDD-Ghana and GSS align well with our own, and the local ecosystem for evidence-informed policymaking in Ghana makes it a particularly promising setting for new partnerships,” said Jessica Wells, Senior Program Manager at AidData. “We’ll be working on some topics that are already deeply integrated into CDD-Ghana’s work and some newer areas that are more aspirational and experimental.”

Further down the road, AidData hopes to engage with a broader set of organizations on the continent.

The recent 18-month grant from the Hewlett Foundation allowed AidData to establish some guiding principles and criteria for assessing partnership opportunities.

“We’ve learned that is difficult to achieve and capitalize on early wins and sustain progress when organizations do not have closely aligned or complementary interests, goals, and activities. It’s also important that partner organizations establish a clearly defined division of labor that is based on their respective strengths and incentives,” said BenYishay.

The new award is separate from a three-year, $1.5 million award the Foundation made in 2020 to support AidData’s three-year strategic plan, Vision 2023.

“For more than 12 years, the Hewlett Foundation has been a steadfast partner that has helped our organization expand its global reach and impact,” said AidData’s Executive Director Brad Parks. “Its latest investment in Vision 2023 is a vote of confidence in our research lab as a whole. Its support will allow us to innovate and pilot ahead-of-the-market ideas, recruit and retain top talent, and get our data and analysis into the hands of decision-makers.”","AidData wins Hewlett Foundation grant to build research partnerships in AfricaGrant Supported: AidData staff meet with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and the Ministry of Health during a trip in fall 2019.

Cmdr. Justin Dargan to his latest Reserve assignment as a Foreign Area Officer (FAO). The cuts of jamón ibérico hanging overhead in airport bars, football jerseys in seemingly every storefront, and the silhouettes of bulls plastered across much of the tourist merchandise brought back memories from nearly a lifetime ago during Dargan’s first visit to the country.



Since the establishment of the Reserve FAO program in 2015, the organization has evolved into a tight-knit group of military diplomats. FAOs are experts in regional languages and cultural knowledge who maximize the collaborative abilities of U.S. partner nations and military forces while continuing the shared goal of maintaining peace and stability across the globe.



There are a number of key characteristics that unite most FAOs — as illustrated in the following article by Dargan. FAOs maintain a broad range of military skills and experiences; are knowledgeable on political and military affairs; have familiarity with the political, cultural, social, economic, and geographic factors of the countries and regions in which they are stationed; are proficient in one or more foreign languages; and also possess a regionally focused master’s degree and qualification in a U.S. Navy warfare specialization. Most FAOs also share a passion for multilateral engagements, building relationships with allies and partners, and promoting allied unity in pursuit of a shared goals.



LT. CMDR. JUSTIN DARGAN



I’d been to Spain 16 years ago as part of the Naval Academy’s summer study abroad program. I chose to minor in Spanish, in no small part because I liked the idea of learning about other cultures and had hoped to experience them firsthand.



Growing up lower middle-class in a Midwestern U.S. suburb, I had never traveled abroad, and this first taste of cultural immersion as a 21-year-old Second Class Midshipman sparked a real and unshakable enthusiasm for multicultural engagement.



It was that same passion that eventually motivated me to redesignate as a Reserve FAO.



Last year, my second trip to Spain was on short notice, having been selected to serve on orders with the Spanish Maritime Force (SPMARFOR) in Rota. The command had recently fallen below full-readiness manning levels, understaffed in both national Spanish officers and full-time NATO liaisons. One of five NATO High Readiness Force headquarters designated to serve on a rotating basis as Maritime Component Command (MCC) for the NATO Response Force, SPMARFOR was in need of Navy Reserve FAO support to prepare for and assume the role during calendar year 2020.



Since redesignating as an FAO, I have been amazed by the variety of backgrounds and breadth of experience among the many talented officers in the community. Cmdr. Demetrio Camua, who joined me in the SPMARFOR assignment, is a prime example.



Born in the Philippines and having immigrated to the U.S. after college, Camua is one of many FAOs who has spent much of his life overseas. This imbues him with globally informed insight that comes in handy while working with foreign partners abroad. After four years on active duty, Camua transitioned to the Navy Reserve in order to pursue a civilian career in commercial aviation. He subsequently earned his flight instructor and commercial pilot certification and flies as a first officer for a regional airline in Florida.



My own background is also in aviation as a Naval Flight Officer. After serving my first fleet tour as a controller and mission commander in the E-2C Hawkeye, I embarked on a 3-year program in an exchange billet flying in the E-3D Sentry with the British Royal Air Force. I also spent considerable time abroad with NATO allies, including a 2-month assignment in Italy’s Combined Allied Operations Center.



My positive experience serving with my British squadron mates and allied NATO officers further fueled my passion for foreign engagement. During my final active duty assignment, I began working on a master’s degree in international relations. Eventually I transitioned to the Reserve while continuing to pursue graduate studies with the ultimate goal of attaining a doctorate and becoming a university professor.



Although Camua and I had experienced a good deal of success during our Navy careers, we had both strayed from the typical career path of most officers. When the Navy Reserve began soliciting applications for the new FAO community, each of us saw it as the perfect opportunity to capitalize on our unique talents and give back to the service. By the time I met Camua in Rota, it felt like I already knew him.



The Reserve FAO program is a tight-knit group. In addition to those who have served together in Reserve units, many of us have spent time face-to-face through a combination of joint FAO training in Monterey, California, region-specific seminars or association sponsored meet-and-greet events. Our community is active online where members can share information about potential activations, educational opportunities, deployment stories, international connections and general advice. It was through these informal channels that we’d both found out about the opportunity in Rota.



Upon checking into SPMARFOR, Camua and I were integrated into the command staff, filling gapped billets in the N7 Training and N3 Operations departments. Our primary focus was to help the staff prepare for the successful execution of two large joint NATO exercises while deployed at sea aboard Spanish Flagship ESPS Castilla (L52).



Exercise Dynamic Mariner was planned for October as a live-fire exercise with a distinctly maritime focus. Then, November’s follow-on Exercise Trident Jupiter was to be a computer-assisted command post exercise, placing emphasis on the joint service element of multinational military operations. Successful completion of both would be necessary to attain the fully mission-capable status required for the official assumption of NATO Response Force standby Maritime Component Command duties.



Based on my background as an NFO, I was assigned to the air operations division working as part of the operations planning team ashore and as the deputy director of the maritime air operations center aboard Castilla. With his previous experience as a training and readiness department head, Camua was billeted as a branch head in the training and plans division, working as one of the key officers responsible for the successful overall planning of the upcoming exercises and frequently traveling to represent SPMARFOR at NATO planning conferences.



As we settled into our positions and became integrated within the exercise staff, Camua and I threw ourselves into our roles in the training and operations divisions. However, we soon found out that some of the most important contributions to be made existed outside of our defined roles on the NATO staff.



“Semper Gumby” is an old play on the official U.S. Marine Corps and Coast Guard mottos which are sometimes invoked by service members and first responders to describe the best state of readiness for operational success — staying flexible. Embracing this mantra has been central to the identity of the RC FAO community as it has evolved over the past five years.



Requests for Reserve support have often come on short notice and many of us have needed to respond quickly to an increasing demand for the Reserve team’s operational and diplomatic capabilities. In my case, this meant leaving a new civilian job at the Naval War College and temporarily suspending plans to earn a PhD. For Camua, it meant taking unaccompanied orders away from his wife and two children to an area of responsibility outside of his geographic specialization.



At SPMARFOR, our willingness to adjust as necessary to support operational requirements has allowed us to fill gaps and increase command response time and efficiency. I found that there was never a shortage of documents, speeches and high visibility messages in need of writing and editing. This came in handy during Dynamic Mariner at SPMARFOR where my own cultural and media awareness allowed me to support SPMARFOR’s need for a public affairs officer.



For his part, Camua, without formal training in Spanish, started off with a disadvantage. He went to work immediately in his off-duty time to meet the mission need. He enrolled in Spanish courses and dedicated most of his free time to learning the language. In just one year his progress was exceptional. Additionally, during Dynamic Mariner when there was neither a dedicated billet for a space warfare specialist, Camua volunteered to take on the role, quickly getting up to speed on NATO space warfare guiding documents and procedures.



As we studied our new collateral duties, public affairs and space warfare, we joked that this was all part of our job description as Swiss Army knives of military diplomacy. The description is an apt description for the utility of Reserve FAOs. Regardless of operational background or regional specialty, FAOs are trained to tactfully and effectively represent the U.S. Navy abroad, building relationships and contributing to U.S. and shared allied interests.



For me, the journey that began nearly 20 years ago with a study abroad trip to Spain has come full circle with a successful Reserve tour in the same country. The mission has reinforced my commitment to continue my career in international relations and military diplomacy. I am proud to serve as a representative of the FAO community, and excited to do so as an advocate for the program’s future development.

Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) has released its first sustainability report and announced changes to its lending policy and ambitious targets to work with SMEs to reduce New Zealand’s carbon emissions.

In the next five years, BNZ has committed to delivering $10 billion in sustainable finance and will be embedding a focus on helping intensive carbon emitting customers to transition to new ways of doing business.

A stronger ESG framework to be launched next year will increase investment in businesses and projects that deliver carbon reduction and sustainable benefits. BNZ has also committed to supporting half of all its SME customers (around 100,000 businesses) to adopt and use a Digital Climate Change Toolkit to measure, reduce and report on their emissions by 2025.

Angela Mentis, BNZ CEO, says, “We’re clear about what we stand for. BNZ is a bank that protects the environment, works with its customers to reduce emissions and supports the long-term improvement of the social and financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

“In reporting our impacts today, we are not only showing what we will do to reduce emissions and support New Zealanders, but signaling to the market the types of businesses we want to work with to grow the New Zealand economy in a sustainable way,” she says.

To deliver its sustainability targets, BNZ is committing to two principles that are important to the long-term future of our country: Kaitiakitanga, to accelerate the just transition to a low emissions economy, that supports the regeneration of the natural environment; and Manaakitanga, to grow the long-term social and financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

Mentis says it was important that BNZ’s sustainability strategy reflect a Te Ao Māori worldview that ensures the bank takes an interconnected, long-term and intergenerational view of the way its people work and engage with customers and stakeholders, and BNZ’s impacts on communities and the environment.

Kaitiakitanga: Supporting a transition to a low emissions economy

In addition to the $10 billion sustainable finance target, BNZ will introduce an updated and enterprise-wide ESG framework in 2021, embed sustainability risk as a material risk category and roll out climate risk training for all staff within the next two years.

Mentis says, “It used to be that lending decisions considered a narrow range of economic factors, but new ambitious targets will hardwire sustainability into how we work. We’re serious about changing the way we work and the people we do business with for the benefit of New Zealand and its people.”

Mentis is excited about working with New Zealand’s SMEs to tackle climate change. In partnership with the Sustainable Business Network, BNZ will provide a Digital Climate Change toolkit to its SME customers. The simple self-assessment tool works through an easy to follow step by step ‘climate action journey’ of advice and support. This is then tailored to the specific motivations and conditions of each business and will connect them to good quality existing information, tools and resources.

“SMEs are the lifeblood of the New Zealand economy, they must have a place in a new low carbon economy. The toolkit will be a vital initiative to make it easy for SMEs to increase the sustainability of their operations and have a significant impact on carbon emissions,” she says.

Manaakitanga: Growing long term social and financial wellbeing of all New Zealanders

BNZ’s Sustainability Report outlines initiatives and targets that the bank will focus on to ensure New Zealanders can benefit from the acceleration in digital technology and support those in vulnerable circumstances.

Mentis says, “COVID-19 has changed the economy dramatically and put pressure on businesses and individuals. The future is digital and it’s important that no one gets left behind as the country recovers.”

She says BNZ will build on initiatives such as its dedicated Over 70s phone line and BNZ’s Scam Savvy to support people to feel safe and capable online, and participate in an increasingly digital world. She says the bank is also going to step up its support for people in vulnerable circumstances.

“Everyone can have a moment of vulnerability - it just takes an unexpected life event. We will partner with social organisations across the country to tackle some of the toughest issues we face such as domestic and economic abuse, inadequate housing and access to finance to support families and job seekers,” she says.

Since 2014, BNZ’s Good Loans initiative has partnered with a number of community organisations to offer people on limited incomes fee-free, low-interest and no-interest loans. When COVID-19 hit, BNZ worked with its partner, Good Shepherd NZ, to extend its Community Finance programme, allowing $5 million of no-interest loans to be accessed by families that were financially impacted by the pandemic. The bank also launched a domestic and economic abuse team and received Living Wage Accreditation this year.

332,https://www.act-news.com/news/transit-electrification-leads-to-innovative-partnerships/,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Advanced Clean Tech (ACT) News,Transit Electrification Leads to Innovative Partnerships,"In partnership with: Amply

Bus and shuttle operators are beginning to electrify their fleets in response to a growing number of mandates throughout the country. With public transit agencies edging towards zero-emission buses to satisfy these mandates, which call for improved air quality and health benefits, some leading transit agencies are developing larger, more complex battery electric bus projects that require innovative partnerships to execute.

Electrification Mandates on the Rise

Legislative mandates to meet zero-emission targets are increasing, with states such as California adopting regulations such as the Innovative Clean Transit (ICT) rule in 2018, which requires transit agencies to begin transitioning to a zero-emission fleet as early as 2023, and by 2029, purchasing only zero-emission buses. This was followed by California Governor Gavin Newsom signing an executive order this past September that will ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles starting in 2035 and in 2045 for commercial applications.

Legislative mandates to meet zero-emission targets are increasing, public transit agencies electrify fleets in response.

But the Golden State is not alone, with 14 other states and Washington, D.C. signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreeing to switch to all medium- and heavy-duty trucks, vans, and buses to run on electricity by 2050, with an interim goal of 30% zero-emission vehicles by 2030.

Even with the recent reduction in emissions caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, diesel emissions are still projected to rise in the U.S., pushing state and local governments to curb air quality impacts. With this trend to reduce harmful diesel pollution across the country, transit agencies are moving quickly to procure battery electric buses and shuttles for their fleets. But doing so requires building out the right operational ecosystem for charging and onsite energy storage.

Scaling a Project to Save Millions

Anaheim Transportation Network (ATN) recently broke ground on a project with an estimated potential fuel savings of $4.8 million over the next 20 years for its fleet, due to the addition of 46 electric buses. These significant cost savings are possible for ATN through a combination of forward planning to reduce demand, lowering fueling prices by switching to electric, and ongoing charging management.

Significant cost savings are possible by building out the right operational ecosystem for charging and energy storage.

The 20-year contract developed by AMPLY Power is the first of its kind and the largest Fleet Charge Management Services (CMS) to date. The contract covers the management of ATN’s charging operations from system design, equipment purchase, installation, operations, and maintenance all for a fixed price per kWh consumed. The agreement also includes the construction of a 545kW solar canopy that will provide 25% of the total expected energy consumption.

ATN moves approximately 10 million people annually, as Anaheim is home to Disneyland, two sports complexes, the Anaheim Convention Center, and multiple hotels as well as robust business and residential populations. ATN’s operation began in 2002 with 10 electric buses, but it was unable to expand until recent advancements in battery electric buses improved reliability and cost. ATN took delivery of six battery electric buses from BYD in 2020 and another 40 electric buses are slated for delivery by spring of 2021.

ATN is already planning for the second phase of this project when the fleet grows from 46 electric buses to a full fleet of 82 electric buses by 2025, ahead of the California mandate.

ATN broke ground on an electric bus project with an estimated potential fuel savings of $4.8 million over 20 years.

Combining Infrastructure and Management

The growing size of battery-electric deployments calls for growing innovation, and in November 2020, AECOM, an infrastructure provider to transit agencies, announced a partnership with AMPLY. By combining AMPLY’s operational experience with AECOM’s specialization in large-scale transportation and utility projects, bus and shuttle operators can optimize their infrastructure and operations for electrification.

AECOM specializes in supporting electric fleet conversions by optimizing infrastructure requirements, designing and coordinating utility infrastructure, and siting new facility locations. As a partner, AMPLY offers fully managed charging service for fleets, including charging hardware deployment, management of depot upgrades and utility interconnections, real-time software-controlled charge optimization, debt financing of capital expenditures, and resiliency planning.

The duo’s turnkey solutions offer transit agencies and shuttle providers the qualified, experienced support and expertise they need to electrify their fleets. As bus and shuttle operators move ahead toward zero-emission goals, the significant fuel cost savings and emissions reductions will improve the customer experience, help reduce operating costs, and benefit the environment and public health.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

You're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.

In his plenary address to the audience of Charcha2020 in May this year, Nobel laureate Prof. Muhammad Yunus urged citizens, corporates and governments of the world to seize the “tabula rasa” opportunity gifted to us by the pandemic. Wipe the slate clean—he said, because the past is not what you want to revert to when the pandemic is over.

We now have an unprecedented opportunity to create a future that works for everyone, with nobody left behind. Now six months later, as normalcy starts to take shape, it is apparent that the systems of the pre-COVID era will no longer suffice. Any efforts to restore, or revive the past as we know it will be woefully inadequate for the needs of the future. From education, to healthcare, sanitation to urban housing, there is a need for ab initio solutions that are designed to reach hitherto underserved segments of the population, and for resilience against future shocks.

Social entrepreneurs rising to the occasion

Social entrepreneurs have long been the bridge between government and its citizens. Edtech, agritech, fintech, healthcare, digitized infrastructure, clean energy, climate change and reworking of citizen-state relationships have seen unprecedented innovation, led by social entrepreneurs. As the former education secretary Anil Swarup noted in his NexusofGood blog: “Public-private partnership is the way forward in improving the quality of public (education) systems. Non-profits like Leadership for Equity, Room to read, Right Walk, etc., demonstrate that yet again as they go on to scale their good work after initial experiments through government partnerships.” Innovation is the forte of startups while governments hold the key to scale. The handshake of government and civil society organizations with the DNA of innovation has accelerated the pace of solutions at this critical time.

Nudging Corporate Talent Into Public Sector

While the pandemic has pushed the envelope on innovation, it has also demanded a sense of urgency for large-scale overhaul of public systems. At a time when governments have been on an overdrive managing the demands on the health, economic and humanitarian fronts, the added onus of systems redesign and rapid transformation starts to overwhelm on several fronts. Meanwhile India’s top professionals who have driven our economic growth in diverse sectors are increasingly looking to apply their talent and capabilities to public good.

Having built muscles for agility at scale, senior leaders from multinational corporations can bring strategic acumen and a results-oriented work ethic to bear, in helping visionary civil servants to leverage the tabula rasa opportunity to create systems that effectively serve the citizens of the country. For example, The/Nudge recently launched the Indian Administrative Fellowship, to bring C-suite technology leaders into an 18 month fellowship with state secretaries to work on strategic programs of state-wide importance.

Corporate India’s enthusiastic response to the call for applications—over 1,000 signups in three days—is proof that beyond material success lies the pursuit of purpose.

The role of commercial capital in inclusive development

The last few years have seen a surge in impact investments as well as philanthropic capital (which form 60 per cent of private capital). Post COVID, impact investments in India stand at $11 billion, touching 490 million lives. This has been the wellspring of capital for 11 of India’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, especially the top two—poverty alleviation and zero hunger. Impact investing in social enterprises will continue to grow as needle movers, unclogging the $600 billion needed for India’s Sustainable Development Goals. In parallel, corporate social responsibility has come of age. Seven years since the CSR law came into effect as a mandate, we are starting to see corporate India step up to its social and environmental responsibilities and take an active role in improving public systems and funding public goods.

Policy support

Funding policies for non-profits, from corporates and foreign capital pools, have been long subjected to controversy. While regulation needs to be more rigorous on authenticity checks, data protection, privacy etc., the capital bottleneck here needs to be resolved for serious and scalable innovation in the sector. Bringing these key ideas together, think-tanks with all stakeholder groups need to be activated, and then expedited into implementation. We have to underscore the need for more intentional and proactive public-private sector partnerships, to connect global and domestic investor base. The pandemic has inspired government, businesses and civil society organizations to come together and appreciate the role that each plays. This handshake has the potential to forge strong partnerships to rebuild India, the sustainable way.","Wipe the slate clean—he said, because the past is not what you want to revert to when the pandemic is over.

It also, assists countries to coordinate partnerships with other assistance providers to strengthen their national nuclear security regimes.

“Developing comprehensive, detailed, and prioritized INSSPs provides a strong foundation for focusing the resources, provided to the IAEA through the Nuclear Security Fund and through in-kind contributions, on the identified and requested needs of our Member States,” said Raja Abdul Aziz Raja Adnan, Director of theIAEA’s Division of Nuclear Security in his opening statement at the recent INSSP Points of Contacts meeting held virtually in lieu of the tri-annual Technical Meeting.

Since the first approval of an INSSP in 2006, 112 countries have taken advantage of using the IAEA INSSP mechanism. As of the time of the publication, 88 States have approved their country specific Plans.

“The IAEA manages an average of 600 assistance requests for nuclear security each year, of which 70% are identified through the INSSP process,” said Raja Adnan.

In close consultations with the requesting states, the IAEA develops country-specific INSSP that outline priorities and develop implementation strategies and a timeline for completing the highest priority activities toward enhancing the State’s nuclear security regime. The plan also identifies roles and responsibilities and helps to facilitate internal coordination among the many national authorities responsible for different aspects of the State’s nuclear security regime.

“Clear delineation of responsibilities for implementing the Plan is essential for the efficient use of international assistance, whether from the IAEA or other entities,” said Heba Ezz Eldin Anwar Negm, INSSP Officer at the IAEA’s Division of Nuclear Security. ""Having multiple stakeholders working on the same aspect of national nuclear security regime with assistance from different entities is inefficient for the international community and ineffective for the country’s nuclear security.”

A country’s INSSP takes into account bilateral cooperation with other countries and entities, ongoing or planned, to avoid duplication of international efforts and resources. For instance, Romania invited the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority to take part in its INSSP Finalization Mission to ensure a coordinated approach with an ongoing project on strengthening Romania’s regulatory infrastructure for nuclear safety and security, funded through Norway’s voluntary contribution to the IAEA.

Since 2014 when Egypt signed its INSSP, the national authorities utilized the Plan to coordinate international partners from the United States of America, United Kingdom and Canada and connect them with the appropriate national counterparts.

“With the IAEA we, the regulator, are strengthening our regulatory framework, including in the areas of transport security and physical protection of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities,” said Mahmoud Mohamed, Head of Nuclear Security Department of Egyptian Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Authority. “Partners from the U.S., UK and Canada are assisting with building capacity among the operators of the various facilities.”

Leveraging the content of the INSSP, countries also use the Plan to address their international legal obligations related to nuclear and other radioactive material.

“We established a single National Action Plan to coordinate multiple partners’ support for addressing the country’s legal obligations under the [United Nations Security Council Resolution]1540, the European Union Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear National Action Plan, and the INSSP,” said Ilhom Mirsaidzoda, Director of Nuclear and Radiation Safety of Tajikistan’s National Atomic Energy Authority. “This single National Action Plan is not limited to preventing nuclear terrorism, but encompasses all CBRN-related prevention and control activities.”

The INSSP mechanism and process

A robust national nuclear security regime may involve physical protection of nuclear or other radioactive material and associated facilities and activities, criminalization of offenses involving such material, and detection of material that may be lost, stolen or may be smuggled; and a coordinated response thereto. National nuclear security regimes may look different from country to country, depending on the kind of material in use and the results of national threat and risk assessments. For this reason, IAEA works with States to develop country-specific INSSPs.

The INSSP development process is a systematic and comprehensive approach for helping a State to identify areas, in a manner that maintains confidentiality of sensitive information, where a State’s national nuclear security regime should be strengthened. The priority areas and associated activities are identified by the State, regardless of the organization that might assist the State in addressing the need.

The IAEA and the State assess the State’s nuclear security needs, based on six functional areas: the legislative and regulatory framework, threat and risk assessment, physical protection regime, detection of and response to criminal and unauthorized acts involving material out of regulatory control, and nuclear security regime sustainability. Findings of IAEA advisory missions, like the International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS), the International Nuclear Security Advisory Service (INSServ), and the International Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) may also inform the INSSP.

Despite the travel restrictions preventing fact-to-face INSSP meetings, the IAEA maintains open dialogues with States to review and adapt their INSSP implementation plans.

The tri-annual Technical Meeting of the Points of Contact for INSSP, has rescheduled to 5-7 May 2021, will mark 15 years of the INSSP programme and lessons learnt.","The Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan (INSSP) is a key tool that helps countries coordinate nuclear security assistance from the IAEA.

And then we've protected from threats like invasive species and agricultural pollution.""Brammeier said there is a large front backing the protection of our lakes and tackling its biggest threats in hopes of the achieving long term goals.""Well one of the great things about this region is that it came together about 10 years ago and started to build a program called the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and this is a major investment of federal, state and local money into the Great Lakes, that has brought billions of dollars to bear on restoring and protecting this great water over the last decade,"" he said.Roughly $300 million a year has been dedicated to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, focusing on highly contaminated areas.""So that we are essentially decision maker, at the end of the day, but we want to do that with a lot of input,"" Korleski said. ""The other thing we have to do is we have to make sure that our expenditures, have a lot of taxpayer money. We want to make sure that we follow our action plan, because that five year action plan that is our blueprint for what we hope to do.""The top priority is a continuing problem across the Midwest caused by fertilizer runoff from farming. Notre Dame Professor Jennifer Tank explained one solution already in the works to offset the issue: planting over-crops.""My dream would be to drive around in February. Some year, and see green on the ground, everywhere as long as there isn't if there isn't snow but the types of winters we've been having there hasn't really been that much snow. And what I would want to see is all green sort of blankets protecting the soils of all this farmland around here, to have it be the norm that you would never leave your soils your farm fields, unprotected during this vulnerable time of winter, you'd always plant cover crops you'd always protect them. By having that biomass on the ground, until you're ready to plant the next cash crop so treating the soils and those fields with that kind of care,"" she said.Pollution prevention is not only in the hands of farmers and scientists. Every individual person can help keep more than 22 million lbs. of plastic that ends up in the Great Lakes every year out with a few small changes to our everyday lives.""Imagine any place in your day to day life where you might be able to reduce the amount of waste that you produce or come up with substitutions for your daily activities that might, hopefully be reusable more recyclable more sustainable, you know, none of us are perfect. We can't do this all the time. So, that's important to recognize as well,"" said Loyola University Assistant Professor Tim Hoellein.""If there's any if there's anything you can do substitution, you can make. And for the times that you can make it. That is actually contributing to the solution. And, you know, if no one has said thank you or no one has said I appreciate you doing that, you know, you can hear me saying I thank you and I appreciate you doing that. And on behalf of so many other people, all of our neighbors, all of our children and, you know, the people to come in the future,"" he added.Beneath the waves, a vast ecosystem is in need of protection, including an ancient coral reef in Chicago, just steps from Lake Shore Drive and 51st Street.""Tens of thousands of people are driving past it every day. Hardly anyone knows that it's there or even pays attention to it,"" said Phil Willink, fish biologist. ""So I think what the most important thing is that we get people to realize that Morgan Shoal is out there. There are other places like this possibly nearby, that can be highlighted as well. There's a lot more going on beneath Lake Michigan and we need to appreciate that. And this is a good bit because Lake Michigan is our source of drinking water. It's a source of fishing, it's a source of all kinds of recreation beaches, all of these types of things are all interconnected and we have to figure out better solutions for a lot of these problems. If you want to keep utilizing this resource in a responsible manner.""Protecting an underwater oasis and creating a long term plan to restore and sustain our shoreline will cost more than $71 million for design and construction.""We're actually looking into doing a resiliency study at Great Lakes resiliency, which is a one and a half million dollar study where we're going to actually look at the vulnerabilities of the lakefront and Lake Michigan in general and just come up with well what can we do and just study the situation of the long term.,"" said Michael Padilla, US Army Corps of Engineers Chicago District.""The lakefront is actually also a really big economic driver for the city so if you think of all the festivals and events and concerts and the air show and things that bring in tourists to the city of Chicago,"" said Heather Gleason with the Chicago Park District. ""It's jobs it's, you know, making sure that our city is healthy, from an environmental standpoint you know we want to make sure this is our water source. So all those things come into play and just make the lakefront and the shoreline a critical resource for all of us.""This fragile ecosystem interconnects a complex food web. Invasive species are threatening and disrupting the Lake's natural biodiversity. Asian carp have exploded in population downstream in the Illinois River causing irreversible damage. The Army Corps of Engineers is dedicating millions of dollars to a new multi-phase project to keep the carp out of Lake Michigan.""We're going to use air bubbles to get them out between the barges, we'll be having sounds. As we mentioned they react to motorboat sounds. We're going to use that against them we're going to try and drive them away with sound and then we're also going to use electricity again. So we think that the combination of those technologies will help prevent them from getting into the lock,"" said Jeffrey Zuercher, US Army Corp of Engineers Chicago District.""So another thing that we're working on is educating the public about Asian carp. We want to make sure that when people are out, collecting fish, when they're on the Illinois River. They don't put those fish in their boat and then somehow transport them into the Great Lakes, so there's a lot of education has gone on I know the Illinois Department of Natural Resources has put out a lot of information trying to educate fishermen,"" he added.Already covering the bottom of Lake Michigan are invasive quagga mussels, filtering out food for native fish. New techniques are being tested to remove these mussels. Zequinox is a pesticide injected under anchored tarps, shows a 95% reduction rate after applications.""We need to be open to new ideas and new technology, we've discussed Zequinox with the Great Lakes Commission and the people who are working very closely. Now recently, I just read that, it may actually be a different chemical, but they're looking at another potential technology that may be even more effective against the quagga muscles but the short answer to your question is, we have to keep abreast of new technological advances. We have to keep talking to the experts, and we need to be open to those ideas,"" Korleski said.Climate change is harder to solve. Combating high lake levels and intense temperature swings will take a team of the brightest minds in the region to compose a plan of action to preserve the lakes and cities.""We're seeing more rainfall, we're seeing more intense storms. We're seeing just greater erosion and a lot more water running into the lakes. And that's a hard one to fix, because if you, if you try to address an issue here by building a break wall by doing something you can't just be moving the problem down somewhere else. The other thing I would point out is 2013, 2014, which isn't that long ago, people were very worried because the lake level was so low,"" Korleski explained. ""The knowledge is so many people across the lake. To make the best, the best decisions about what you do.""""What can the general public do? And then what can governments in our country and our states do? And I think those are separate questions. For individuals i think, you know, just using less energy and using less water are both important adaptation and mitigation strategies. So, you know, installing efficient heating and cooling equipment insulating our house. Turning the thermostat down, driving. All of these are things that we can do. Flying less actually very important,"" said Alan Hamlet, associate professor at Notre Dame. ""This problem is going to require us as a nation, and as a member of the international community to work together, globally to solve this problem.""But many remain hopeful it can be solved.""Passionate partnerships and passionate involvement from so many federal agencies from the Great Lakes states from local partners from tribes from organizations from non-governmental organizations. Amazingly enough. They're working well together. And I think they all want to keep working well together. And that's why things are happening,"" said Korleski.""I think betting against humanity is a, is not a good bet. I think we are pretty resourceful, and as many people have said you know as if you're sitting on the beach and the water's coming in, you're not just going to sit there and let the water engulf you, you're going to move back right you're going to take action and, and get out of the way. And we will certainly see that too. I mean, people are not just going to take it they're going to adapt. And we are very adaptable, we know how to do that,"" Hamlet said.""Great Lakes are a huge source of fresh water, and so the fact that we have so much of it here means, I think, that we have an obligation to be good stewards of that incredible resource,"" said Tank.""We actually can make a difference and I think by tackling it one piece at a time by sort of keeping together and making sure everyone's included. You know, I really do. Genuinely I really do believe that these improvements are possible,"" said Hoellein.","EMBED >More News Videos Saving our Great Lakes means tackling multiple threats and problems from multiple angles.

336,https://www.nuwireinvestor.com/8-dos-and-donts-of-real-estate-partnerships/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",NuWire Investor,8 Do’s and Don’ts of Real Estate Partnerships,"Early in the year, the real estate industry was flourishing, despite the chaos unfolding in the average American home. But when the coronavirus knocked on these American’s doors, buyers and sellers employed a wait-and-see strategy. By early March, numerous real estate agents reported that buyer interest reduced by 48 percent. On the other hand, seller behavior remained unphased by the pandemic’s antics.

Despite unemployment rates reaching record highs, the housing market is still hot, meaning prices will increase, hindering affordability. As of October 2020, mortgage rates hovered near historic lows, but there was a short supply of homes for sale. This imbalance leads to bidding wars, pushing prices upwards.

Given the real estate market’s vitality, you may want to consider bringing on a real estate partner to maximize profits. While you may be skeptical about forming a real estate partnership, it presents many benefits that can help you conquer the real estate sector. Partnering up in real estate creates synergies in resources and expertise, helps expand networks, boosts morale and accountability, and facilitates sharing the workload.

If you’re primed for success in the housing market, it would be best to consider a real estate partnership. Should you decide to venture down the partnership route, consider pulling in a lawyer who can help streamline the process and ensure both parties reach an agreement regarding the partnership conditions. To help you get started, you should recruit legal experts like WH Law when you begin to structure a real estate partnership.

Secrets to a working partnership

Partners bring assets, client networks, or expertise that you don’t have. But be warned that a two-is-better-than-one mentality could potentially lead you astray. Coupling up with a partner who can help you maximize the benefits of real estate partnerships is difficult but possible.

That said, consider the below dos and don’ts if you want to form a long-lasting, working real estate partnership.

Set common objectives

How can real estate partners work in unison unless they agree on their top priorities? When forming a real estate partnership, both partners should share the same mindset.

For example, both parties will need to agree on holding the property for five years before selling it. Having the same objectives deter disagreements and helps real estate moguls cultivate long-term relationships.

Do your due diligence

You shouldn’t form a real estate partnership with just anyone. Choosing the right partner is the key to unlocking the full potential of a partnership. That said, conduct your research to identify a partner that compliments your skills and can be trusted.

Communicate regularly and effectively

You are partners. And what partners do best is to communicate. Promote a communication-friendly environment that’s conducive to brainstorming sessions, productive discussions, and even respectful disagreements.

Define roles and expectations

Before entering into a partnership, you must pinpoint each partner’s roles and responsibilities. Clearly-defined objectives mitigate the risk of conflicts, discrepancies, and wrongful assumptions.

Conduct a self-evaluation

While setting up a partnership, you might spend too much time vetting potential partners, inhibiting you from looking inward. What are your strengths and weaknesses? How do you handle conflicts? Is it easy to work with you? Developing an honest opinion of yourself is just as important as evaluating your prospective partners’ reliability.

Don’t rush to form a partnership

Will a real estate partnership actually benefit you? Don’t lose sight of your goals or allow yourself to become overly excited over the prospect of a partnership. Instead, take the time to consider alternatives before taking the leap.

Only commit to a partnership if it’s the most viable alternative. Recklessly expediting the process can lead to the formation of a poorly-structured partnership that will crumble in a few months’ time.

Don’t overpromise

It’s better to under-promise and over-deliver. Otherwise, overpromising and then failing to deliver leads to disagreements and reduced trust.

Don’t be unfair

Just because someone is ready to invest their time and money into you doesn’t mean you throw them in the deep end of deals coming your way. Treat their assets with the same care and consideration you do your own, and don’t let them invest in their money unwisely.

To conclude

Your business will generate more leads and boost profits with the help of a real estate partnership. However, when embarking on this real estate partnership journey, observe the above helpful tips to construct a rock-solid partnership.","Given the real estate market’s vitality, you may want to consider bringing on a real estate partner to maximize profits.

Joe Hopkins, Detective III, Los Angeles Police Department

“When building public-private partnerships, or any meaningful partnerships for that matter, I believe that it’s extremely important that all parties involved carry an open mind and be considerate of the issues and responsibilities impacting their counterparts,” said Hopkins. “While we may ultimately share the same goals, quite often the priorities of each organization may not always fully align. We can have different perspectives and different approaches, so it is imperative to establish common ground. Cooperation and mutual respect provide the foundation that everything else is built upon.”

A twenty-three-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Hopkins has worked various detective assignments such as crimes against persons, burglary, financial crimes, and commercial crimes, among others. His current assignment is with Commercial Crimes Division, Cyber Crimes Section, and he is the section’s community business coordinator where he serves as the liaison to numerous public-private partnerships, including the Los Angeles Area Organized Retail Crimes Association (LAAORCA). He is an advising board member for the International Association of Financial Crimes Investigators (IAFCI), a director of Law Enforcement and Private Security (LEAPS), and was instrumental in the founding of the California Organized Retail Crimes Association (Cal-ORCA). He was recently named a board member for the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail (CLEAR).

“Early in my career I realized the value of working together—employing resources outside of my department to further my investigative efforts and resolve issues,” he said. “My advice to young leaders is to be both receptive and outgoing while forming strong professional relationships. It is equally important to cultivate relationships through flexibility, creativity, ongoing communication, and genuine respect.”","The LPM “Magpie” Awards offer a means to celebrate industry accomplishments on an ongoing basis, recognizing the loss prevention professionals, teams, solution providers, law enforcement partners, and others that demonstrate a stellar contribution to the profession.

339,https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20201224/earth-today-research-partnerships-must-blue-economy-thrive,"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Jamaica Gleaner,"Earth Today | Research, partnerships a must for blue economy to thrive","The Prioritisation of research and development, together with tailored capacity building and awareness raising are said to be vital components of a needed overall framework to realise a resilient blue economy, especially in the face of a changing climate.

These are included in a raft of recommendations by respected Caribbean scientists who recently penned a chapter in the book titled The Caribbean Blue Economy, which was edited by Peter Clegg, Robin Mahon, Patrick McConney and Hazel A. Oxenford. It was published in October.

“A resilient blue economy across spatial and time scales should form part of an overarching, cohesive sustainable development framework in the region, even for physical, human, technical, financial and social systems indirectly associated with marine resources,” writes Jamaican researchers Dr Mona Webber and Dr Michael Taylor, who are both professors at The University of the West Indies, Dr Tannecia Stephenson and Felicia Whyte in their chapter of the book.

They also list a range of response measures to advance the blue economy, which is comprised, according to the 2017 World Bank Report on the subject, of “established traditional ocean industries such as fisheries, tourism, and maritime transport, but also new and emerging activities, such as offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive activities, and marine biotechnology and bioprospecting”.

“A number of services provided by ocean ecosystems, and for which markets do not exist, also contribute significantly to economic and other human activity such as carbon sequestration, coastal protection, waste disposal and the existence of biodiversity,” adds the World Bank Report titled ‘The Potential of the Blue Economy: Increasing Long-term Benefits of the Sustainable Use of marine Resources for Small Island Developing States and Coastal Least Developing Countries’.

The Jamaican researchers, meanwhile, recommend among the response measures for a resilient blue economy, the establishment of a sustainability process for the effective implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures, while leveraging co-benefits.

“Within the region, adaptation and mitigation measures are sometimes not implemented as part of a broader, holistic approach, to the detriment of sustainability. As such, the development and implementation of adaptation and mitigation efforts should be supported by rigorous assessment, ranking and prioritisation, with significant consideration given to the effectiveness of the measures in a progressively warming world,” Taylor and the others write.

“Monitoring the measures over the long term to ensure expected benefits are being derived, should be emphasised and any negative impacts are proactively addressed. Education, training and empowerment of local community groups in, or near to, the intervention areas will also be key,” they add.

AN INTEGRATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

On the matter of prioritised research, they maintain that the blue economy should be bolstered by “an integrated research and development agenda that pulls from academia, government, private sector and multilateral resources (human and financial) to address current and future problems; fosters evidenced-based decision-making; promotes the development of new technologies, techniques, methods and tools; focuses on maximising benefits, reducing threats, identifying new opportunities and where possible, converting threats into opportunities; as well as replicates and scales up successful models”.

When it comes to capacity building, education and sensitisation, Webber, Taylor and the others argue in favour of “‘positive transformation in the knowledge, attitudes and practices of blue economy stakeholders”. To make that happen, they propose, among other things, the targeted education of stakeholders on how to protect and conserve the marine environment; development of a cadre of professionals who will lead implementation efforts; and the enhanced capacity of governments and other stakeholders to effectively sensitise and educate users of marine resources, as well as the general populace.

The World Bank, for its part, has noted a set of parametres for a blue economy – globally worth between US$1.5 trillion and US$3 trillion a year or about three to five percent of all economic activity in the world. They include the need for public and private actors to set clear, measurable, and internally consistent goals and targets for a Sustainable Blue Economy; to plan, manage, and effectively govern the use of marine space and resources, applying inclusive methods and the ecosystem approach; as well as to recognise that the maritime and land-based economies are interlinked and that many of the threats facing marine environments originate on land.

By Rebecca Hick, Director, Experience Center Asia.

A chief information officer of a regional carmaker group was feeling frustrated. He realized that he was sitting on troves of valuable data, but much of it was locked away in siloes or shackled to outdated processes. He couldn’t effectively mine the data to give company leaders the insights they needed to understand their fast-changing market and customers.

For help, he turned to Microsoft’s Experience Center Asia (ECA), a regional flagship facility in Singapore designed to be a state-of-the-art destination for digital transformation. But the Experience Center Asia team was facing its own challenge: just months after cutting the ribbon on the center, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the shutdown of the physical space.

This one-stop shop where enterprise customers from across industries can go hands-on with the latest products and services from Microsoft and our partners, as well as hear about insights and best practices gathered from across the world, had to completely reinvent itself for a world that had gone remote and digital with breathtaking speed.

The ECA – Microsoft Technology Centers (MTC) team sprang into action, bringing in Microsoft experts and external partners from around the world to identify pain points, design a new architecture and produce a set of recommendations to move the company from a disjointed system to a unified data platform aligned with business goals. All of this happened in the span of less than four months, despite the lockdowns and restrictions.

The pandemic upended the world and challenged everyone’s notions of how we work and connect with each other. But solving unique business challenges is precisely the mission of ECA.

Working from home amid a sea of uncertainty, the team quickly reimagined how to digitally transform to deliver meaningful outcomes for customers through virtual briefings, insightful consultations, and compelling experiences.

The result: a near tripling in customer engagements and, more importantly, faster time-to-value and time-to-innovation for our participating customers. It turned out that removing physical limits means that customers can have conversations that are more efficient, focused, and impactful.

For example, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with interests ranging from retail to shipping to telecoms, sought help with ensuring business continuity during the pandemic, but their teams were scattered across many countries and industries. Under the old model, it would have been near impossible to hold in-person briefings for everyone at a single location. But our new digital-first approach allowed us to design and stage a virtual roadshow that reached 700 executives around the world.

The power of partnerships

This approach has rippled throughout our global Customer Engagement Teams, which are hosting hundreds of virtual engagements every single day. They conduct demos, showcase immersive Microsoft experiences such as HoloLens 2, and, importantly, shine the spotlight on one of our greatest strengths: our partners and their innovative solutions.

Customers love hearing from partners in our ecosystem and to see examples of success or learn about product offerings that address their needs. The new virtual approach enables us to bring more partners into these conversations earlier

A timely example would be the ECA’s virtual experience that showcases The Diary, maker of a digital platform that delivers personalized health services to patients, such as chronic care management and disability care. As hospitals everywhere struggled to cope with the pandemic, The Diary developed a COVID-19 solution to help triage patients and have them receive care without having to visit a hospital. This was soon adopted by an Australian hospital network to cope with increasing healthcare demand.

A spirit of openness and sharing has been key to making these partnerships work for customers. In one case, a major airport in New Zealand, reeling under the impact of the pandemic, seized the moment to embrace digital transformation. The airport had millions of visitors every year, but had no easy access to data and insights on most visitors, and what they were interested in.

The ECA team, realizing the importance of embracing a partner on the ground in New Zealand, worked hand-in-hand with Aware Group, specialists in AI and automation. Together with experts from MTC, the ECA team and Aware Group ran a unique hybrid workshop to better understand the airport’s needs and priorities, seamlessly collaborating to produce a technology roadmap and platform prototype to power the airport of the future.

Get ready to ride the Third Wave

So, what’s next? It may seem pointless to try to predict tomorrow when uncertainty grips today. But some trends are already clear. The world is entering a Third Wave of computing, an era defined by mixed reality and an “intelligent edge” of smart, connected devices. COVID-19 has brought that vision into sharp focus. Businesses need insights, fast. They want to understand their customers’ rapidly changing needs. We want to showcase first-hand what that means for our customers and bring to life Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.

Just as importantly, people increasingly expect companies and brands to lead in the area of social good. Digital transformation is not just about productivity and profitability, but about building a more just and equitable society. We have an ethical obligation to enable that change. Initiatives like AI for Good, and our commitment to reskill 25 million workers around the world – including 1.5 million here in Asia so far this year — to prepare for the tech-enabled jobs of the future are steps in that direction.

ECA is more passionate than ever to showcase what is possible with solutions from Microsoft and our partners. As we cautiously reopen our physical space, we have an exciting opportunity to blend the virtual and physical worlds through mixed reality. We can help companies, educators, and organizations visualize and contextualize the data they need to better serve their customers and communities. And we will strive to bring digital transformation to audiences that have been traditionally underserved.

See for yourself what Experience Center Asia and our many partners can do for you. Reach out to your Microsoft account manager or partner representative to start the conversation around your digital-transformation strategy and how you can prepare for the Third Wave.","Microsoft Experience Center Asia: Reimagining the future through partnershipsBy Rebecca Hick, Director, Experience Center Asia.

The final Place North West conference of 2020 saw key figures from the public sector take to the virtual stage to examine the ins and outs of partnerships with the private sector, fundamental to the delivery of so many schemes.

The event was sponsored by Waterman, DAC Beachcroft, Telcom and Three Sixty and hosted through the Remo events platform.

A full video recording of the event is available here.

Panel One – How are local authorities managing to keep things on track at a time when scant resources are challenged further by macroeconomic contraction?

John Bowker, director of property services, Stockport Homes Group

Christopher Stanwell, head of planning, DAC Beachcroft

Tim Heatley, co-founder, Capital & Centric

Sean Anstee, chairman, Trafford Housing Trust

Becca Heron, director of economy & skills, Wigan Council

Wigan’s Becca Heron said the move to more local shopping has shown the need that’s still there: “Covid has taken a lot of our attention this year, but it has emphasised the importance of our economic strategy, especially diversifying our town centres as retail’s role is reduced. We’re continuing with procurement for the Galleries in Wigan, and are progressing with the Future High Street fund for Leigh.”

She continued: “The ‘towns as the new cities’ idea was something we fortuitously put forward a year ago, and there’s no doubt the pandemic has made people re-evaluate their relationship with place. Although there’ll be a return to the office, commuting patterns will change. Quality of place is key, whether private or shared.

“In residential terms, what towns can offer is central living with a level of access to schools and health you don’t get in city centres. Viability can be the main issue.”

Capital & Centric has been prominent both in central Manchester and in towns such as Stockport. Tim Heatley said there’s a lot to be gained from working in partnerhip:

“We like working with the public sector because we like the outcomes it creates beyond property, there are exciting things with social impact. The good thing about partnership is that one party can take pressure off the other at times over complex, long-term projects and ride waves out.

“Town cente were serving a demographic that’s not there so much now, and the future lies in attracting younger people, those who moved to Manchester for university or work from all over: why wouldn’t they want the space, character and benefits of a town, with the appeal of Manchester 15 minutes away too?”

In Heatley’s view, institutions might start to back suburban development – 300-home sites with energy-efficient systems, and amenities built alongside saying: “The ‘weight of money’ that we hear a lot of talk about lies in funds where public pensions are, and the people who manage those are increasingly keen to demonstrate social outcomes that consumers want to see.”

What impact has 2020 had on a housing trust bought in 2019 by L&Q, one of the sector’s biggest players? Sean Anstee said: “What we want to achieve hasn’t changed, and the big issues haven’t changed: we still need more affordable homes in this region. As providers re-set, we’ll see more creativity. Ultimately, being focused on end outcome will be part of the economic solution, stopping building won’t help.

Warning against value-engineering, he said “when things go wrong, people often go for significantly higher densities and poorer quality – as an industry we need to make sure we’re not throwing up things we won’t be proud of in 25 years”. This is not a time to not compromise, he added.

Christopher Stanwell said that much client thought is going into repurposing retail: “We’re seeing a lot of people trying to work out what to do with space, exploring what could be repurposed for logistics and housing. Partners have to bring their respective skills and among what councils can offer, the ability to borrow money long-term and CPO powers are particularly useful.

Like Heatley, he said there’s definitely an eagerness to explore socially-minded projects among institutions. “It’s not just theorising: lots of big organisations have ambitious CSR targets: we’ve seen that high street brands that fail to deliver have withered and died. Customers want things to reflect their aspirations.”

As welcome as town centre residential can be in revivifying central areas, John Bowker warned against ‘too much too soon’:

“With investment coming in, we need not to lose sight of people who need us as towns become cool to live in: we need to maximise social impact, generate local jobs and not price people out. Can we use this investment to bring about real social and economic change?”

Bowker, who presented on the work being delivered by the Stockport Homes Group, including the Three Sixty building arm, added:

“As an organisation, we’re a safety net to many people, and with the impacts on the economy coming, there will likely be more people in need of support.”

Bowker added that “big challenges lie ahead” for the building sector, such as delivering zero-carbon and introducing more modular development.

Panel Two

Gerry Brough, director of place, Bolton Council

John Laverick, head of development, Warrington & Co

Caroline Simpson, corporate director for place, Stockport Council

Cllr Peter Moss, deputy leader, Preston City Council

Do local authorities still have firepower, or are they hamstrung by Covid?

Caroline Simpson said it’s full steam ahead in Stockport: “We’ve ploughed on through 2020, and have some significant private investment projects going through planning.

As is the first session, there was agreement that public space can be a strength ofr towns over the larger cities. Simpson agreed but warned “it’s easier said than done – we’re advancing a two-acre park, which has only been possible with equity commitments from the council, GMCA and transport monies, in a scheme delivered with a transport interchange and a residential block”.

As to what councils look for in developers, she said: “We want to work with developers who understand what a council’s priorities are, but also show some commitment and initiative, rather than just asking officers to ‘tell us about your sites’. A good “how-to” example would be Muse, Stockport’s partner on the Exchange scheme, she said.

One intriguing idea is a housing product to appeal to middle-aged “empty nesters” freeing up sought-after family housing and creating a market for town centre retail & leisure: “If we can crack this, it’s a huge opportunity, bringing to areas close to town centres an active population with disposable income and time to spend.”

While Bolton’s Gerry Brough admitted council investment will be tougher to secure post-Covid, he said “we have committed £37m of the £100m town centre investment plan announced in 2017, and still have leeway: no one’s hinting at slowing down or pulling out among our development partners”.

One thing Bolton’s been a beneficiary of is changing sentiment around affordability. Brough said: “We decided not to ask for affordable housing to be included as a must on town centre schemes, but what’s happened is that schemes are coming forward with good amounts of affordable housing because the funding environment for registered providers is healthy, so partnerships are working well.

“There is a balancing act: RPs are reluctant to go taller than five storeys, so densities are low and completion numbers are impacted, but that emphasis on more traditional homes does bring in families. It shows the need for flexibility.”

Not uncommonly, Warrington is amid a long-term plan to bring in more residential and offices to the town centre.

John Laverick said: “We’ve invested heavily in Time Square and that’s starting to bear fruit in the surrounding areas. Developing our infrastructure is key, both to enable town centre regeneration and to encourage more cycling and walking. Everyone benefits from a more attractive environment.

“Viability can hold back affordable housing in some areas, and it’s something you have to be flexible with: if it’s not quite possible, but the intention’s there and the proposal is well thought through, that deserves support and we’d rather see something delivered than not. You have to be pragmatic.”

The only elected member on the panel, Cllr Peter Moss, said “what’s driven Preston is trying to make the city centre a calm, enjoyable place to be for anyone, from 8 years old to 80.

“We’ve had an emphasis on increasing city centre living, and that’d supporting bars, restaurants and shops – there’s room for more.”

Moss also touched on the “Preston model,” city’s economic approach to community wealth-building. He said: “Buying locally doesn’t stop us working with major contractors: Balfour Beatty are delivering one of our largest projects, but all their sub-contractors come from within 40 miles of Preston. We’re very open – there are 100 organisations in the Preston Partnership, all talking to each other.”","Meet the Authorities: public-private partnerships Comments (0)The final Place North West conference of 2020 saw key figures from the public sector take to the virtual stage to examine the ins and outs of partnerships with the private sector, fundamental to the delivery of so many schemes.

Nevertheless, Farmer – who was appointed in May at the height of COVID-19 – says that her main goals when coming into the company hadn’t changed due to the pandemic.

These goals were: creating an environment where people have the courage to be proactive and not wait to be told what to do; pushing beyond current limitations; and keeping customers and patients at the heart of why Sanofi does what it does.

Luckily, the company has found ways to keep working towards these objectives despite COVID disruption – proving that big pharma companies can be more adaptive than outside observers might expect.

On the patient side of things, for example, there were many decisions the company had to take quickly in order to help and protect their health during lockdown. Some patients’ monthly home deliveries were switched to three-monthly to reduce resources and minimise their contact with others, and Sanofi also increased its home blood-taking services to free up hospital resources and help shield patients.

Meanwhile, the company worked closely with the NHS and private healthcare providers, particularly for oncology medicines to explore locations that would enable people with cancer to continue with their treatments in a safe place.","Nevertheless, Farmer – who was appointed in May at the height of COVID-19 – says that her main goals when coming into the company hadn’t changed due to the pandemic.

Expanding the benefits of clean, renewable solar energy to underrepresented low-income, BIPOC or frontline communities is a priority for state-level regulators. While some states have struggled to deliver, Oregon’s community solar program provides a unique platform to bring solar to frontline communities by successfully leveraging public-private partnerships and providing flexible project structure and financing alternatives.

The Oregon Community Solar Program (ORCSP) kicked off in early 2020. Similar to other states that propped up community solar programs, the ORCSP implemented legislation which included a mandate to “determine a methodology by which 10% of the total generating capacity of the [CSP] projects will be made available for use by low-income residential customers,” according to Oregon Senate Bill 1547 (2016). Through an extended rulemaking process, the public utility commission has translated this mandate into standards that require diversification of the subscriber pool for each project as follows:

10% of the subscribers for each project must be low income (defined as a household earning less than 80% of the area median income)

No single subscriber may account for more than 40% of a project and may not subscribe to more than 2 MW ac of capacity across all participating utilities during the pertinent ORCSP tranche.

of capacity across all participating utilities during the pertinent ORCSP tranche. 40% of project capacity is reserved for residential/small commercial customers while up to 50% can be allocated to large commercial customers.

Participants must subscribe to a community solar project in their utility territory. Portland General Electric (PGE), Pacific Power (PAC) and Idaho Power (IDP) are participating utilities.

These standards target outcomes that manifest the policy objectives of the state to spread the benefits of solar to new constituencies that would otherwise not have access. These standards also add complexity to the solar facility development process.

Creativity and collaboration are paramount for organizations like Oregon Shines, who represent registered project managers within the program to assist in subscribing to their projects. Partnerships with public agencies have proven to be a viable path to meeting the economic needs of the project and the community benefit objectives of the ORCSP.

One such partnership has been founded in Portland Community College (PCC), whose Sustainability Department has forward-thinking approaches to meeting internal climate goals. A leader of participation in the ORCSP, PCC has chosen to offset a large portion of its PGE electricity consumption with community solar.

An aspect of the ORCSP is the ability given to subscribers to maintain ownership of the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) generated by their subscription which allows agencies, such as PCC, an alternative to simply buying RECs. Through community solar, participants are gaining an opportunity to support local solar projects while also saving an average of 5% on their subscribed electricity annually.

Partnerships, such as the one between Oregon Shines and PCC, set the precedent for all consumers of electricity, large commercial or residential, to look at their energy consumption and ask themselves what options they have to mitigate the environmental impact of their consumption while also maximizing economic benefits.

Community solar offers a harmonious match between the two. The balance between access and affordability is exactly what makes the program an attractive opportunity for low-income qualified consumers of electricity.

Community Energy Project (CEP), the designated low-income facilitator for the ORCSP, has been working to fulfill the low-income requirements of the program through outreach and education to communities who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in the green revolution. Going solar has traditionally meant the installation and maintenance of solar panels on site, which excludes a vast majority of the population who may not have the financial means or a roof of their own to support solar panels.

The program offers a multitude of opportunities for public-private partnerships that can advance this aspect of the program, and it will be exciting to see what partnerships are cultivated to bring solar and savings to those who have historically been barred from reaping the many benefits that solar has to offer.

ORCSP allows flexibility in contracting for low-income subscriber participation. Project managers may contract directly with rate paying low-income households, or contract with affordable housing providers, including public housing authorities. This flexibility lets low-income families take their bill credit with them when relocating, but also gives the project managers the efficiency to contract for entire buildings to meet the 10% threshold for community solar projects.

When contracting with affordable housing providers, the ORSCP standard requires that 75% of the financial benefit go directly to the low-income household, ensuring that either contracting method satisfies the community benefit objectives of the program.

There are many opportunities and possibilities on the horizon in Oregon that have been ushered in by the ORSCP. Programs such as this need public-private partnerships to help them take root, grow and thrive and that process is just beginning with the ORCSP. With strategic, well-established partnerships in place between the many organizations that have been working to make this program a success, community solar will continue to offer benefits and rewards to communities throughout Oregon for years to come.

“The fight against AIDS can be won, but it requires unwavering global partnerships. It is, therefore, a call to us all to join this cause by recommitting to invest in human capital and building a foolproof system, as the surest way to reach our goals and sustain them,” Mrs. Kagame tweeted on Tuesday 1st December.

Every year, the world celebrates World AIDS day on 1st December. On this day, the world takes time to reflect upon the worldwide response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by remembering the millions of lives lost over the past four decades, celebrates achievements over the past year, and pledges to work in even more inclusive and innovative ways over the coming year.

The World AIDS Day 2020 themed “Global solidarity, resilient services” aims at reminding communities to work together, focus on impact by using data to deliver high quality, people-centered HIV prevention, and treatment services to those most in need.

The celebration of World AIDS day aims at tackling stigma and discrimination and empowering communities. It also reaffirms the essential role of resilience, which enables individuals and communities to meet the challenge of HIV/AIDS even in times of adversity.

According to Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV prevention, testing, and treatment are all being disrupted worldwide particularly in countries where healthcare infrastructure is weak.

“Breakdown in essential HIV services due to COVID-19 is threatening lives,” she said.

“We must fight on with passion and we must keep human rights at the center of our societies and of our health systems or we will not end the HIV epidemic.”

The United Nations indicates that globally, 12.6 million people living with HIV/AIDS still don’t have access to treatment and an estimated 38,000,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2019.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed almost 33 million lives so far.

By June 2020, 26 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy, marking a 2.4% increase from an estimate of 25.4 million at the end of 2019 while 85% of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV also received antiretroviral therapy(ART), according to WHO.

“Health is a human right – and universal health coverage must be a top investment priority. To overcome COVID-19 and end AIDS, the world must stand in solidarity and share responsibility,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.

A funding call that supports research into Covid-19 and its impact on some of the world’s most disadvantaged people has awarded grants to 20 projects.



The projects, including one led by University of Glasgow’s Professor Fabrice Renaud, will develop solutions to mitigate the short and long-term social, economic and health consequences of the pandemic.



Vulnerable communities

Researchers and experts from the UK and across developing countries will work in partnership to directly address the negative impacts of COVID-19 on communities which are already vulnerable due to issues such as long-term conflict, food and water shortages, and crowded living conditions.



Fabrice Renaud is a Professor in Environmental Risk/Community Resilience based in the College of Social Sciences’ School of Interdisciplinary Studies in Dumfries.



His project will investigate the social and environmental impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnamese provinces bordering China and Laos following border closure.



The project is a partnership between the University of Glasgow (School of Interdisciplinary Studies and School of Geographical and Earth Sciences) and the Vietnam National University – Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies and the Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Vietnam.



Professor Renaud said: “We hope our research will achieve impact locally, by providing scientific evidence to local and national policy-makers as to the situation of vulnerable communities and of their environment, as well as developing future scenarios of this situation under various assumptions of the evolution of the pandemic and potential cross border movement”.



“We are partnering with local authorities and aim to provide scientifically-grounded advice on amending existing policies so that ethnic minority dominated regions can receive the appropriate support to ensure we are “leaving no one behind”, the stated aim of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals”



Dr Hue Le from the Vietnam National University – Central Institute for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies said “In Vietnam, the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is particularly exacerbated for vulnerable groups, especially ethnic female migrant workers.



“With their main sources of income lost and receiving very little to no support from the government, these communities are having problems making ends meet. Our research findings will inform decision makers on how to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 crisis in a more just and inclusive way in the uplands, better addressing the needs of all vulnerable people in Vietnam as well as in other countries in the region”.



These awards are the second tranche to be announced by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded through the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and the Newton Fund.



After a first group of 20 projects were announced in September, it means a total of 40 partnerships are working across every part of the Global South. They are investigating everything from improving health systems in Africa to how the pandemic is affecting fishing communities, displaced people and people with disabilities.



£14.5 million investment

The Agile COVID-19 GCRF and Newton Fund has invested £14.5 million into the projects. The projects have brought together more than 100 universities and hundreds of other partners operating in 39 countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania.



They build on the multidisciplinary partnerships formed through the two global funds over the past four years. They have enabled rapid new partnerships between the international development research community, other academics, policy makers, governments, businesses and community groups across the UK and the rest of the world. The projects will be carried out over the next 18 months.



Ms. Ann Nyambura Wanyoike, the Manager, Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya, and a member of the peer review panel that assessed the project proposals, said: “This Agile call was a timely and invaluable platform for innovative research ideas that showcased the potential impact of multidisciplinary approaches for tackling the global pandemic. The call drew a broad cross-section of researchers and partnerships from across the globe to spearhead novel proposals and innovations towards current policy or practice in the understanding of, response to, and recovery from COVID-19 in developing countries, with the capacity to deliver lasting impacts on livelihoods too.”



Many strong proposals

Fellow peer review panelist, Professor Dr Ruzy Suliza Hashim, Centre for Research in Language and Linguistics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, added: “There were many strong proposals that highlight the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted developing countries. The variety of inquiries and solutions to problems and challenges that different nations and communities experience in handling the pandemic require collaborative efforts of international partners. I was impressed with the scholarship and commitment from various academic and industry partners well as NGOs from across the world and this breadth of experience is central across all these project teams.”



Further Information

Social and environmental impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnamese provinces bordering China and Laos following border closure project

Northern provinces in Vietnam that border China and Laos have been severely affected economically by the current Covid-19 pandemic. These provinces have high populations of ethnic minority groups who rely in part on cross border migration to sustain their families’ livelihoods. With border closure, major sources of income were foregone and because loss of employment in a foreign country is not recognised by Vietnamese social protection mechanisms in the context of this crisis, entire communities have had to develop their own coping mechanisms.



For example, some communities have increasingly started to rely on their surrounding natural environment. It is not clear how effective these and other coping measures are, nor what the long run consequences on natural resources will be.



This project aims to investigate how the current crisis has shaped the relationship between vulnerable communities and their natural environment by combining different scientific approaches. We will investigate the economic and environmental consequences of

Covid-19 related border closure on the most vulnerable households of three border provinces in Northern Vietnam.","A funding call that supports research into Covid-19 and its impact on some of the world’s most disadvantaged people has awarded grants to 20 projects.

Yang Yang Zhang, managing director at Xendit Philippines, said the Indonesia startup is willing to support the digital transformation of banks in the country to reach the underserved and unbanked areas.

“I think that we are trying to be as inclusive as possible. So we’re really open to working with anyone,” Zhang told The STAR in a virtual interview.

Zhang said Xendit continues to expand its portfolio in the Philippines while playing an active role in building meaningful partnerships to positively impact the economy.

“Just as we try to work on digital transformation journeys for our customers, we also want to do that for our partners,” she said.

She said the fintech wants to offer its assistance and skills set to banks that are embarking on their digital transformation journeys.

“I think our incentives are really aligned, they want their bank accounts to have more usability, we want to help them realize that,” Zhang said.

Xendit recently strengthened its partnership with GrabPay by further expanding its top up options.

“We are actually releasing BDO Direct debit for GrabPay. It is going to be a limited release but it will slowly roll out over the next couple of weeks,” Zhang said.

She said direct debit would change the world for Southeast Asia as consumers would be able to link their accounts for online transactions.

Zhang explained the process would also allow merchants to allow their customers to use their bank accounts.

She said Xendit is strongly supporting the three-year digital transformation roadmap of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) that aims to transform the Philippines into a cash-lite from a cash-heavy economy.

BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno has committed to raise the share of digital transactions to total transactions to 50 percent as well as the percentage of Filipino adults with bank accounts to 70 percent by 2023.

The goal could be achieved earlier than expected due to the shift in consumer behavior amid the coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think the pandemic has done a lot in convincing people about the value of contactless payment. Because now it is not just a matter of convenience but a matter of safety,” Zhang said.

Jonathan Bates, head of GrabPay Philippines, said there is a growing trend to digital payments and those who have embraced it cited that they enjoy the convenience, the quick transaction time and low processing fees.

Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter

Cooperation between Government and the private sector must be increased to meet targets set under the policies crafted to attain national development goals, President Mnangagwa said yesterday after touring PPC Zimbabwe milling plant in Harare’s Sunway City Industrial Park.

The company was already making cement in Colleen Bawn and Bulawayo before opening the Harare factory in 2017.

The National Development Strategy gives priority to the private sector in increasing manufacturing and wealth, while the Government boosts infrastructure and ensures the private sector can access resources.

“My Government remains committed to engaging the private sector through tours and visits such as this one as these enable us to collectively reflect on the course we are taking,” said the President.

“Under the Second Republic, we are accelerating private sector-driven economic growth and prosperity. There is no ‘us and them’. Together let us redouble our efforts to leapfrog the attainment of our national development targets as outlined in both the Transitional Stabilisation Plan and the National Development Strategy.

“I look forward to more invitations from industry and commerce in the near future in our quest to ensure development that leaves no one behind.”

Following the success of the TSP that brought stability in the economy, President Mnangagwa launched the NDS1, a five-year economic blueprint that runs from 2021-2025 to lead efforts to create a middle income economy by 2030.

President Mnangagwa said the cement industry had a critical role to play in the economy as infrastructure development was one of the enablers for modernisation, industrialisation and provision of services for economic growth.

“The anticipated massive growth of road, dam and housing construction projects entails that our cement production, which is an indispensable ingredient in infrastructure development, expands in tandem with the projected demand,” he said.

President Mnangagwa acknowledged that the cement industry was facing challenges such as competition from imports.

Government will continue to craft measures to ensure continued viability of the cement industry.

The President challenged the industry to adopt latest production technologies that will be competitive on international markets.

“I exhort the industry to ride on our Education 5.0 Model, the innovation hubs and industrial parks within our institutions of higher learning for import substitution,” he said.

Institutions of higher learning have huge potential to help transform the country.

The University of Zimbabwe has already patented 70 products this year.

Guided by the devolution agenda and anticipated development within provinces and districts, President Mnangagwa challenged PPC to ensure that quality products were easily accessible and affordable to all market segments throughout the country.

Results of a survey commissioned by Government to assess the provinces GDPs and per capita GDPs would be made public soon.

PPC managing director Mr Kelibone Masiyane said the company had confidence in Zimbabwe and thanked Government for the initiatives that have now stabilised the economy.

“We as PPC Zimbabwe have shown confidence in the development and success of the Zimbabwean economy. Through significant investment, PPC has cemented their role in the growth of the economy.

“The Harare plant is one such project that has played a part in showing our belief of Zimbabwe’s potential. We are proud to have successfully launched the PPC SureRange of products which carries six distinct types of cement each with its unique qualities and range of uses,” he said.

Mr Masiyane added that the company has been the leading supplier of cement products for major national projects like the Hwange Thermal Power expansion, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion, several road rehabilitation projects that include the Harare-Beitbridge highway and the expansion of the Beitbridge Border Post.

“We have embarked on going green by investing close to US$50 million towards setting up solar farms in Gwanda and Bulawayo. The land has already been procured and commencement discussions are at an advanced stage.

“We anticipate an output of close to 32MW at Colleen Bawn in Gwanda and 10MW in Bulawayo that will be shared with our Harare factory. This will reduce the burden on the national grid. We have invested a further US$5,2 million on environmental sustainability initiatives for 2021 at our Colleen Bawn factory,” said Mr Masiyane.

The company has been operating in Zimbabwe since 1913 and has three plants in Harare, Gwanda and Bulawayo.

The plant in Harare was opened in 2017 following an investment of over $82 million.","President Mnangagwa and Vice President Kembo Mohadi are led on a tour of PPC’s factory by the company’s managing director, Mr Kelibone Masiyane, in Sunway City, Msasa, yesterday.

Even normal human connections aren’t easy to build but are just as easily broken with the slightest problems. So you can expect a business partnership to be pretty messy. But it doesn’t have to be. With the right preparation, expectations, and mindset, anyone can experience the benefits of joint projects, especially in the construction industry! So in this article, we’ll be taking a look at some of the best things to keep in mind when starting a joint contract in construction.

Perfect your sales pitch

Before entering into any partnerships, it’s important to be able to clinch that big project you’ve been meaning to get your hands on. In order to do that, you need to be able to perfect your sales pitch to a prospective client — including your possible partner for the project. While the particular company that you will partner with may be finalized later, you should still give an estimate of how much work you yourself will be doing for the said project.

Marketing and communication skills will have to be mastered in this aspect. Without the green light of a client, there’s no way you can enter into any kind of project with a different contractor, no matter how in sync the two companies are.

Know your strengths and weaknesses

To determine the extent of your participation in a project and understand what kind of help you need, you should first assess yourself as a company. Be honest and list down your strengths and what aspects you need some assistance with. Once you’ve got that covered, you need to review the types of construction workers out there and which specialties you would need to partner with to make your big project a reality.

After learning what kind of partner you’d need, you must then do your own research with regards to the strengths and weaknesses of your prospective business partner. You may need to pitch the project again or simply ask them for a formal meeting to discuss the potential joint venture. This is where knowing your own strengths would come in handy, too.

Maintain open communication

Assuming that you and your business partner have ironed out the terms of your venture, another important tip to keep in mind is to always maintain open communication, especially if the authority on the project is equal. Your partner needs to know when things aren’t going as planned, in the same way that you expect the other side to be transparent, especially with regards to issues that may make or literally break your entire partnership.

Maintaining open communication is also essential during the negotiation of your venture and how much power you have for the project. Remember: Good communication is one of the most important foundations of any relationship whether it be personal or business.

Work only with licensed companies

Working with a licensed company means you have some sort of guarantee of the professionalism and legitimacy of your partner contractor. Hence, this is a pretty obvious factor that some companies sometimes forget in the quest of looking for a good deal or when they’re short on time to make necessary arrangements for a big project.

However, since there’s a lot more at stake in a big construction project like an entire townhouse or condominium development, then you should only consider partnering with someone who has an updated license.

But this same strict criteria must apply to you, too. If you’re doing a site-specific project, let’s say in Florida, then you must certainly pass the Contractor’s License exam in Florida. Otherwise, no good company would ever want to be your partner. In fact, you might not even qualify for a big project at all.

Don’t forget to keep things black and white

Before signing any contract for your dream project, you should exercise caution and hire a good law firm to make sure that you will not be duped into something that would cause your bankruptcy. Nobody wants a bad deal and getting a lawyer to represent you during negotiations is definitely not a bad idea. After all, you’re the one who’s going to live with the consequences of a poorly drafted contract.

Entering into a business partnership is a big move for any enterprise. It requires skill, patience, knowledge, and good social skills to be able to work in harmony with other firms and their own business climate. However, if you follow these tips to the tee, then you’re sure to end the partnership as a success which would absolutely prove your worth in the industry.","With the right preparation, expectations, and mindset, anyone can experience the benefits of joint projects, especially in the construction industry!

Chandigarh: Underlining brazen military manoeuvres and unprecedented scale of challenge” from China, security experts on Saturday suggested India must adopt a more aggressive demeanour to forge issue-based geo-strategic multilateral partnerships like Quad to leverage country’s full potential in checking the dragon in its rank.

The views were expressed by a group of panelists including former Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba during an exchange held virtually on the second day of the Military Literary Festival 2020 on The Quad: The Emerging Indo-Pacific Naval Alliance .

Sharing his thoughts, noted defence commentator and the Director of the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore, C Raja Mohan, said Delhi must learn from the past in not letting the academic debates about alliances tarnish its judgment about extraordinary economic and security challenges staring India.

India faces growing threats and it needs more partnerships than it has ever needed before globally, Raja Mohan said while pointing out India’s traditional reluctance to be an active Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad partner due to fear of being perceived as taking a side.

Underlining the changed global scenario where India cannot remain neutral anymore, as has been policy till now, he said, “We have to move on much faster on multiple fronts while strengthening Quad and enhancing other regional mechanisms.

“The way China threatens us today requires us to dynamically improve national economic capacity, not only the military capability, in partnerships with intensive international coalitions for which Quad could be the central fulcrum for the time being,” he said.

Moderating the discussion, former Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba expounded on the genesis of Quad as a club of four nations comprising India, US, Japan and Australia which was mooted by the then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007.

Forged in the wake of coordination amongst the four democracies during the 2004 Tsunami, the ambitious grouping went into limbo owing to Australia’s reluctance to antagonise China then, he said, adding that it’s prominence in 2017 has been a response to China’s assertiveness in the region.

Taking part in the deliberations, career diplomat Shyam Saran, who was the foreign secretary during 2004 when the Tsunami had struck Indian shores, recalled acknowledgment India had received from foreign nations for its swift action by naval forces.

Dissecting the real reason for Quad’s retreating into limbo after 2007, Saran said it was the US which in fact had wanted to play down the group’s significance because it did not want to loose out on China and Russia’s support for pushing the Iran nuclear deal.

Marking out reasons for the revival of Quad, he said the challenge posed by assertive China to India and other countries, including Japan and Australia, as the immediate trigger has rightfully reinvigorated the grouping.

Besides, the security relationships between these four countries are much equal, he added.

Echoing the sentiment, Vice Admiral Pradeep Chauhan (retd) said China considers India as one of its target of military assertion, a challenge our establishment has so far not been familiar and comfortable dealing with it.

“We need to have a nimble asymmetric strategy and must maneuver our strengths to best of our capabilities in thwarting China, he added.

Pointing out that China has been weaponising its economic prominence to saddle other countries, he said India cannot be choosy while entering alliances while referring to China-backed trade agreement Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

“The decision of India to stay out of the RCEP is incorrect and not in line with keeping the high ambitions to match geo-strategic goals. We need bold steps across the board to counter rising China”, he added.

Saran said India has moved to crystalise the accord but more participation will be better for future course, possibly alluding to ASEAN member countries.

Pointing out that Quad future trajectory would depend on China’s stance, the former ambassador reiterated India should be less hesitant in taking it forward and must always aim to create a propitious environment for Quad to be more powerful.

Further, participants discussed enhancement and strengthening partnerships amongst countries in the region for smart investments in WASH.

Earlier on November 29, a meeting of civil society organizations and private consultancies was held in preparation for FMM, during which representatives from Watercare, Small Island Geographic Society and Save Maldives Campaign discussed the need for creating civil society networks and accountability platforms to discuss where challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were discussed, with a spotlight on WASH as well as protecting the environment.

During the meeting held on November, attendants reiterated that the discussions were timely as countries across the region are utilizing multi-stakeholder networks and collaboration in the identification of priorities in the WASH sector.

As such, similar practices in Maldives could support the development of CSO which asks for effective use of available financing in addition to the development of strategies and partnerships in order to obtain further resources to ensure the achievement of universal access to WASH services in the country by 2030.

Discussions revolved around topics such as improvement of governance; institutional development; capacity building; the development of specific action plans for the establishment of water and sanitation research facilities; assisting educational institutions to develop academic programs to support the development of the local water and sanitation industry in the context the developments in water and sanitation technology among academics and practitioners, as well as policies to optimize human capital and engagement of CSOs in all areas of the water and sanitation sector.

(Courtesy VISL)

Under normal circumstances Greater Victoria’s weather allows soccer, field lacrosse and field hockey to be played by adults and youth throughout the winter.

The availability of all-weather fields, however, is a key part of that. That’s a big reason why the Vancouver Island Soccer League (VISL) is partnering with the Greater Victoria School District and Indigenous and other sports groups to create a centralized, two-field, $3.5-million complex at Spectrum Community School in Saanich.

“This is something we’ve been working on for 10 years, if not longer,” says Vince Greco, VISL executive director. Since turf became viable as a way of reducing game cancellations, he adds, several member clubs in Greater Victoria have constructed all-weather fields.

The high cost of land has been a roadblock to creating a VISL home field to date, Greco says, which makes the partnerships involved crucial.

“I think the only way for this to work is if we synergize our efforts,” he says. “About five years ago we started looking into different possibilities, and we kept coming around to the school district.”

The district is providing the land, but the other partners, each of which would share a piece of this recreational home, include Songhees Nation, the Native Indian Football Association and the T-Bird Soccer Group, while connections to the Canadian national para-soccer team and Kidsport Victoria have also been made for future use.

Not only does Spectrum have a large, mostly unused piece of land, VISL’s goals dovetail with those of the school. The side-by-side fields – part of a greater vision for the school that also includes an ice rink for its hockey academy – would be used for soccer, field lacrosse, PE classes and other recreational programs.

“We’re always trying to do things for the kids in the community,” says athletic director Dominic Butcher, pointing specifically to the Indigenous partnerships. “With our school district’s huge emphasis on truth and reconciliation … this project directly addresses that.”

Butcher, a longtime VISL goalkeeper himself, echoes Greco’s sentiment that the project has the potential to provide benefit to a broad cross-section of the community.

“I think [it’s in] our very name, we want to be that colour in the community, connecting people and being that community builder, with the people we help build and the students we produce,” Butcher says. “There’s lots of potential for partnerships and many community sports groups are crying out for turf time.”

The proponents aim to get $2.25 million in grant money, leaving the league to raise roughly $1.25 million. Any donations received by the end of 2020 will enhance the group’s current funding applications, Greco says.

Besides the fields, the goal is to have a “learning centre” that would house change rooms, meeting and spectator spaces and potentially a concession.

Doha: Lord Mayor of London in the United Kingdom HE William Russell, described his visit to the State of Qatar as successful and fruitful in terms of the nature of the discussions he had with a number of competent state officials regarding the development and strengthening of financial, investment, commercial and economic ties and opportunities in general between the two sides.

He pointed out that the City of London has long-term partnerships with investment and financial institutions in Qatar.

In an interview with Qatar News Agency, (QNA), His Excellency stressed the close and historical relations between the State of Qatar and the United Kingdom, and in this regard said that Qatar is an important friend of the United Kingdom, and it is necessary to develop financial, economic and commercial ties with it, especially since the two countries are considered as a financial center at the world level, in addition to the fact that they play a vital and pioneering role in building a more resilient global economy that takes into account the environment, the risks of climate change and green growth, which is imperative for the two countries to develop these partnerships in wider areas.

Lord Mayor noted that he chose Doha to be his first foreign visit after the state of general closure the world witnessed due to the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, saying that Qatar is an important country for the United Kingdom and the financial district of London, stressing that he met a number of officials during his visit, where they discussed investment opportunities, especially green investments, accelerating economic growth and sustainable development issues.

In this context, His Excellency praised the issuance of Qatar National Bank of green bonds worth USD 600 million on the London Stock Exchange last September, and said it is a worthy initiative to follow.

He referred to the wide and great concerns that Qatar and the United Kingdom give to climate change issues, and environment-related issues.

In this regard, His Excellency pointed out that Qatar hosted the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference ""COP18"", while the United Kingdom will host the twenty-sixth summit ""COP26"" in Glasgow next year.

Lord Mayor added that he is aware of the great importance and great care that Qatar attaches to issues related to the United Nations' green agenda and the sustainable development goals and their fulfillment, all of which are issues that both sides focused on during discussions in Doha, as included in Qatar's ambitious National Vision.

Lord Mayor reviewed the areas and prospects for banking cooperation in the field of financial services between the two sides and as well as the commercial and financial opportunities that will positively benefit both parties, he also touched on reviving the world trade and economy, international development challenges in this regard, and the importance of joint action between the two sides to overcome them in a way that also benefits the world.

His Excellency indicated that the volume of Qatari investments in the United Kingdom amounted to about 40 billion pounds last year in energy sectors, companies and properties.

It is noteworthy that the total number of British companies and representative offices operating in Qatar amounts to about 1134 companies and representation offices, including 993 companies with joint Qatari-British capital, and two representative offices for British companies, compared to 104 companies wholly owned by the British side and 35 companies registered in the Qatar Financial Center.

His Excellency expressed optimism that the UK and London financial district will be stronger after Brexit and COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery of global economies.

Lord Mayor also considered Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup as a great opportunity in which Qatar will prove its ability in organizing this important global sporting event, especially after the completion of many stadiums and facilities with environmentally friendly standards, he also expressed the willingness of the financial services sector in the UK to provide technical assistance for a successful and sustainable edition of this event, praising in this regard the announcement of the transformation of the public transport bus fleet in Qatar to electric buses by 25 percent in 2022.

HE Lord William Russell affirmed the commitment of the two countries to developing their successful partnerships and exploiting future opportunities to strengthen their cooperation in the mentioned fields and other areas such as green finance, technology and the financial services sector.","He pointed out that the City of London has long-term partnerships with investment and financial institutions in Qatar.
