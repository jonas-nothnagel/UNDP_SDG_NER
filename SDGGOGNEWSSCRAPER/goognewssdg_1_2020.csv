The survey is part of a consultation process that will inform the UN’s 75th anniversary in September 2020.

The UN describes the process as a “global reality check” and the “largest, most inclusive conversation on the role of global cooperation in building a better future for all.” It aims to gather the views of, in particular, youth and other groups not already engaged with the UN.

One format the conversation will take is a survey launched on 1 January 2020, consisting of five questions:

Overall, do you think that people in 2045 will be better off, worse off, or the same as you are today? (Choose one.)

If you picture the world you want in 25 years, what three things would you most want to see? (Choices include “better management of international migration,” “more environmental protection,” “more employment opportunities,” “greater equality between men and women” and “better access to healthcare.”)

Which of these global trends do you think will most affect our future? (Choices include risks related to terrorism, health and new technologies; climate change and environmental issues; nuclear weapons; forced displacement; and breakdown of relations between countries.)

How important – or not – is it for countries to work together to manage the above trends? (Five-point scale from “Not important at all” to “Essential.”)

What would you advise the UN Secretary-General to do to address these global trends? (Write up to 140 characters.)

Users are informed that responses “will help improve international management of these trends, and put us in a better position to meet our aspirations for a brighter global future in 2045 – when the United Nations will turn 100.” In addition to the one-minute survey, the UN75 dialogues will include opinion polling in 50 countries, and artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment analysis including through social media, in 70 countries. The resulting data will be provided to inform national and international policies and debate, according to the UN.

The UN Secretary-General will present the ideas generated by the process during a high-level event to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020. The theme of this event will be, ‘The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism,’ as agreed by UN Member States in June 2019. This theme also will guide all other activities, meetings and conferences organized by the UN in 2020, including the general debate of the UNGA’s 75th session.

The UN75 global conversation was announced on 24 October 2019, and a toolkit to support each conversation format has been made available. [UN75 Survey] [UN Press Release]","The UN system launched a “one-minute survey” to elicit aspirations for the future from people around the world.

Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

The compendium features country case studies from Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru.

The ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems’ was launched at the Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration, which took place from 14-18 October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. In September 2019, a synthesis report of the six case studies was introduced at a side event during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

One billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation.

According to the compendium, current birth registration coverage is not adequate to meet SDG target 16.9, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. It reports that: the average birth registration rate globally is 73%; only 46% children in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered; and only 25% of the world population live in countries where more than 90% of the births and deaths are registered, most of these countries being high-income countries. The authors also note that according to the latest data from the World Bank, 1 billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation. The World Bank has also found that approximately 50% of the world’s deaths are not registered.

The compendium aims to provide evidence and raise awareness of the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management, where civil registration and identity management systems support each other. The publication is also aimed at shedding light, for civil registration authorities, of the opportunities for advancing CRVS and increasing registration coverage through tighter cooperation or integration with identity management systems and other “identity ecosystem” actors.

The compendium focuses on the experiences of six countries that have pursued a holistic approach to CRVS: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru. The case studies reflect varied experiences in building identity ecosystems with different constitutional and legal systems, administrative traditions and institutional arrangements. The studies present good practices, underlining how the countries’ different starting points were not an obstacle to building their identity system around a holistic approach, as well as their various ways of working.

Five recurring messages were identified across the six case studies:

A strong CRVS system that registers all vital events from birth until death for the whole population is an essential precondition for the implementation of a holistic identity system;

Other components of an identity ecosystem, including the issuance of identification credentials and functional government systems, rely on civil registration records as the only source of up-to-date identity data;

The digitization of CRVS and identity management systems, together with other government functional systems, enables more efficient ways for processing identity information;

The benefits of a holistic approach span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption and leaving no one behind; and

The four key elements essential to a conducive enabling environment for pursuing a holistic identity system are: political commitment; a legal framework that enables data sharing; a data privacy and protection framework; and technology ownership from the outset to mitigate possible vendor lock-in.

The six case studies (Armenia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru) also show that technical interoperability provides a range of benefits in ensuring that all categories of population from birth to death reflect their identity information in the system.

Dhruv Gandhi Senior Research Analyst - Global Economy and Development, Center for Sustainable Development

In his essay, Belay Begashaw, Director-General of the Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, highlights that progress so far on the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals, and targets and notes the need to redouble efforts. He emphasizes the importance of localizing the SDGs and integrating them within the local, national, and regional planning processes including the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

Given the current state of progress on the SDGs and the need for additional efforts, Figure 1.2 in the report highlights several scenarios for poverty and health care SDG targets.

The Global Compact on Refugees was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 2018.

More than 3,000 representatives of governments, the UN system, civil society and the private sector as well as 70 refugees participated in the Forum, which convened from 17-18 December 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was organized by the governments of Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan and Turkey, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was co-hosted by the government of Switzerland.

Delivering opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recalled that during his experiences as the High Commissioner for Refugees he saw “a fundamental human trait: the will to kindness” and the impulse to help a person in trauma. He said he also learned that generosity is not always proportional to wealth, and “the world owes all countries and communities that welcome large numbers of refugees a debt of gratitude” as well as the shouldering of that responsibility. He said the UN will advocate for including refugees in regional frameworks and national development plans and reviews, as well as in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.

The Forum reported the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced, including through employment, legal support and education.

UNHCR Filippo Grandi linked the Forum to the SDGs’ goal of leaving no one behind. He said refugee situations only become crises through short-term thinking, failing to work together across sectors, and neglecting the communities where refugees arrive.

The Forum had six areas of focus: burden and responsibility sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; solutions; and protection capacity. Each area was supported by a coalition of co-sponsors who formed alliances of support and advocacy, and identified opportunities for making pledges and contributions. More than 30 “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” consultations took place at the country and regional levels to identify possible pledges and contributions.

The Forum’s official summary reports that around 770 pledges and contributions were submitted during the event by a broad range of actors, including governments, humanitarian actors, private sector entities, educational institutions and international organizations. This composition of supporters represents “a considerable increase” in the level of engagement of many states and organizations in the Global Compact’s implementation. Per the summary, more than 350 pledges relate to improving laws and policies, such as pledges to:

continue to receive and admit refugees;

adopt “out of camp” policies and strengthen asylum systems;

allow refugees and asylum seekers to work and access financial services; and

include refugees in countries’ national development planning and national systems for education and health.

The summary also notes a commitment “to further and deeper engagement” by development actors and multilateral development banks, expressed through a range of financing and policy instruments, with almost 250 pledges containing “some form of financial component.” An initial analysis presented in the Forum’s summary indicates: USD 2.2 billion pledged by the World Bank Group, through a dedicated funding and financing window for refugees and host communities, in addition to a separate window of USD 2.5 billion aimed at supporting private sector investment in creating jobs in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence; USD 1 billion committed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); and over USD 2 billion in financial commitments by “a broad range of States and other stakeholders.”

The Global Refugee Forum also registered more than 200 pledges and contributions from the private sector, representing “the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced.” These commitments include more than USD 250 million in funding, the direct employment of more than 15,000 refugees, a joint legal community pledge with NGOs to provide more than 125,000 hours of pro bono legal services per year, and other pledges related to education and training, women’s economic empowerment, connectivity, business development services and innovative financing.

By the Forum’s summary, more than 130 pledges were made towards expanding access to education for refugees, focusing on supporting the inclusion of refugees in national systems.

The good practices, pledges and contributions announced during the Forum are featured on a digital platform launched at the Forum. The Platform will continue to collect and share good practices.

The first Global Refugee Forum also featured the launch of Support Platforms to reinforce three regional refugee responses, namely the MIRPS in Central America and Mexico, the Nairobi Process facilitated by The Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the East and Horn of Africa, and the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. The Support Platforms are situation-specific arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing provided for in the Global Compact on Refugees. Their purpose is to galvanize political commitment, mobilize assistance, facilitate coherent humanitarian and development responses, and support comprehensive policy initiatives.

Other launches at the Forum included the Asylum Capacity Support Group and the Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network, which seek to make the best use of, build upon and expand existing knowledge and expertise on refugee protection, in support of the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees. The UN Development Programme presented its SDG Impact Accelerator (SDGIA), launched with the Government of Turkey, which aims to accelerate entrepreneurs for market-creating innovations that tackle the challenges of refugee populations and host communities in Turkey. Subsequently, SDGIA’s solutions and best practices could be replicated and applied to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

The Forum was preceded by a day of special events dedicated to the refugee cause. It was supported by a social media campaign that emphasized that #EveryoneCounts.

UNHCR has developed a mechanism to track the implementation of pledges and contributions, and the next Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2023. A mid-term review meeting in 2021 also will serve as a tool to assess progress and maintain momentum for implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees.","The first-ever Global Refugee Forum – an opportunity to “rally behind the aspirations of the SDGs of leaving no one behind” – generated hundreds of pledges and contributions towards implementing the Global Compact on Refugees.

By 2060, the global building floor area is expected to double. Emerging and developing economies in warm and tropical climates will experience the biggest increase.

Already today, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sector consumes over a third of global final energy. Energy demand from the building sector is expected to grow by another 50% by 2050. Space cooling is a key driver of this demand – energy needs for space cooling are expected to triple.

Buildings cause greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both when they are built, and over their long lifetime of 30 to 80 years. Our modern way of constructing is mostly based on concrete, using standard blueprints regardless of the climate. This leads to high energy bills for those who can afford it, and economic and health risks for those who cannot.

Future-proofing Buildings Can Drive SDGs 1, 7, 11

Energy-efficient buildings are not rocket science. Improvements in the building’s outer structure and appliances can achieve substantial energy savings compared to standard buildings. Measures to future-proof buildings can range from “low-tech,” such as painting roofs in light colors and ensuring natural shade, to digital solutions for building design and management. Additional macro-economic benefits include energy security, job creation and health. And from a business perspective future proofed buildings have a lower lifetime cost and higher asset values.

Climate action in buildings and construction is among the most cost-effective measures. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that realizing the potential of sustainable buildings will save USD 1.1 trillion by 2050.

Nevertheless, this transition requires a shift in investment. USD 4.5 trillion are invested into real estate every year. To channel this investment towards energy efficiency, we need to influence it from two directions: ambitious policy and regulation serving as a “stick,” and financing as a “carrot.”

The Programme for Energy Efficiency in Buildings (PEEB), a French-German initiative, works with its first five partner countries – Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Vietnam – to transform the building sector. PEEB combines financing energy efficiency in large-scale projects with technical assistance through policy advice. PEEB mobilizes innovative financing solutions for large building projects. For example, in Morocco PEEB supports the government in mobilising EUR 20 million in climate financing for a residential housing programme. A green loan programme for young families is in the making in Vietnam. The programme also works with partners to make policies and standards more ambitious and effective, through better enforcement of existing green building codes or setting standards for sectors like hotels or hospitals.

All of these advancements are helping to achieve 2030 Agenda targets on energy, housing and poverty.

Climate Action in the Building Sector is Gaining Momentum

Another international agreement – the Paris Agreement on climate change – also hangs in the balance; its goals will not be achieved without a climate focus for buildings in the new decade. A rapid decarbonization needs to happen in the building sector, driven by international and national actors.

In 2019, action on buildings took center stage. Led by the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), buildings featured prominently at the climate change conference COP25 in Madrid, with topics ranging from zero carbon buildings to circular economy approaches in the buildings sector. The Global Status Report on Buildings and Construction confirmed the urgent need for action in the building sector. At the Climate Action Summit convened by the United Nations in September 2019, the Net Zero Carbon initiative was launched to leverage the leadership of governments, industry and civil society to commit to ambitious targets and mobilize funding. The Cool Coalition and SEforALL’s Cooling for All initiative have incorporated buildings as a key element of their strategies.

As we head into 2020, buildings are high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has named moving towards zero carbon buildings as one of its four top priorities for tackling climate change. The report by the UK government on energy transitions features buildings as a key sector. The lead-up to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) in 2020 has an unprecedented opportunity to raise the ambition of all actors to make our buildings future-proof and wake this sleeping giant.

The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).

The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.

According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.

The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.

However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.

The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:

equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;

ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;

update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;

strengthen regional cooperation; and

promote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.

The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities.

Bridging that gap requires removing the constraints to the supply of, and demand for, capital.

Development banks must focus on catalysing new sources of financing.

Despite a tremendous increase in the number of initiatives dedicated to sustainable development since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, a persistent $2.5 trillion annual financing gap stands in the way of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The international community has committed to turn promises into reality as we enter the “decade of action and delivery”, acknowledging that the progress made so far has been very slow in many areas.

The first step in financing the SDGs is to ensure that capital is actually deployed where it has true sustainable development impact. Global GDP in 2018 amounted to an estimated $85 trillion. This means that if only 3% of the global GDP was invested for sustainable development, the world would be able to close the SDGs financing gap – the global community would be able to meet our sustainability ambitions and collectively achieve the 2030 Agenda.

Many obstacles, however, stand in the way. The Global Future Council on Development Finance, convened by the World Economic Forum and comprising 24 experts active in the field, is focusing on innovative ways to overcome the systemic challenges that limit the flow of development finance. For the Davos Annual Meeting 2020, we created the new Development Finance Transformation Map, summarizing the key dimensions characterizing the ecosystem.

The Council brings together representatives from national governments, donors, multilateral and bilateral development finance institutions (DFIs), private investors, finance leaders and academia. It believes that conventional approaches to development finance are inadequate to address the market failures that manifest themselves at the national level. This is why the action taken so far has not achieved the scale and speed needed to mobilize the capital required for the SDGs.

With a focus on identifying solutions, the Council recognizes that enhanced action is needed from all participants – the providers of capital (supply), the users of capital (demand) and the institutions that link the two (intermediaries) – while also realizing that only limited progress will be achieved if those areas are explored in silos, given how interconnected they are.

An integrated approach that considers how all elements interact is needed. This approach is one where public and private stakeholders at a global and domestic level work together to bridge the SDG financing gap, achieving more than they could on their own. Furthermore, for global thought leadership to have an impact on the ground, it must be harnessed to action at a country level, allowing the system to work in sync and achieve the speed and scale required to move the needle in the decade of action.

Supply side: aggregate investment opportunities to attract more capital

The private sector seeks investment opportunities that match return expectations and risk appetite. Weak global economic growth forecasts and the proliferation of negative yield bonds mean that projects in developing and emerging economies that contribute to the SDGs should be offering attractive investment opportunities.

However, market failures disincentivize private participation in financing the SDGs. High levels of perceived risk, local currency volatility, information asymmetries between capital providers and project developers and deal size – to name a few – often transform what might be an attractive investment opportunity into a very complex deal where the final expected return does not justify the risk and effort that the investor must undertake to deploy the capital.

Consider an example: Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) represent a group of 58 island countries that face similar development challenges related to vulnerability to natural disasters, need for climate change resilience and their small size. Though SIDS have urgent needs for new sources of capital to finance their 2030 Agenda plans, they find themselves struggling to attract private sector investment given their high perceived risk and lack of projects with scalable returns.

The Council is developing a framework to help SIDS attract capital and overcome their size problem through the use of aggregation vehicles at the country, regional or sectoral levels. These vehicles can group smaller investment solutions into larger opportunities that can more easily attract private capital. This could develop into a viable mechanism for SIDS to find new sources of capital for the SDGs.

Demand side: take a strategic approach to using all types of capital

Market failures also stem from the demand side. One such source of inefficiency is the lack of coherent strategic development planning: countries should link their national allocation processes to the SDGs and create a national financing plan for the 2030 Agenda.

Governments must move away from a confined project-by-project approach towards a holistic financing strategy for the SDGs, involving all sources of capital across the various stages of the investment value chain.

During its previous term, the Global Future Council on Development Finance recommended that countries should pivot from “funding” to “financing”, thereby moving away from relying on official development assistance (ODA) and other public funding, and instead clearly mapping the right type of capital for each project, having a holistic consideration of all the capital sources – domestic, international, private and public capital – that could be deployed at a national level.

Moreover, the Council believes that governments can make or break the attractiveness of a country for investors. By fostering a sense of “investable governance” and creating an enabling environment that boosts investors’ confidence the country can set itself up for success.

For instance, implementing a regulatory framework that attracts private investors through business-friendly policies will enhance further business investment. To achieve this, multi-stakeholder collaboration is essential so that the public and private sector can align on the right type of action needed to improve a country’s investable governance.

The changes will only have a lasting impact if they build on the consensus of both public and private stakeholders and therefore allow the country to stick to an overall governance framework that continues to support domestic and international investors operating in the country.

Intermediary institutions: act as the catalysts in the interest of the countries

The supply and demand dynamics outlined above will unfold within an existing development finance landscape, and it is crucial that the relevant intermediary institutions improve their ability to link the supply of, and demand for, capital for SDGs. This requires a fundamental reassessment of the role of various development financiers and other stakeholders.

In particular, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Regional Development Banks (RDBs), National Development Banks (NDBs) and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) should prioritize their role as catalysts that help countries move from “funding” to “financing”, embracing a change some institutions have already started.

As countries pivot away from a “project by project” approach to strategic efforts to create private markets and attract a diverse set of capital providers, intermediaries should enhance their ability to bring investors and countries together. This requires a deeper understanding of the different types of capital that are needed for achieving the SDGs (all the way up from standard project financing to the most impactful type of equity risk capital) and an ability to work well with both the public and private sector.

The Council believes that it is crucial for existing intermediaries to focus on catalysing new sources of financing including from pension funds, insurance companies, and retail investors that have traditionally not been active suppliers of SDG financing.

This involves mobilizing private financing at different stages of the project lifecycle. For example, MDBs have had a tendency to focus on deploying their own capital in their own bespoke projects and keeping that capital tied up throughout the life of the project.

MDBs should find a way to bring in more private investors alongside them at the start of the project and then subsequently attract additional more risk-averse investors by allowing a refinancing of the MDB financing once the project has been derisked. This would help mobilize a whole new class of SDG investors and also enable the MDBs to recycle their own capital more efficiently.

MDBs could use their comparative expertise to identify more bankable projects while also making it easier for private financiers to get involved. There is an urgent need to attract more private investment in sustainable development in middle and low-income countries where MDBs and DFIs in 2018 jointly mobilized only $69 billion across the globe.

Conclusions

In Davos, members of the Global Future Council on Development Finance will meet with representatives of both the public and private sectors to engage them in reigniting the energy required to meet the ambitious targets of the Decade of Delivery.","For the Davos Annual Meeting 2020, we created the new Development Finance Transformation Map, summarizing the key dimensions characterizing the ecosystem.

The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.

The report frames the global economy as facing increased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.

The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.

The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.

Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.

India’s standing vis-a-vis United Nations-mandated goals has improved marginally, but the country has slipped in key areas, related to food security, livelihood and standard of living.

The country’s overall score of 60, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Index 2019-20 released by NITI Aayog, was three points above its 2018 standing. This was primarily due to better performance related to water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy as well as industry, innovation and infrastructure.

But the country was worse off in several goals (SDGs):

SDG 1 – Alleviating poverty

SDG 2 – Ending hunger

SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth

SDG 10 – Reducing inequality

SDG 15 – Preserving life on land

SDG 16 – Upholding peace, justice and strong institutions

A hungry nation

India’s worst performance was towards SDG 2: Ending hunger by 2030, where its score has fallen to 38 in the current year from 48 in the previous year.

This was also highlighted by Global Hunger Index 2019 released in October 2019, which places India 102nd among 117 qualifying countries.

As many as 25 states and Union territories failed to address “hunger and malnutrition”, according to the NITI Ayog index. Jharkhand led from the bottom, scoring 22 off 100, followed by Madhya Pradesh (24) and Bihar (26).

Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh were among the states that lagged.

Top performer Goa scored 76, a dip of four points. Scores also dipped for five of the top 10 states: Manipur, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre-backed think tank considered three new indictors:

Children (6-59 months) who are anaemic

Children (0-4 years) who are underweight

Gross value added in agriculture per worker

Those apart, there were four existing indicators:

Rural households under public distribution system

Stunted children (under five)

Pregnant women (15-49 years) who are anaemic

Rice, wheat and coarse cereals produced annually per unit area

Climate challenge

The index recognised climate change as a challenge to ensuring food security in India as it turned food production highly vulnerable.

It stressed on climate-smart sustainable agriculture and called for widening climate-adaptive farming practices, new technology and plans that involve land owned by small farmers, who constitute more than 82 per cent of India’s farmers.

Poverty, gender parity

India slipped four points to 50 vis-a-vis ending poverty, with 22 states unable to reduce poverty. The situation was dismal for gender parity too.

Goa ranked last there, with its score plummeting 31 points to 19.

The index, in its second year, ranked the states and UTs based on 100 indicators for 54 targets across 16 goals.

Are you willing to accept this challenge too?

Originally published in the ESI Africa final newsletter for 2019 on 15/01/2020

In the industry, we are familiar with the UNDP’s Sustainable Development Goal 7 – access to affordable and clean energy – which has a fast-approaching ‘sell-by date’ stamp of 2030.

For those of you willing to join me in my new year’s resolution, here are some basic items to help you along the way.

Inform your networks about SDG 7. You will be surprised about who isn’t aware of the goal.

Spread news stories with your community, for instance, at your child’s school, or on your neighbourhood social media pages.

Write in-depth articles about goal 7 to keep it in the news and newsworthy.

According to the UNDP, between 2000 and 2016, the number of people with electricity increased from 78% to 87%. Globally, the number of people without electricity dipped to just below one billion.

This progress is fantastic but all things considered, it’s a drop in the ocean. The challenge for the SDGs, and precisely goal 7, is the sheer number of people they relate to, making it near impossible to fully accomplish as populations continue to grow.

The goals require, nay – demand, vast amounts of funding and investment. On the ground, SDG 7 can make headway where finance is made available for solar, wind, hydro, and clean thermal power projects.

However, advancing clean energy generation capacity is futile if those it serves to connect to a power supply can’t afford the tariff. The solution lies in thinking about supply and demand outside the box – a cliché that is quite fitting.

Power supply and demand fits into a tight co-dependent box. Where the supply is reliable and affordable, the demand remains high.

It’s a dynamic that is evident in South Africa’s current chaotic energy environment where loadshedding is contributing to economic decline and therefore also demand for electricity – a story to unpack another day.

As an example of out of the box financing for SDG 7, consider a farming community that needs to pump water. Could the farmers form a co-op and use their produce as ‘money’ to pay for the power? Imagine a power purchase agreement (PPA) quoted in bushels of corn.

Granted, this type of PPA could not work for utility-scale power projects; however, to get traction on SDG 7 we need substantially more small-scale, localised and decentralised clean power projects. There are many such projects doing their bit to power rural and off-grid communities but don’t make it to headline news.

Do you know of small-scale projects that are perfect examples of achieving this UNDP goal? Be sure to include them in your new year’s resolution and give them a hearty shout out!

Till next week,

Nicolette","On 1 January 2020, I welcomed in the New Year with one resolution: To keep SDG 7 at the heart of all I aim to achieve this year.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the publication, Armenia’s experience shows that the two building blocks of identity – CVRS and identity management – do not need to operate under one agency to be done successfully, but can work well even if different agencies are responsible, as long as the respective systems are interoperable so they can share information.

The case study highlights how the country’s Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for civil registration, and the Police have developed “a solid framework” for working together. The publication notes that Armenia’s modern CRVS is fully digitized, with all registered information being entered directly into the electronic civil register. This system enables the digital vital events records that belong to a specific person to be linked, so their up-to-date identity information is available any time. The identity management system is managed by the police, its population register being an electronic database that serves as the main tool to manage identity data and issue national ID cards and travel documents.

The country study also reports that each time a new birth is added to the civil register, the information that includes identity attributes of the newborn is automatically sent to the population register, where a new personal record is created. Also, every time a new vital event is registered and the names of informants are added to the civil register, this digitized platform automatically pulls identity information for the informants from the population register. This way, the publication explains, the two interoperable systems can provide up-to-date information to other users of identity data from these registers.

Some of the good practices identified in the Armenia case study include:

Digitizing civil registration processes to enable easier data sharing and registration of vital events;

Including an e-health platform that can be accessed at hospitals, where digital and paper-based medical certificates are produced;

Linking the civil and population registers electronically to the civil register to copy identity data of informants or applicants from the population register, instead of copying that data from an identification credential that a person presents; and

Using an innovative platform to verify if civil registration certificates and documents are authentic.

The publication highlights data interoperability among government-operated information and communications technology systems as essential to the effectiveness of the holistic approach taken with regards to the CRVS and identity management systems, as it allows the government to decide which types of data each service can access. The text explains that when a nation-wide layer of data interoperability was added, specific procedures were instituted to regulate cooperation between the two agencies.

Overall, Armenia’s framework to fully digitize government services by 2030 focuses on cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, government efficiency, tech-oriented private sector, and tech-savvy workforce. According to the framework, once the proposed E-Gov is fully in place, it will reduce the cost of government services by 50%, significantly reduce corruption and increase competitiveness, and add up to 3% to the growth rate of Armenia’s gross domestic product.

According to the case study, like most countries that emerged from the former Soviet Union, Armenia inherited a well-developed system for registering vital events, thus investment was needed for the system’s digitization, which was done with support from the EU. The total amount invested in digitizing so far is estimated at around USD 2 million, with the digitizing of historical records being estimated at USD 1 for each vital event record.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

In a significant improvement over the inaugural version, 68 indicators have been directly borrowed from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework (NIF) while another 20 are modified versions of NIF indicators and 12 have been developed by NITI Aayog in consultation with Union ministries. This alignment of indicators will pave the way for better coordination among government agencies for tracking India’s performance on SDGs.

Another noteworthy improvement is the broader coverage of goals, targets and indicators. While in the first edition, Goals 12, 13 and 14 were not included, only Goal 17 has been left out of the second round for ranking sub-national governments due to the absence of any relevant indicators in the NIF. Additionally, while SDGII 2018 covered 39 targets and 62 indicators, SDGII 2019 spans 54 targets and 100 indicators.

Scores improve

So, how are we faring in our quest for achieving the SDGs? Overall, India’s score has improved from 57 to 60, with notable progress on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9 and 11. While, a decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio has contributed to our improved performance in the area of ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, ramping up toilet coverage under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan has raised the country’s score on ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’.

The commendable performance on Goal 7 is due to expanded access to clean cooking fuel and the government’s massive electrification drive. Similarly, on Goal 9, the progress can be attributed largely to a significant improvement in rural road connectivity and increased mobile phone penetration. Our performance on Goal 11 has been boosted by better access to housing through the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana as well as more widespread adoption of door-to-door waste collection and processing.

While this progress is heartening, there are certain indicators where focussed attention is required. For instance, India’s tuberculosis notification rate is still high, thus limiting our overall progress on Goal 3. Further, there are some SDGs on which the whole country needs to step up its performance considerably, namely those pertaining to poverty, hunger, gender and climate action.

Limitations exist

While SDGII 2019 is a much-improved version, an exercise of this nature is not without its limitations, especially because of the gaps in data availability. In subsequent versions of the Index continued efforts need to be made to include indicators that capture the full extent of the SDGs. For instance, if the target is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, we need to go beyond measuring spousal violence and sexual crimes against children. Similarly, SDG 3 must capture at least one indicator that reflects the country’s progress on tackling non-communicable diseases.

Crucially, concerted efforts need to be made to generate data disaggregated by gender, age and socio-economic status to truly get a sense of how we are faring in terms of fulfilling the overarching SDG mantra of ‘leaving no one behind’.

Finally, future SDG Index reports could perhaps go a step further by including good practices that enable high-performing States/UTs to make progress on each of the goals, thus providing useful lessons for those lagging behind.

India is the only country to publicly rank its sub-national governments on SDGs. While the exercise needs strengthening in terms of scope and quality on an ongoing basis, it is a valuable effort that needs to be persisted with as it helps to bring the SDG agenda into the limelight at the national level as well facilitates its localisation at the level of States and UTs.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

The Peru study reports that after operating a disperse system of civil registration and an identification system closely tied to electoral purposes for more than 100 years, in 1993 Peru established a single national agency in charge of both functions, el Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil (RENIEC). Since then, RENIEC has articulated a decentralized system, increasing the coverage of vital events registration, identifying citizens, and integrating CRVS and identity management systems. The integration was realized through establishing standard processes and guidelines, introducing digital technology, and digitizing civil registration and identification records.

Throughout the integration process, RENIEC has increased collaboration between public and private organizations through the exchange of data, and has become Peru’s primary resource for identity authentication. The case study notes that, in order to make civil registration the backbone of identity management, RENIEC focused its efforts on:

Constitutional independence and autonomy;

Digitized records;

Information exchange between public and private sectors;

Integration strategies combined with information technology; and

Online services at health facilities for birth and death certification and registration.

To reflect the benefits of CRVS and ID management, the publication highlights the example of nutrition subsidies where the integration improved service provision and saved time and money: RENIEC has ensured that more newborns get nutrition support in time by reducing the application process from two months to 72 hours, and reaching 71% of beneficiaries within the first month, up from 36%.

As data gaps in registration still remain, especially related to the most vulnerable segments of the population, RENIEC has taken measures to improve services for Indigenous communities, set inter-institutional alliances and cooperation, and launch mobile registration units.

The publication also notes that, as part of the efforts to serve Indigenous communities, the Identity Restitution and Social Support Department is developing a project to provide customized training to civil registrars in Indigenous communities. As Peru has 48 Indigenous languages that are spoken by approximately 16% of the population, since 2014 RENIEC has worked to promote the use of Indigenous languages in civil registration services. The institution also provides an online registration platform, civil registry books, civil registration forms, dissemination and training material, and certified copies of civil registration records in Indigenous languages. These measures have helped reduce registration errors, promote inclusion, reduce under-registration, and contribute to reaching the SDG target 16.9.

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

The resolution “calls on the Commission and the Council to set a clear spending target for biodiversity mainstreaming of at least 10% in its Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027, in addition to the target for spending on climate mainstreaming.”

In the resolution of 16 January the EU Parliament calls for increased ambition in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which the CBD COP 15 is expected to adopt in October. The resolution calls for Europe to lead by example to address global biodiversity loss, noting with concern the findings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which “underlines the magnitude of the ecological crisis and the need for urgent and concerted efforts fostering transformation change” to tackle biodiversity loss and halt species extinctions. EU Parliamentarians also express deep concern on the impact of climate change in driving biodiversity loss, concluding the world is “facing an environmental emergency, which requires significant action.” They stress that COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

The EU Parliament identifies the upcoming EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 as an opportunity to demonstrate European leadership on biodiversity. Parliamentarians support taking biodiversity objectives into account in all EU policies and earmarking a minimum of 10% of the EU’s 2021-2027 long-term budget towards efforts to improve biodiversity. Parliamentarians further call for ensuring that natural areas make up at least 30% of the EU territory; restoring degraded ecosystems by 2030, by restoring natural forests, peatlands, floodplains, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal zones and marine areas; and promoting more sustainable agricultural and forestry practices, including binding reduction targets on pesticide use in the EU. They also call on the European Commission (EC) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to include biodiversity-proofing components in their financial instruments to avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity.

The resolution coincides with other steps the European Commission is taking towards implementing a European Green Deal. In her keynote speech to the World Economic Forum, the President of the European Commission Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen said that the European Union will mobilize EUR 1 trillion of investment that will “create a green investment wave.” [EU Press Release on EU COP 15 Position] [European Parliament Resolution] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Green New Deal] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on EC Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on IPBES Assessment] [Keynote European Commission President Speech]","COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

In the past four years, we have slid at least 15 notches on the UN Sustainable Development Goals index. The country ranked 115th in 2016, went down to 117th in 2017, and then to 122nd in 2018 before reaching the 130th spot in 2019. Sadly, considering the strained economy, poor governance and high inflation, the living conditions of millions of Pakistanis will only get worse. It is ironic that Pakistan was among the first countries that translated the Millennium Development Goals into national goals and came up with a detailed framework for achieving them. However, Pakistan had missed several major goals related to health and climate by the conclusion of the MDG time frame in 2015. Similarly, after the Sustainable Development Summit of 2015, Pakistan was again one of the first countries to adopt the 2030 agenda through a resolution in the National Assembly. Yet, despite the allocation of resources, foreign aid and much activity in bureaucratic circles, the country continues to perform badly in several areas, the challenges ranging from malnutrition to education inequality. In the latest Human Development Report, Pakistan is ranked at 152, marginally below all other South Asian countries, not least because of the complexity of the developmental challenges it faces and its poor response to them.

What we lack are proper resources, political will, competent personnel and empowered local governments, while bureaucratic delays, corruption and mismanagement have worsened matters. Unfortunately, development to policymakers is an ‘outside’ problem to be tackled by academics and development agencies. What seems to be missing is the realisation that development indicators also expose ineffective governance. The success of any parallel or overarching development scheme will always remain limited if governance weakens the implementation of goals. For example, the introduction of the Sehat Sahulat Card that aims to provide health insurance is a laudable step by the PTI government, but unless a serious effort is made to improve the quality of drinking water — polluted water is a major source of disease — the initiative will remain ineffective because of rising health costs. Similarly, eradicating poverty and hunger will be difficult without a reduction in food prices. The challenges for the present government are enormous. But solutions might be simpler than expected — if the decision-makers are willing to make amends.

DAVOS, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The United Nations Global Compact today launched SDG Ambition — a global impact initiative aimed at challenging and supporting companies to integrate the Sustainable Development Goals into their core business.

“The business community is not moving at the speed or scale needed to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. The Goals will not become a reality without greater ambition as well as deeper integration within companies everywhere. We hope that SDG Ambition will establish a new normal for the global business community that is both bolder and more strategic in efforts to achieve the world we want,” said Lise Kingo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.

SDG Ambition was launched by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres — the UN Global Compact’s Board Chair — in Davos during the World Economic Forum. The initiative, supported by SAP and Accenture, will provide organizations with the management framework to help them incorporate sustainability and the SDGs into their business operations and to measure and manage their performance.

“SAP shares a joint vision with the UN Global Compact and Accenture to mobilize industry around SDG Ambition and scale impact for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals,” said Jennifer Morgan, co-CEO of SAP. “By inspiring our global ecosystems and bringing together our respective areas of expertise, we can empower businesses around the world to use ‘technology for good’ and provide the necessary tools to accelerate achieving the world’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”

According to recent research by Accenture and the UN Global Compact, just 21% of CEOs believe business is playing a critical role in contributing to SDGs.

“The time for increased commitment and action is now, and SDG Ambition is a bold and practical response to this timely and urgent call to action,” said Julie Sweet, Accenture’s chief executive officer. “We are proud to stand with the UN and SAP as partners in unleashing the massive potential for innovation and disruptive technology to help address and solve critical issues at speed and scale across the globe.”

The UN Global Compact Local Networks, located in more than 60 countries, will lead the initiative’s implementation. SDG Ambition aims to engage more than 1,000 companies across industries in more than 40 countries to focus their sustainability efforts on high-impact strategies and business models.

Article content Poverty is the most-persistent social ill in all of human history, and anyone who tries to solve it has always faced an uphill battle. Nonetheless, the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being Plan created for Cornwall, Akwesasne, and the United Counties of SDG has made poverty reduction one of its four main pillars. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Working to eradicate poverty in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Back to video Each pillar contains several proposed initiatives that could be implemented across the entire region. The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation. More On This Topic More people, better access to health care in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Working to create safer communities in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Cornwall, Akwesasne and SDG endorse community safety and well-being plan Vibrant Communities publishes community well-being plan for SDG For this poverty pillar, the newspaper went over all the ideas with Juliette Labossiere, the executive director of the United Way / Centraide of SD&G, which already supports a wide range of initiatives dedicated to breaking the cycle of poverty.

Article content Advocacy The plan starts off by proposing the region begin a campaign advocating for several changes that have been championed by anti-poverty activists in recent years. These include either free or affordable tuition and access to nutritious food; a more generous social assistance that allows recipients to begin to build up savings; and, for local employers to begin paying a living wage. Labossiere said the United Ways in Perth and Huron are currently leaders on the living-wage issue. Not only do those organizations pay their employees living wages, they highlight businesses in their communities who do the same. “It’s like: they are a gold business because they pay their employees a living wage. It’s a community rating system for businesses, if you will. It’s been quite influential, and it is something that could be moved over,” she said. Adult education Education and retraining are often put forward as ways to break the cycle of poverty by giving people more options in their lives. The plan says a culture of volunteerism should be promoted as a way to help people build their qualifications while helping the community. It also proposes more interactive and accessible education to meet people’s needs and diverse learning styles, as well as an educational resource list. Expanding literacy training and employment preparedness courses is another proposal, which are things already being done by the Tri-County Literacy Council. Labossiere said the United Way already supports the council with its grants, but one easy way to improve adult education in the region would be for more people and charities to do the same.

Article content Programs for the working poor This initiative proposes working with existing agencies and people with lived experience to find gaps in the support system for people just barely getting by and then coming up with collaborative solutions. One of the biggest problems Labossiere sees is how the current system punishes poor families who start making more money “We are fortunate to live in a community that has fantastic accessibility levels for families with low revenues. There is low or free access to child care and summer camps, but then there’s that red line that if you make more than this amount, you no longer qualify,” she said. “Many families are still in the working poor category when they are just above that line. “So how can we break down barriers to participation for families in that grey area?” Prevention initiatives Preventing poverty can be easier than getting people out of its insidious cycle, so the community well-being plan proposes more prevention initiatives be created, targeted specifically at children and youth. These include life skills workshops to teach things such as food preparation, laundry, sex education, good consumer practices, financial literacy, and budgeting. It also proposes creating homework help and breakfast programs as well as mentorship programs. Labossiere noted there is already a program being run by the French Catholic school board called L’Equipe Psycho-social that does many of these things for vulnerable students and could be used as a model.

Article content Housing issues Homelessness is another tricky issue to try to solve, but the plan proposes advocating for more supportive housing in the region for people with mental illnesses, disabilities, and other health needs. It also calls for ensuring that there is adequate social housing for low-income families and individuals. A sense of community “Isolation is a huge factor in breaking the cycle of poverty, it’s even a determinant of health. We have to see isolation that must be worked on,” said Labossiere. “Anything that gets people feeling like part of a community makes for a healthier community, and a healthier community is one where people are less reliant on services and more reliant on neighbours.” Ways to cut down on that feeling isolation include organizing block parties or affordable recreational activities, such as sports or summer camps. Realities of poverty Being poor has always come with a large stigma attached, but the plan aims to change that. Great strides have been made in reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness in the past several years, and by holding workshops, particularly with employers, the plan hopes to do something similar. “I think there’s a misconception on the part of people who have lived a privileged life about those who have to struggle,” said Labossiere. “What do you do when your rent is due, you need electricity, and your kids are always hungry? “If you are always in survival mode, how do you take time to stop to do financial planning or make a good investment? You don’t.’

Article content Expanding access In order to give people easier access to the services that are already available, the community well-being plan calls for looking at the implementation of more online and phone services, as well as working with providers on things such as flexible hours and transportation programs. Volunteer opportunities Local community organizations are always in need of volunteers, and the community well-being plan wants to see a culture of volunteerism take hold in the region. Labossiere said work on this is already underway with the creation of the new volunteer managers association and the revamping of the Volunteer Hub website, which will have postings for volunteerism opportunities in the region. Better co-ordination The plan calls for organizations to work more closely together to help as many people as efficiently as possible. This includes creating a community hub where several different services can be accessed under one roof. “It’s not about giving money to one agency, it’s about addressing one need and bringing as many people to the table as necessary to fix it,” she said. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/Alan_S_Hale

19,https://www.gulftoday.ae/opinion/2020/01/07/kerala-retains-first-place-in-sdg-achievement,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gulf Today,Kerala retains first place in SDG achievement,"Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its rapid improvements in health facilities, gender equality and quality education.

In a ranking of states released last week by Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog and the United Nations, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially in poverty alleviation and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh sank to the bottom of the list.According to the SDG India Index 2019, India’s composite score improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20 with successes in water and sanitation, power and industry. Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.Kerala retained the top slot while Bihar came out as the worst performer. Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100, where it fully achieves its SDGs. Himachal Pradesh ranked next with 69 due its clean water and sanitation efforts, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among the union territories (UTs), Chandigarh topped at 68 due to its focus on clean water and sanitation and providing quality education.Tamil Nadu also topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.As per the SDG India Index 2019, the composite score for each state/UT is computed by aggregating their performance across the goals, and then by taking the arithmetic mean of individual goal scores. A score of 100 implies that the State/ UT has achieved targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that the particular State/UT is at the bottom of the table. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim have shown maximum improvement, as per the report for second year released by NITI Aayog on Monday. This first such report was released in 2018.The year 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by 193 countries at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The Index has been developed by NITI Aayog in coordination with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute.In 2018 index, only three states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, were placed in the category of front runners – with a score in the range of 65-99. In 2019, five more States joined this league – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Sikkim and Goa, taking the total tally to eight.With regard to poverty reduction, states which have done well include Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim. On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. It is designed to function as a tool for focused policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, and moving towards development action pegged to globally recognizable metrics. The Index also supplements NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts to encourage evidence-based policymaking by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and sharing best practices.The 2019 Index is more robust than the first edition on account of wider coverage of goals, targets, and indicators. It spans 16 out of 17 SDGs with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels. Further, the Index highlights the need for improvements in data collection, reporting and methodology. Partnerships for disaggregating data and developing capacity for real-time monitoring and measuring incremental progress are also being explored.","Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its rapid improvements in health facilities, gender equality and quality education.

20,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-s-top-films-of-2019-sry8eg5a,"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG’s Top Films of 2019,"Religious themes graced an unusual number of notable films in 2019, which our critic says may be the best movie year of the decade — with one notable caveat.

An exquisite art-house film about a beatified martyr. The triumphant arrival of a belated documentary of a celebrated gospel concert. A fact-based drama about an alliance of devout and unbelieving survivors of clerical sex abuse calling for justice.

These are just a few of an unusually large crop of notable films that tackled religious and spiritual themes in 2019.

Prayer, clerical characters, and church services and liturgical celebrations featured in several films, from the baptism and confession scenes in Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman to Tom Hanks’ Mr. Rogers praying for all the members of the Vogel family by name in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.

There was a revisionist Jesus indie. A Harriet Tubman biopic that treated Tubman’s faith and mystical experiences as a kind of superpower. A documentary about an influential priest who served on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and marched with Martin Luther King Jr.

There were also, of course, a number of faith-based films, produced within the “Christian film” industry. Among these were the fact-based medical-miracle drama Breakthrough, the sports movie Overcomer and the abortion-themed conversion story Unplanned, based on Abby Johnson’s memoir.

All of these were embraced by the faithful and did well at the box office, though like most faith-based films they continued the trend of preaching to the choir.

The revered filmmaker Terrence Malick is a Christian and the religious themes in his work are very deliberate, but his films speak powerfully to cinephiles of other faiths and of none. His latest celebrates the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter, a devout Austrian Catholic executed in 1943 for refusing to swear the soldier’s oath of allegiance to Hitler, and declared a martyr and beatified in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI.

A somewhat different case: In cataloguing the horrors of China’s crimes against humanity, the critically acclaimed documentary One Child Nation bears startling witness to the human dignity of discarded fetuses found in alleys and garbage dumps, above all in the work of the visual artist Peng Wang, the film’s most eloquent voice of conscience.

I found this the most powerfully pro-life message on American screens in 2019, though the filmmakers didn’t set out to make a statement about abortion itself. On the contrary, late in the film is a glib throwaway line unconvincingly comparing efforts to restrict abortion in the U.S. with China’s policies of forced abortions and sterilizations.

Still, the film’s unavoidable pro-life implications have caused discomfort, perhaps even cognitive dissonance, among some of its supporters. At Sundance a leading New York film critic, while acknowledging the film’s achievements, expressed concern about how the U.S. “extreme right” might respond to it — an indication, for me, of the film’s moral power.

In some cases, on the other hand, religious themes were downplayed or omitted entirely where they might be expected. For example, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, though a delightful film and a fascinating commentary on Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel, omits essentially every scrap of the source material’s religiosity while adding a shocking line about God’s will in relation to an impending tragedy.

A Beautiful Day includes Mr. Rogers’ faith and prayer but omits the larger role of prayer in the source material. Tolkien could hardly help including the youthful Tolkien’s clerical guardian, but it subverts his relationship with Tolkien and otherwise ignores the role of Catholicism in Tolkien’s life, including its direct relationship to his mother’s ostracism from her family.

2019 was another banner year for Disney dominance. With the combined power of its Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm brands, the Mouse released seven of the year’s top 10 box-office hits domestically, including Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. (That’s not counting Spider-Man: Far From Home, which Disney got a piece of but was released by Sony. Rounding out the top 10 were Warner Bros’ Joker and It Chapter Two.)

None of these branded IP releases were among my favorite films of the year, but that wasn’t very surprising or disappointing.

More disappointing was the dearth of high-quality family films. Original content especially was lacking amid a parade of sequels (Lego Movie 2, Toy Story 4, Frozen II, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World) and remakes (The Lion King, Aladdin, Dumbo).

Movies often come in twos, but this year there were a trio (!) of abominable-snowman cartoons — none very good. What else? Among the odds and ends, the most diverting were a hand-drawn Santa Claus origin story (see my honorable mentions) and a live-action Arthurian fantasy adventure called The Kid Who Would Be King from Attack the Block director Joe Cornish. (Toy Story 4 also was good, not great.)

In a way it was a year for trios. In a great year for nonfiction films, a trio of archival “time machine” documentaries that brought the past to startling new life were all so miraculous that ranking them was practically meaningless. (In the end, lacking anything else to go by, my deciding factors were subject matter and emotions: I would rather think about space travel than war, and I would rather think about God than anything.)

Among the year’s popular high-profile releases a trio of auteur-driven throwbacks to classic Hollywood genres with a twist — the whodunit, the “women’s picture” and the gangster movie — had me cheering.

But I was disappointed by the trio I had been most looking forward to: three acclaimed original films — The Lighthouse, The Nightingale and Us — each the sophomore effort of a director whose wildly original horror feature debut (respectively, The Witch, The Babadook and Get Out) set a high bar.

Among other acclaimed films I wasn’t over the moon for, I was dazzled by the brilliant filmmaking of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood, but after reading scads of raves I remain unsold on the ending. And I was crushed not to love Clemency, a movie that, on paper, ought to have been a shoo-in for my top five, or even my top three.

Still, going just by the quality of the films in my top 10 (and the difficulty I had eliminating many worthy runners-up that I would have been just as happy including in the top 10), I might call 2019 the best overall movie year of the 2010s — with the caveat that family audiences were underserved.

When I first saw the harrowing Syrian documentary The Cave I was sure it would be in my top 10, until it was displaced by For Sama. How is it possible that For Sama didn’t make the top 10 either? How did Aquarella, from the Russian documentarian whose quietly delightful ¡Vivan Las Antipodas! rounded out my 2013 top 10, land in my honorable mentions? Perhaps most astonishingly to me, why is Marriage Story not in my top five, let alone my top 10?

That’s how good the films were this year.

At any rate, this is my list of the 30 films that most moved, thrilled, inspired, shook or haunted me in 2019. If your favorites aren’t listed below, it’s not because I “forgot” them, although, as always, there are many films I have yet to catch up with and others I wish I had enjoyed more than I did.

SDG’s Top Films of 2019

A Hidden Life. The moral themes of dramas of martyrdom and conscience like A Man for All Seasons and Sophie Scholl blend with Terrence Malick’s signature themes of theodicy and paradise lost in this ecstatic, anguished three-hour cinematic hymn singing the life and death of Blessed Franz Jägerstätter. Malick’s most linear film in years is also his most overtly religious and most political, with challenges for both believing and secular admirers. Violence and menace; thematic content. Mature teens.

One Child Nation. The psychological and cultural toll as well as the human-rights atrocities of China’s war on the family are laid bare in Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang’s daring first-person stealth documentary. Juxtaposing Wang’s memories of growing up in the one-child era with revealing interviews and archival materials, it’s a furiously controlled blend of political indictment, cultural cross-examination and personal journey. Frank discussion of atrocities, including forced abortions; some disturbing images; brief language. Mature teens.

Amazing Grace. Sydney Pollack’s long-unfinished film of Aretha Franklin’s 1972 gospel concert with the Southern California Community Choir at L.A.’s New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, completed at last by producer Alan Elliott, is at once an exuberant celebration of music and showmanship and also a transcendent act of worship. Nothing problematic.

The Farewell. A gorgeous and winning cross-cultural comedy-drama about an extended Chinese family going to unusual lengths to gather around a dying matriarch who doesn’t know she’s dying, Lulu Wang’s semi-autobiographical film finds universal truths in the tale of a very specific lie. A Shinto ritual; brief crass language; heavy drinking and inebriation; mature themes. Teens and up.

Light from Light. Loss, mystery and the pursuit of meaning are recurring themes in Paul Harrill’s subdued indie dramas set in East Tennessee. His latest, starring Marin Ireland and Jim Gaffigan, is a whisper-quiet ghost story that, while not overtly religious, implicitly raises questions about discerning the voice of God speaking to us. Mature themes; a brief medical scare. Teens and up.

Apollo 11. Long-neglected high-definition NASA film reels and brilliant editing offer genuinely new, wondrous access to one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements in Todd Douglas Miller’s masterful documentary. Brief language. Kids and up.

They Shall Not Grow Old. Voices and faces from the dim and distant past emerge with stunning vitality in Peter Jackson’s tour de force World War I documentary, which features cutting-edge digital restoration and colorization of archival footage. Graphic battlefield imagery. Adults.

Little Women. It’s still a feel-good celebration of family bonds and moral virtue, but Greta Gerwig hasn’t just remade Louisa May Alcott’s often-adapted classic — she’s reimagined and reinterpreted it, interweaving the two halves of Alcott’s story and glossing the autobiographical significance of Saoirse Ronan’s Jo March. Brief inebriation; mature themes. Might be fine for older kids.

Knives Out. In Rian Johnson’s hands, an old-fashioned, ridiculously entertaining whodunit with all the usual elements becomes a morality tale with a distinctly contemporary vibe, rewarding decency and compassion, siding with the marginal over the privileged, and knocking the complacent on both sides of contemporary political discourse. Murder theme; a suicide; sexual references; frequent profanity and crude language. Teens and up.

By the Grace of God. Three adult survivors of clerical sexual abuse in childhood band together to confront Church authorities and face their trauma in François Ozon’s emotionally persuasive fact-based French drama. Several graphic descriptions of clerical sex abuse of boys; references to a genital deformity; brief partial female nudity; brief domestic violence; some harsh language. Adults.

New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG

Article content Despite Ontario’s Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act replacing and repealing the previous Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) Act, it will be business as usual at the Ontario SPCA Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Animal Centre in Cornwall. “The society and its network of animal-welfare communities will continue to facilitate and provide for provincewide leadership on matters relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals and the promotion of animal well-being,” said Melissa Kosowan, associate director of communications for the OSPCA provincial office. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG Back to video When asked about the act and how it might affect the SDG office, branch manager Carol Link said, “(the act) is different from what we do, sheltering. It’s two different departments.” PAWS, the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada, will oversee a variety of different categories. The province is implementing a new model with more inspectors to provide provincewide coverage, including those with specialized expertise in livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines.

Article content In addition, the act enables courts to impose the highest financial penalties for offenders in Canada and update prohibitions and obligations, such as barring the return of dog fighting equipment to a person convicted of an offence, and harming or attempting to harm a service animal or one that works with peace officers. The act will provide a more aggressive way of tackling animal abuse, something which the Ontario SPCA did to a lesser extent. “It’s important to remember that enforcement made up only approximately 20 per cent of the work the Ontario SPCA does every day in animal protection,” said Kosowan. “As Ontario’s animal welfare charity, we offer a variety of mission-based programs, including community-based sheltering, animal wellness services, provincial animal transfers, shelter health and wellness, high-volume spay/neuter services, animal rescue, animal advocacy, Indigenous partnership programs and humane education.” The act will also establish a multi-disciplinary advisory table made up of a wide range of experts, including veterinarians, agriculture representatives, academics, animal advocates and others to provide ongoing advice to the ministry. “People care about the welfare of animals and so does our government,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. “We committed to creating a strong, new system to protect animals, and we have delivered on that promise.”

Article content PAWS will also introduce a new enforcement model, made up of a chief animal welfare inspector, locally deployed provincial inspectors and specialized inspectors for livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines. What is unknown at the moment is whether those inspectors who worked for the OSPCA – one was based here in SDG – remain employed under the new service. Inspectors will conduct outreach and education on animal care best practices and how to be compliant with the legislation, proactive, risk-based inspections; including, for example, of zoos and aquariums and reactive inspections to respond to animal welfare concerns The new approach will also provide resources for Crown attorneys to support animal welfare prosecutions. The province has established a toll-free number, 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625) for people to report concerns about animal distress or abuse. This call centre is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. fracine@postmedia.com Twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had on Wednesday lauded the marked improvement in several key sectors under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the state while calling for more aggressive efforts to boost performance in other areas.

Niti Aayog's -- SDG Index 2019-20 report, based on 17 goals covering 100 indicators, showed that the state has done exceptionally well in areas like open-defecation free (ODF), internet subscribers, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and door-to-door waste collection, besides showing improvement in the average annual dropout rate at secondary level, said an official statement.

According to the statement, Punjab ranked 10th with the index score 60 among the states against India's overall score of 57 points in NITI Aayog's first report 'SDG Index India 2018', based on 13 goals covering 62 priority indicators.

However, there were a few indicators where the state's performance had marginally declined. The release further said that employment under the MGNREGA decreased from 81.63 per cent to 76.12 per cent, sex ratio at birth decreased from 893 to 886, and reported cognizable crimes against children (one lakh population) increased from 21 to 24.3.

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

Article content “I would love for SDG to have the same status as Prince Edward County (PEC),” she said. “We know the people will spend money and will travel for food experiences. Well, we have all that is needed here, to be every bit as glamorous and successful as PEC.” Clement went on to outline what she believed is a solid foundation to develop agri-tourism in the region. “We have competent cities and towns,” she said. “We have an experienced agricultural sector here. We have local entrepreneurs that are fierce and creative. This is a perfect recipe for agri-tourism.” The mayor concluded by promoting the city’s tourism development fund. The said fund exists in order to support entrepreneurs wanting to create an event, festival, project or even collaboration that would attract tourism to Cornwall. “The province has allowed us to set up a fund by collecting revenues through tourists that come here,” Clement said. “This sits in a fund and people apply to that fund. We want to make sure that the people understand that that fund is to support anything that is going to bring tourism to Cornwall, that result will nights stays and accommodations. “If it’s going to somehow benefit the City of Cornwall, then we want to hear about it.” Akwesasne’s District Chief Edward Roundpoint praised for his part the partnerships created between the region’s neighbouring communities.

It’s about bringing us all together. We will build on each other. Co-operation is the best thing that we can offer.” The mood in the Upper Canada Cider Company was best echoed by how Clement concluded her speech.

This comes as a result of the negative consequences it has on people, specifically, women and girls.

Her view is that unlimited access to safe water and sanitation are undoubtedly human rights for people everywhere across the globe, especially for women and girls, as recognized in 2010 by the United Nations General Assembly.

For these rights, society will need the right systems: well-resourced, capable institutions delivering services and changing behavior in resilient and appropriate ways. As it stands, over 2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services while an estimated 4.2 billion still lack safely managed sanitation services.

Unsafe hygiene practices are seen everywhere on a daily basis, degenerating the negative impacts on people’s health, especially those in deprived communities. The effect on child mortality rates is so dire with more than 297,000 children below the age of five dying every year as a result of diarrheal diseases, a consequence of poor sanitation, poor hygiene, or unsafe water

In the absence of a facility that safely separates human waste from human contact, people are rendered with no other alternative than to use unsafe public latrines or resort to open defecation. This is often a headache to women and girls, as they have to wait until the cover of darkness before going out to locate a place of convenience, a phenomenon which sometimes leaves them to be abused and sexually assaulted.

In the immediate environment, lack of an improved sanitation facility will only expose fecal matter back into people’s food and water resources, thus leading to the spread of deadly diseases such as cholera.

In some parts of the world, there is little or no awareness of good hygiene practices and their role in reducing the spread of diseases. However, it is often the case that even when people do have knowledge of good hygiene behavior, they lack the soap, safe water, and washing facilities they need to make a positive change to protect themselves and their community. Indeed, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene will help drive progress towards the SDGs concerned with poverty, work, and economic growth, also it will help achieve gender equity.

It is women and girls who bear the burden of collecting water and caring for relatives who are sick due to lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and who often miss out on education due to domestic roles assigned them. Lack of WASH worsens the marginalization of females by locking them into a cycle of poverty and struggles, with wider consequences for society.

The impact of universal access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) on global health would be wide and varied as women and girls would have the facilities and knowledge to be able to manage their menstrual cycles in safety and dignity.

There is also the potential to save the lives of the over 829,000 people who currently die every year from diseases caused by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices, and we could also drastically reduce child malnourishment, and help eradicate physical and mental under-development.","This comes as a result of the negative consequences it has on people, specifically, women and girls.

The document – Frontier 2030 – is aimed at ensuring the application of information technology in achieving the SDGs set up by the United Nations for the year 2030.

""To help close the gap between technology's potential and the slow rate of progress, the Forum is supporting the launch of Frontier 2030 at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos,"" said WEF in a media statement on Thursday. The Frontier 2030 would be a roadmap to mobilize technology companies, governments, international organizations, investors and civil society to tackle the barriers that prevent 4IR technology from being scaled up to address the Global Goals. ""We have a good reason for technology optimism, but we also need a good dose of technology realism,"" said Antonia Gawel, Head of Innovation and Circular Economy, World Economic Forum. ""4IR technologies are tools that still require commitment, policies, and partnerships to put them to work in the service of the Global Goals. With Frontier 2030 and UpLink – our digital platform to engage Gen Z and entrepreneurs in meeting the SDGs – we will make this happen."" The WEF 2020 is scheduled to be organized on 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland.

The report of WEC titled 'Unlocking Technology for the Global Goals' which was released on January 16, 2020, claims that 4IR technology can play a major role in bridging this gap, but new commitments and partnerships will be necessary to move beyond technological optimism. According to the report over 300 use cases of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of Things, 5G and drones were analyzed to build the case for how 4IR technologies could do more to accelerate progress towards the Global Goals. Across the Goals, and their 169 targets, 70 percent could be enabled by 4IR technology applications already in use today. Current 4IR tech was found to play an important role for 10 of the Global Goals, in particular: Health (Goal 3), Clean Energy (Goal 7), and Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (Goal 9), claimed the report.","World Economic Forum (WEF) 2020 will witness the launch of a comprehensive document on the application of technology in achieving SDG 2030.

“We live here, we work here, we raise our families here, we want what’s best for our community,” he told council members. “In our last visit, we explained the program. There were some questions I understand, that were raised after our presentation. So I just wanted to address a couple of points.”

OPP Const. Jim Blanchette was back before council to provide clarifications regarding the proposed partnership between the SDG OPP and the Mental Health Crisis Team (MHCT) at the Cornwall Community Hospital.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Although council had initially expressed support for the partnership, most members had also outlined they didn’t want SDG to finance the project on a yearly basis, citing that doing so should be the provincial government’s mandate.

The future of the proposed OPP mobile crisis response team was cemented during an SDG council meeting Monday.

In order to solidify his point, Blanchard pointed to a specific case in Winchester, where, two years ago prior to an intervention from the OPP and community partners, a woman had been involved in 128 calls for service.

“Since we’ve had the intervention, we’ve only had one interaction with her,” said Blanchette. “I could go on and on and on about the benefits shown across the province with this type of community team response. I think it’s important to note that this proposal is actually an extension to the police services board.

“You have an opportunity to reduce your police services budget in a reduction of calls for service.”

Despite Blanchard’s claims, some elected officials were still skeptical of who would end up having to finance the request.

“My fear is that if we fund this this year, will you be coming back every year,” said Coun. Bryan McGillis. “It adds up to a lot after 10 years. Are you going to be back next year with the same amount?”

“It certainly not our intention to make this request every year,” answered Blanchette. “If this program gets off the ground, then we won’t need to come back.”

Coun. Tony Fraser, on the other hand, expressed how he felt SDG was often overlooked by the provincial government.

“I don’t doubt the cost saving or the benefit this could have for our community,” said Fraser. “My struggle is not a struggle with this project. My struggle is with the province. Sometimes I feel that as members of the SDG council, we’re neglected and it is a struggle to find the funds that we need to keep everything working.”

A supporter of the proposal since its initial pitch, Coun. Kirsten Gardner urged her fellow council members to support the initiative.

“We’re going to invest $100,000 in a newspaper digitization project,” she said. “History doesn’t save lives.”

The $120,000 was added to the 2020 budget. SDG council will return to budget deliberations in February.

The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

The two countries follow Marshall Islands, which in 2018 became the first country to submit its second NDC.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change establishes five-year cycles to increase ambition, including through NDCs that would grow more ambitious over time. Countries requested that in 2020, Parties with an NDC time frame up to 2025 communicate new NDCs, and Parties with a time frame up to 2030 communicate or update their NDCs by 2020.

Suriname submitted its second NDC on 9 December 2019. As low-lying coastal country and, like Marshall Islands, a small island developing State (SIDS), Suriname and its population face vulnerability as economic activities are concentrated in the coastal zone. Therefore, Suriname’s NDC includes adaptation elements, including its 2019 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as part of its climate strategy.

Among its conditional and unconditional mitigation contributions, Suriname’s NDC presents a package of policies and measures with sectoral sub-targets, including enhanced contributions from four of the country’s six emitting sectors: forests, electricity, agriculture, and transport, which together cover an estimated 70% of emissions.

In its NDC submission, Suriname emphasizes its efforts to protect its natural resource and forests serving the global community as a biodiversity hotspot and a carbon sink. As a high forest cover and low deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname commits to maintaining 93% forest cover.

Forty-one countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

Taking into account Suriname’s domestic circumstances and capabilities, the maintenance of the carbon stock and the sectoral emission reductions are undertaken on the basis of equity, conditional on the availability of finance, and in the context of sustainable development, according to the NDC document.

Norway submitted its updated NDC on 7 February 2020, with a target to achieve economy-wide emission reductions of “at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels” for the time frame 2021-2030. The target covers all sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs). This is an ambition enhancement from the country’s original NDC, in which Norway intended a 40% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Norway seeks to fulfill the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

In the event Norway’s enhanced NDC should go beyond the target set in the EU’s updated NDC, Norway intends to use voluntary cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 to fulfill the part that goes beyond what is fulfilled through the climate cooperation with the EU. Norway notes that the EU’s current climate framework “does not open for the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs) from outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA), emphasizing that final accounting towards its NDC target may depend on any further arrangements in Norway’s cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

Norway further informs that it will have specific legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering emissions from all sectors and all GHGs. About half of Norwegian GHG emissions are covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which regulates emissions from industrial plants, power plants, the petroleum industry, and commercial aviation within the EEA. Not covered by the EU ETS are emissions from industry, petroleum, and the transport, agriculture, buildings, and waste management sectors. These are regulated under the Effort Sharing Regulations, which set binding national targets. Norway’s national target is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS-sectors by 40% in 2030 compared to 2005. The target can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by the use of flexible mechanisms within the EU framework. With regard to the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation, Norway’s commitment is to ensure that emissions do not exceed removals in this sector.

Norway considers the NDC “fair and ambitious” as it is in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 and onwards that correspond to keeping global warming in line with the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2°C,” and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, above preindustrial levels. Norway references the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Panel’s special report revealing pathways towards limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

Since the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in 2016, a number of world leaders, including during the 2019 UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, said they would submit new or updated NDCs by the first quarter of 2020. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), with partners, issued a supporting guidance for this process of developing new or updated NDCs, which it generally treats as “NDC enhancement.” According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 2020 NDC tracker, 41 countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

In December 2019 and January 2020, we saw this in discussions and reports on adaptation finance. They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows. Discussions also focused on the need for current business models to adapt to increasing climate risks and transform production processes to halt nature loss.

Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about the level of progress made. On the one hand, they saw missed opportunities such as to determine how cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement on climate change should advance. On the other, they noted steady achievements in the work of scientific bodies. In January, lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II (WG II) continued to advance work on the Group’s contribution to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6), focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, due for release in October 2021.

Seen in the light of adaptation funding activities, identified impacts and needs, these recent discussions suggest that climate change adaptation requires a rethinking of production, redistribution and equity. This Policy Brief focuses on these and other recent developments that inform climate adaptation finance.

UNFCCC Reflects on Its Integration of Adaptation, Prepares for 2023 Global Stocktake

The Adaptation Committee, established in 2010 under the UNFCCC, issued a report reflecting on the evolution of adaptation in the climate regime and outlining its work towards the first global stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement scheduled in 2023. Titled, ‘25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC,’ the report was released at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December 2019. Citing findings from the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report draws attention to increasingly more urgent adaptation needs.

The report notes that rising adaptation costs are likely to range from USD 140 billion to 300 billion per annum by 2030, and could rise to between USD 280 billion and 500 billion per annum by 2050. The Committee highlights the specific roles of the Convention’s Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism to support adaptation. Reporting on its own activities, the Committee informs of its partnerships with international, regional and national stakeholders and its efforts on engaging the private sector. A strategy for private sector engagement was also discussed at the 57th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council in December.

Looking forward, the Adaptation Committee notes that the seventh review of the GEF, the oldest operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, will be initiated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC will also start key negotiations on the post-2025 finance goal. Over the course of 2020, developed countries are expected to make submissions on finance beyond 2020 and on the alignment of global finance with the Paris goals.

The Committee further outlines its work towards the 2023 global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assessment of collective progress towards achieving its long-term goals. The global stocktake will conduct a review of overall progress made towards achieving the global goal on adaptation and the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation action and support. Inputs for the stocktake will include reports from the “network of institutions” established to enhance adaptation actions.

COP 25 Agrees of Arrangements for Adaptation Fund Going Forward, But Further Work Remains

The Adaption Fund approved a record USD 188 million in new projects in 2019, and reached the milestone of 100 concrete adaptation projects financed in vulnerable developing countries. The Fund fosters country ownership and enables direct access to adaptation finance for applicants from accredited national implementing entities from developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. It provides new learning opportunities, such as e-learning programmes to enhance access to climate finance, and new grants that foster adaptation practices on the ground and scale up effective projects.

Given its important role and the benefits it creates for an increasing number of countries in need of adaptation finance, the Fund welcomed two decisions taken during the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December, on decreasing risks of interruptions in the Fund’s work. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted:

amendments to the Fund’s arrangements with the World Bank to provide services as its interim trustee, to now be an open-ended arrangement; and

a decision that there will be no end date attached to its memorandum of understanding with the GEF Council on the GEF hosting the Fund’s secretariat.

However, the fact that COP 25 failed to conclude negotiations on the modalities of cooperative approaches under Paris Agreement Article 6 left some open questions.

In line with previous decisions, the Fund has served the Paris Agreement since January 2019. It will no longer serve the Kyoto Protocol once the share of proceeds becomes available under the sustainable development mechanism of Agreement Article 6.4, though it will continue to receive the share of proceeds, if available, from activities under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

The failure to conclude negotiations at COP 25 leaves unclear precisely how much of the share of proceeds under Agreement Article 6.4 sustainable development mechanism will become available for the Adaptation Fund. There seems to be consensus on a minimum share of 2% but possible increases are still under discussion. Parties further disagreed, among others, on whether a share of proceeds would also come from both market-based approaches, namely transactions under the mechanism, as well as from the trading of Article 6.2 “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs). Many countries called for equal treatment of rules for both approaches, for a number of reasons. In the context of adaptation finance, developing countries highlighted the value of predictable funding. As reported by some analysts, many of the countries likely to be on the buying end, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Norway, are concerned about higher costs of their carbon offsets.

COP 25 also did not result in any decision on whether the membership representation of developing and developed countries on the Adaptation Fund Board should change, given its role in serving the Paris Agreement.

Tracking Adaptation Finance

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has set out to tackle significant data and reporting challenges to capturing global adaptation finance flows. Adaptation investment, the Initiative finds, is difficult to track due to challenges associated with context dependency, the uncertain causality of investments made, a lack of impact metrics, and confidentiality and reporting requirements.

For this reason, CPI’s report titled, ‘ Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019,’ does not track any private sector adaptation finance. The Initiative underlines that almost all adaptation finance covered in the report was funded by public actors and that the tracking of public domestic adaptation finance remains limited. Nevertheless, that report finds that adaptation finance gained momentum in 2017-2018, increasing 35% to an annual average of USD 30 billion from 2015-2016, although adaptation still accounts for just 5% of tracked climate finance based on available data.

In its subsequent December report titled, ‘Tracking Adaptation Finance: Advancing Methods to Capture Finance Flows in the Landscape,’ CPI briefs on potential methods to fill data gaps for the tracking of adaptation finance flows, and proposes methods to measure progress.

The proposed framework, the authors suggest, can serve to identify information that should be tracked and reported by local governments and companies. The aim is to improve the understanding, and, ultimately, delivery, of adaptation finance. CPI finds that:

Investment flows that are specific to adaptation and resilience must be understood in the context of the total investment that receives a resilience benefit from the incremental adaptation investment;

Adaptation- and resilience-focused flows should be measured against total investment by sector to understand progress made to achieve resilience against a benchmark; and

Technical approaches, such as keyword searches and investment matching against national adaptation goals and geographic climate risk, can help identify adaptation flows in datasets that do not label them as such.

World Economic Forum Recognizes Climate and “Nature-based” Risks

The World Economic Forum (WEF), which convened for its 50th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from 21-24 January 2020, issued its annual Global Risks Report 2020. Based on its Global Risks Perception Survey results, the Forum concurs with findings from other fora that climate change is the stand-out long-term risk the world faces. It stresses that the near-term consequences of climate change amount to a “planetary emergency” with catastrophic, wide-ranging and intersecting implications. The WEF report also ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years.

As a traditionally business-centric gathering, the WEF finds that USD 44 trillion of economic value generation is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Illustrating how nature loss impacts businesses’ operations, supply chains and markets, the Forum urges the business community to adapt to several nature-based risks and implications. These risks, explained in another WEF report titled, ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ can be assessed using climate risk categories as defined in the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Under its ‘Nature Action Agenda’ stakeholder platform, the Forum has identified areas where strategic transformation of current business models and production processes can contribute the most to halting and reversing nature loss, and ways to finance this transformation.

Climate Change Adaptation Requires Rethinking of Production, Redistribution and Equity

Reflecting on these discussions, one cannot ignore the diversity of stakeholder groups engaged in addressing climate change impacts and their growing need of global adaptation finance. That need is estimated at USD 180 billion annually from 2020-2030 and USD 50 billion annually from many developing countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. While the UNFCCC and its constituent bodies prepare for upcoming procedural tasks, and the IPCC is advancing work towards AR6 publication, others talk about business opportunities and revenues. Few can envision the estimated sums in question. Half of the world’s biggest companies say “climate adaptation solutions could result in USD 236 billion in increased revenue.” Some suggest that “in the food and land-use sector alone, the climate challenge provides an annual business opportunity of USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2030.” At the same time, those that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including African farmers and island nations, speak of securing their livelihoods and coping with the negative impacts of climate change while lacking the means to adapt.

One of the notions underpinning these contrasting discussions is equity, with its different meanings and undertones. In an effort to to answer the basic economic questions of production and distribution, which all societies grapple with, we could think of what products are going to be made and by what means. How are the claims on production and incomes divided among resource contributors? How is production divided between private and public purposes? And more pertinently perhaps, given the limited ecological capacity within which the established global economy has to function, how is production divided between the present and the future?","They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows.

Governments have increased efforts to decouple their economies from resource use, but the demand for extractive resources is projected to continue to grow, especially in emerging economies.

As a basis for the proposed SDLO framework, the report titled, ‘Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing Extractive Industries Towards Sustainable Development,’ maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives that focus on delivering the SDGs. The authors lament, however, that the existing frameworks do not operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

Noting that extractive industries can cause extensive and lasting damage, the report critiques the current paradigm of “social license to operate” (SLO), which it notes arose as a response to business risk. The SLO paradigm aims to accommodate community demands to the minimum extent necessary to avoid public opposition and social conflict, and associated reputational damage, the authors write.

To move beyond SLO and consolidate existing instruments, the report sets out consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the SDGs and other international policy commitments. It identifies eight SDGs in which the extractive sector, if well-managed, can play a positive role: Goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Effective mineral resource governance incorporates human rights, responsible business practices, greater engagement of home countries, and economic decoupling.

UNEP emphasizes that the minerals and metals industry can promote social cohesion, inclusiveness and economic progress among low-income countries and vulnerable populations, but guidance is needed. The report elaborates that the SDLO model advocates for fairer deals, equal share of benefits among stakeholders and holistic consideration of regulations that are not inclusive on their own.

The proposed SDLO framework addresses large-scale mining and investigates artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), in which some marginalized groups in certain geographies partake, though often without oversight by policymakers. The framework does so in part by extending responsibility to ensure implementation is shared by both “host” and “home” countries, and by expanding the scope to a broader swath of the extractive value chain. However, the authors caution that the SDLO is not a substitute for laws and regulations, and that extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water.

Prerequisites of an effective mineral resource governance framework, the report notes, include decoupling economic growth from environmental and social impacts, protecting human rights, establishing responsible business practices, and ensuring greater engagement of home countries. With respect to national and sub-national governance, the report recommends that countries establish three public institutions: an environment directorate, a mining directorate and a geological survey to regulate the mines and metals industries. The report also articulates the role and responsibility of host governments, which includes devising responsible concession agreements, mainstreaming environmental assessment, domesticating natural capital accounting, ensuring transparency and channeling extractive rents into public investment.

Internationally, the report advocates for the creation of an International Minerals Agency to improve coordination mechanisms, or at least settling on an international agreement to share data on economic geology, mineral demand and the industry’s impacts. It suggests that this agreement could be negotiated through existing for a such as the UN Environment Assembly, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, and wider ongoing UN processes focused on reviewing progress towards the SDGs.

This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In this context, the Policy Brief also discusses the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) decision to end funding fossil fuel energy projects.

EIB Ends Funding of Fossil Fuel Energy Projects

In November 2019, the EIB Board adopted a decision to end financing for fossil fuel energy projects by the end of 2021. In its energy lending policy, aimed at supporting the energy transformation, the Bank further laid out its climate action and environmental sustainability strategy and focus on support for clean energy and security.

Specifically, the policy change means that the Bank will phase out support to:

the production of oil and natural gas;

traditional gas infrastructure;

power generation technologies resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above 250 gCO2 per kWh of electricity generated; and

large-scale heat production infrastructure based on unabated oil, natural gas, coal or peat.

The Bank will potentially continue to approve gas infrastructure projects already formally under appraisal until the end of 2021, noting that switching from oil or coal to natural gas may reduce GHG emissions in the short term.

The EIB explains that it will support clean energy and security directly by: reinforcing electricity networks; reducing energy demand through energy efficiency projects or through low-carbon power generation; and deploying demand response or storage at scale. According to the policy, five principles will govern future EIB engagement in the energy sector:

Prioritizing energy efficiency with a view to supporting the new EU target under the EU Energy Efficiency Directive; Enabling energy decarbonization through increased support for low- or zero-carbon technology, aiming to meet a 32% renewable energy share throughout the EU by 2030; Increasing financing for decentralized energy production, innovative energy storage and e-mobility; Ensuring grid investment for new, intermittent energy sources like wind and solar as well as strengthening cross-border interconnections; and Increasing the impact of investment to support energy transformation outside the EU.

Furthermore, the EIB Group stated that it expects its financing to unlock EUR 1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainable investment in the decade to 2030. The Bank will gradually increase the share of its financing dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability to reach 50% of its operations in 2025.

Outside the EU, the Bank foresees to support energy access with the development of energy systems that are low-carbon, efficient and reliable. The Bank’s energy lending volume represents only a small fraction of the required investment outside the EU. Looking to finance projects that reinforce countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Bank will support projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and energy transformation in other regions, in particular Asia and Latin America.

Aiming to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

Collectively, the EIB and the EU and its member States are the largest providers of public climate finance globally to developing countries, accounting for EUR 21.7 billion in 2018, including EUR 2.65 billion from the European Commission and EUR 2.97 billion from the EIB. The European Commission highlights this collective commitment, which kept increasing over the past five years, in the Fourth Biennial Report from the EU to the UNFCCC.

Like the EU, most developed country Parties have also submitted their biennial reports, as requested, by January 2020. These reports inform of Annex I Parties’: quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets; progress made towards their achievement, including information on mitigation actions and their effects, the estimates of emission reductions and removals, and the use of units from market-based mechanisms and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities; GHG emission trends and projections; and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing country Parties.

This information is relevant for the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal as well as adaptation and finance objectives, which are expressed in general terms in the Agreement’s provision articulating its purpose. On finance, Parties agreed to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” (Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c)).The EU’s BR4 stands out in this regard as it reports on EU’s implementation of this provision.

The European Commission explains its commitment to mainstream climate change mitigation and adaptation into all major EU spending programmes, with reference to the EIB’s Energy Lending Policy and the 2020 EU budget. With total commitments set at EUR 168.7 billion, the budget was endorsed in November 2019. To meet the goal of dedicating at least 20% of EU expenditure to climate protection in the period 2014-2020, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU agreed to increase the focus on climate-related actions in several areas. These include research and development, transport and energy infrastructure and the EU’s external action. Additional funds of EUR 590 million were allocated to the EU’s LIFE programme, the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and climate action, with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion for the 2014-2020 funding period. The European Commission also informs of its pledge to report on the “at least 25%” earmarking for the next financial framework 2021-2027.

The EU’s aim to make finance flows consistent with its climate commitments involves:

revenue spending from auctioning of EU ETS allowances;

diverting subsidies under the Renewable Energy Directive for transport sector from biofuel feedstocks with high indirect land use change emissions risks;

developing metrics and monitoring methodologies to track progress concerning finance flows; and

mobilizing the private sector through sustainable finance initiative and climate-related financial disclosure requirements.

Tracking Progress on the Paris Agreement’s Long-term Finance Goal

The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) is preparing the 2020 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. For this purpose, the Committee has called for submissions on evidence, including a list of needed information and data, with regard to:

methodological issues relating to measuring, reporting, and verifying climate finance flows;

data on climate-related finance flows;

assessment of the effectiveness of climate finance flows, including drivers, impact results, meeting needs, and access; and

information relevant to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c).

A call for improving understanding of finance flows was also heard during discussions at the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December 2019. Parties’ views, however, diverged on establishing a common definition of climate finance and on commencing work on the new collective post-2025 finance goal prior to the scheduled negotiations, to commence at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020.

At its 21st meeting in October 2019, the SCF addressed the determination of the needs of developing country Parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, which Parties had mandated the SCF to report on every four years, beginning in 2020. Prior to the meeting, the UNFCCC overhauled its Climate Finance Data Portal, which captures information, graphics and figures for a better understanding of climate finance flows, and informs of activities funded in developing countries to implement climate action, particularly financial flows that have been channeled, mobilized and leveraged by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It also presents information on Adaptation Fund project data related to entities, projects and programmes approved by the Adaptation Fund Board.

Defining Ways to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

According to the findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), momentum for aligning climate finance flows with the Paris Agreement is growing. Which multilateral development banks (MDBs) will follow in the EIB’s footsteps and take measures in support of the energy transformation? In its report titled, ‘Aligning Development Co-operation and Climate Action: The Only Way Forward,’ the OECD stressed that, in the case of “development finance,” support for energy efficiency and renewables has increased since the Paris Agreement, but continues to be undermined by financing for new fossil fuel-based energy. That means multilateral providers overall, which accounted for 77% of funding of fossil fuel activities in 2016 and 2017, need to change.

The complexity of “climate finance” is illustrated by data gaps, and heated negotiations characterized by diverging views on: what constitutes “new and additional” climate funding; whether climate finance should be excluded from being counted as official development assistance (ODA); and using private sector investments to meet climate finance needs.

Nevertheless, though drafted in general terms, the Paris Agreement provision on “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” reflects a certain degree of agreement among Parties. As the wording suggests, such efforts may entail whatever lies within state power, for example regulations, green fiscal policies, and providing public sustainable development aid to cause finance to flow in the direction of carbon neutrality. Yet given the time pressure to achieve the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, some have pointed to a growing realization that while necessary, globally, public finance alone may not be sufficient. While welcome, announcements such as by the EIB to double its share of sustainable financing to 50% are not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, making palpable the need for private sector investments at scale.

Private sector stakeholders, in turn, are certainly aware of their own climate change risks, including the issue of stranded assets, as noted in recent news. Companies are beginning to change their business models, expecting future revenues from demand for low-emission products and services. How this will influence climate finance flows, however, remains to be seen. Governments will have to identify their role in transforming economies and determine how to enable a shift in economic activities. In affluent societies, this may warrant considerations of basing these activities not only on the principle of “eco-efficiency,” which focuses on increasing output per unit of input, but also “eco-sufficiency,” which requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste and emissions in absolute terms.","This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The XIV Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Santiago, Chile from 27-31 January 2020, ahead of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), and its Beijing Platform for Action. This year’s CSW session will conduct a review of progress towards the action platform.

The Regional Conference served to review progress towards the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, adopted in 2016 at the XIII Regional Conference, and identify barriers to progress.

Without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.

During the Conference, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) launched a regional progress report that identifies hurdles to achieving gender equality in the region. The Regional Progress Report on the Montevideo Strategy, the first of its kind, recognizes successes towards achieving gender equality in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region to date. It also finds that as LAC governments prepare for Beijing+25, challenges include 1) the sheer magnitude of gender inequalities in the region and the limited State capacities available to address the issue; 2) lack of disaggregated data to analyze the issue; 3) the fact that gender inequalities manifest themselves at international, regional, national and subnational levels, and coordination is needed to renew and implement public policy across governance levels; and 4) the need to increase the budgets allotted to gender equality policies.

The Conference concluded with countries’ approval of the Santiago Commitment. The Commitment’s 48 points outline the means by which countries will accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. It welcomes the Regional Progress Report and reaffirms the commitments made in Beijing in 1995. The Commitment encourages countries to foster and promote public polices on various dimensions of gender equality including education, representation, labor participation, to measure the multiplier effects of boosting the care economy and strengthen the production of gender statistics at the national level, and to voluntarily report on progress.

At the Regional Conference’s closing session, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said it is time to “put an end to patriarchy as a societal model.” Isabel Plá, Chile’s Minister of Women’s Affairs and Gender Equity, emphasized that “without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.” The next session of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean is planned to be held in Argentina, in 2022.

Other regions have also affirmed commitments ahead of Beijing+25. UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab Regions committed to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at meetings organized in November 2019 by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), which resulted in respective declarations on progress.

In Europe, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) held a review meeting from 29-30 October 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland, co-hosted with the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia. In Africa, a regional review took place from 27 October to 1 November 2019, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UN Women and the African Union Commission (AUC).

The report argues that, beyond the compliance agenda, cities and regions should leverage the full potential of SDGs as a policy tool to improve people’s lives in a shared responsibility across levels of government.

The experiences of nine pilot cities and regions show the SDGs’ potential to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

Released during the Tenth World Urban Forum (WUF), on 10 February 2020, the report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs: Synthesis Report,’ highlights the key role of subnational governments in achieving the SDGs and demonstrates the importance of the SDGs for cities and regions. The report argues that many OECD countries are increasingly seizing the potential of the SDGs as a framework to improve multi-level governance, and in particular vertical coordination. For instance, Germany and Japan are promoting the “localisation” of the SDGs from the central government level by supporting cities and regions in their local SDGs strategies, both financially and in terms of capacity building. The report also documents – from the experience and evidence of nine pilot cities and regions – the potential that the SDGs offer to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

The report introduces a ‘Checklist for Public Action’ to help policymakers implement a territorial approach to the SDGs. The checklist presents action-oriented recommendations across five categories: planning, policies and strategies; multi-level governance; financing and budgeting; data and information; and engagement.

On planning, policies, and strategies, the checklist recommends defining and shaping local and regional development visions, strategies and plans and reorienting existing ones using the SDGs as a guiding framework; using the SDGs to manage tradeoffs and promote synergies among sectoral policies and across levels of government and link social, economic and environmental dimensions at the Goal or target level; using the SDGs to address concrete local challenges that require holistic approaches, such as access to green spaces, territorial inequalities or service delivery; and identifying place-based priorities through a participatory, multi-stakeholder process that considers the indivisibility and interconnectedness of the SDGs.

On engagement, the checklist suggests: using the SDGs as a vehicle to enhance accountability and transparency through engaging all territorial stakeholders in the policymaking process, including co-designing and co-implementing visions and strategies in a bottom-up, participatory way; engaging stakeholders using a combination of tools, such as providing networking opportunities, de-risking investments in SDG solutions through grants or loans; and using the SDGs as a tool for “public service motivation” by linking staff’s daily work with SDG achievement. Selected examples illustrate how cities and regions have implemented these recommendations.

The OECD Localised Indicator Framework for the SDGs measures the distance towards the SDGs for 601 regions and 649 cities, using 135 indicators across the 17 SDGs. At least 80% of regions from OECD countries have not achieved the suggested end values for 2030 in any of the 17 Goals. The average distance of OECD regions to the SDGs in 2030 ranges from 25% to 60%, showing that cities and regions in OECD countries are “far from achieving the SDGs.” Cities and regions are lagging behind the most on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action), and are performing the best on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Cities and regions can use the tool to compare their performance with other cities and regions in their country and identify peers in other countries. The tool aims to promote peer-learning and policy dialogues across cities and regions, increase government accountability on the SDGs, and raise awareness on the SDGs among society as a whole. An overview of Tataouine, Tunisia, for example shows that the city is 50% of the way towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), below the OECD average of 69%, and 48% percent of the way towards reaching SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), below the OECD average of 73%. The tool identifies Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand as a comparable city or region. The tool identifies Kinki, Japan, and Oslo and Akershus, Norway, as peer regions for New York, US.

OECD’s Programme on a Territorial Approach to the SDGs produced the report and indicator framework. The Programme plans to publish nine additional pilot-specific reports. Each report will offer in-depth analysis, tailored policy recommendations and action plans to champion a territorial approach to the SDGs.

OECD will launch a second phase of the Programme, which will work to implement recommendations and to support new cities, regions and countries in their efforts to localize the SDGs.

The fund is accepting contributions from a range of partners to meet its $50 million target size, with the Nordic Development Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and the Government of Australia providing capital for the project’s preparation.



Operations are expected to begin in Q2 2020 with investment in early stage startups focused on addressing ESG issues such as climate change and the empowerment of women. ADB Ventures has a 17-year fund life, which means it can invest long-term capital into the projects selected.



Mike Barrow, director general for private sector operations, ADB, says: “This region is brimming with technology solutions to conserve energy, reduce waste, fight climate change, and deliver public services effectively.



“Our vision is for ADB Ventures to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to achieve the SDGs by 2030.”

Impact technology solutions refer to specially designed technologies which are fundamentally aimed at making a positive impact toward ESG factors.

Barrow continues: “ADB Ventures will help bring these solutions to market by leveraging our extensive operational networks and filling the risk capital gap facing innovative early-stage companies in developing Asia and the Pacific, particularly smaller and frontier markets.”

ADB differentiates itself from a typical VC fund by going beyond the sourcing and provision of capital. ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 (the facility’s anchor trust fund) is augmented by a $12 million technical assistance program that will be deployed to the startups over three years. The program is two-pronged, with the ADB Ventures SEED grant program promoting expansion into emerging markets and the validation and de-risking of technology pilots.

The second leg of the assistance program, ADB Venture Lab provides a suite of innovation programs and will generate technology pilot opportunities to the anchor fund’s portfolio companies.



The announcement echoes a recent wave of banks and other large institutions making significant pledges to allocate resources toward sustainable ventures and re-align their portfolios to meet self-imposed carbon neutral commitments.



Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BlackRock and JP Morgan are just a handful of industry leaders working toward these goals, some of which are also deploying impact investing funds to support environmentally focused fintechs.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), has established the ADB Ventures platform to feed investment and support to Asian startups which are developing solutions aimed at achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

As the clock ticks towards 2030, the year when the world’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/en/ must be achieved, countries are working to improve their systems of statistic-gathering and analyses for better planning in crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry sectors.

However, the capacity to adequately monitor and analyse agricultural statistics varies dramatically country-by-country, and no where in the world is that variance more prevalant than in the Asia-Pacific region.

Pietro Gennari, Chief Statistician of FAO, noted the significant data gaps in Asia-Pacific in monitoring the SDGs, and the slow progress towards achieving its goals. “Slow country commitment to measuring the SDGs, and the poor performance towards achieving the SDGs, are closely connected. We are witnessing an inversion of the familiar axiom whereby “what gets measured gets done”. We are not measuring the SDG indicators, and this is one of the crucial reasons why we are not on track to achieving the SDG targets.”

Special Commission convenes in Bali to address the gaps

FAO today opened the 28th Session of the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS)http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-events/ess-apcas, in Bali, Indonesia. The Commission Session runs from 10-14 February. It is hosted by the Government of Indonesia with more than 100 participants from some 30 countries and 10 international and regional organizations attending.

Focusing on the specific needs of food and agricultural statistics of Asia-Pacific, this biennial meeting of agricultural statisticians and experts reviews and support the region’s preparedness to produce adequate statistics to monitor progress towards the 2030 SDG targets.

What doesn’t get measured doesn’t get done: The urgency for statistics in the progress to end hunger

Food insecurity plays an important role as a determinant of many different forms of hunger and malnutrition. The majority of the world’s hungry, and children affected by stunting, live in Asia. Hunger has increased in many countries where the economy has slowed down or contracted, mostly in middle-income countries. Furthermore, economic shocks are contributing to prolonging and worsening the severity of food crises caused primarily by conflict and climate shocks. Even in upper-middle and high-income countries malnutrition is an issue, with obesity evident in school-age children, adolescents, and adults.

“Collaboration among internal institutions within the government such as Statistics Indonesia, Ministry of Agriculture, relevant ministries/agencies with the FAO of the United Nations, is needed to produce high quality agricultural statistics that are accurate, timely and relevant to provide SDG’s indicators. said Chief Statistician of Statistics Indonesia, Dr. Suhariyanto, in his key note speech. “Sharing of knowledge and good practices in the regional conference, such as APCAS, is a way to improve and accelerate production of agricultural statistics in Asia Pacific. Adding to that, the discussion at the forum will be effective to monitor the SDGs achievements in the region.”

“Agenda 2030 identifies 17 goals, 169 targets and some 232 indicators to monitor progress. This is a huge and daunting task for national statisticians, and the clock is ticking down to 2030. With only a decade to go, and nearly half a billion hungry people still struggling to survive in our region, we must strengthen partnerships among governments, international organizations and the private sector to meet these data needs,” said Stephen Rudgard, FAO Representative to Indonesia. “FAO stands ready to support national efforts through its technical assistance programmes.”

The APCAS meeting provides a platform for Asia Pacific countries to directly engage in drawing attention to their unique challenges in development of agricultural statistics such as geographical remoteness, changing cropping patterns and livestock rearing due to climate change and transboundary diseases, and limited statistical infrastructure and resources.

A plan for improving the use of ICT and “Big Data” in Agriculture Statistics

Adding to the many firsts, FAO announced new partnerships to help countries adopt cost effective technologies to produce agriculture statistics. FAO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a massive open on-line courses in 2019 and handbooks will be launched during APCAS on use of tablet-based data collection using Computer Assisted Personal Interviews. Hundreds of thousands to millions of paper questionnaires can now be replaced with less than a few thousand tablet computers in the largest of countries, saving time, money, transportation and trees. FAO also announced a partnership with the ADB and the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) to help countries use satellite data to generate agriculture statistics. FAO, ADB and AIT will host a three-data expert meeting on this subject after APCAS, joined by various regional experts and private sector firms.

“This new data source is part of what we call Big Data, and its development is often led by the private sector. Partnering with the private sector allows us to innovate, and is a game changer in how governments produce official statistics. We will discuss this during APCAS, and in more detail in the three-day expert group meeting that follows. Several private firms will join the expert group meeting to explore how we can work better together to enable official statistics to exploit these new non-traditional, powerful and real-time data sources,” said Sangita Dubey, FAO Regional Statistician and Secretary of the Commission.

The APCAS session will also review other new approaches to developing and integrated system of Agricultural Census and Surveys, enhance data quality assurance, produce and share privacy-protected micro data, and provide crop, livestock and fisheries statistics in a cost-effective manner.

The recommendations of APCAS will serve as a guide and lay down priorities for FAO for the next two years in its effort towards building capacity of countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Both endeavors support achievement of globally agreed goals on forests within the context of the forthcoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in 2021.

The CPF Strategic Vision calls for the sustainable management of all types of forests and forest landscapes by 2030. It seeks to recognize the multiple values of forests, unlock their goods and services, and it calls for the achievement of the SDGs and the Global Forest Goals. To support countries in the achievement of these aims, the CPF will enhance coherence and synergy on forest-related issues and values among its member organizations. It will focus on moving from deforestation to restoration.

The CPF will also work towards a set of strategic priorities that include: supporting the achievement of the globally-agreed goals and targets on forests; promoting the science-policy interface and science-based decision making; enhancing communication and outreach activities; enhancing cross-sectoral collaboration, policy coherence, coordination, and integrated approaches; unlocking the full potential and values of forests; and identifying emerging issues of significant concern to forests. The CPF will operationalize these priorities through its 4-year workplans, which align with the quadrennial workplans of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF).

The Decade is expected to upscale the restoration of degraded ecosystems and support efforts to address the climate and biodiversity crises.

Speaking on the Vision, Hiroto Mitsugi, FAO Assistant Director-General and Chair of the CPF said it was “crucial to move from deforestation to restoration.” He also noted that “in light of the upcoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the CPF has an increasingly important role to play.” The Decade, which will conclude in 2030, is expected to upscale the restoration of degraded ecosystems and support efforts to address the climate and biodiversity crises while enhancing food and water security, among other ecosystem services.

Also in January, religious leaders met in Jakarta, Indonesia to launch the Interfaith Rainforest Initiative country programme. The leaders recognized the “destruction and loss of tropical forests as a threat to the sustainability of human life,” and they demanded immediate and decisive action to protect the country’s forests. The Interfaith Rainforest Initiative in Indonesia will be carried forward by an Advisory Council, representing a coalition between religious communities, indigenous peoples, civil society, the scientific community and the UN. In December 2019, the Initiative launched its Democratic Republic of the Congo country programme, which aims to protect the Congo Basin’s tropical forests.","Both endeavors support achievement of globally agreed goals on forests within the context of the forthcoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration in 2021.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to alleviate social, economic, and environmental problems by the year 2030, but progress has been slower than necessary and scattershot in impact. Certain SDGs tend to attract awareness and action from companies if they are closely related to their business objectives, but others (#1 No Poverty, for example, or #14 Life Below Water) seem relegated to specialist intervention. The goals themselves are nonbinding, absent government adoption and mandates, and there are only a handful of standards for the management and/or reporting of SDG performance.

Most of the world’s stock exchanges support the SDGs. Industry advocacy and support takes many forms, including participation in the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative and the UN Global Compact. Some exchanges have also integrated the work of the SDGs into the sustainability tools and support that they provide to listed companies, leveraging events, white papers, and webinars to demonstrate the market value and business impact of the SDGs.

“Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation.”

Yet a relatively small number of companies are publicly reporting progress against the SDGs, which implies that the 2030 target is in serious jeopardy. Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), fundamental building blocks of job creation and international development, seem to be particularly silent. The most recent Sustainable Development Goals Report (UN, 2018) cites certain factors for this, including a lack of expertise and resources, especially in developing economies.

Given this seeming gap between advocacy and performance, we wanted to examine the level of SDG awareness, action, and efficacy within the global exchange community. WFE provided CFI.co an understanding of SDGs-related industry practices based on a WFE survey.

Under Chief Executive Nandini Sukumar, the WFE created a set of Sustainability Principles that (among other things) formalizes industry commitment to the UN SDGs by accelerating development of sustainable finance and promoting awareness in the capital market. Ms. Sukumar, citing the WFE Annual Sustainability Survey, says, “73% of the exchanges with sustainability initiatives have some form of SDG-specific initiatives. These initiatives include education programs on SDGs for issuers, disclosure guidance and offering SDG-related products in their markets.” Certain SDGs (#5 Gender Equality, #8 Decent Work Conditions, and #13 Climate Action) are the most engaged among WFE members.

Survey Results

We sent questions to the Sustainability Working Group — a subset of WFE members that are especially committed to sustainable business integration — and received responses for more than half of them. Participating exchanges included B3 (Brazil), Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, Borsa Istanbul, Bourse de Casablanca, Dubai Financial Market, the Egyptian Exchange, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange Group, National Stock Exchange of India, Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Two members elected to remain anonymous, and Nasdaq itself has contributed to the industry data in this article.

We found that awareness and valuation of the SDGs is nearly universal, yet actionable progress is not being measured. The SDGs are vital to capital market function, particularly for listed firms and their respective supply chains. Without reaching for the Goals, one responding exchange said, “Neither the capital markets nor the real economy will be able to survive in the coming decades.”

80% claim that the SDGs are well understood in their market

87% believe that the SDGs are a fundamental part of the sustainable economy

More exchanges (54%) do not measure SDG progress than do (46%)

Wanting to press further, we asked this question: How does your exchange engage, inform, or otherwise communicate with issuers and other stakeholders about the UN SDGs? The disparate range of answers may help to explain the gap between industry awareness and industry action, as there is no global standard for measurement – but it’s also clear that the responding exchanges are proactive.

“The SDGs are recommended as a global reporting framework for listed companies in LSEG ESG reporting guidance,” according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). “FTSE Russell — the global, multi-asset index provider part of LSEG — develops investment tools that incorporate alignment with the SDGs in the index design.”

Taiwan Stock Exchange cited strong information disclosure, corporate governance, stewardship responsibility, sustainable product development, and market capacity building as evidence of their commitment to SDG progress. Other exchanges cited index development as a key driver. Other exchanges were more candid about market inhibitors. Further support from stakeholders including issuers is needed to allow exchanges to move forward more aggressively.

Other Industry Initiatives

The UN and exchange leaders had previously identified the SDGs that most pertain to the industry and the various ways that capital markets can help deliver on the Goals. Per this guidance, the SDGs that receive special emphasis from Nasdaq and others include:

#5 Gender Equality. Ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.

#12 Responsible Consumption and Production. Encouraging companies, especially large and trans-national companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.

#13 Climate Action. Improving education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

#17 Partnerships for the Goals. Enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of sustainable development goals in all countries, particularly developing countries.

An influential joint report from the UN SSE and the WFE (How Exchanges Can Embed Sustainability Within their Operations: A Blueprint to Advance Action, 2019) makes one point clear: “The imperative of sustainability as embodied in the SDGs demands deep transformative change from both business and public policy. For exchanges, the incorporation of sustainability considerations is likely to be a determinant of long-term performance and resilience in a changing world.”

These are welcome steps given the critical condition of India’s water sector, which is highly stressed.

Water resources are limited. The water demand in all sectors by 2050 is estimated to exceed its supply. While demand is growing, the quality of water supply is dwindling. Per capita water supply is declining on an annual basis and is likely to touch the benchmark of water-scarce supply in the coming years. Groundwater levels are also decreasing, although globally, India is the highest user of groundwater, especially in irrigation and domestic sectors. Its quality is also a cause of concern.

SDG 6.1 stipulates achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking for all by 2030. Under the Jal Jivan Mission (JJM) scheme, India launched the programme to provide piped water connections (at 55 litres per head per day) to 14.6 crore rural households by 2024. An amount of Rs 3.6 lakh crore (with a Central share of Rs 2.08 lakh crore) has been approved for this scheme over the five year period. During 2020-21 (Table 1), an allocation of Rs 11,500 crore (15% more than the revised estimate for 2019-20) for connecting 1.15 crore household through functionally piped connections in rural areas, has been made. Under this programme, source sustainability measures for augmenting water supply through rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, and management of greywater for reusing wastewater, have been envisaged through gram panchayats which should play a crucial role in planning, designing, execution, operations and maintenance of the in-village infrastructure.

SDG 6.2 goals are required to be achieved by India through access to adequate sanitation and hygiene for all, and ending open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women, girls, and those in vulnerable situations. Having made substantial progress under the Swachh Bharat Mission and declaring the country as open defecation free (ODF), India is determined to continue to take steps for liquid and solid faecal waste management, post toilet construction. Accordingly, it has allocated Rs 12,294 crore (25% more than the revised estimate of 2019-20) for FY 2020-21 for achieving the ‘ODF plus’ status of sanitation component. This is also a welcome step.

Water quality has to be improved by reducing pollution (SDG 6.3) by 2030. For cleaning the river, allocation of funds under Namami Gange (Rs 800 crore) for Ganga cleaning and National River conservation (Rs 840 crore) for cleaning other rivers, has been made during 2020-21. SDG 6.6 mandates protecting and restoring water-related ecosystem such as wetlands, rivers, aquifers. These two programmes address this aspect as well. There is no fund allocated for grey water management for recycling and reuse of wastewater as required under SDG (6.3), although this aspect is proposed to be covered under the JJM scheme while giving access to water.

India’s water use efficiency in all sectors is not satisfactory. For example, India’s water use is highest in the irrigation sector (80%) and its efficiency is only 38%. To address the improvement of the efficiency, PMKSY (‘per drop more crop’) scheme was launched using micro-irrigation technology. India’s potential for micro-irrigation is an area of 70 million hectares and the achievement till 2018 is only 9 million hectares. PMKSY is a Centrally sponsored scheme and states’ meaningful participation is essential. Budget 2020-21 allocated Rs 4,000 crore, which is almost double the RE 2019-2020 amount and is substantial.

Unfortunately, increasing water use efficiency in the domestic and industrial sectors was not touched upon in the Budget, although the SDG 6.4 mandates increasing efficiency in all sectors. To ensure sustainable water withdrawals, an allocation of Rs 200 crore under Atal Bhujal Yojana for incentivising and effective groundwater management is a welcome step. In addition, PMKSY (Har khet ko pani) and integrated watershed management have been allocated higher funds during 2020-21 for addressing source sustainability measures.

Given the allocation of funds for water and sanitation sectors was Rs 30,478 crore for 2020-21 (higher than the 2019-20 figure by about 20%), India’s commitment to implementing the SDG 6 goal is evident. Since water and sanitation are state subjects, the states’ full participation in the implementation of schemes is essential. Given the past achievements in sanitation sectors, there is much hope for overcoming the enormous challenges in the water sector.

Crysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

Benjamin de Haan, SDG director of transportation and planning services told council on Feb. 18 that he was very satisfied with the tenders that had been received for the project.

“Here it is finally, after all this time we’re here awarding the project for the Crysler Bridge,” he said. We’re very happy with the price. This is a full rehabilitation of the bridge and it is on budget.”

The project will see the county spend $1,533,000 on the rehabilitation, plus the harmonized sales tax. Tenders for the project had initially been issued last year, but every one of them had been over budget. This resulted in SDG staff modifying the project, cutting down on its cost.

“Last year’s low bid was $1.9 million and our budget was of $1.2 million,” said de Haan. “So we obviously made adjustments to the tender, as you can see. Some of those changes include extending the construction schedule.”","Article contentCrysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

The first group is made up of those who adversely criticize whatever President Muhammadu Buhari does or fails to do, while the second group consists of those who see no wrong whatsoever in the activities of Buhari’s government.

The two groups have something in common which is that most Nigerians do not understand either of them.

Perhaps because both groups are unaware of this situation, they have continued to seize every opportunity to eloquently disagree with one another on every subject so as to convince us that they have good points either way.

So, when Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki last week painted a frightening picture but which looks like a true story of the precarious Nigerian economy, the resultant huge war of words between the pro and anti-Buhari crusaders especially the non-state actors could not have surprised any analyst who has followed street debates in the country.

As if to sensitize people on the state of the nation’s economy, Obaseki had raised an alarm that our finances have gone so low that last month,government had to print more money for states to share to meet their obligations.

This was unacceptable to some people who decided to react to the allegation. First, was an unsigned statement that government was unaware of any printing of money as alleged. One comedian immediately tweeted that “the man didn’t say you were aware, he said you printed.

”The second reaction described the governor’s alarm as a lie while the third educated us on the correct terminology for what happened – lending, not printing. Painfully, what should be of concern to us has been buried by the controversy.

The fact that what was shared was a form of loan seems to establish that there was not enough to share. Whether the extra that was borrowed was printed or conjured by a magician cannot controvert the fact that Nigeria is hugely broke.

If such truth must be told to put our status in correct perspective, then Obaseki’s alarm can hardly be wished away especially if his entire statement and not just theexcerpt on printing is read in full.

Indeed, there are vital parts of the statement that have been ignored. For the benefit of those who may not have read Obaseki’s statement, here is a crucial aspect that ought not to be downplayedor discountenanced.

According to the governor, “everywhere else, governments rely on the people to produce taxes and that is what they use to run the local government, state and the federation.

But with the way we run Nigeria, the country can go to sleep. At the end of the month, we just go to Abuja, collect money and we come back to spend.

We are in trouble, huge financial trouble. The current price of crude oil is only a mirage. The major oil companies who are the ones producing are no longer investing much in oil.

Shell is pulling out of Nigeria and Chevron is now one of the world’s largest investors in alternative fuel, so in another year or so, where will we find this money that we go to share in Abuja?”

This quotation is no doubt a veritable wake-up call for us all to rise to the occasion and change our spending habit.

This is more so when the governor also clearly stated that it would be unfair for Nigerians to expect one man – Buhari, to be left alone to face the enormous problems.

In other words, the governor’s statement created no room for claims and counter claims amongst politicians or supporters.

It is also important to make the point that this is not the first time some of us are getting confused about the internal sources of Nigeria’s colossal loans.

Last month, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) announced that his corporation could no longer bear the huge subsidy payments of over N120 billion monthly subsidy for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).

The NNPC according to Kyari has been absorbing the cost differential between the actual and selling cost of the product by recording it in its financial books.

Not many understood the statement. From which of its books does NNPC get such huge sums every month?

If NNPC had been paying all its funds into the Federation Account as legally expected what magic does the Corporation employ to accommodate massive subsidy payments; is it by merely writing the amounts in its books?

Indeed, during the peak of the Covid 19 pandemic, there were certain expenses which Nigeria was too broke to accommodate and which both the NNPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), graciously accepted to co-settle.

Do these two bodies have their own supply of funds? Answers to a question such as this may illuminate the state of Nigeria’s finances Is Nigeria really in financial trouble, if so, to what extent?

The latest answer to this question was given a few days ago by Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed who said “the nation’s debt profile was still within sustainable limit.”

The statement was quite comforting on its face value but the situation on ground appears to counter it because if we still have capacity to borrow more, why not go ahead and resolve the numerous issues waiting to be settled?

From basic economics we can imagine that our current inflation rate reflects a decline in the purchasing power of our naira which is itself not available to many. Only last week, the National Bureau of Statistics released her consumer price index (CPI) for March 2021.

In the report,inflation was said to have risen to 18% in March representing 0.82% when compared to 17% recorded in February.

Similarly, food inflation rose by 5.0% to 23% in March from 22 percent in February. The report is worth worrying about especially as the scarce funds available are swallowed by personnel costs across the nation. How do we develop?

The body language of the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele at the press conference where he was requested to react to Obaseki’s comment, showed he was visibly upset that his sacrifices do not appear appreciated.

Of course no responsible CBN can watch her nation in trouble without intervening. Again, no one doubts that our CBN has never been this stressed in history.

Governor Emefiele must take solace in the fact that he has been able to withstand the vagaries of the economic weather of Nigeria in the last couple of troublesome years.

To say that Nigeria is super broke is not an indictment but telling the truth about our situation for general enlightenment.

One of the advantages of educating people on the true status of our economy is that it can have an effect on the increasing demands by different striking Nigerian workers on all kinds of expectations.

What displeases Nigerians is not the disclosure of the true state of their nation’s economy but the transparent inequity where at this critical stage, some people still enjoy wardrobe, newspaper or other forms of annoying comfort while others are dying.

49,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-wendy-a-revisionist-southern-wild-peter-pan-story,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Wendy’: A Revisionist Southern-Wild Peter Pan Story,"The director of the celebrated indie Beasts of the Southern Wild is back with a weird and messily personal take on Peter Pan — one that intriguingly reworks the theme of motherhood in the traditional story.

No child dreams of growing up to push a mop or sling plates in a diner. As Benh Zeitlin’s Wendy observes, though, our dreams change as the years go by.

Angela Darling (Shay Walker) is a single mom of three children running a diner on the outskirts of New Orleans. One of her twin sons (Gage and Gavin Naquin) says she used to be a “badass”; pressed by her children about her youthful dreams, she confesses that she wanted to be in a rodeo.

And now? Her “dream” today — “Taking care of my tribe … making sure I don’t screw you up too bad” — to a child’s ears sounds depressingly diminished. If that’s what growing up means, what child wouldn’t take a pass?

Zeitlin’s celebrated, celebratory 2012 feature debut, Beasts of the Southern Wild, offered a magical child’s-eye view of Louisiana bayou life in all its harshness and beauty. The Darlings’ diner in Wendy seems situated at the frontier of the mundane and the magical: a static, stagnant neighborhood seemingly mired in time, untouched by the outside world, with one caveat: the thundering freight trains that invade the neighborhood at all hours of the day and night, their hurtling passage like immense angelic or demonic emissaries, beckoning on behalf of a world beyond.

It isn’t just the trains that beckon. Wendy Darling (Devin France) has glimpsed a tiny figure leaping fearlessly atop the trains from car to car. Long ago a neighborhood boy followed that figure onto a train — and was never seen again. The iron giants barrel right past Wendy’s second-floor bedroom window, so close that she could leap aboard. The trains hold out the hope of avoiding the fate, shared by those left behind, of growing up in what seems a dead-end world where nothing ever happens. In fact, those who ride away may not grow up at all.

Transposing J.M. Barrie’s Victorian fairy tale as a Southern-wild fever dream, Zeitlin’s take on Peter Pan, co-written with his sister Eliza Zeitlin, is in some ways similar in spirit to Spike Jonze’s 2009 Where the Wild Things Are, itself indebted to Barrie. Like Wild Things, Wendy is both exhilarating and sad, homespun and visionary, weird and messily personal.

The tiny figure on the train tops is, of course, Peter himself, played by a startlingly young, dreadlocked Yashua Mack, with an implacable gaze befitting the wildness and sternness of Barrie’s tragic hero. Perhaps he isn’t quite as magical as Barrie’s hero, or as magical as he thinks he is, but he’s intriguingly close.

Mack is one of two black actors playing Peter Pan in new films that made their debuts in January at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. The other film, Come Away, is a somewhat more traditional British period piece set roughly in Barrie’s day, with Angelina Jolie and David Oyelowo as parents of three children, two of whom will grow up to be Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland.

Despite its high-minded literary aspirations, Come Away is a disappointment. Among many other problems, Jordan Nash’s sensitive Peter has nothing of the feral heartlessness of Barrie’s incalculable character. Wendy’s Peter is much closer in spirit to the boy who resents all real parents and the claims they make on their children, but who has a special place in his heart for the idea of a mother as someone who tells stories.

In Zeitlin’s film, though, it is not Wendy who represents motherhood. Instead, Wendy is as wild as the boys, for it is her own angst about the compromises of growing up that has catapulted her into Neverland, along with her twin brothers Douglas and James.

Occupying the maternal role traditionally given to Wendy is a mysterious presence replacing Barrie’s fairies and mermaids: a beast that is pure Zeitlin, and the locus of magic in a Neverland very far from Barrie’s potpourri of mythological contrasts.

Barrie’s Neverland was syncretistic patchwork of fairies, Caribbean pirates, American Indians, mermaids, crocodiles and so forth. There are no Indians or crocodiles on this rugged, volcanic Caribbean island, but the island appears to come to life when Peter approaches, just like Barrie’s Neverland, and the volatility of the land seems to answer Peter’s own wildness of spirit and the abandon of the Lost Boys’ play.

As in the world of the Bathtub in Beasts of the Southern Wild, Zeitlin emphasizes the visual wonder and playfulness of Neverland, from rugged sedimentary rock formations and underwater caverns to the Lost Boys sliding down muddy slopes or diving from a twisted tree over the water.

There’s also, as in Barrie, a dark side of this Neverland. Carefree romping and gamboling is a full-time occupation, and one can’t pause to reflect or question without the risk of starting to grow up. Even in Neverland, adulthood remains an existential risk. (Barrie’s novel notes that Peter occasionally had to “thin out” the Lost Boys when they started to grow up, but no prior adaptation I’m aware of has contemplated what this might mean, or, as someone says here, “where Lost Boys go when they’re really lost.”)

The Zeitlins’ reworking of Peter Pan’s theme of motherhood is perhaps the most intriguing thing about the film to me. Barrie’s Neverland was both magical and heartless for the same reason: There were no mothers there. Maternal love, for Barrie, bound one to the mundane world and to the necessity of growing up; by leaving mothers behind, Peter could fly away and remain forever a child in a magical world.

This Neverland works differently: Motherhood powers it, makes it magical, and keeps Peter and the other Lost Boys young. In the emotional climax, a crisis corresponding to the poisoning of Tinker Bell, clapping to express belief in fairies is replaced by an affirmation of mother-love. Wendy ultimately vindicates motherhood as a heroic calling; it even subverts Peter’s famous line about dying, proposing that growing up would be an awfully big adventure.

It doesn’t all work. Wendy’s attempts to challenge the dark side of Neverland and the lostness of the Really Lost Boys through imagination and solidarity are given short shrift. Above all, a major character’s disturbing arc emphasizing the gravity of the stakes trails off in an inconclusive, unsatisfying way.

But it’s a rare take on Peter Pan that takes the material seriously on a mythic level, neither banalizing it like the 1953 Disney cartoon nor treating it in an overly self-aware way, like Steven Spielberg’s Hook and P.J. Hogan’s 2003 Pan.

It’s full of sorrow, disappointment and dread, but also joy and hope. In an age when most Hollywood movies try to please everyone on a shallow level, Wendy is a film that shouldn’t exist. It’s a style of moviemaking that seems to have no place in today’s cookie-cutter film market — that seems to have no audience, even, unless the audience is you.

Organized by NITI Aayog in partnership with the North Eastern Council, Govt. of Assam, and Tata Trust, the conclave is supported by UNDP and RIS.

The inaugural session of the conclave started with an address from Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, followed by welcome remarks from Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister, Finance, Transformation & Development, Education & Health, Government of Assam. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog set the context for the Conclave, followed by Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

The three-day event, from 24 to 26 February, hinged on the premise of ‘Partnership, Cooperation and Development of North East States’, will see representation from the highest offices of all the State Governments of the north east, Central ministries, civil society organizations, academia, international development organizations and think tanks active in the north eastern region.

“India, especially the northeast region, offers unique challenges & opportunities. The solutions need interventions that bring disruptive change and, thus, fostering a tech-embedded development trajectory is of paramount importance,” said NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.

Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, focused on the need for mainstreaming the northeastern region in the national development agenda and identification of state specific and region specific priorities as key to SDG localisation.

“Several north eastern states rank on the top of NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index and the region is India’s bridge to South East Asia, and this presents immense opportunity for trade & commerce,” said Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

Chief Ministers of North Eastern states also addressed the inaugural session of the SDG Conclave. “In the coming days, we will partner will NITI Aayog for strengthening our resolve for SDGs. We have identified 145 state indicators linked to the CM dashboard, which has been monitoring the State’s progress for the last 2 years,” said Pema Khandu, CM of Arunachal Pradesh.

“With the financial help from the Central Government, as well as monitoring the progress made by north eastern states of India, I believe the SDGs can certainly be achieved,” said Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga.

“Through SDG Conclave 2020, we now have a regional space to learn from each other and from the rest of India. Sustainability is important for Himalayan states like Sikkim and how we harness our natural resources,” said Prem Singh Tamang, CM of Sikkim.

Chief Minister of Tripura, Biplab Kumar Deb, presented a goal wise analysis of Tripura’s progress towards achieving the ambitious Agenda 2030 by linking existing schemes and programmes.

“Guwahati will play a crucial role as it is India’s gateway to Southeast Asia. Together, with NITI Aayog’s support, we will continue our journey in ensuring the prosperity of the region and its people,” put forth Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam.

In his keynote address, Union Minister of State (MoS), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jitendra Singh, said, “When India becomes a $5 trillion economy, the north east will be an essential component”.

Another key highlight was the release of reports on challenges, prospects, and SDG best practices. The four reports released were: Compendium of State Indicator Frameworks of 8 North Eastern States; North East and SDGs by RIS and Tata Trusts; Stories of Change by Tata Trusts; and Best Practices Portfolio on North East by UNDP.

The inaugural session on the first day will be followed by technical sessions on 25 and 26 Feb. These sessions will include discussions pertaining to SDGs in the North Eastern Region: Pathways for Localisation and Achievement; Drivers of Economic Prosperity & Sustainable Livelihoods; Climate Adaptive Agriculture; Nutrition Security & Health and Wellbeing for All; Education, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; Communication, Connectivity and Infrastructure Development; Addressing Inequality and Exclusion in the North East and the Way Forward and Valedictory.

NITI Aayog has the mandate of overseeing the adoption and monitoring of SDGs at the national and sub-national level. Progress in the northeast region is crucial in this decade of action for the country to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and this conclave is part of NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts towards fostering partnerships at the sub-national level. In terms of SDG localisation, the states in the region have taken major strides in integrating the Agenda 2030.

As the library remains unrestricted for all to provide any relevant services, including reading, access to information and research, it is termed a 'University for Public'. Library is basically a living apparatus which preserves all the information of the past for the use of the present generation and that creates link between the past and present generation for the utilisation of information for its future generation.

The United Nations (UN) held a meeting in New York at the end of September 2019 for adoption of the 2030 Agenda with a total of 169 targets spanning economic, environmental and social development. The global body outlined a plan for all countries to actively work for making the world better for peoples, without anyone left behind.

Libraries are essential platforms for achieving such objectives. Over the last few years, International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has been actively involved in formulation of the UN 2030 Agenda, promoting inclusion of access to information, safeguarding of cultural heritage, disaster risk reduction through climate literacy, universal literacy and access to ICT (information and communications) in the system. IFLA is the leading international body representing the interests of people who rely on libraries and information professionals.

Access to information was recognised as a priority in SDG 16 (target 16.10): ensuring public access to information and safeguarding fundamental freedoms in compliance with national legislation and international agreements.

Culture (target 11.4), climate literacy (SDG-13) and ICT (targets 5b, 9c, 17.8) have also been included in the SDGs. And, universal literacy is recognised in the vision for the UN 2030 Agenda.

Libraries all over the world are reliable organisations with access to information that is necessary to drive economic opportunity and community development. In many places, a library is the only place where people have access to information that will help better education, develop new skills, find jobs, build businesses, make informed farming and health decisions, or gain insights into environmental issues.

The UN SDGs are now common goals and each country will be responsible for developing and implementing national policies to achieve them, and it is expected that it will track and report its own progress towards each goal.

HOW TO GET INVOLVED: In Bangladesh, libraries now need to demonstrate that they can accelerate change across the whole range of 2030 Agenda. Everyone within and beyond the library community can help foster the role of libraries as development supporters.

IFLA suggests that it is now vital to negotiate with government decision-makers to ensure awareness of the role of libraries as development engines, and to ensure that libraries obtain the funding needed to continue this work. Increasing visibility inside and beyond the library community by arranging events, use of the social media, websites for updating library technology and services, forums, and mailing the users are useful to demonstrate contribution of libraries to helping the country's growth.

Library associations and members should be involved in advocacy work at national and regional levels to ensure reliable public access to information through library services and programmes.

SDG FRAMEWORK: Very recently, as part of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, some 20 library members, along with other guests, gathered at the Australian Library Association (ALIA) House in Canberra to discuss goals for Australian libraries. They developed 17 SDG goals and 169 SDG targets and are divided into three sections: Priorities for Australian library services, contribution to society and Global citizenship through the prism of the people who attended the roundtable. In every section there are multiple subsections which reflect targets, explanation, role of actors to achieve the targets, indicators, measures taken by leading institutions and timeframe to achieve the goals.

Australian copyright legislation supports open access; equitable access; culture and heritage; literacy and lifelong learning.

It is unfortunate that the library associations in Bangladesh are not yet members of IFLA. It's time to be actively engaged with libraries and library associations internationally.

I’ve been there, it’s quarantined off.” Roumeliotis pointed to the fact the quarantined area is currently manned by Canadian Red Cross workers, Army personnel, public health agency workers and an emergency management medical assistance team. “If I was infected and coughed, it would go a couple of feet but drop to the ground and stay there,” he said. “If someone happened to touch it, they might get infected— but it’s not going to be airborne and going into ventilation like other viruses do.”

Article content The Eastern Ontario Health Unit is providing regular status updates on the quarantine at the Cornwall NAV CENTRE. Our... Posted by Eastern Ontario Health Unit on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 In its regular update on Tuesday, the EOHU indicated the testing laboratory set up at CFB Trenton would now be moving to the Nav Centre as the people quarantined in Trenton reached the end of their 14-day stay and were released. The daily update also indicated one person at the Nav Centre was transported to Cornwall Community Hospital on Monday for medical reasons unrelated to the COVID-19. “There were transfers of quarantined individuals to hospitals in Trenton for medical reasons not related to COVID-19, and we do expect them here as well,” Roumeliotis is quoted as saying in the update— though he did not volunteer this information during his update to city council Monday. All precautions were taken by Cornwall-SDG EMS in transporting the person, and the Cornwall Community Hospital is equipped and prepared to isolate the person while providing treatment. If well enough to be released before the 14-day quarantine is lifted, the person would return to the Nav Centre. During his presentation, Roumeliotis praised the quarantine area, calling it an ideal location, being completely walled off and having a tunnel leading to it. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking to Nav employees,” he said. “I know that some are worried. I’m also getting phone calls from schools saying that kids are being bullied now because their parents work at the Nav. Some parents are refusing to send their kids to daycares and to schools because their parents are working at the Nav Centre.”

For the first time in eight years, the Cornwall Collegiate Golden Raiders are senior girls volleyball champs in SDG.

The Golden Raiders won the tri-county AA title on their home court on Tuesday, defeating the visiting St. Joseph’s Panthers in an exciting championship match that required four sets.

The Golden Raiders, coached by Ian Wilson, took the first set 25-12, but the Panthers would rally and get even with a 25-21 win in the second game. Cornwall Collegiate went back out in front with a 25-15 decision in the third set. The fourth set was tight, 22-21, but the Golden Raiders were able to get on a run and pull away to a 25-22 victory.

“We traded points back and forth before we were able to pull away (down the stretch),” Wilson said.

It was somewhat of an unlikely local conclusion for the Golden Raiders, who had to overcome a considerable amount of adversity this winter.

“Our season started with three girls on the injured list, with sprained ankles, dislocated knees and wisdom teeth surgery,” Wilson said.

But, when everyone was available, the Golden Raiders were a force, charging to an 8-2 regular season record.

Their next challenge will be on Wednesday, playing at the eastern Ontario championships in Pembroke. The winner of the tournament will move on to the OFSAA provincials to be played early in March.","Article contentFor the first time in eight years, the Cornwall Collegiate Golden Raiders are senior girls volleyball champs in SDG.

Dr John Adabie Appiah, the President of PSG, who made the call said access to paediatric services was increasing across the country and has become necessary to have more experts to expand their services to every corner of the country.

Dr Appiah was speaking at the PSG’s two-day maiden Annual General and Scientific Meeting in Accra on the theme; “Building Partnerships to Achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3”.

The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Newborns, children and adolescents in Ghana are faced with a myriad of health challenges, which must be addressed holistically.

He said with the failure to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, Ghana has no excuse but to accelerate efforts to be counted among the ‘elite’ nations of SDG high-fliers.

“This calls for more than doubling our efforts, pooling resources together and working with each other and trust that we can do better,” he stated.

According to him, the Society was seriously looking into the uneven distribution of child health experts in some parts of the country adding that, this is a major issue, which compromised the quality of care.

Dr Appiah said in as much as Ghanaian child health experts are taking up positions across the country than before, there was the need to identify additional factors and dynamics contributing to child mortality.

He called on skilled personnel to address problems such as lower respiratory tract infections and sustain immunization to save children.

Mrs Cynthia Morrison, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, commended the Society for meeting to further discuss the well-being of children.

She said Ghana had demonstrated clear commitment by ensuring that the SDGs were maintained and coordinated into the President’s programme of economic and social development policy.

In achieving the goals, the Ministry she said adopted a multi sectorial approach in the implementation of its policies and programmes.

“To further strengthen inter agency partnership to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages, an inter-sectorial standard operating procedure for child protection and family welfare development for children under zero to three have been finalized under the early Childhood Care and Development policy,” she said.

This policy including others give the overall framework direction for protection and promotion of the vulnerable.

This, she said, could not be achieved by the Ministry alone but needed partnerships to ensure common goals and targets and urged all not to relent on their efforts in achieving the SGDs.

Mrs Linda Asante-Agyei, the Vice President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), speaking on the role of the media in achieving the SGD 3, urged journalists to ensure that policies and laws regarding the well- being of children were implemented through their writings.

She said Ghana has made tremendous progress on new policies such as the Child and Family Welfare Policy and Justice for All Children policy and advised journalists to monitor commitments made by government and other organizations through continuous tracking and assessment of programmes.

“We must ensure that children receive the best care and improve their wellbeing to take up the mantle of developing the nation,” she noted.

Mrs Asante-Agyei urged the PSG to deepen their collaboration with the GJA to ensure that journalists report effectively on children issues.

She said this was important as it would help do away with wrong reporting on children since they were sensitive group of people.

The two day programme witnessed a lot of presentations, business meeting, exhibitions, awards and dinner dance.","The SDG 3 enjoins member states to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

56,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ireland-faces-significant-challenges-on-environmental-sdgs-social-justice-ireland/,"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Ireland Faces Significant Challenges on Environmental SDGs: Social Justice Ireland,"Compared to 15 other EU countries, Ireland is doing relatively well on SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

57,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-statistical-commission-adopts-36-changes-to-sdg-indicators/,"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Statistical Commission Adopts 36 Changes to SDG Indicators,"The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs. The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.

Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones. In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework. She also provided an oral update to the report, noting that on indicator 3.8.1, the refinement has been changed to “coverage of essential health services,” meaning that the indicator “basically goes back to what it was before.”

She also highlighted that:

The IAEG proposes establishing a working group for measuring development support more broadly than through official development assistance (ODA) – “total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD)”. An additional indicator on TOSSD had been proposed during the comprehensive review process, but members differed over the methodology. The Group agreed to work further on this potential indicator for submission to the Commission in 2022, and to establish a working group to this end.

Data disaggregation is a main area of work for 2020, to ensure “no one is left behind,” and the IEAG aims to develop guidelines on tools and methodologies on data disaggregation and to help build national capacity; and

The Group has issued a report on interlinkages between the Goals and targets both statistically and through a policy and legislation lens, to support deeper analysis of the 2030 Agenda.

Member States, some of whom are IAEG members, made numerous remarks. Several welcomed the fact that the changes to the framework had been limited so as not to increase the overall burden on national statistical organizations, while increasing the quality of the framework. Some expressed support for specific changes, such as the addition of an indicator on civil justice (16.3.3), the additional of an indicator on total greenhouse gas emissions per year (indicator 13.2.2), and in a revision to indicator 15.9.1, the integration of biodiversity into national accounting under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.

Speakers expressed concern on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on employment in sustainable tourism.

On other changes, the speakers expressed concern, including on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on the proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs. China voiced concern about, among others, the addition of the GHG emissions indicator, noting that the global response to climate change should focus on equity and preserve each country’s equal right to development.

The United Arab Emirates suggested “cancelling” all indicators that remain in Tier 3, given the relatively short time left to implement them. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) lamented the lack of an indicator for older persons under SDG target 2.2. on malnutrition.

The African Group recommended reinforced collaboration and coordination with regional commissions. Others called for improved coordination between the custodian agencies for the indicators and national governments.

Revisiting the discussion on 6 March 2020 with the aim of approving the Commission’s report on the proposed changes (E/CN3/2020/L.3, draft decision 1), many delegations reiterated their concern about deleting indicator 8.9.2 on sustainable tourism employment.

The Director of the UN Statistics Division Stefan Schweinfest recalled that the comprehensive review process had been lengthy and “very complex” and had resulted in a “package deal.” This would make reconsidering the decision on one indicator a “dangerous path,” he said, urging delegations to accept the premise of a compromise. Speaking on the “painful” impacts of deleting 8.9.2, Suriname urged that the report reflect that “part of the Commission does not accept this…. Some countries are saying this is not okay.”

The report of the IAEG was adopted as orally revised, and it “agreed to and adopted the proposed major changes and minor refinements … while noting concerns regarding specific indicators, and recognized that the work on SDG indicators is work in progress.” The amended text also indicates that the IAEG is requested to continue its annual refinement, research and methodological work including on “policy issues such as sustainable tourism and climate change.”

Another oral revision to the report adds wording on “the importance of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for SDG monitoring.”

At the closing of the 51st session, Commission Chair Shigeru Kawasaki (Japan) expressed satisfaction that “the SDG indicator framework is advancing, although there is still some room for improvement … we are in a very promising situation.” [Meeting webcast, 3 March 2020] [Meeting webcast, 6 March 2020]","The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs.

58,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unece-releases-statistical-portrait-of-regions-sdg-progress/,"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNECE Releases Statistical Portrait of Region’s SDG Progress,"The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has launched a first regional report on SDG progress. The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

The report aims to inform the region’s progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.” It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.

The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.

Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.

The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds, inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.

To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:

achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;

“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; and

in the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.

The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.

The 15-member Panel is convened to help address the financing gap for implementing the SDGs by 2030.

FACTI was first announced in late January 2020.

The Panel will present an interim report during ECOSOC’s High-level Segment in July 2020.

After the September 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development held at UN Headquarters as part of the UNGA’s high-level week, the Assembly’s Second Committee (Economic and Financial) developed a resolution that:

acknowledges that combating illicit financial flows contributes to domestic resource mobilization;

calls upon the relevant organizations of the UN system, within their respective mandates and resources, to continue their consideration of the negative impact of illicit financial flows on financing the 2030 Agenda, to further explore policy responses to the phenomenon and to coordinate their efforts in this regard; and

invites the President of the UNGA, the President of ECOSOC and the UN Secretary-General to give appropriate consideration to the importance of combating illicit financial flows and strengthening good practices on assets return to foster sustainable development, and in this regard invites all relevant international institutions to support these efforts, in accordance with their respective mandates.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande addressed the launch of the Panel, held in New York, US, on 2 March 2020. He explained that illicit financial flows and related problems threaten least developed countries’ ability to deliver adequate health care and education and threaten the achievement of the SDGs. He also noted that having entered the Decade of Action and Delivery, the UN must focus on implementing the 2030 Agenda, and the Panel will help make global economic and financial systems to “work better for everyone, everywhere.” In particular, the Panel’s independent review of existing institutional and legal frameworks related to financial accountability, transparency and integrity can identify gaps, impediments and vulnerabilities in their design and implementation, including with regard to their comprehensiveness, effectiveness and universality.

The Panel’s first meeting is tentatively scheduled for 30 March-1 April 2020, in Oslo, Norway. The panel will produce an interim report in July 2020, for presentation during ECOSOC’s High-level Segment. Following additional consultations a final report with recommendations will be submitted in February 2021.

The report states that this SDG target “will be missed,” underscoring the need to increase “efforts to generate decent jobs for the next generation of workers.”

The report titled, ‘Global Employment Trends for Youth 2020: Technology and the Future of Jobs,’ highlights that the number of young people classified as NEET has risen from 259 million in 2016 to 267 million in 2019, and is expected to continue increasing to approximately 273 million in 2021. Young women are twice as likely as young men to face precarious employment situations, and two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women. The gender gap is even more pronounced in the Arab States and Southern Asia, where cultural and social norms are more likely to prevent women from pursuing education or working outside the house. Youth unemployment also varies by region, from 30% in Northern Africa to less than 9% in Northern America.

Two-thirds of those classified as NEET are young women.

The report finds that a narrow focus on vocational training, a lack of jobs to match qualifications, and increasing automation are creating a “precarious future in the labor market” for young people. Employees between the ages of 15 and 24 are at greater risk of losing their jobs because of further technological advances than older workers.

The report also identifies challenges with vocational training, which tends to impart occupation-specific skills that become obsolete faster than general education skills. As a result, employees with vocational training are even more vulnerable. To address these concerns, the report calls for modernizing vocational training programmes to meet the evolving demands of the digital economy.

Young people who complete tertiary education are less likely to lose jobs to automation. However, the increase in the number of young people with degrees has outpaced the demand for graduate labor, resulting in falling returns to tertiary education and pushing down wages for graduates. The report addresses a number of additional challenges, including informal and less secure forms of employment and a digital divide between regions and generations.

The report recommends an integrated policy framework to support young people’s ascent into decent jobs and to assure that new technologies positively impact on youth employment. The report argues for policies to generate a sufficient number of decent jobs, to equip young people with the skills needed for those jobs, and ensure social protection for workers.

The ILO also produced briefing notes on youth employment trends by region.

Our relationship with forests is a prime example.

Forests are among the most biodiverse of Earth’s ecosystems. They sequester carbon and help to mitigate against climate change. They protect watersheds and help to control soil erosion. And yet, around 11% of carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation and forest degradation, which is second only to the energy sector.

The 21st of March was the International Day of Forests, and it convened under the theme of forests and biodiversity. This is fitting in 2020, the beginning of a critical decade for the planet. There will be landmark moments early in the decade, including the anticipated adoption of a new post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

The United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) is a Centre of global excellence in biodiversity. Over the past 10 years, we have been closely involved with REDD+, an initiative under the climate change convention (UNFCCC) that aims to support developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to promote the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests. Working closely with the UN-REDD Programme, we help countries to plan for and access results-based payments for these actions.

In work led by UNEP-WCMC, the UN-REDD Programme has supported over 20 developing countries to analyze where REDD+ actions could result in multiple benefits beyond carbon. Through spatial analyses carried out in close collaboration with national partners, countries have been empowered to identify areas that have potential for forest conservation, restoration and sustainable management, and can also help secure a range of additional important benefits for people and planet.

These analyses have shown how sustainable forest practices across the planet can contribute to a wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals.

One such example is Costa Rica. The National REDD+ Secretariat, together with FONAFIFO (the country’s National Forestry Financing Fund) and the UN-REDD Programme used spatial analyses to explore where REDD+ actions could help secure benefits beyond carbon, such as enhanced water regulation to support communities vulnerable to water stress, the potential for socio-economic improvements from forest-dependent livelihoods, and from ecotourism.

The work emphasized areas of overlap between the National REDD+ Strategy and spatial priorities for Costa Rica’s other objectives, such as national development, restoration and biodiversity conservation. Considering these benefits when planning and implementing REDD+ will help progress towards SDGs 1 (No Poverty); 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation); 13 (Climate Action); and 15 (Life on Land), among others.

More recently, this work also featured in the development of Costa Rica’s Gender Action Plan (contributing to SDG 5 on Gender Equality). Spatial layers showing the proportion of women by district contributed additional insight and helped to highlight districts where women could act as conservation agents, support efforts to reduce forest fires, and undertake reforestation activities.

Another example is Côte d’Ivoire, where we collaborated with the country’s REDD+ Permanent Executive Secretariat and the Swiss Scientific Research Centre to develop a forest restoration opportunities map. This combined potential benefits, such as carbon density, soil erosion risk and species richness, with obstacles to forest restoration, such as infrastructure development and high human land use. The resulting map shows areas with higher potential and lower obstacles, and thus where forest restoration could be most effective and have the most positive impacts. This could include contributing to SDGs such as SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land).

This type of analysis can identify where agroforestry actions are feasible to guide implementation of Côte d’Ivoire’s National REDD+ Strategy, promoting the use of agroforestry to strengthen agricultural systems’ resilience to climate change, and to diversify incomes for farmers. There is also an opportunity to align REDD+ and private sector cocoa initiatives, with the potential to create more incentives for smallholder farmers and contribute to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), among others.

Meanwhile in Viet Nam, lessons from the National REDD+ Programme are informing the development of a deforestation-free jurisdiction in the Central Highlands. This region is at the forefront of efforts to conserve natural forests and other biodiversity, while sustaining production of high-value crops like coffee. Both nationally and locally, partners are seeking to promote sustainable land management and pilot a deforestation-free approach in the region in support of SDGs 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

These individual examples give us just a snapshot of how retaining, restoring and sustainably managing our forests can help achieve a wide variety of SDGs and bring a range of benefits for people and for nature. As this year’s International Day of Forests slogan put it, our forests are too precious to lose.

64,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/icao-identifies-six-eligible-carbon-offsetting-programmes-for-aviation-industry/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICAO Identifies Six Eligible Carbon-Offsetting Programmes for Aviation Industry,"Recent meetings organized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), addressed steps by ICAO to address the aviation industry’s negative environmental externalities.

At the ICAO Council meeting, which convened from 2-20 March 2020, in Montréal, Canada, the Council adopted a standard to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health, and took further decisions on implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA is a market-based mechanism adopted in 2016 to achieve ICAO’s goals of increasing fuel efficiency by 2% per year and carbon-neutral growth of civil aviation from 2020 onwards. The mechanism aims to cap aviation’s future emissions growth by obliging airlines to buy offsets, rather than reducing their aircraft emissions.

The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase. These six programmes are:

American Carbon Registry

China Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Voluntary Emission Reduction Program

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Climate Action Reserve

The Gold Standard

Verified Carbon Standard

The Council’s decision follows recommendations by the Technical Advisory Body (TAB), which it established and tasked with evaluating whether carbon-offsetting programs satisfy the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). Public comments were also received, including from experts at Europe-based research institutes Öko-Institut, Perspectives, and Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), who published their analysis of 14 carbon-offsetting programs in October 2019.

In accordance with TAB’s recommendations on “eligibility timeframe” and “unit date eligibility,” the emissions units are issued to activities that commenced as of 1 January 2016, and in respect of emissions reductions occurring through 31 December 2020, subject to each programme’s scope of eligibility. The list of eligible emissions units will eventually be publicly available on the ICAO CORSIA website.

In its assessment and recommendation of programmes, TAB highlighted the following criteria:

Permanence: Carbon offset credits must represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or carbon sequestration that are permanent, whereby any given risk of reductions or removals being reversed require that either such credits are not eligible or measures are in place to monitor, mitigate, and compensate incidences of material leakage.

Additionality: Carbon offset programmes must generate units that represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or removals that are additional, including that they exceed any GHG reduction or removals required by law, regulation, or legally binding mandate.

Avoidance of double counting towards mitigation obligations: Measures must be in place to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming such as could occur by claims from both an airline and the host country of the emissions reduction activity.

Monitoring, reporting and verification: Emissions reduction is calculated in a conservative and transparent manner, verified by an accredited independent entity prior to issuance of offset credits, which should be based on accurate measurements and monitored on a regular basis.

Public disclosure of sustainable development: A programme should list the criteria used regarding alignment with the SDGs.

The selected programmes performed differently, and none perfectly against all EUCs, the TAB recommendations and expert submissions reveal. TAB underscores that various programmes “made substantial progress” towards addressing certain shortcomings, or have “indicated willingness to put in place measures to ensure consistency with the EUCs.” Still, experts proposed that programmes be approved only provisionally until they satisfy all EUCs, to avoid risks for CORSIA’s integrity. Experts also called on ICAO to provide further clarity on which global warming potential values the programmes should use when issuing CORSIA eligible offset credits.

The January 2020 report from TAB recommends that the Council request from most of the eligible carbon-offsetting programs further specified actions following its decision, with the exception of the CDM. This is because the future of registered CDM activities is still being negotiated in the context of the rules, modalities, procedures, and guidelines for Article 6 (cooperative approaches) of the Paris Agreement on climate change. International guidance on the transition of the CDM is needed since all participating Paris Agreement parties will have to correspondingly adjust their emission levels and targets upon transfer of mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting.

On using carbon offset credits under CORSIA, experts hope that Paris Agreement parties will provide clarity on:

How emission reductions not covered by Parties’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) should be treated;

What key elements are necessary for letters of attestation and authorization by host countries to confirm avoidance of double counting so the units can be used under CORSIA;

How additionality of activities can be proven; and

What actions should trigger corresponding adjustments to account for the use of offset credits under CORSIA.

The ICAO Council also improved its environmental standards to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health. Environmental and health impact assessments of aircraft engine emissions rely on Particulate Matter (PM) characteristics such as number, size, and composition, but reported PM emissions data varied due to different sampling protocols and methodologies used. For emission certification purposes, measurement methodologies needed to be standardized. Engine manufacturers use certification of aircraft engines for non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions.

At its March 2020 meeting, the ICAO Council adopted a “non-volatile PM (nvPM) mass and number Standard” for aircraft engines. The standard applies to engine designs of rated thrust greater than 26.7 Kilonewton and will govern both new and in-production engines from 2023 onwards. ICAO aims to ensure that only the most effective nvPM reduction technologies are employed in post-2023 aircraft engine designs.","The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase.

The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

Starting off its first meeting of the year, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board met from 10-12 March, in Geneva, Switzerland, to address pertinent agenda items. The Board considered an updated workplan for the next three years, the effectiveness of its committees, and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the simplified approval process (SAP).

Board members agreed on measures to increase the GCF’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals, and also discussed budgetary issues such as progress on ‘stuck’ projects and what lessons can be learned from the pilot programme on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+. This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

Progress on the GCF’s Work Program 2020-2030

As was decided at the previous Board meeting, the Co-Chairs presented a draft of the updated workplan of the Board for 2020–2023, including a schedule for a list of items the Board will consider in 2020. The Board considered a draft decision to adopt the updated workplan, which built on previous discussions that were held at an informal meeting from 5-7 February 2020, in Monrovia, Liberia.

Board members requested prioritizing: by June 2020, the approval of key policies related to the investment framework, including the incremental and full cost methodology, the policy on ‘concessionality’ and the mapping on eligibility and selection criteria; and by 2021, the approval of guidelines on the Board decisions without a Board meeting.

In informal consultations, views diverged on: strategic objectives and allocations; shifting financial flows; project prioritization; diversifying instruments; accreditation prioritization; and efficient process management and delegation. The Board advanced convergence of views on diversifying instruments and accreditation prioritization, but concluded with the need to further discuss the workplan at its June session.

The Board also took note of actions to be undertaken in 2020 in response to the guidance received from parties during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) in 2019.

Working towards enhancing the effectiveness of committees

The status of the review of the effectiveness of committees was also highlighted as critical to be addressed as soon as possible under the GCF’s work plan. A previous report, which was distributed on a limited basis, suggested that there was scope to improve transparency by reviewing record keeping and reporting to the Board, and enhance effectiveness by reviewing structures of committees as well as the way committees operate and coordinate.

The Board took note of the ‘Final report of the review of the effectiveness of committees and groups established by the Board’ and of the ‘General Guidelines for Committees and Panels,’ and requested the Co-Chairs to consultant with members and Committees and present updated guidelines by its next June session.

Improving the GCF’s Simplified Approval Process

The Board also considered the review of the simplified approval process pilot scheme, which assesses the results achieved by the simplified approval process (SAP) to date, and includes recommendations for streamlining and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAP. The review found the following:

The SAP is a valuable funding modality that can lead to expeditious approval of low-risk projects that can better address the urgent climate adaptation needs of GCF priority countries, such as the African States, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small islands developing States (SIDS);

The SAP pipeline has grown by an average of 10.5% every month and represented 22% of all submission in the GCF pipeline, demonstrating a strong demand for SAP, especially from direct access entities (DAEs) which compose the majority of pipeline submissions; and

Despite the fact that SAP projects are small in terms of GCF finance and have low risks, the SAP is perceived similar to the regular proposal approval process even if they involve funding proposals that imply higher risks and require much larger amounts of GCF finance.

The review’s main recommendations include:

expand to activities that imply limited environmental and social risks;

speed up the approval cycle of such projects and programmes with ‘In between Board Meeting’ approvals;

introduce delegated authority to the Secretariat for the approval of SAP projects and programmes that imply minimal to no environmental and social risks;

use dedicated independent expert consultants in lieu of the independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP);

increase the Secretariat’s capacity for technical reviews of a larger number of SAP proposals using external technical reviewers;

strengthen technical support to DAEs with closer alignment to Project Preparation Facility and Readiness activities; and

keep expanding the knowledge products on SAP, which build the capacity of accredited entities and national designated authority in SAP project design/development.

Some members signaled their: opposition to delegating authority or functions of the ITAP to external consultants; concern over the unbalanced geographically distribution of projects in the SAP pipeline; and opposition to introducing any notion of “GCF priority countries.”

Observers called for ensuring that any ‘In between Board Meeting’ approval process allows for stakeholder input, and opposed the use of the SAP to facilitate private sector involvement as well as an opening up of the SAP for any projects outside of activities with minimal or no adverse environmental or social risks or impacts. The Board requested the Secretariat to further develop the SAP for Board consideration by its next meeting.

Increasing ITAP’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals

As ITAP is one of the areas identified in the SAP review in which efficiency could be increased both under the SAP and the regular GCF proposal approval process, the Board considered an option to enhance the ITAP by increasing its members to ensure that more projects will be brought before the Board for approval.

GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec clarified, among others, that the GCF’s key challenges include an increased need for project review, with an expected increase in the number of projects per year based on the level of replenishment. He said that 52 projects are currently undergoing review and noted that the GCF is on track to submit 21 projects to ITAP for the Board’s next meeting. He added that a larger number is expected for the Board’s subsequent meeting, in part to deliver on the ambition for UNFCCC COP 26.

During discussions, members raised procedural questions and advocated establishing a roster of experts. Observers stressed the importance to engage in more detail with in-country project relevant stakeholders and affected people. The Board decided to, inter alia:

re-appoint three members of the ITAP for a 1.5- year term;

increase the size of the ITAP from six to ten members by the end of 2020;

approve an additional administrative budget for the Board for the year 2020 in the amount of USD 338,800, to cover the additional four members of ITAP, the administrative support consultant, and the operationalization of the roster of experts; and

request the Secretariat, in consultation with the Investment Committee and the ITAP, to propose updates to the operational modalities of ITAP to accommodate the increased workload by the next Board meeting.

Status of the GCF’s financial resources

The GCF saw USD 10.3 billion in contributions during the fund’s initial resource mobilization which lasted from 2015-2018, and USD 9.8 billion for the GCF’s 2020-2023 replenishment, or first replenishment (GCF-1), with a combined total of USD 8.3 billion received so far. At its March meeting, the Board took note of the Status of GCF resources, pipelines and portfolio performance.

The GCF resource status shows that the total of GCF funding commitments amounts to USD 6.5 billion, which is composed of: USD 5.4 billion under approved projects; USD 0.3 billion under Readiness and Project Preparation Facilities; and, taking other factors into account, a remaining commitment authority of USD 1.8 billion. Noteworthy, USD 13.9 billion of co-financing mobilized, in addition to the 5.4 billion GCF financing, serve the approved projects and activities in 105 countries.

The largest portion of GCF Funding, amounting to USD 2.2 billion, is allocated to 37 countries in the African Region. This geographical distribution is followed by: USD 1.9 billion allocated to 34 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and USD 1.1 billion allocated to 27 countries from Latin and Caribbean Region. About USD 1.4 billion has been committed to 23 LDCs and USD 0.8 billion to SIDS.

The GCF portfolio of approved projects is expected to abate a total of 1.6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (GHG) in carbon dioxide equivalent and reach 348 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries, based on the estimations of accredited entities. Since November 2015, the Board approved 124 funding proposals, with 74 projects under implementation and 61 projects receiving funds. In total, the approved projects, including co-financing, amount to USD 20.6 billion.

By the start of the year the GCF Funding pipeline showed 79 public and private sector funding proposals, which request a total GCF funding of USD 3.4 billion to support projects and programmes totaling USD 11.8 billion, when taking co-financing into account.

During discussions, members raised concerns about projects that are not progressing over long periods of time, suggesting consideration to restructure such projects and implement early filters as remedy measures. The Secretariat informed that it was developing a stronger portfolio performance management system to identify early warning and project performance and reported that seven projects worth USD 500 million “were stuck for two years” but are now expected to move towards implementation by mid-2020.

Progress on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD+

Regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the Board took note of the Secretariat’s analysis of the experience with, and the progress made towards, achieving the objectives of the pilot programme for REDD-plus results-based payments. Findings include:

a positive response from REDD+ countries, and that the numbers of countries submitting REDD+ results to the UNFCCC increased from three to 12 in the last two years;

procedures approved by the Board are fully functional, and that technical capacities were enhanced in ITAP with UNFCCC experts; and

the pilot is relevant to the REDD+ results-based payments finance landscape, given that the GCF has provided 30% out of the global volume of this finance and a large interest to continue and to explore options, including involving the private sector to leverage additional finance for the pilot programme.

So far four projects in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and Paraguay for USD 228.63 million have been approved, with six projects in the pipeline from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Nine more are expected by the end of the pilot programme, seven from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and three from the Asian region, while the funds are likely to be exhausted by 2021 and prior to the end of the pilot programme in 2022.

Recommendations from the analysis include, given the complexity of REDD+ elements, to further discuss and analyze alternatives for the continuation of the implementation of REDD+ results-based payments, including:

analyzing market and non-market contexts, the role of the private sector, complementarity with other multi- and bilateral funding arrangements, and technical and procedural matters; and

considering options such as to extend the pilot programme, a second pilot programme with some adjustments, a permanent funding window, and a grandparenting period.

Noting diverging views on REDD+ in general, some members highlighted that ensuring environmental integrity is a key issue to take into account when addressing the future for the pilot programme. Members also: voiced their reservations about considering a permanent funding window; supported consideration of the role of private actors; and cautioned against prejudging ongoing negotiations under Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches). Raising concerns about the four funding proposals already adopted, Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples: called for revisions of the pilot programme; opposed the use of reference levels that lower ambition; raised questions about carbon storage permanence and verification of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and stressed the need to avoid double counting.

Board approves USD 169.7 million in GCF funding for six projects and programmes

The GCF Board approved six funding proposals amounting to USD 169.7 million in GCF funding that will support projects and programmes with a total value of USD 618.7 million. The majority of the funding, or 74%, is allocated for adaptation projects, and 26% for mitigation projects. The expected impact potential is to abate a total of 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) of GHGs and reach 4.8 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries. Specifically, the GCF approved finance to support four public-sector projects in the following countries:

Viet Nam, with a USD 30.2 million GCF grant for a USD 156.3 million adaptation project which aims to empower vulnerable smallholders by securing water provision, supporting farmers to adopt climate-resilient agriculture, and strengthening access to agro-climate information, credit and markets.

Zimbabwe, with a USD 26.6 million GCF grant for a USD 47.8million adaptation project which seeks to address climate impacts and build the resilience of smallholder farmers in three semi-arid agroecological regions of southern Zimbabwe.

Sri Lanka, with a USD 39.8 million GCF grant for a USD 49 million adaptation project which aims to strengthen the capacity of smallholder subsistence farmers to address climate-induced irrigation and drinking water shortages by improving the resilience of farm- and land-management practices, and by climate proofing ecosystems.

Cuba, with a USD 38.3 million GCF grant for a USD 119.9 million cross-cutting project which seeks to increase the climate resilience of agricultural production and ensure food security through improved ecosystem services from agroforestry, silvopastoral systems, reforestation and assisted natural forest regeneration in seven municipalities vulnerable to climate change.

The Board also approved two private sector funding proposals for climate action in the following countries:

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are benefiting from GCF funding of USD 25 million in equity for a USD 200 million mitigation programme, titled ‘Arbaro Fund – Sustainable Forestry Fund.’ It will invest in sustainable plantation forestry projects with adaptation co-benefits to increase carbon sinks by producing wood in a sustainable manner and conserving natural forests, whilst contributing to reduction of illegal logging.

Haiti, with a USD 1.5 million GCF grant and a USD 8.4 million loan for a USD 45.7 million cross-cutting project. The project aims to: develop 22 community-scale solar plus battery storage micro-grids in communities where currently no grid power exists; provide affordable and reliable access to modern energy services in communities; and build capacity for microgrid deployment and operation.

The Board further:

took note of the explanation provided by the Secretariat and the Accreditation Panel regarding the accreditation of the applicant ‘National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development’; and

transferred to the Board for approval, without Board meeting and on a no objection basis, of the two applicants ‘Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation’ and ‘Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia’.

In addition, the GCF also considered a number of reports during its meeting, including on the activities of the Secretariat, Board committees and independent units, and by the Co-Chairs such as proposals on Board decisions without a Board meeting, and their proposal on the review of committees, panels and groups.

The GCF Board Meeting closed without a decision on the date and venue of its next meeting, but with the understanding that the previous decision on the date, from 23-25 June 2020, stands unless the Board revokes that decision.

Given the extraordinary circumstances regarding the COVID-19 virus outbreak, the Board considered: authorizing the Co-Chairs to determine whether to change the venue, or hold the meeting by way of video conference, teleconference or net meeting; and requesting the Co-Chairs to continue to monitor the developments and consult with the Board on a possible change in date and/or venue for its next meeting. Observing no consensus, the Co-Chairs proposed further in-between meeting consultations.","This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

Stakeholders highlighted civil society priorities for the declaration as well as plans for the UN75 People’s Forum in April 2020.

The briefing for stakeholders on 28 February 2020 was hosted by the NGO Committee on Sustainable Development-New York in collaboration with the UN2020 initiative and Together First.

The co-facilitators, Alya Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, held the first informal consultation meeting with UN Member States at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 21 February 2020, as reported in this SDG Knowledge Hub story. On Member States’ priorities for the declaration, the co-facilitators reported that:

Governments support a declaration that is both short and unifying, as well as substantive;

The discussion indicated much convergence on key issues to address in the text, with climate change and biodiversity high on the agenda;

Delegations issued calls for reforms not only of the UN Security Council but also the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); and

The importance of partnerships and the role of the private sector were emphasized during the consultation.

The co-facilitators also said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hopes the declaration will call for continued dialogue after the anniversary event – to be led by Member States, the Secretary-General, or an independent commission. The co-facilitators urged NGOs to reach out to Member States and groupings to ensure the adoption of a strong political declaration.

As next steps in drafting the declaration, the co-facilitators said they will present an elements paper for discussion at a consultation in early April. A zero draft will be released in May.

Providing input to the co-facilitators, stakeholders said important issues include climate change, species loss, shrinking space for civil society, and peace and disarmament. They noted that corruption is an important part of Agenda 2030 that integrates the three pillars of the UN. They suggested that the UN75 declaration and the outcome text of high-level meetings on Beijing+25 (taking place in March and September 2020) should support and reinforce each other. Participants urged the co-facilitators to find ways to include the perspectives of people who are not able to travel to the UN, and said civil society participation must be meaningful, not “ceremonial.”

Alongside the political declaration, a civil society declaration is also being developed. The UN2020 network has called for inputs, and the zero draft is available for commentary until 15 March. The declaration is expected to be adopted during the UN75 People’s Forum convening in New York, US, from 23-24 April 2020.

The People’s Forum, being coordinated by UN2020 and Together First, will focus on the theme of advancing people-centered multilateralism. In addition to the People’s Declaration, it is also expected to result in a People’s Plan for Global Action.

In the meantime, a UNGA youth plenary will take place on 31 March 2020 as part of UN75 consultations. It is scheduled back-to-back with ECOSOC’s 2020 Youth Forum which will meet from 1-2 April 2020.

The platform presents data from its member states for 80 “regionally relevant” SDG indicators from across all 17 Goals.

The UNECE Dashboard for SDGs was launched on 13 March 2020, ahead of UNECE’s Regional Forum on Sustainable Development. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RFSD will only convene for a half-day, online meeting on 19 March 2020.

Data disaggregation remains a major gap in monitoring the SDGs.

The Dashboard draws on data from the UN Global SDG Database. The 80 indicators included in the dashboard are listed at the indicator menu page.

The Dashboard allows users to:

See “snapshots” by country, and compare countries;

View differences between women and men;

Create graphs and maps; and

Access definitions and explanations.

Users can download full datasets for more in-depth analysis.

Announcing the launch of the Dashboard, UNECE notes that a major gap in monitoring the SDGs is data disaggregation. Although the 2030 Agenda calls for examining indicators for specific population groups – broken up by sex, age, ethnicity, as well as migratory, disability and/or indigenous status – data collection still must be significantly increased to make this possible. UNECE reports that “to date, the only disaggregation offered in the UNECE dashboard is by sex, where possible with the currently-available data.”

UNECE adds that it is working to improve measurement in areas of the SDGs that are particularly hard to measure, including disaggregated poverty measurement, migration statistics, environmental statistics and indicators, climate change-related statistics, and statistics on children and youth.

69,https://science.thewire.in/health/sdg-compliance-of-maternal-mortality-a-cause-for-concern-or-celebration/,"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Wire,SDG Compliance of Maternal Mortality: A Cause for Concern or Celebration?,"While the aggregate Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) seem realisable, the disturbing part of the story is the stark intra-country disparities that reveal differential vulnerabilities across regions.

With the commitment towards compliance with the SDGs, there is a definite improvement in the data system to obtain the relevant estimates for indicators representing each of the goals. In the process of obtaining these estimates, two concerns arise: the levels of disaggregation and the reliability of the estimates conditioned by the rarity of the event or phenomenon.

In terms of an adverse indicator, like the maternal mortality rate,, the two concerns are equally relevant in the sense that with decline in this adversity, there is a compromise in its reliability. Further, its disaggregation obtains differentially reliable estimates ineligible for comparison.

A 2015 WHO study on the reduction of MMR by 75% from 1990 to 2015 in the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) suggested that, by 2013, MMR was reduced by 45%, from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births – reflecting substantial progress but still falling far short of the global MDG goals. MMR reduction is a priority in the SDGs, with the broad objective to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

Hence, it is questionable as to whether such estimates be obtained in brief periodicity (i.e. every three years) based on the same sample coverage and secondly should these estimates be compared across regions with differential reliability. The following discussion elaborates on this pressing concern to draw attention of policy makers.

The most recently released statistics on maternal mortality notes a decline of 8 units in the maternal mortality ratio in the gap of three years, which is a positive trend. The target level of SDGs for this indicator is 70 per one lakh live births by the year 2030, and this seems very much within the horizon given the declining exposure to reproduction on one hand and ever-increasing extent of institutional deliveries on the other. While this aggregate achievement seems realisable, the disturbing part of the story lies in the intra country disparities which are stark and revealing of the differential vulnerabilities across regions.

The national achievement makes a specific region 1.8 times more vulnerable vis-à-vis the other two regions 0.52 and 0.63 times-less vulnerable based on the MMR. These differences are alarming in the sense that they are not merely guided by the differential risk of reproduction alone as convergence in fertility decline across the country is a reality. Further, such a pattern could very well lead to compliance with the SDG target at the national level leaving behind some regions with such adversities. The race towards compliance with SDGs has always this limitation as one of the authors of this note observed in the initial years of SDG formulation as to whether target compliance will compromise on equities.

The three regional estimates of MMR put the southern region comprising five states at 72, a group of other six states of the north and western region at 90 against the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states with the inclusion of Assam at 175. Apart from these regional estimates, Assam leads the table with an MMR levels of 229 followed by Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar which have MMR estimates closer to 200. One would imagine that these are purely a derivative of differential exposure to reproduction but it is not the case given the decline in fertility levels across the EAG states.

There is apprehension as to such high levels of MMRs may not necessarily be associated with childbirth alone but miscarriages and non-clinical abortions as well. The levels of MMRs in EAG states are distinctly higher compared with other states except in Punjab. Another aspect of this comparison relates to the statistical reliability of these estimates. The high levels of MMR in EAG states do have the widest possible confidence intervals understandably owing to the rarity of this event. But the kind of decline that is celebrated should also take into account the wide confidence intervals as they might otherwise be a statistical construct and not a real decline at all. In that sense, the regional estimates are somewhat acceptable for comparison which presents a clear regional divide that needs focus and attention.

Another aspect of this phenomenon is to situate them in an age profile to identify age-specific vulnerabilities. Given that a larger share of fertility or childbirth related experience is below the age of 30 years, a risk evaluation indicates that almost two-thirds of maternal deaths are happening between ages 20-30 years of age. Hence, the common understanding that adolescent motherhood or high-risk age of maternity do not seem to intensify this problem. In addition, the fertility transition too places this age bracket to share a significant share of the childbirth experience. This suggests towards targeting the younger and primipara women to comply with institutional deliveries as well as the maternal care continuum to avoid such adversities.

Finally, caution needs to be exercised about certifying compliance of such targets overlooking the regional disparities as well as reliability of estimates given the rarity of the phenomenon itself. While monitoring this phenomenon is desirable, it is rather important to change focus from reducing levels to that of converging them.

It followed on the heels of the 33rd African Union (AU) Summit, which focused on the 2020 theme, ‘Silencing the Guns: Creating conducive conditions for Africa’s Development.’

Addressing the overarching theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ the sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD 2020), was also the first regional consultation to take place under the UN@75 reform process. On the margins of the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General (UNDSG) Amina Mohammed convened several consultations with regional stakeholders, including UN and AU institutions, and youth, to elicit perspectives from on the ongoing UN reform process.

ARFSD 2020 took place from 24-27 February 2020, in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. It was co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the AU Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN system. It brought together nearly 3,000 delegates in plenary and parallel sessions over the four days, holding more than 60 preparatory and side events.

The Regional Forum assessed Africa’s progress on all 17 SDGs, clustered around the “five Ps” of the 2030 Agenda: people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnerships. Drawing on regional data sources – including the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2020, and the inaugural AU Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063 – there was a convergence of evidence that, despite some pockets of progress, the region is off track on both global and regional goals.

Forum participants engaged in in-depth discussion of key findings and lessons from a selection of VNRs currently being conducted by 17 African countries for presentation at the HLPF in July 2020, as well as emerging lessons from voluntary local reviews (VLRs), which featured for the first time at the Forum. A recurring theme in the discussions was the need to address weak national and local capacity in accessing and using quality and relevant data. Underscoring the importance of building VNRs on evidence-based local reviews, the Forum proposed developing a template to support country reporting. Accelerators for delivering a transformed and prosperous Africa, including through leveraging science, technology and innovation (STI), and strengthening partnerships with the UN Development System, major groups, youth, and other stakeholders were also highlighted.

The Forum adopted a ministerial declaration, titled, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ as well as an outcome summary report and key messages containing Africa’s priorities and policy measures to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

Addressing the negative impact of the climate crisis, Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), cited estimates that some countries are spending the equivalent of 2-3% of their GDP on unplanned responses to weather and climate impacts. Touching on repercussions for the water, energy, conflict, food security, and hydropower production sectors, she highlighted efforts underway to craft a common regional position on this issue for the 2020 UN Climate Conference.

During the 33rd AU Summit, which took place from 8-9 February, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the AU-UN strategic partnership is growing “ever stronger and more dynamic,” and highlighted interlinkages between the ‘Silencing the Guns’ initiative with targets on human rights, gender equality, climate change, and sustainable development. With an estimated tripling of armed conflicts over the past decade, despite implementation of a peace and security roadmap, the discussions underscored the importance of good governance, and building more inclusive societies.

Incoming AU Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined regional priorities to achieve the Agenda 2063, including, supporting regional integration, industrialization, and trade and investment, and strengthening women’s economic empowerment, in line with the launch of the AU Decade of Financial Inclusion for Women. The Summit adopted enhanced commitments towards this end, including plans to allocate 25% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, and the launch of the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF), which aims to provide capital to both first time and experienced fund managers, to invest in majority female-owned businesses.

By Ashok Pandey

THE NITI AAYOG released the second version of the SDG India Index and Dashboard on December 20, 2019. India, as a signatory to adoption of UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is under obligation

to streamline development policies for a time-bound (by 2030) achievement of human well-being. The 17 goals and 169 related targets weave around five pillars— People (first six goals), Prosperity (next five), Planet (following four goals), Peace (goal 16) and Partnership (goal 17). Achieving these requires government’s commitment, people’s participation, allocation of funds, intergovernmental cooperation, technology and innovation.

The SDG Index is the first attempt at the national level to assess where each state and UT stands on achieving SDGs. The SDG India Index 2.0 uses a hundred indicators covering 16 goals (barring goal 17 for want of sufficient inputs) and 54 targets. The Index has played a vital role in driving the SDG agenda in India. Budgetary allocation is an essential component of pushing the SDG agenda forward. Prominent themes in this year’s Budget include working for an aspirational India, ensuring economic development for all, fostering a caring society and ease of living. These also cover most SDG goals around People and Prosperity.

The finance minister gave a big push to wellness, water and sanitation by providing Rs 69,000 crore for the health sector. Of this, Rs 6,400 crore is for the PM Jan Arogya Yojana, extending its reach to 20,000 empanelled hospitals, and Rs 3.6 lakh crore approved for the Jal Jeevan Mission, of which Rs 11,500 crore will be available for 2020-21. Cities with a million plus population are mandated to achieve the objective this year. Also, Rs 3,000 crore additional will be available for skill development, and the National Skill Development Agency will give a special thrust to infrastructure-focused skill development— infrastructure projects will involve young engineers, management graduates and economists from universities.

Women-specific schemes, nutrition enhancement and financial support to uplift the conditions of young girls contribute significantly to achieve educational, health and financial targets under different SDG goals. There are conscious efforts and the intent to reduce fossil-fuel based power to meet the objectives under goal 13. An allocationof Rs 4,400 crore has gone to the 16 action points for agriculture, irrigation and rural development. Additional allowances will help propel fish production and export. Encouragement to growing algae, seaweed and cage culture will give a boost to the blue economy.

The finance minister’s statement to ensure corruption-free, policy-driven governance is a welcome step. Providing justice and building strong institutions will enhance the Index ranking undergoal 16. The government’s recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and new technologies to augment our efforts in achieving plan 2030 is also commendable. The SDG India Index noted that Tamil Naidu and Jammu & Kashmir performed the best amongst states and UTs, respectively, in alleviating poverty. This means better performance in achieving the targets under SDG goal 1— reducing extreme and multi-dimensional poverty, improving social protection and safety net, providing the necessary services and mitigating a multitude of natural disasters.

A similar indexing in achieving other targets is both instructive and encouraging. The SDG India Index, together with the budgetary mandate, should serve as a reminder that with intentional policy and

action on the ground, it is possible to achieve the goals of well-being. The interstate and inter-UT competitions and a mature and people-centric federal interdependence augur well for the country. The NITIAayog’s SDG India Index 2.0 will serve as a facilitative rubric to bring transparency, accountability and urgency for judicious utilisation of national resources.

Presenting the report’s highlights at UN Headquarters on 10 March 2020, Taalas said that: 2019 was the second warmest year on record and ended with a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels; 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record; and CO2 levels had reached a new peak in January and February 2020.

The report highlights the physical indicators of climate change, such as increasing land and ocean heat, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice. It also addresses the impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security, and land and marine ecosystems. It includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, international experts, scientific institutions and UN agencies, and provides information for policymakers to consider in their decision-making processes.

In his presentation, Taalas said that a recent decadal forecast from the UK’s Met Office indicates a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years, and, over 10 years, temperature estimates range from 1.1 to 1.65°C, exceeding the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. Taalas said that while developed countries have been able to decouple economic growth from emissions growth, developing countries have not yet done so.

Taalas highlighted that smoke and pollutants from the Australian wildfires reverberated across the globe, causing an increase in CO2 emissions, and record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier with significant impacts on sea level rise. He warned of a growing water crisis in parts of Africa and in Southern Asia, many areas of which depend on glaciers as the main freshwater source.

Other examples of socioeconomic impacts highlighted in the report include a deteriorating food security situation in some countries in 2019 due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict, and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people in the Horn of Africa were estimated to be severely food insecure. In addition, unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 contributed to a locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, the worst in over 25 years.

The report also addresses high-impact events, including:

floods in Southern Asia, Iran, the US, which experienced US$20 billion in losses, and South America, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion;

drought, with Australia having its driest year on record;

heatwaves, with record-breaking temperatures in Australia and Europe;

tropical cyclones in the Bahamas and along the eastern coast of Africa, increasing food insecurity and displacement; and

increased wildfire activity in high-latitude areas, such as Siberia and Alaska and even in parts of the Arctic, where such events were previously rare.

Responding to questions regarding the impacts of the coronavirus on climate change, its short-term contribution to decreased emissions, and its potential to drain resources and political will from climate efforts, Guterres said he expects the impacts of and efforts related to coronavirus to be temporary and underscored the need to ensure that efforts to fight the virus do not distract from addressing climate change. Taalas added that while the virus is negatively impacting the economy in the short term, the economic consequences of non-action on climate change over the long term would be massive.

(AFP Photo)

Yesterday, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) released the 'Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020'. The report outlines the region's performance in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) designed to be a ""blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.""

Data for countries in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region were drawn from the Global SDG Indicators Database maintained by Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).

Many of the countries assessed are showing positive progress on improving the quality of education as well as providing access to clean energy. However, the report singled out Southeast Asia for a declining share of renewable energy.

“Our analysis finds that the Asia-Pacific region has struggled the most with two Goals: advancing responsible consumption and production, and climate action. In fact, the region is not even moving in the right direction,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.

The report underlines a crucial concept of progress which cannot only rely on economic growth. For instance, although the APAC region's real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita more than doubled compared to the world average in 2017, to achieve sustainability, it needs to be coupled with human well-being and a healthy environment – an aspect that is severely lacking in the APAC region.

At this rate, the report states that the region is expected to ""miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger, gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030."" Nonetheless, improvements recorded in the aspect of food security, women's role in decision-making and access to basic sanitation services could provide a strong foundation for countries to implement measures for future acceleration.

Environmental indicators

While overall share of forest area in the APAC region has increased slightly since 2000, 35 percent of countries reported a continuous loss of forests – all in Southeast Asia. Despite boasting the largest proportion of forest area (48 percent), it is the only region with a declining share of forest area; namely in Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste.

Air pollution is also a critical issue in the ASEAN region with high concentration of airborne particulate matter (PM) 2.5 – also known as fine particle pollution – which can enter the bloodstream through the lungs and has been linked to asthma attacks, heart attacks and respiratory problems.

In addition, the volume of hazardous waste generated in the ASEAN region has increased fivefold between 2000 and 2015, reaching nearly 40 million tons.

“These findings sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies,” added Armida.

These are some of the aspects in which the Southeast Asian region is lagging behind. As we are only 10 years away from the SDG target year, ASEAN countries could risk losing their prominence in the global arena if efforts to achieve sustainability is side-lined for other interests that would not contribute to a national and regional movement towards sustainability.

ESCAP also warned that without concerted and extra efforts from all concerned, the region remains unlikely to meet any of the 17 SDG targets by 2030.

It also highlighted the crucial role of trade as a means for the region to achieve SDG targets. Southeast Asia has received around 30 percent of all APAC aid-for-trade funding over the past five years. Not to mention the large benefit from personal remittances, which represents 2.8 percent of GDP in 2017 (over US$60 billion). This indicates that resources could be allocated more efficiently in order to better implement steps towards achieving the SDG targets by 2030.

Stakeholders such as government officials, regional analysts, and national experts could draw out methodologies to address priority issues as well as develop appropriate policies. While expectations are low, it could still help the region accelerate its efforts to implement effective measures targeted at achieving the 2030 Agenda for SDG.

It’s not the tweet of the robin. Ditto Roll Up the Rim.

Instead, it’s the ushering in of half-load season on select county and local roads. Half-load season is just that, the limiting of materials to five tonnes per axle on the weaker roads located throughout the region.



Roads that are subject to seasonal weight restrictions are identified with a sign. Half-loads will be enforced once signs are posted, which started March 6, 2020 and will likely run into the early part of May.

Except the following locations, most roads within SDG are subject to half-load restrictions:

– South of Highway 401 on County Road Nos. 1, 14, 33 and 35.

– County Road 15 from County Road 2 to the southwest leg of County Road 36.

– County Road 44 from Highway No. 138 to 840m East of County Road 42

– County Road Nos. 31, 34, 43, 46

– County Road No. 2 from Leeds & Grenville boundary to the City of Cornwall boundary and from the City of Cornwall boundary to the Ontario/Quebec boundary.

Benjamin de-Haan, the director of transportation and planning for the county, said half-load season is integral to the long-term sustainability of the road infrastructure within the county – the biggest municipal roads system in the entire province.

“We strive to ensure we allow for the transportation of goods across the county, while at the same time putting measures in place to protect the investment taxpayers have made in our infrastructure,” he said. “These kinds of measures are important to the bottom line of the county, as well as the effective use of taxpayer dollars.”

Why are these measures so important? Try to think of a road like a giant sandwich buried in the ground with layers that are important to the overall flavour of the road. When you add an extra ingredient – like water – your sandwich can become a mess.

The base of the road begins at its deepest point with the sub-grade material, which is typically native material or imported fill. On top of this layer is aggregate material of varying sizes of crushed stone and other granulars that are packed into place. Finally the whole thing is topped with asphalt.

The problem comes in the late winter and early spring when the heat of the sun can warm the asphalt base to several degrees above freezing, while the ambient air temperature can often be well below zero. As snow and ice melts, it can permeate the asphalt in areas. When that water refreezes, say after sunset or doing an especially cold day, the ice and trapped water will weaken the strength of the road.

By restricting the amount of weight a vehicle carries, the damage to weakened roads can be mitigated.

“Half-load season is an effective means to protect our roads,” said de-Haan. “It won’t be long before the weather warms even more, and we will remove the restrictions.”

Indonesia's Tanoto Foundation has joined hands with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to develop the first tools for measuring early childhood development in the country, in an effort to support Indonesia in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.

SDG 4 aims to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"".

More specifically, the tools are intended to help the country meet Target 4.2 by 2030: ""ensure that all boys and girls have access to quality early childhood development, care, and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education"".

Tanoto Foundation has granted UNICEF Rp 2.8 billion (US$196,556) to develop versions of the Early Childhood Development Instrument (ECDI) and the Caregiver Reported Early Development Index (CREDI) measurement instruments that have been adapted for Indonesia.

These tools provide population data on the developmental statuses of children aged 0 to 3 years and 3 to 5 years.

UNICEF will test and validate the data collected through these tools that Statistics Indonesia (BPS) can then use for the 2020 National Economic and Social Survey.

“Intervention for young children is the key to developing Indonesia's human resources, and it is one of our focus areas. Measuring and monitoring are important, as we work with evidence-based principles,” Tanoto Foundation global CEO J. Satrijo Tanudjojo said in a statement The Jakarta Post received on Thursday.

“I am looking forward to the partnership with UNICEF to develop this measurement method that can then become a contribution to the nation,” he added.

Tanoto Foundation is an independent philanthropy organization that focuses on education.

UNICEF Indonesia representative Debora Comini echoed Satrijo, saying that it was highly important to develop tools to help relevant stakeholders in measuring and monitoring early childhood development in Indonesia.

“Investing in children to help them reach their full potential is critical, but to give every child the best start in life, we need to have the right data,” Comini said in the statement.","SDG 4 aims to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"".

And it would be a house league player from South Stormont, Adam Winter, who was the Panthers’ hero in a wild third period, breaking a 1-1 tie with 1:51 to go in regulation time when at close range he took a pass from behind the net from captain Nolan Shane and calmly but quickly fired the puck into the open side.

“I shot along the ice – kept it simple,” said Winter, a Grade 12 student in his second year on the Panthers squad that has several AAA-calibre players and quite a few AA-level skaters.

Winter connected just after a St. Joseph’s power play ended, and just after the Crusaders almost went ahead when presented with a shorthanded breakaway chance. He tied up his opponent behind the goal and fell to the ice. Shane swooped in to get the puck, and by the time it was put out in front, Winter was back on his feet and off to the side of the goal.

“Nolan came back to the bench (afterwards) and said ‘I knew you would be there,'” Winter recounted.","Article contentLONG SAULT — It was expected to be a thriller, and the championship game delivered.

Experts say young-adults from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh

Addressing the obstacles faced by the younger generation in Bangladesh, especially from marginalized and indigenous parts of the society, will be a key to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), said experts and activists.

Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of the US-based charity The Hunger Project Bangladesh, said youths from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh. “They are deprived largely in social, academic, employment and even cultural affairs.”

“In order to reflect and materialize the SDG focus of leaving no one behind, we must focus on diversity, tolerance, pluralism and the atmosphere of acceptance among some major measures, or else, they will not only get derailed but also get involved in extremism in numbers,” he warned.

The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Chairman Rehman Sobhan said the work being done by the government and non-government organizations (NGOs) for the SDG implementation implies how serious they are.

Through engaging in the process, the government attest to its obstacles and reliance on the NGOs, he said, adding: “But did it formally recognize the role the NGOs are putting in?”

Rehman insisted on much more coordination among the government and non-state actors in attaining the SDG, for which he termed the next five years as highly crucial.

The noted economist suggested the civil society to recognize its role in the process and act as a pressure group, especially on behalf of the marginalized people.

“By assembling data, it can evaluate what has been and needs to be done alongside holding the government accountable for the development activities for the SDG implementation,” he further said.

Shaheen Anam of the citizen’s platform said achieving the SDGs by 2030 does not solely depend on the government’s efforts; rather it is a process that involves all citizens of the country.

“And in doing so, we have to focus more on the theme of the SDGs and the 16th goal, engaging more and more youths in the process,” she opined.

“In the past, we massively neglected the young population despite the latter being our future. We hardly thought of resolving the challenges they face,” Shaheen said.

The young must get assistance and guidance from all since their activities will decide where the country will be heading towards in the future, she said.

Transparency International Bangladesh’s (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said the 16th goal of the SDGs may be hampered by politicization within the administration, the judiciary and authorities concerned.

He alleged that the space of civil society in the development process is being gradually shrunk since it is failing to raise its voice and criticize any irregularities in development projects.

“Even the young, in many cases, feel threatened only for dissenting on any graft in the development process, thus, refraining from participating in the dialoge for accountablity,” he said.

KM Abdus Salam, director-general of NGO Affairs Bureau, said the young have nothing to worry about in inclusive growth as the government believes in ensuring development for all.

The event was addressed, among others, by the citizen’s platform Coordinator Anisatul Fatema Yousuf, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman, and ActionAid Bangladesh Country Director Farah Kabir.","The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Article content Whelan last year was just in Grade 9 when the Panthers won the SDG crown for the second straight time. That led to another appearance at the Eastern Ontario (EOSSAA) championships, the Panthers coming oh-so-close to qualifying for the provincials but falling in a tight final against Bishop Smith from Pembroke. This time, the Panthers will head to EOSSAA next Tuesday (March 10) in Napanee. “I’m really looking forward to it,” said Whelan, who plays minor hockey at the midget AA level with the Lady Grads in Gloucester. “Hopefully we’ll have another good tournament.” Panthers coaches and administrators will have to do a little bit of stickhandling themselves that day, as the boys’ team also will travel to its EOSSAA event, being held in Renfrew. In the game against Tagwi, the Warriors kept things close early on, trailing just 2-1 late in the opening period. But, there was a disputed goal toward the end of the session, the Warriors making a pretty good case that the puck never crossed the line into the net, but it counted and the deficit became 3-1. Tagwi enjoyed some offensive pressure on a power play opportunity early in the middle session, but it would be the Panthers who scored, Kate Villeneuve with a shorthanded marker that made it 4-1. Villeneuve scored her second goal just over three minutes later, and she had two assists in the contest for a four-point effort. Olivia Mudde also scored for St. Joseph’s, and Macey Dionne had a pair of assists.

So, to have a relatively successful campaign required some ducks to align and a lot of patience and co-operation.

82,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-the-way-back-more-than-a-sports-movie,"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘The Way Back’: More Than a Sports Movie,"The convergence of high-school basketball and alcoholism inevitably invokes Hoosiers, one of the greatest sports movies ever made. As if leaning into the comparison, The Way Back even gives one coach a heart attack and has the coach protagonist ejected from a game for raging at a referee.

But screenwriter Brad Ingelsby and director Gavin O’Connor (Miracle, Warrior) have other ideas. The Way Back blends the beats of two familiar genres, the underdog sports movie and the addiction and recovery movie, in the process finding a rhythm that feels at once familiar and not quite like anything I’ve seen before.

The two story elements overlap at Bishop Hayes High School in Los Angeles’ working-class San Pedro neighborhood, where Ben Affleck’s Jack Cunningham, a bearded, heavyset construction worker and hard-drinking but mostly functional alcoholic, was once a high-school basketball star with a seemingly bright future.

Jack isn’t looking to take on something new when he gets a call from his alma mater. The school’s longtime head, Father Devine (John Aylward), explains that their head coach suffered a heart attack and that their struggling team, the Tigers, could use an infusion of the vitality Jack brought to their game.

Jack, who has never coached and hasn’t touched a basketball in decades, tries to decline, but Father Devine insists that he sleep on it. In the harrowing evening binge that follows, Jack rehearses a series of increasingly ill-formed refusals.

What ultimately moves him to accept? The film shrewdly skips to Jack showing up at the next day’s practice. I like to think that in the end he just can’t say no to this priest from his youth.

The screenwriter’s brother, Martin Ingelsby, is head coach at the University of Delaware and played at Archbishop Carroll High School in Philadelphia and at Notre Dame. Their father, Tom, was a star player at Cardinal O’Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania, and at Villanova before going on to play for the NBA and ABA.

Clearly Ingelsby knows about two things: basketball and Catholic education. That life experience is reflected in the film’s authenticity in various respects, from the strategies Jack employs on the court for coaching a dark-horse team playing better opponents to the school culture at Bishop Hayes.

It’s likewise impossible to separate the persuasive messiness of Affleck’s performance and of Jack’s troubled relationship with alcohol with the actor’s well-documented, longtime struggles in this area and his repeated stints in rehab. (The film leans into this, too, with early shots almost overtly echoing the “Sad Affleck” memes of a few years ago, accompanied by somber, muted scoring.)

Perhaps Ingelsby knows something about alcoholism, too, since the screenplay is sharp with insight here. An early conversation at a Thanksgiving family reunion between Jack and his sister, Beth (Michaela Watkins), is a deft portrayal of the kind of awkward, circling exchange that occurs between a caring family member attempting a ginger intervention in the life of a loved one she doesn’t see often and the defensively indignant addict in denial.

What makes Jack’s denial harder to overcome is that he gets up every morning, drives himself to work, and puts in a full day at the construction site. He’s drinking all the time — the shower-head caddy basket that holds his beer each morning where he can reach for it along with his shampoo is among the most telling touches — and some nights he needs a ride home from the bar, if not a hand getting up the steps to his apartment door, but he gets through the day.

Now that Jack and his wife, Angela (Janina Gavankar, The Morning Show), are separated, no one is close enough to Jack for his drinking to cause friction as long as he doesn’t want to confront it.

That changes, of course, once he begins coaching at Bishop Hayes.

The team has a long tradition of failure, and Jack’s lack of coaching experience and undisciplined personality make for a rough start. But Jack knows basketball, and the gradual reawakening of that part of himself is moving to watch.

Among many small, thoughtful touches, Jack asks his assistant coach, an algebra teacher named Dan (comedian Al Madrigal) who was a benchwarmer in Jack’s glory days, what the dress code is for games. For head coach, Dan answers, coat and tie. (Jack technically fulfills this requirement at every game while still looking like a slob with his shirt untucked.)

As he did in Miracle, the veteran sports director carefully builds up the team’s game from their indifferent early play to their aggressive competitive style, at the same time ramping up the tempo and drama of the camerawork and editing.

If Miracle left most of its players undifferentiated, The Way Back efficiently develops a more vivid cast of characters, with the most attention given to a quiet player named Brandon (Brandon Wilson) whom Jack singles out not only for his superior skills but also for his deeper understanding of the game.

Unsurprisingly, with Jack’s short temper and foul mouth, the school’s code of conduct is a recurring challenge, and more than once the team’s chaplain, Father Mark (Mark Whelan), has to push back on him, most notably after an egregious display of poor sportsmanship in coaching at a demoralizing defeat.

When Father Mark gently brings up the topic of Jack’s R-rated language, Jack tries a theological dodge: With all the bad stuff going on in the world, does the priest really think God gives a fig, or something, about his language?

But the chaplain is unfazed: At Bishop Hayes, he says, the mission is to “integrate our faith into our lives” — and so, yes, Father Mark thinks God gives a fig about Jack’s language. (This is not one of those cases where Jack reaches for one of the harsher words he could have used, which is fortunate since the priest repeats the word back to him.)

Later there’s a more drastic confrontation with the other priest, Father Devine. As much as we empathize with Jack in this difficult scene, Father Devine is not only in the right, but clearly finds the moment as painful as Jack does.

A wholly positive Catholic priest, let alone two, in a mainstream Hollywood non-horror film is essentially unheard of today. The Way Back not only makes Father Devine and Father Mark moral authorities, it also makes them individuals. (Another small but notable touch: Head priest Father Devine wears clerical blacks while Father Mark wears street clothes.)

The religious element is low-key, as it was in Warrior, but it’s better integrated into the story here.

Many sports movies have issues larger than sports on their minds. In The Way Back the larger issues of Jack’s personal life subvert genre expectations with a third-act crisis in which Jack’s life becomes both more complicated and simpler.

Jack’s line about God caring about language isn’t his most theologically fraught; it’s clear that the anger he lives with is directed at God, and he has a despairing line about life after death that is not rebutted by a priest or anyone else. On the other hand, a priest-led prayer before the final game stands in significant contrast to the limitations that Jack, even at his best, brought to his coaching style and attitude.

More important, ultimately, than the interweaving of the two storylines is the balance they provide each other.

The young Bishop Hayes Tigers players stand in some ways where Jack stood decades earlier, the present bright, the future uncertain. Jack stands at a crossroads of his own, his past a long pileup of bad choices, consequences and heartache earned and unearned.

The Way Back finds a satisfying note to end on, but what matters most as the credits roll is the way forward.

G7 foreign ministers meet virtually

U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo will host his counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. on Tuesday. Pompeo had originally planned to hold the meeting in Pittsburgh, but due to the coronavirus and travel restrictions foreign ministers will meet via video conference through Wednesday.

WEDNESDAY

Chinese property developer updates on Blackstone bid

SOHO China's response to a private equity firm's buyout proposal will be the focus on Wednesday when the commercial property developer reports 2019 earnings.

Background: Earlier this month, the company said in a stock exchange disclosure that it was discussing a sale with overseas financial investors.

Who's buying? The disclosure came after Reuters reported the American private equity firm Blackstone Group had offered $4 billion, or double SOHO's market value, to take it private.

UN releases update on Asia's SDG progress

The Bangkok-based United Nations Economic and Social Commission for the Asia-Pacific is expected to deliver a grim assessment of Asia's progress toward sustainable development goals.

What are the SDGs? In 2015, 193 countries pledged to achieve 17 goals by 2030, including eliminating poverty and hunger, universal health and education, and sustainable energy and infrastructure.

Where is Asia falling behind? Gender equality, sustainable production and climate action.

Why it matters: Several Asian countries, including Japan and the Philippines, consistently top global risk indexes for extreme weather events due to climate change.

THURSDAY

Huawei launches new flagship smartphone

Huawei will launch the P40 series in an online event on Thursday, after plans to hold a grand debut in Paris were cancelled due to the coronavirus.

What's in it? Due to U.S. blacklisting, Huawei's new premium phone will still lack support from Google Mobile Services, including YouTube and Google Maps.

Background: The world's second largest smartphone maker is likely to report its first-ever shipment decline this year, as the industry faces macroeconomic headwinds and uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Worldwide shipments for 2020 are projected to drop by 10%, or 100 million units, according to U.S. research company Strategy Analytics, as the outbreak wreaks havoc on supply chains and consumer sentiment.

Pegatron announces 4Q and 2019 results

Key iPhone assembler Pegatron will release October to December earnings and 2019 results on Thursday and give an update on its plan to resume production in China. Pegatron's quarterly earnings are expected to grow year-over-year due to better than expected sales of the iPhone 11. The assembler, however, whose manufacturing hub is in China, has seen its supply chain disrupted by the coronavirus.

Japan leg of Olympic torch relay begins

The Olympic torch relay will start in Fukushima Prefecture, north of Tokyo, on Thursday, after the flame arrived in Japan last week. The event comes amid persistent speculation over a postponement of the Tokyo Olympics. Organizers insist the games will start as planned on July 24.

What's the plan? Torchbearers, including Japan's world champion women's soccer team, will run across Fukushima and visit the coastal areas devastated by the 2011 tsunami.

Stay at home: The organizing committee is urging spectators to refrain from crowding around the relay route and watch the relay from home instead. The Greek leg of the relay was prematurely halted after fans in Sparta crowded around a torchbearer, the actor Gerard Butler, sparking concerns about the spread of COVID-19.

FRIDAY

Shangri-La and Genting announce 2019 results

Investors will have a chance to look into the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the luxury travel sector as Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts and Genting Hong Kong, which operates Crystal Cruises, report annual earnings on Thursday. The cruise industry in Asia has ground to a halt, and prestige hotels saw a sharp drop in occupancy as people stay home to avoid the coronavirus.

More: The operator Princess Cruises suspended operations after an outbreak aboard one of its vessels, the Diamond Princess, left thousands stranded for weeks at the Port of Yokohama.

Kirin holds annual general meeting

Japanese beverage giant Kirin Holdings will hold its annual general meeting on Friday. The U.K.-based activist investor firm Independent Franchise Partners (FP) is pushing Kirin to choose two FP-nominated outside directors and focus on its core beer business by selling its health segments.

What's at stake: How much support FP can get from Japanese institutional investors is up in the air. FP would first need a quorum of more than half of Kirin's voting shareholders, then garner votes from more than half of those attending. FP owns 2% of Kirin's shares.

WEEKEND

Tokyo's Haneda airport opens new international terminal

On Sunday, Haneda International Airport will inaugurate the extension of Terminal 3, which serves international flights. Additionally, Terminal 2, which is currently dedicated to domestic flights, will begin partially serving international traffic.

What else is new? The airport also plans to introduce a facial recognition system for check-ins in the first half of 2020. But the pandemic has forced tenant airlines to ground a majority of their planes, putting the renewed airport into trouble from the get-go.

More: Following many Asian carriers, ANA is reducing 80% of its planned international routes from March 29 to April 24. The Japanese airline had planned a fleet expansion, taking advantage of the increased landing slots at Haneda.","Last week closed with major monetary policy easing by six Asia Pacific central banks, including Japan and Australia.

Article content Bergeron went to the Downtown Business Improvement Area (BIA) website and grabbed a list of business from there. She worked with Chris Munro at Life’s Little Pleasures to have other businesses participate. Munro threw a message out on Facebook notifying owners and Bergeron reached out to the Cornwall and Area Chamber of Commerce herself so it could help spawn the idea quickly. “What happens on the business side is I take in all of the proceeds and pay it out once a week,” said Bergeron. “I’m very transparent.

COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR

Article content A regional state of emergency was declared on Thursday afternoon in response to COVID-19. In a press teleconference, it was announced the City of Cornwall, the United Counties of SDG, and the United Counties of Prescott-Russell were all making the declaration together, a unified front in the battle to prevent spreading of the virus. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR Back to video “We felt a regional approach to a declaration of emergency would be best,” Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement said. “It strengthens the (regional response), the importance of the message.” The message? Most have heard it but too many have not listened to it, mainly that those who are sick or are a returning traveller must isolate at home for 14 days. For those who are healthy, leaving the home should only occur when it’s an essential trip. And, people should keep two metres apart, buy only what they need at stores, wash their hands and help their neighbours. Speaking forcefully, Clement said “the time is now to flatten the curve,” and that community buy-in is “how we’re going to beat this thing. I’m calling on residents to do the right thing: stay home, stay connected, stay healthy.”

Article content Prescott-Russell Warden Pierre Leroux, in noting the measure gives municipal leaders extra powers during a crisis, said the redeployment of county resources such as personnel for emergency services was one example. Paramedic services is Prescott-Russell’s responsibility in that area, whereas the City of Cornwall administers the paramedic service within its borders and also within SDG. Leroux said the COVID-19 situation in the region “is still manageable,” but it is and will be more difficult because “we do have some ‘COVIDiots’ out there. . . we all need to get the message loud and clear.” Medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, started the teleconference by saying he’s been in close contact with municipal leaders for the last four to six weeks, and that now, that on March 26, “we felt it was a very important time to declare an emergency.” Why now? Because health experts, while acknowledging there are currently just four positive cases so far, expect the number to soon rise, and possibly quite dramatically. “We’re at the bottom of the curve, just starting to go up,” Roumeliotis said. Roumeliotis said that for the region overall, there are 300 tests still pending. He reiterated he believes there is community spread of the virus at this point, and that “our population is a vulnerable population,” because of demographics and a large number of elderly citizens, and a population with high incidence of chronic illnesses.

Article content More On This Topic Cornwall will push out funds to agencies ASAP EOHU to receive quarantine enforcement guidelines shortly Cornwall ready, and waiting, to declare a state of emergency SDG Warden Frank Prevost stressed the importance of following quarantine, self-isolation procedures, and that the declaration “gives us the opportunity to make decisions efficiently to protect the well-being of our residents.” In a question and answer session during the call, which was quite chaotic at times mainly because of ambient noise and some technical difficulties, Leroux said the declaration was both one that gives officials more power, but that it was also, and importantly, symbolic, in that “we want to make (the measures are) clear to all.” Clement expanded on earlier comments about the declaration, saying it “does give us more flexibility in how we direct resources to deal with the emergency. But the point of the regional approach is to send the strongest possible message to our residents that the time is now to slow down the spread of the virus.” The biggest concern for municipalities seems to be a flexibility to shuffle resources within their ranks. Clement explained the declaration allows staff members to be redeployed to wherever needs might be greatest moving forward, even for tasks that may not fall under that person’s collective agreement. Should the city’s own employees start to be impacted by COVID-19, that flexibility is needed to ensure the city can continue to operate. Roumeliotis was asked if a curfew could be invoked, limiting times during the day that people could be outside their homes. “It’s a last resort,” the doctor said, saying so far there’s been a “progressive approach” to having people stay at home, and that further limitations in the size of gatherings is what likely would come next. But, he said, all measures including a curfew are on the table, and that which course of action is taken “will depend completely on how the disease progresses and what toll it takes.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

89,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/in-updated-ndc-chile-aligns-climate-and-sustainable-development-agendas/,"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"In Updated NDC, Chile Aligns Climate and Sustainable Development Agendas","Chile has submitted its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, following submission of its first NDC in 2015. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

90,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/ffd-forum-highlights-calls-for-debt-standstill/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,FfD Forum Highlights Calls for Debt Standstill,"The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) held its annual Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum) to hear remarks from officials on financing sustainable development in the context of COVID-19. The outcome document of the 2020 Forum was negotiated among Member States through virtual means, and placed under consideration via silence procedure.

Opening the virtual FFD Forum on 23 April 2020, ECOSOC President Mona Juul drew immediate attention to the importance of debt relief. She welcomed:

the Group of 20 (G20) Finance Ministers’ Action Plan calling to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries,

a call by the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,

actions by the Paris Club; and

the call by Pakistan’s Prime Minister for a Global Initiative for Debt Relief, proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt issue and financing for sustainable development.

Also on debt, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 are amplifying existing debt risks. He called for extending the G20’s proposed debt moratorium to all countries that request forbearance, including middle-income countries (MICs) that lose access to financial markets. He said more targeted debt relief also will be needed, and to address sovereign debt restructuring in a way that supports countries in achieving the SDGs.

UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also echoed the importance of debt relief, welcoming the initiatives from the G20, IMF, World Bank, and the Global Initiative for Debt Relief called for by Pakistan.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Board Chair for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization – GAVI, explained that for many vulnerable countries, COVID-19 began as an economic crisis as global demand fell for their export products, including oil and industrial metal. Income from tourism and remittances also fell. “Then the pandemic arrived and the health crisis set in,” she said, and the necessary measures to save lives compounded the economic crisis. She said that in developing countries, 70% of workers are in the informal sector, and for them, lockdowns mean no work, no money, and no food for their families. This “perfect storm” can amount to a food crisis and lead to unrest. She highlighted the proposal for a two-year “debt standstill” as a short-term response, followed by efforts to revamp health systems and make them more resilient.

Another theme of the officials’ remarks was illicit financial flows (IFFs). Juul stressed the need to combat and prevent IFFs, as all sources of finance must be mobilized to address the virus and its social and economic consequences. Muhammad-Bande added that IFFs must be fought so countries can prevent inequalities from deepening.

Speakers also highlighted gender-related impacts of the pandemic crisis. Juul said women both carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, and are overrepresented among frontline health workers. Guterres said the pandemic has shown how economies are sustained by the invisible, unpaid labor of women, and “returning to our previous path is simply not an option.” He said women’s leadership is needed to help avoid catastrophic consequences of economic instability on women and girls.

In a keynote address, Narbada Gumbonzvanda, Board Chair, Action Aid International, outlined Action Aid’s call for a global people’s bailout of at least US$4.6 trillion. Pointing to inequality as “the mother of all pre-existing conditions,” she said we are on the brink of catastrophe because of “the yawning gaps we have tolerated in social and economic rights such as access to healthcare, clean water and rights to decent work.”

Gumbonzvanda reported that two thirds of low-income countries are spending more on debt service payments than on public health care. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only one in five people is covered by any kind of pension, social protection or safety net.

Jay Collins, Citigroup Vice Chairman for Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory, suggested using the COVID-19 crisis to strengthen resolve against climate change, and learn how to manage setbacks. He said the mobilization of trillions of US dollars in capital demonstrates that the world is capable of radical responses in the developed world, but in the developing world, the fight has just begun.

Collins acknowledged that COVID-19 has moved the SDG targets further from reach and made them even more ambitious. However, he identified “silver linings” in investors’ interest in social factors, reporting that: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds are outperforming non-ESG benchmarks; risk models for investment are being reconsidered, giving additional weight to climate value-at-risk and other concepts; and ESG scores for companies are already falling for poor COVID-response behavior.

In a statement on the occasion of the Forum, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said the impacts of the pandemic will be felt across all SDGs and the seven action areas of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD. He said recovery actions must be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and AAAA to ensure that we recover in a more sustainable and resilient way, and the AAAA in particular can act as a roadmap to a more resilient economy in the post-COVID world.

The virtual informal meeting of the Forum served as its fifth annual session, since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD in 2015. The outcome document was negotiated among Member States through virtual means in a process led by the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Latvia, and was placed under silence procedure until 27 April 2020.

Juul said the text, once adopted, will represent the first universal agreement on UN policies to finance immediate response to COVID-19 and longer-term recovery.

91,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/a-bold-call-for-action-needed-on-measuring-sdg-indicators/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: A Bold Call for Action Needed on Measuring SDG Indicators,"The global SDG indicator framework, which is the foundation of the 2030 Agenda’s mutual accountability edifice, continues to have its value undermined by those who should champion it most. Consider blood donation campaigns. In most countries of the world, donating blood is voluntary. To raise donations, governments and health agencies traditionally appeal to social responsibility and a sense of civic solidarity, sometimes even providing incentives.

Imagine instead a scenario where the principal pitch-line of a donation campaign was that it remains a “voluntary” initiative, and citizens can always find “alternative” ways to express their civic responsibility. The likely result would be to discourage the noble action of blood donation.

This resembles the situation we are witnessing with the global SDG indicator framework. Following the most pessimistic declaration to date by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in September 2019, in which it noted with great alarm that the world is “off track” to meeting most of the SDGs, the response by the UN Statistical Commission at its latest session on 3-6 March 2020 was to tepidly “reiterate that the application of the global indicator framework is a voluntary and country-led process and that alternative or complementary indicators for national and subnational levels of monitoring will be developed at national level on the basis of national priorities, realities, capacities and circumstances.”

The SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, measured first and foremost by the global SDG indicators.

Why does the Commission take pains to repeat that the global indicator framework is a voluntary process, and why is it sanctioning the use of alternative indicators?

Importance of Monitoring the Global Indicators

The development and review of the global SDG indicator framework has been an arduous process that has lasted over five years and required the concerted effort of the entire international statistical community. The Commission’s seemingly paradoxical approach of downplaying its importance may be the result of objections from a small number of countries to certain SDG indicators or to their methodological specifications. Rather than tackle this handful of cases head-on, the Commission appears to have preferred portraying the entire SDG indicator framework as less binding, including allowing for “alternative” indicators and continuing to refer to it as “work in progress.”

Nobody is debating the fact the 2030 Agenda as a whole, and the SDG indicators in particular, are a voluntary commitment. But by constantly reiterating the voluntary nature of the global indicator framework, without advocating for its use for the purpose of global monitoring, the UN Statistical Commission – the highest intergovernmental decision-making body in statistics – sends an ambiguous message to countries that risks doing a disservice to the 2030 Agenda.

In our previous article published on this blog, we highlighted how poor SDG data are leading to poor implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s global commitments. In that article, we also suggested a number of pragmatic measures to tackle the huge data gaps, beginning with the need for the UN Statistical Commission to urge countries to monitor the global SDG indicator framework. Unfortunately, when the Commission met in March 2020 for its annual session, it missed this opportunity.

Alternative Indicators, Risky Substitutions

The Commission’s open invitation for countries to use “alternative” indicators may have serious consequences for global SDG reporting. To some readers, the terms alternative and complementary may at first glance appear almost equivalent. However, there is a profound difference between the two. To complement the global indicator framework with regional and/or national indicators means that countries should ostensibly report global indicators as the starting point, yet they are also free to deploy additional indicators for more specific purposes. By contrast, suggesting that “alternative” indicators can be developed effectively gives countries a blank cheque to substitute global indicators with different national indicators.

As we also noted in our previous article, alternative national indicators are invariably incomparable with global indicators, and this directly undermines the principle of mutual accountability on which the 2030 Agenda is built. There are no established criteria or procedures for determining when and how to substitute global indicators with national indicators, which leaves the door open to arbitrary choices. More importantly, when countries do not produce the official global indicators at national level, it becomes impossible to compile regional and global aggregates and thereby gain a sense of the world’s progress towards implementing the SDGs.

By allowing countries to develop “alternative” indicators, the UN Statistical Commission has overlooked associated risks, as well as the sage advice of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the Millennium Development Goal indicators (IAEG-MDG) – the predecessor mechanism to today’s IAEG-SDG. In its seminal report on Lessons Learned from MDG Monitoring from a Statistical Perspective, the IAEG-MDG noted one of the key weaknesses of the MDG monitoring framework was the fact that “discrepancies between national and international data, due to, among others, different methodologies, definitions, different choice of data sources, or time gap in release dates, created problems at the national level and tension in the international statistical community.”

The other challenge with using “alternative” instead of “complementary” indicators is that it may amount to a reinterpretation of UN Resolution 70/1 (by which the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Paragraph 75 states that: “global indicators…will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by Member States.”

The term “alternative” does not figure at all in the 2030 Agenda or its associated UNGA resolution. In introducing this term, with the real and not merely semantic implications explained above, the UN Statistical Commission has set a questionable precedent by blurring the boundaries between the roles of legislator and statistician.

Time is Running Out to Measure SDG Indicators

With a little over ten years left until the end of 2030, and an unenviable track record so far, half-hearted efforts and mixed messages will not get us to the finish line. A bold and unambiguous statement is needed to remind all actors that the SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, which are measured, first and foremost, by the global SDG indicators.

The forward, by Henrik Hammargren, notes that defining “leadership” can be a difficult task, but identifies four characteristics: 1) that it can be both constructive and destructive and therefore must be scrutinized; 2) that it should not be condensed to a particular set of skills; 3) that it is often confused with—or reduced to—management capability; and 4) that the public discourse is too narrowly-focused on the individual, and should also recognize collective responsibility and action.

Making the case for the relevance of UN leadership in the current context, the report offers five precepts that provide a framing for 26 written contributions:

The responsibility of the UN and its mandate: leaders in the UN must act in the midst of—and in response to—endemic poverty, climate change, armed conflicts and human rights violations, and uphold the UN charter in the face of resistance The recognition that no one has a monopoly of knowledge over ‘leadership’: the voices and viewpoints expressed by the individual thoughtpieces differ, each offering their own perspective The relationship between leadership and management: noting the above caveat, leadership encompasses management, but the latter can be taught, learned or otherwise implemented, whereas leadership builds on a variety of other traits spanning ethics, integrity and courage Leadership is not just at the top: leadership is to be sought, enabled and nurtured at all levels of the organization, across a wide range of professional profiles Anchoring decisions in today’s realities: recognizing that past inspirations regularly surface, the report avoids a “golden age” or “what would Hammarskjöld have done” sentimentality, recalling his words that, “Your duty, your reward – your destiny – are here and now.”

The report organizes contributions beginning with a broad exploration of what principled leadership at the UN entails, and how leadership can build consensus to address global challenges and strengthen multilateralism. The second chapter describes lessons learned from, and attributes of, individual leaders, featuring inspirational stories and an exploration of the question, “who would you want to work for?” The report’s third chapter explores the institutional role of UN leadership in coalition-building, the relevance of feminist leadership to the UN, and the relationships between innovation and leadership. The final chapter takes stock of current leadership initiatives undertaken in the wake of the adoption of the UN System Leadership Framework, and utilizes data related to UN human resources functions to revisit past assumptions and review “unexamined symptoms of ailing leadership.”

Better leadership is essential not only for ensuring trust in the UN—and in multilateralism more broadly—but also for effectively responding to today’s global challenges, the report argues. It highlights a tension between realism and idealism, where leaders must uphold universal values and principles, but also must hold governments and people to account, which involves a unique set of risks and pressures. These pressures, the report recognizes, demand that a leader demonstrate grit and courage, but also humility, compassion and empathy.

The report concludes with three emergent learnings: for leadership to grow, failures must be recognized and discussed; further stock must be taken on the UN Leadership Framework’s implementation across a fragmented UN system; and if the UN is to be impactful beyond New York or Geneva, reflections on leadership must be shared beyond these spheres, going past inward-looking perspectives to include external experiences and stakeholders.

The publication’s focus on UN leadership derives from three factors: 1) the UN reform process, of which strengthening leadership features as a core pillar; 2) turbulence, where the UN is being questioned and having its contributions and budgets reduced; and 3) historical, as 2019 marked the “centennial anniversary of the international civil servant” and the founding of the League of nations. Additionally, this September will feature a celebration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, a key theme of which will be multilateralism.

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

The report titled, ‘The Illegal Trade in Chemicals,’ was released on 1 April 2020. In discussing the governance and markets of the illegal chemicals and waste trade, the authors review enforcement failures and best practices, and provide recommendations for policymakers, as well as for communities and users of chemicals.

According to the publication, multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) regulate only a fraction of the chemicals being traded, amid exemptions under MEAs and inconsistencies among domestic regulations. The authors report that many toxic products are easily accessible in the marketplace or online, and a lack of reporting mechanisms means that information on illegal trade is scarce and hinders the ability of authorities to act.

The report provides a particular focus on the illegal trade of pesticides and mercury, both of which are subject to strong international regulations. However, the scale of illegal trade in these chemicals is unknown, and users of the substances are often unaware of the risks they pose. The authors suggest that public-private partnerships can help raise awareness among vendors, local farmers, rural communities, and private landowners about the health and environmental risks associated with pesticides. They also find that:

annual revenue losses of €1.3 billion in the legitimate pesticides industry in the EU are attributable to counterfeit pesticides;

an estimated 30% of pesticides sold in developing countries are sub-standard;

half of all mercury used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is traded illegally; and

the value of illegally-traded mercury is USD 100–215 million annually.

Legitimate businesses, national economies, and human health and the environment are bearing the brunt of the illegal chemicals trade, write the authors. They recommend: building expertise and capacity to identify illegal shipments; establishing national reporting mechanisms to assess illegal trade within national jurisdictions; better controlling the production and marketing of gold and the harmonization of gold-export regimes to reduce the drivers of illicit cross-border trade; and standardized regional mercury-specific trade frameworks and anti-corruption campaigns at the local and national levels.

A challenge to reducing illegal chemicals trade is that law enforcement officers are not adequately trained or equipped to detect and recognize illicit chemicals and counterfeit containers. Shipping documents may not report mercury concealed among other materials, or mercury may be delivered in secret to a small port by fishing boat.

The report recommends that policymakers work to ensure the availability of human and technical resources to combat illegal trade, including to maintain staffing levels and train law enforcement officers to identify and interdict illicit movements of hazardous chemicals, and developing intelligence systems for sharing information among agencies and the coordinating transnational enforcement operations.

The report was prepared by UNEP and GRID-Arendal in partnership with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), the Center for Environmental Law (CIEL), INTERPOL and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), among others.

The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

On 27 March 2020, the UNGA adopted decision 74/544, titled ‘Procedure for taking decisions of the General Assembly during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.’ The decision notes “the limitations recommended on meetings within the United Nations premises as precautionary measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.” Circulating the proposed decision for adoption, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said that from his consultations with the Assembly’s General Committee, “it is quite clear that we all agreed that, under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances, the General Assembly has to be able to take essential decisions related to the Organization.”

According to a step-by-step document on applying the silence procedure, the UNGA President will circulate a draft of a decision or resolution to all Member States, specifying the deadline for raising an objection and allowing at least 72 hours. At the same time, the draft is to be made available on the UN’s Official Document System in all official languages, except in extraordinary circumstances. Any information from the Secretariat on programme budgetary implications is to be circulated at the same time.

To make an objection, Member States can send a letter or Note Verbale via email to the UNGA President. The President will inform all Member States that the silence has been broken. The President then may choose to refer the draft decision/resolution and the objections to: the sponsors of the text; the co-facilitators of the UNGA-mandated processes for the 74th session; the Chair of the originating Committee; the Office of the UNGA President; or a facilitator designated by the President to lead further consultations. Any revised drafts would follow another round of the silence procedure.

If there are no objections within the specified time period, the UNGA President will circulate a letter confirming adoption. The step-by-step process also includes options for making an explanation of position. The document indicates that it is not technically possible to hold a vote under this temporary procedure.

All decisions and resolutions adopted via the silence procedure will be noted by the UNGA plenary at its first possible meeting in the General Assembly Hall.

For ECOSOC, on 1 April 2020, taking into account the UNGA’s agreement on the methodology, President Mona Juul circulated a proposal enabling the Council to adopt decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council adopted Decision 2020/205 on 3 April, and the procedure is in effect until the end of May 2020 unless extended through the same procedure.

According to the step-by-step guide, when the ECOSOC president intends to circulate a draft decision or resolution under the silence procedure, she will first consult the Bureau. Bureau members will then consult with the members of their respective regional group. The document notes that information about this consultation will be posted on ECOSOCPlace before a proposal is sent on silence procedure.

The draft is to be circulated to all Members of the Council with copy to all other Member States for their information, under a silence procedure of at least 72 hours. If the silence is not broken, the decision is considered adopted.

If objections are raised, the ECOSOC President may choose to refer the text and the objections to: the Vice-President responsible for coordinating matters under the item concerned; the sponsors; the co-facilitators of the ECOSOC processes for the current session; the Chair of the originating subsidiary body; or a facilitator to lead further consultations.

Other steps in the procedure are similar to those under the UNGA procedure, including the circulation of programme budgetary implications and the placing of the draft text into the UN’s document system in all official languages. Like in the UNGA, all decisions taken through the silence procedure will be noted at the first plenary meeting held “after the cessation of the precautionary measures as soon as the circumstances allow.” [UN News story on UNGA silence procedure] [All COVID-19 updates from ECOSOC President]","The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

As a result, many schools have also asked parents to ensure that learning continues at home and online learning is an obvious way to keep lessons going. However, only a few schools have well-established online learning systems while millions of parents and teachers looking for ways to help kids stay engaged over this extended period of at-home learning.

Two of Australia’s biggest tech companies, Canva and Atlassian, are looking for ways that they can help students learn remotely by bringing a bit of magic to their at-home experience and they are doing this through the 30-day “Sustainable Development Goal Challenge for Change project.”

The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”. They’re an urgent call for action by all countries – developed and developing – in a global partnership.

To help these students make a real difference whilst learning from home, Canva partnered with Atlassian to create this challenge-for-change initiative. They have drawn on the expertise of 30 specialists across businesses, nonprofits, and industry sectors to create specific tasks and share their insights on topics relating to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This 30-day challenge for change initiative not only allows students to learn new things, but also provides them with the opportunity to grapple with the world’s biggest problems and with the potential to make a difference to global issues such as poverty, climate change, and equality. The organizers are asking students to share their solutions on Twitter using the #changemakerchallenge.

It’s a fun, interactive way to engage with and learn from the experts in each area.

Fun Fact: You could even win a few prizes along the way, so it’s well worth getting involved in. You’ll be set challenges for which you must carefully consider your solutions before finding a way to best present and share them on Twitter.

The 30-day challenge has started today and today’s challenge is on “Ending poverty in all its forms” and is unpacked by the Head of Australia for UNHCR Naomi Steer.

In 2020, to mark its 75th anniversary, the United Nations have initiated UN75, the largest and most inclusive global conversation on how to build a better future.

The initiative intends to map out what works and what doesn’t within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. When calling for global participation in the conversation, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remarked that no country can solve the complex global challenges on its own. Participation is pivotal to shaping the future we want.

And 2020 will be a year of great importance: there are just 10 years left to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda.

The goals, adopted by all countries in 2015, constitute a universal roadmap for the world and represent a shared commitment for people, planet and prosperity. Among its key aims, the 2030 Agenda includes bringing to life a low-carbon, climate-smart economy, ending extreme poverty and hunger, and promoting peace, just societies and gender equality. All of which must be accomplished within the next decade.

Doing so necessitates concrete action to be taken now to safeguard the progress made over the past five years.

To deliver on the 2030 Agenda, stakeholders, stretching across sectors, societies and countries, require greater mobilisation — a point made by UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J Mohammed, when briefing Member States on the Decade of Action in late 2019. She acknowledged that “game-changing transformation” has yet to occur. Gender inequality, the climate crisis, poverty and hunger, corruption and numerous other obstacles still haunt and hinder us.

Unpacking the Decade of Action

Under the umbrella of the Decade of Action, the UN has identified three action points: mobilisation, ambition and concrete solutions. Governments and other actors need to showcase good practices and address their failures.

These three action points resonate with the SDG Lab at UN Geneva, and strike at the chord of the Lab’s DNA. As a relative newcomer in the sustainable development space, the Lab acts by serving as a connector, an amplifier, a question-asker and an innovator.

The SDG Lab’s role

The SDG Lab leverages the convening power of the UN. It brings together governments, actors from the UN system, civil society, academia and the private sector, and offers a neutral space to advance the SDGs. The role of the Lab is increasingly relevant in disseminating SDG solutions.

Among the key initiatives that the Lab has spearheaded is its work in connecting the expertise and resources of the finance and development communities. Development finance is taking a new turn. More investors are looking to drive capital for impact, and to integrate social and environmental aspects into their investment processes. Both communities acknowledge that much more can be achieved together than separately.

New sustainable finance projects have been developed in the Geneva ecosystem. One such project is the “Pipeline Builder” that aims to bridge the need for investment at country level with actors who want to drive more capital for greater impact. Another concept that is being explored is an initiative that would facilitate SDG financing by strategically utilising public and philanthropic capital to incentivise the mobilisation of additional private finance.

Bridges for sustainable finance

In 2019, the SDG Lab, together with 50 partners, held Switzerland’s first-ever Building Bridges Week (buildingbridgesweek.ch). The event’s ambition was to help influential financial players gain exposure to sustainable development and insight into impactful investments.

The Week also tapped into the growing fatigue with the “business as usual” attitude. Many citizens have pressing demands for new investment models aligned with the 2030 Agenda. They want to see their money make a difference, as well as financial returns.

In the spirit of the Decade of Action, initiatives such as these help to mobilise the SDG actors of international Geneva and beyond, boost ambitions and provide SDG solutions.

In line with the momentum of UN75, the SDG Lab will continue to do its part to accelerate implementation of the goals.

The Policy Tracker includes information on 193 economies, as of 3 April 2020. For each of these 193 entities, data regarding number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and containment measures are updated regularly, as are summaries of each economy’s fiscal, monetary and macro-financial, and exchange rate and balance of payments policy responses.

The Tracker focuses on discretionary actions; it does not incorporate information such as automatic insurance mechanisms or social safety nets that were in place prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The IMF notes that the information in the Tracker is not meant for comparisons across economies, because responses vary depending on the nature of the shock and country-specific circumstances.

In a separate article, the IMF recommends that economic policy at this time should have three objectives: guarantee the functioning of essential sectors; provide enough resources for people hit by the crisis; and prevent excessive economic disruption. The article notes that, while public sector intervention is justified by the emergency “for as long as exceptional circumstances persist,” it must be provided in a transparent manner and should have clear sunset clauses.

On fiscal policy recommendations, and IMF article suggests that governments should: spend money to prevent, detect, control, treat, and contain the virus, and to provide basic services to people that have to be quarantined and to the businesses affected; provide timely, targeted, and temporary cash flow relief to the people and firms that are most affected; and create a business continuity plan.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has developed a “COVID-19 Policy Tracker,” which summarizes the economic responses that governments are taking to address the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Life is difficult right now – there’s no way to sugar coat it! We’re modifying our behaviours, adjusting our routines and giving up time with our loved ones. The pay off should be worth it, but it doesn’t mean it’s not hard.

In difficult times, hearing heartwarming stories can provide us with an extra boost of positivity. Everyone is looking for ways to stay positive and to help make things just a little easier for their loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, etc. I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

There have been a lot of stories of individuals and organizations using their 3D printers to provide protective equipment to healthcare workers – within days of closing, Library staff were involved in testing these types of printing projects for Glengarry Memorial Hospital.

Since that first week, staff have been working to print face shields and most recently, mask straps. The face shields are still in progress, as the print jobs originally took nine hours and finding the clear plastic is difficult to source. The library has arranged to have their shields available to GMH staff as a back up should they run out of their supply of protective equipment. Thankfully, there has been no need for that yet.

The mask straps, designed to relieve the pressure on the ears from wearing a face mask for extended periods of time, were delivered to extremely grateful hospital staff last week.

We’re proud that we are able to use our equipment to provide support to our brave healthcare workers. Printing these items has been a real team effort, involving numerous staff to make it happen. Library staff continue to demonstrate that we are a resourceful bunch – and we’re ready to respond to any needs we can during this difficult time.","I’m so proud to share the efforts that SDG Library staff have been taking to help contribute to the protection of healthcare workers.

Article content Hospitals in SDG and Prescott-Russell have about a week to a 10 days’ worth of personal protective equipment before they run out. Eastern Ontario Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis confirmed this Monday, saying unless the region received a massive supply of equipment within the next few days, local hospitals could be forced to decontaminate masks and reuse them. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG/Prescott-Russell to run out of PPE within 10 days: EOHU Back to video “We’re also being told that any day now we should be receiving a massive supply, so were crossing our fingers,” Roumeliotis said during Monday’s teleconference briefing. “At this point it’s either we decontaminate it and reuse it, or we get a big supply.” According to Roumeliotis, directives to decontaminate and reuse the equipment stemmed from both federal and provincial governments. “Medical-grade facemasks should be reserved only for healthcare providers,” he said. “Healthcare providers use those to protect themselves and to protect their patients.”

Roumeliotis still could not give an exact number when asked how many ventilators were in the Prescott-Russell and SDG area, citing that he did not have enough time to look it up. “I don’t have those numbers,” he said. “I’ve just had so many things to do.” Fifth centre opens

Five testing centres are now up and running in the EOHU area — Casselman, Hawkesbury, Winchester, Cornwall and Rockland, which opened its doors on Monday. Roumeliotis outlined there was the potential to open one in Alexandria, if needed. In total, the SDG and Prescott-Russell areas have 44 confirmed cases, with three of them currently in intensive care unit (ICU) and two in a non-ICU setting. Of the five hospitalized cases for the area, three are housed in the Cornwall Community Hospital — with two of them being in ICU. “They are all in stable condition,” answered Roumeliotis when asked about them. “There were rumours that there was a death due to the virus in the area. At this point, we haven’t had any reports of death related to COVID. So far, we haven’t had any deaths.” More On This Topic Eastern Ontario Health Unit now at 42 local cases of COVID-19 EOHU now at 34 cases, including first youth Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Data unveiled by the province on Monday outlined that of the 44 local cases, three have now been classified as resolved. Of those who tested positive, 22 are women and 24 are men. Only one case is reported as being under the age of 20. Three are in the 20s, eight in their 30s, four are in their 40s, 14 are in their 50s, 13 are in their 60s and two are in their 70s. One person’s age is labelled by the province as unknown.

Roumeliotis expressed once again that residents should not visit family members during the pandemic — especially during the upcoming Easter weekend. “Again, I urge everybody, please don’t get together with your families,” he said. “I know that for many it’s an important religious holiday, but it’s really important, particularly over the next week or two, that we stay at home, that we don’t gather and that we don’t go see grandma. “It’s well worth doing phone calls or getting together virtually to protect the most vulnerable in our community.” He also said the number of confirmed cases seems to have slowed down recently. “There’s a bit of a peak between March 14 and March 26,” said Roumeliotis. “We had about five to six new cases on a daily basis. Now it has sort of gone down. We’re looking at keeping that low and we’re going to be monitoring very closely.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine Resources: Ontario’s COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool

Article content Despite 2020 not being halfway done, it already appears the year will be disastrous for several local fairs, many of them being cancelled over COVID-19 safety concerns. It was announced on April 15 the Maxville Fair had been cancelled. Every year, the Maxville Fair is the first to take place, setting the stage for other such fairs in Chesterville, South Mountain, Avonmore, Stormont and Williamstown. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Some SDG fairs already cancelled due to COVID-19 Back to video “I think this is the first time it’s been cancelled,” said Steve Rolland, president of the Maxville Fair’s board of directors. “It was a very hard decision to take. All the directors voted on it through email because we couldn’t get together.” During an interview with the Standard-Freeholder, Rolland said the difficult decision was made in order to protect local residents who take part in the fair. “We actually start planning the fair before April,” Rolland said. “That’s why we took the decision to cancel it this year. This whole pandemic doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Our fair is based on our community.

Article content “We didn’t want anyone getting sick.” Despite the cancellation of the 132 year-old fair, the president expressed hope for the future,. “We’re going to plan for 2021,” Rolland said. “We’re going to try and overcome this and try to make it better for next year. We’re not sure how this is going to affect next year’s fair, but hopefully the sponsors and everyone else understand.” The Avonmore Fair also recently announced its board of directors had taken the decision to cancel this year’s edition. This year’s fair would’ve taken place in July and would’ve marked the 160th anniversary of the event. “The decision to cancel our fair, like many fair boards are having to consider, was not an easy one,” read a statement on the fair’s website. “2020 marks our 160th year and we were excited to share it with you. Instead, we will celebrate it at our fair in 2021. We appreciate the hard work of our volunteers, as well as the support of our community and we are looking forward to the 2021 Avonmore Fair.” The president of the Williamstown Fair said its board had not yet made up his mind regarding the possible cancellation of the event. Williamstown is the longest-running fair in Ontario, spanning over 200 years. This year, it is slated to take place from Aug. 7-9. “While preparations have started, we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic situation at this time,” said president Mike Seguin. “We know that some people are wondering whether there will be a fair this summer. Although it is not business as usual, we believe that it is premature to make a decision on the fate of this year’s fair.

This includes the South Mountain Fair. The Mountain Township Agricultural Society, which organizes the latter, remained optimistic. The board had yet to cancel the event scheduled from Aug. 13-16, stating it was still evaluating all the factors that might impact holding the event. It also cited that it was awaiting further guidance from government and public health officials before making a decision. The Chesterville Fair, which is set to take place from Aug. 26-28, as well as the Stormont County Fair, to take place from Sept. 4-7, had also not issued any announcements as of Thursday. fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

For the pilot accelerator, it has selected 11 startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

The program, which has been moved online for the time due to the pandemic, which run for 5 months, beginning from April 21.

Due to the current corona crisis all physical elements (e.g. workshops, events) of the program have been transformed into a virtual version in order to support both the startups and the people behind them. All 11 finalists will now have access to a five-months accelerator program provided by Google for Startups. Google

Out of the 11 startups selected, mDoc, a Nigerian healthcare startup that uses technology to make health services more accessible to people is one.

Here is what mDoc does

mDoc provides 24 hours support to people in sub-Saharan Africa with chronic diseases. It does this by connecting people through a virtual network to healthcare service providers using its app.

Through its tech platform, mDoc has a secured centralized repository of users’ healthcare information and uses it to connect them to various practitioners such as nutritionists and coaches.

The experts, in turn, help users with their health goals. They also help people find quality in-person healthcare when needed.

mDoc’s geo-coded database of healthcare providers makes it easy for users to access quality health care from different parts of Africa using their health information which can be updated and monitored on mDoc’s app.

Why was mDoc selected?

Besides its laudable operations and using tech to deliver quality services, the health startup was selected because its services align with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined by the United Nations.

By tackling the problem of access to quality healthcare and support for people with chronic disease, mDoc is working to realize SDG number 3 in Africa.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3

As a part of the accelerator, mDoc will work with Google engineers. The startup will equally have access to mentoring from over 20 teams at Google, as well as outside experts and local mentors.

Roumeliotis leads 2019 Sunshine List for Cornwall/SDG Back to video Leading the pack at the City of Cornwall level is chief administrative officer (CAO) Maureen Adams, who made $219,383 in 2019. That compared to a wage of $205,968 in 2018. Cornwall’s general manager of planning, development and recreation Mark Boileau, was the second-highest local municipal earner, making $164,424, as opposed to $161,582 he made in 2018. The city’s general manager of corporate services, Geoff Clarke, earned $164,424 in 2019, as opposed to $160,059 in 2018. The fourth-highest earning administration employee for 2019 was Tracey Bailey, the city’s general manager of financial services and treasurer, who received $154,060, higher than her $142,559 wage in 2018. Cornwall’s manager of employee relations Bruce Donig, earned $138,721 in 2019, whereas he earned $134,156 in 2018. Part of his increase is due to when he accepted the position, with 2019 being the first full year he was working in employee relations.

Article content The 2019 list revealed some of Cornwall’s top earners, such as Adams, Clarke and Bailey, received an increase to their salaries that was higher than the 1.9 per cent provided to the employees represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees in 2019. Management wage increases are often tied to what the city’s unionized workers receive. According to Clarke, the management salary grid also echoes the one in union agreements. Which means, not just the annual cost-of-living bump, but also additional pay after a certain amount of time on the job. “We give everybody the same increase as the union had,” he told the Standard-Freeholder. “The increases you see are promotional grid steps. If I make $20 this year and my next step is $22, but it’s a 1.9 per cent increase, it’s $22 plus the 1.9 per cent increase. “What you see is somebody progressing through their pay band.” More On This Topic Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Cornwall/SDG 2018 Sunshine list The 2019 sunshine list also featured several members of the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the Cornwall Fire Services. Cornwall Police Chief Danny Aikman topped the list for first responders, earning $206,095 last year, as opposed to $183,346 in 2018. The 2019 year was his first full year as chief of police, the difference in earning reflecting his promotion. Another promoted officer, Deputy Chief Shawna Spowart, earned $173,226 in 2019, whereas she had made $151,872 in 2018.

Rather, it was Captain Rejean Quenneville, who earned $163,310, considerably more than his 2018 earnings — $109,381. “There has been promotions and some overtime,” said Fire Chief Pierre Voisine. Overall, 54 of the Cornwall Fire Service’s 64 employees earned enough to land on the Sunshine list, reflecting the current agreement and pay scales. Within the Cornwall Police Service, 70 of the service’s 89 sworn officers earned enough to hit the Sunshine list.

“Our first goal is to keep more ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve,” said Lister. “The loose prediction is that we will need seven new ambulances on the road to keep up with the curve.”

He explained that this would bring the total number of ambulances on the road in the region to 14, though he added he would be more comfortable with 17.

That being said, Lister also explained that overall, his service was seeing a lower call volume than is typical for this time of year. He said that for the past week, his service was receiving around 40 calls a day, and that normal levels were around 50.

Lister credited the cancellation of elective surgeries by hospitals, and the provincial and local orders to self-isolate, keeping people at home and out of danger.

On Friday, April 3, in a teleconference with local media, Chief Lister said that his service was expecting and preparing for a spike in call volumes related to COVID-19.

“We are expecting call volume to climb dramatically in the next few weeks and months,” said Lister. “We are preparing to meet that demand, but we need the support, understanding, and patience of residents.”

In addition to adding more ambulances to the road, Lister said that he also planned on hiring another 12 to 20 part-time paramedics to supplement the 66 full-time and 54 part-time paramedics already on staff.","CORNWALL, Ontario – Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services Chief Bill Lister told Cornwall City Council during a Special Meeting on Tuesday, April 7 that his goal was to get seven more ambulances on the road to deal with any future spike in COVID-19 cases in the region.

North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban. . . we recognize that many (residents) are eager to resume burning for both agricultural and recreational purposes.”

Meanwhile, in South Stormont, Fire Chief Gilles Crepeau partially lifted the total burn ban for agriculturally-zoned properties only, effective 12 p.m. Friday, in an effort to allow farmers to prepare for the upcoming planting season.

Effective Thursday, the one in North Glengarry, which had been put in place April 3, was lifted.

Total burn bans, implemented to prevent unneeded firefighting calls in the age of COVID-19, are slowly starting to lift.

“We need your help to keep our community safe,” he said.

All open air burns must be monitored at all times, and burning noxious materials – including plastics, tires, garbage and construction materials – is not permitted.

In South Stormont, where there’s a partial lifting of the burn ban, all agriculturally-zoned permit holders must contact Crepeau at 613-534-8889 ext. 250, or at gilles@southstormont.ca, for authorization prior to any burns. Those planning agricultural burns that do not have a permit can download the application and drop the application off at the dropbox outside the main entrance of town hall in Long Sault, along with a cheque for the $10 permit fee.

Those applying for a new permit must also contact the chief for authorization to burn prior to any burning. Each property requires its own permit, and must follow the bylaw.

Crepeau said the township burn ban for recreational fires and open-air burning on properties not zoned agricultural remains in place and will be reviewed on a week-to-week basis. Should any restrictions be lifted or reduced, an announcement will be made.

“I want to do it in stages,” Crepeau told the Standard-Freeholder on Friday. “I know people are getting anxious. I respect that everyone the last six or seven weeks has accumulated (a lot of burn items), and people want to have something to do – they want to have a bonfire.

“I think any week now, we’ll (have a full) lift.”

But, the chief said, it’s been a dry season, and with a high risk of grassfires, at this time, this year, only a partial lift makes sense. A lot of the decision will be weather-based, he said, but in the meantime, prior to a full lift, and because offices and processing times are different, it’s a good idea to submit applications now, or soon, so that “when (the ban is) lifted you’ll already have your permit,” Crepeau suggested.

Outside of those two townships, it’s best to check with your local municipality on whether any outdoor burns are permitted— including the City of Cornwall, where there is no open-air burn bylaw in place, so provincial regulations apply.","North Glengarry Fire Chief Matthew Roy in a township news release said “we’d like to thank our residents for supporting our local firefighters during the burn ban.

Of 61 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, a multi-coloured map indicated 36 have been in Prescott-Russell, 15 in SDG and 10 in Cornwall, the numbers as of noon on Wednesday.

Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Back to video That Prescott-Russell has the highest number does not come as a surprise to Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, the medical officer of health who in his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon said that county has 92,000 residents – more than twice the population of Cornwall, and about 28,000 more than in SDG – many living in close proximity to Ottawa, where COVID-19 has been very prevalent. “Many people who live in Prescott-Russell work in Ottawa,” the doctor said. The website presentation has several graphs and statistics, the EOHU saying it’s the most accurate information available from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS).

Article content Of the 61 cases, five people currently are hospitalized, with three in ICU. There’ve been 34 patients who’ve recovered. The latest release in the Ontario data indicated no increase in local positive cases between Monday and Tuesday, the number still at 61. Provincial data indicates three more cases are considered resolved, for a total of 45 in that category, although the total is different from the aforementioned EOHU data. Other information provided Wednesday by Roumeliotis included the two local cases involving health-care workers, who work in Ottawa. One was disclosed on March 22, a man in his 30s from Prescott-Russell who works at one of the campuses of the Ottawa Hospital. Nothing has been released about the other. Roumeliotis indicated there have not been any outbreaks at any long-term care facilities or retirement residences. More On This Topic Geographic COVID-19 case location information returning: EOHU EOHU data updated Monday indicates 60 COVID-19 cases Province and EOHU showing different, changing COVID-19 data Responding to a question as to whether he believes schools could be open later this spring, possibly in June, the doctor said “I’m not sure, it’s hard to say.” He said that with the province’s emergency measures extended into mid-May, and with it unknown as to whether it would be further extended, or what size of gatherings would be permitted, it would be “touch and go” as to whether kids would physically be back in school this spring.

Article content Roumeliotis said he expects there’ll be eventually a gradual progression in the loosening of social measures, including larger crowd sizes, but that “I don’t believe we’ll be in a state of normalcy before the late fall, and maybe not until the early winter.” Asked if there could be an emergency curfew put in place, as is the case in Akwesasne, Roumeliotis said it’s a possibility, if physical distancing and other measures weren’t being followed, and the number of COVID-19 cases began rising to the point it overwhelmed hospitals. “(A curfew is) on the table, it’s something we’ve discussed as our next step (aimed at) curtailing gatherings,” he said. “If we feel that measures need to be taken, they’ll be taken.” Roumeliotis said the number of tests done at assessment centres in the region is at just about the 800 mark. The breakdown is as follows: Hawkesbury 292; Cornwall 198; Casselman 165; Rockland 90; Winchester 51. The doctor said about half of the tests have results that are known, and that those still pending should have results come in “in the next day or so.” One graph on the EOHU website for cumulative total confirmed cases in the region, after having an upward curve for most of mid-March into early April, has levelled off over the last handful of days. Responding to whether he expects another surge, Roumeliotis said “it’s hard to say, (but) I hope not. I think what we are trying to do now is level it off. . . we’re having the odd case here, a case there, but it’s a manageable number. Our hospitals are indeed still coping.”

A lot of public spaces and walking trails are closed, but there are still opportunities in the region for people to get out and stretch their legs.

The Raisin Region Conservation Authority, as part of its response to COVID-19, closed the Gray’s Creek Marina, including access to docks and the boat launch until further notice, but the public can still enjoy its network of nature trails, at the conservation area and also at the Cooper Marsh Conservation Area and Charlottenburgh Park.

The RRCA is continuing to require visitors to practise physical distancing, avoid gathering in groups, and refrain from touching common surfaces.

A number of activities, of course, had to be cancelled, including the popular annual Raisin River Canoe Race the RRCA organizes.

But, some services have continued, including the spring seedling sale. The RRCA before Easter weekend noted there were still a limited number of white pine and white spruce seedlings available for order, and those who purchased tree seedlings will be contacted soon, with information on the pickup date, along with the precautionary measures in place to ensure staff and customer safety.","Walking trails accessible over much of the Cornwall/SDG regionArticle contentThe simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

The number of people suffering hunger has increased, climate change is occurring faster than predicted, and inequality is increasing within and among countries, António Guterres says in his ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ 2020 report.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched four years ago to address the most pressing global needs for a sustainable future, including education and health improvements and reductions in social and economic inequalities.

“I think [food price rises are] probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before. It’s like having an emergency in every single country.” Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy, WFP

“The effects of the pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact have overwhelmed the health systems globally, caused businesses and factories to shut down and severely impacted the livelihoods of half of the global workforce,” he says in the report.

It comes on top of an existing slowing in progress towards many of the SDGs, and Guterres had launched a Decade of Action in September to turn things around.

The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The report has been released ahead of UN Economic and Social Council high-level meetings scheduled for July to provide a global, data-driven overview of the SDGs.

Women and girls

Last year’s report had already warned that there was “simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls”.

In the 2020 review, Guterres says “the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled”.

Only half of the world’s women who are married or ‘in-union’ make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, based on 2007-2018 data from 57 countries, the report says.

Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.

More than 260 million children were out of school in 2017 and 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in 2018.

As of 2019, less than half of primary and lower secondary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, computers, the internet and basic handwashing facilities, the report states.

Billions of people worldwide still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, including 2.2 billion people without safe drinking water.

And, the world is projected to miss the target to end poverty in all its forms as hunger increased for the fourth consecutive year and about 50 million children experienced acute undernutrition. Globally, 144 million children under five were still affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters of these children in Central and Southern Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.

Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

“The SDGs reflected the political will of the time,” she says. “Today, in the midst of this pandemic, I think it’s safe to say global political will is in short supply.”

Food crisis

Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in institutions and development at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), says he is sceptical of suggestions in the report that progress has been made on poverty, because the quality of data from national governments has become worse.

He says that wage protections and labour rights need to be made into political issues to ensure they stay on governments’ radars.

“COVID-19 is going to make questions of hunger much worse,” Sinha says. “People are talking about a global response in terms of a vaccine, I think we should pay attention to those who are talking about a global response to the coming food crisis.”

The SDG progress report comes after the United Nations predicted last week that the COVID-19 crisis could push 130 million more people into poverty in the next 10 years.

About 35 million people are expected to fall below the extreme poverty line this year as a result of the pandemic, with 56 per cent of them in Africa, the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2020 report predicted.

The global economy is forecast to lose a staggering US$8.5 trillion in production over the next two years due to the pandemic, the UN report says.

This is a “tremendous setback” for sustainable development, Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, told SciDev.Net.

“[The pandemic] is particularly affecting the more vulnerable groups … because these are the ones whose activities generally require some form of physical proximity to others.”

Remittances

Remittances from migrant workers in the global North could face a hit – in countries such as Haiti, South Sudan and Tonga, remittances constitute more than a third of gross domestic product.

“You have an abrupt cut of people’s livelihoods and incomes, and then you’ve got different kinds of cascading effects through the bigger food system,” says Sophia Murphy, senior specialist in agriculture, trade and investment at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

There are also fears about what the pandemic could mean for long-term food security, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) estimating that 130 million more people in low- and middle-income countries may be pushed into acute food insecurity this year.

Bumper crops in some regions are at risk of being wasted. India has been hit by COVID-19 at harvest time, with crops left unpicked and difficulties getting grain to market for sale before it spoils.

This comes after rising hunger in the three years to 2018 pushed undernourishment back to levels seen around 2010.

Evidence of price rises has already emerged. In Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo, the WFP notes a 10 per cent surge in the price of a typical local basket of food – comprising fish, pulses, peanut paste, cassava flour, oil and condiments – in the space of two weeks.

The organisation expects food price rises to occur more widely, as this is happening in countries such as Syria, where prices have more than doubled in the past year.

“I think it’s probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before,” says Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy at the WFP’s London office.

“It’s like having an emergency in every single country that you’re working in.”

Some countries are already reeling from other problems, such as the locust swarms in East Africa, leading to potentially “devastating” impacts, she adds.","The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.
Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.
Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

116,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/countries-preparing-for-unea-5-stockholm50/,"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Countries Preparing for UNEA-5, Stockholm+50","The UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Committee of Permanent Representatives held a virtual meeting to “continue the business of environmental governance.” The Committee discussed plans for the fifth UNEA session, which is scheduled to take place in February 2021. They also agreed on UNEA’s input to the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and considered the way forward on the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, in 2022.

At the 150th meeting of the CPR on 30 April 2020, the UNEP Secretariat updated the CPR on preparations for UNEA-5. The session will have the theme, ‘Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.’ It is expected to convene in Nairobi, Kenya, from 22-26 February 2021.

The Secretariat described the session’s expected strategic and thematic elements, which include:

Agreement by the multilateral community on four areas for transformative action for nature to achieve the SDGs: Action area 1: Nature for Jobs and Economic Prosperity Action area 2: Nature for Health Action area 3: Nature for Climate Action area 4: Nature for Sustainable Food Systems

The importance of communication to citizens, and plans for the ‘Actions #ForNature’ campaign that blends the World Environment Day ‘Time #ForNature’ campaign with the UNEA theme; and

The relevance of the UNEA-5 theme in the era of COVID-19, in light of the need for urgent, transformative, and sustained actions to “deliberately reshape humanity’s interaction with nature,” including by re-building economies in ways that address systemic threats to nature (e.g. unsustainable consumption and production, rapid urbanization, weaknesses in governance and accountability).

Committee members pointed to UNEA-5 as an opportunity to provide global political leadership towards a sustainable recovery post COVID-19 and to other global sustainable development processes, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, such as by centering COVID-19 recovery plans around investments in nature and green jobs, sustainable finance, sound chemicals management, and sustainable production and consumption.

Ahead of the July 2020 session of the HLPF, the CPR agreed to submit the UNEA input developed through remote negotiations and silence procedure. The input to HLPF reports that: “January 2020 was the hottest month of January ever recorded, one million species may be pushed to extinction in the next few years and air pollution kills millions of people every year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that the world is currently facing, and its immediate aftermath, are likely to place additional strains on the environment.” Moreover, “the climate, biodiversity and chemicals crises have not disappeared [and] the world can ill-afford delays in key environment-related decision-making and investment.”

The UNEA recommends that the 2020 HLPF, among other items:

call for ambition in the 2020 environmental negotiations whose success will be crucial for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda including the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the international sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020;

stress that COVID-19 does not provide a “silver lining” for the environment but offers an opportunity for rebuilding the world better through green and sustainable recovery efforts, sound management of hazardous medical, and chemical waste and a clear commitment to “building back better”;

recognize the role of regional level coordination as key to address transboundary issues and facilitate regionally coherent approaches; and

acknowledge the request made to the UNEP Executive Director to develop a global environmental data strategy by 2025 and ask other UN entities to contribute to the strategy.

On commemorating the 50th anniversary of UNEP, in 2022, the Committee discussed Sweden’s offer to host a high-level political meeting in Stockholm to commemorate the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment. The CPR asked the UNEA secretariat to prepare a report on substantive aspects of preparations for the 50th anniversary.

In his statement to the 150th meeting, CPR Chair Fernando Coimbra (Brazil) said “the environmental agenda remains one of our most powerful insurance policies in preventing future global pandemics like COVID-19.” He added, “we have learnt the hard way that environmental protection is not a luxury,” but essential for growth and protection of vulnerable populations.

He highlighted that the COVID-19 medical emergency is resulting in a rapid increase in medical and hazardous waste. The UNEP framework ‘Towards a Pollution-Free Planet’ agreed at UNEA-4 provides support for Member States to address capacity gaps in medical waste systems in order to minimize possible secondary impacts on health and the environment.

The Chair also recalled that a “prescient” UNEP report from 2016 found that 60% of all known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. In other words, COVID-19 is just one of many diseases now known to have crossed between animals and humans. Currently, he said, UNEP is mapping the links between deteriorating ecosystem health, habitat and biodiversity loss, and over-exploitation of species. This will allow for policies to interrupt the zoonotic transmission pathways and provide “safe operating space” for nature, to prevent future pandemics.

Coimbra stressed that an ambitious, measurable and inclusive Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as The Beyond 2020 Chemicals and Waste Management Framework, because both play a central role in keeping nature intact, diverse and flourishing. Finally, he said the postponement of the next UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) is as an opportunity to strengthen NDCs by incorporating recovery efforts and climate-friendly investments to stimulate economies, build resilience, and create green and sustainable job opportunities.

The dialogues gather UN Member States, civil society, and UN representatives for off-the-record discussions, in parallel to the ongoing intergovernmental consultations on the declaration.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the declaration – Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden – issued an “elements paper” on 9 April. The paper proposes the declaration contain three sections: Acknowledging achievements and looking ahead; Delivering on commitments and responding to global challenges; and Building consensus and mobilizing for change.

In 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature.

The first dialogue in the series took place on 23 April with a focus on ‘Acknowledging Achievements and looking ahead,’ the first section of the elements paper. According to the discussion summary, this dialogue gathered 157 representatives from 19 UN Member States and over 100 civil society organizations. The discussion highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic represents the clearest example of several, intersecting global crises. It points to the need to strengthen multilateralism and address mistrust.

Participants noted that in 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature. It was emphasized that inclusion is “not solely for representation,” since one group’s advancement should lead to the advancement of all. Similarly, national sovereignty itself should be re-evaluated. No country is autonomous in this interdependent world, participants emphasized, and addressing problems globally is in the best interest of all.

Building on this idea, the declaration should propose that the UN no longer function to find equilibrium among competing national interests, but strive to replace an intergovernmental approach with a supranational one. Other proposals included:

Establish a post-2020 process to consider and implement recommendations for reform.

Re-evaluate process for reaching consensus, to ensure a “recalcitrant few” cannot hold back a vast majority.

Consider possible formats for a UN Parliamentary Assembly.

The second dialogue, on 30 April, took up the declaration’s possible section on ‘Delivering on Commitments and Responding to Global Challenges,’ which is expected to contain the most substantive, practical proposals, and serve as the primary vehicle to lay out a plan for the future of the UN. The third dialogue in the series will convene on 7 May, to address ‘Building consensus and mobilizing for change.’ This section is meant to serve as the call to service for the governments of the world.

The co-facilitators of the intergovernmental consultations plan to share a zero draft of the declaration in early May 2020. The consultations are taking place via written comments. A virtual informal consultation will be convened to discuss the zero draft later in May 2020.

The survey will remain open until 31 July 2020.

The Campaign for a Decade of Accountability is a multi-stakeholder partnership to aims to “bolster concerted action and amplify efforts to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development in a coordinated manner.” Advisory Group members to the Campaign include the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), the UN Global Compact, and World Vision. The Campaign is complementary to the UN’s Decade of Action and Delivery for the SDGs.

Survey respondents are asked to: rank specific challenges to accountability for the SDGs in their country, and indicate support needed to address them; comment on expected impacts of COVID-19 on SDG accountability in their country; share information on their country’s platforms enabling stakeholders to engage with the SDG accountability; and how global processes can help to advance SDG accountability. The survey also requests examples and case studies on specific actions that have been undertaken to enhance SDG accountability.

Inputs collected through the survey will feed into the forthcoming ‘Global SDG Accountability Report’ with recommendations for advancing accountability for the 2030 Agenda. The survey is available in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish.

Also on advancing accountability, the Transparency, Accountability and Participation (TAP) Network and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) launched a publication analyzing how nine countries’ voluntary national reviews (VNRs) have addressed SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), in comparison with how civil society reports have done so, over a two-year period. The publication provides recommendations for stakeholders to enable stronger and more inclusive reporting for SDG 16 in subsequent reporting cycles, including:

Integrate findings from civil society reports into VNR reports;

Scale up reporting, monitoring, and review of SDG 16-related actions, such as: measures to mainstream SDG 16 into development plans, collection and use of data, including non-official sources, and targeted policies with a focus on leaving no one behind;

Establish platforms for civil society representatives to regularly engage with government on issues relevant for sustainable development;

Use existing platforms (HLPF, regional economic commissions’ fora for sustainable development, expert group meetings on specific SDGs) to encourage dedicated awareness raising, peer exchange and global learning; and

Increase comparability of civil society reports, possibly through templates and other guidance.

An Assessment of VLRs to Date,"There are only ten years left to deliver the 2030 Agenda. However, as speakers and reports prepared for the 2019 SDGs Summit clearly demonstrated, we are not progressing fast enough. To increase momentum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres inaugurated the ‘Decade of Action’ in January 2020. The Decade is built on three levels of action—global action, local action, and people action—to accelerate progress on the SDGs.

Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) could be an important vehicle to accelerate ‘local action’. Four VLRs were launched during the July 2018 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – by Kitakyushu, Shimokawa, and Toyama in Japan, and New York City in the US. These VLRs have ignited enthusiasm among other cities.

Building on these efforts to localize the SDGs and to further our contribution to the “Decade of Action,” the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) has released two complementary publications to highlight and support the work of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) in implementing the 2030 Agenda:

The “State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs” is a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020.

“The Shimokawa Method for Voluntary Local Review: A Blueprint for Localising the SDGs” is a method on how to conduct a VLR based on Shimokawa’s experience.

We understand the VLR as a process in which LRGs voluntarily review and follow-up implementation of the SDGs. This process becomes a vehicle for sharing experiences, challenges and lessons learnt, as well as to open avenues for new partnerships to address any current shortcomings LRGs might confront. It can also enable LRGs to engage communities in the process, thereby strengthening the accountability and inclusiveness of their policymaking.

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report analyzes the 16 VLRs that had been identified as of February 2020. Of these “first generation” VLRs, four were launched in 2018, ten in 2019, and two in 2020 (all are available at the VLR Lab, here). After summarizing the main characteristics of the 16 VLRs, this report focuses on two crucial aspects of conducting a local review: the level to which the VLR process engages with stakeholders, and the alignment of the VLR with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process. The report reviews the impressive number of commitments and actions that are already underway at the local level, details which are often missing in VNRs.

The comparative analysis of VLRs revealed that conducting a VLR can unlock meaningful opportunities for cities and regions. In particular, a VLR: 1) allows the local government to listen to the needs of its people and reflect them into local policymaking; 2) invites self-reflection; 3) provides for a process that is data-driven and can be used to plan for action to achieve the future we want; and 4) gives a local take on the global conversation on sustainable development. Altogether, these opportunities can lead to transformation. The report also found that the majority of the first generation of VLRs have focused chiefly on aligning the SDGs with local policies, but have not explicitly included a stakeholder engagement process, with notable exceptions being Shimokawa, Manheim, and New Taipei.

In the conclusion of the report, we emphasized the need to envision the next generation of VLRs. The next generation should maximize the meaningful opportunities provided by the VLR process, as identified in the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report, to capture all its benefits. We suggest that these opportunities will only be fully crystalized once the current approach is changed.

A key recommendation for maximizing these benefits is to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the VLR process, and to enable this engagement to be thorough and self-organised. In the case of Shimokawa, a community-led platform with staff from all bureaus of the town hall developed the new 2030 vision, fully embracing the SDGs. This vision then guided Shimokawa’s comprehensive plan (the highest level of planning), and contributed to fostering ownership of the town vision and plan. In addition, Shimokawa specifically tried to engage communities during the action-plan setting phase and helped establish an implementation platform that could mobilize different stakeholders for different community-led initiatives.

This planning process was built on “backcasting,” an approach that identifies a desirable outcome and then walks backwards to find measures to reach the final destination. The case of Shimokawa demonstrates that this approach enables a more robust, transformative policy process than through the use of forecasting, while also allowing for continuously revisiting the vision initially set if the circumstances change.

The report on the Shimokawa Method for VLRs builds on the mechanism used in the Shimokawa case, translating it into ten practical and straightforward steps, This report also incorporates findings from the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report and contains a guide for “VLR format” to which cities can refer as they construct their own VLRs.

The Next Generation of VLRs

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report presents an assessment of the currently available VLRs, while the Shimokawa Method report provides a handbook for implementing VLRs. These two documents seek to pave the way for improving the VLR process. While many internal areas of improvements related to VLRs can be addressed by using the Shimokawa method, more must be done. In particular, when looking to increase the global and national impact of VLRs, cities must strive to integrate their VLRs with their national VNR processes, so that a country can address territorial challenges and scale up successful local solutions.

The principles that underlie the 2030 Agenda resonate strongly with the ongoing global crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic is reminding humanity that society as a whole is as vulnerable as its most vulnerable people. It also brings into sharp focus the ramifications of inequality at many levels. These challenges cannot be suddenly alleviated during the crisis. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.” Recovery must go beyond “returning” and aim to “Build Back Better”, anchored in leaving no one and no place behind. VLRs can be instrumental to this end, building resilience and transforming our cities.

SDG officially releases their new Bel-Air V3 saddle

Intense and GT were early adopters of the Bel-Air, along with the Honda G-Cross Team, pictured here using the first Bel-Air I-Beam version.

Back in 2005 the Pinkbike DH Team ran animal print Bel-Air saddles

What Has Changed Then?

- Shorter and Slimmed Down Profile:

I’ve ridden SDG saddles and almost every Bel-Air model since the early 2000s. The new V3 is slimmed down and hugely versatile. I now run it across the board, including my slalom bike, trail bike, long travel and ebike. — Kyle Strait

I’m proud of the new Bel-Air V3. Understanding our roots, it was important for us to keep the heritage of the Bel-Air alive. My team and I worked tirelessly to further enhance and I strongly believe that the new Bel-Air V3 will continue to keep riders satisfied in the saddle for another decade. — Tyler Anspach (SDG Owner)

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles. The SDG Bel-Air V3 extends premium craftsmanship across the full lineup and hits several price points thanks to several rail material options.

While the meetings spanned energy, agriculture, digital economy, labor and employment, tourism, and trade and investment, the standout theme across all tracks was COVID-19, the impacts of the pandemic, and the G20’s response.

Meetings convened in the latter half of the month produced statements that focus exclusively on the issue, acknowledging COVID in the title. Several note that the respective groups of ministers stand ready to “convene again as necessary,” indicating that the pandemic and shift to a virtual meeting format may lead to more frequent discussions.

A Statement issued by the Trade and Investment Ministers of the G20 following their virtual meeting on 30 March describes COVID-19 as requiring “a coordinated global response.” It notes that the G20 Leaders, following their Extraordinary Meeting held on 26 March, committed “to presenting a united front against this common threat.” The Statement highlights the Ministers’ work to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies, agricultural products, and other essential goods and services across borders. It underscores concern for developing countries, emphasizing least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) and the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable workers and businesses. The Statement commits Trade and Investment Ministers “to work together to deliver a free, fair, nondiscriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment” and keep global supply chains functioning.

Trade impacts are also recognized in the Statement issued following the Extraordinary Agriculture Ministers Meeting held virtually on 21 April. The Ministers “acknowledge the challenges of minimizing the risk of COVID-19 while keeping food supply chains functioning.” They reaffirm the importance of “the continued flow of food, products, and inputs essential for agricultural and food production across borders.” They further agree – like the Trade and Investment Ministers – that emergency measures taken in response to COVID-19 must not create unnecessary barriers and must remain consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The Statement commits to reinforcing international cooperation and to guarding against unjustified restrictive measures that could lead to excessive food price volatility in international markets or threaten food security.

Emergency measures taken in response to COVID-19 must not create unnecessary barriers and must remain consistent with WTO rules.

A press release on the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting notes that while normally held in the margins of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group (WBG) Spring Meetings – on which SDG Knowledge Hub coverage is here – participants instead convened virtually on 15 April.

A Communiqué from the meeting summarizes the Group’s “urgent collective priority” as overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and “its intertwined health, social and economic impacts.” Measures taken by finance ministers and central bank governors include actions on fiscal and monetary stability, as well as ensuring that International Financial Institutions (IFIs) can provide support to developing and low-income countries. The Comminqué endorses the G20 Action Plan in response to COVID-19, including a financial response that, inter alia: delivers a comprehensive IMF support package; implements the support proposed by the WBG and multilateral development banks (MDBs) amounting to more than USD 200 billion; addresses debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries due to the pandemic; and enhances coordination among international organizations to maximize impact and optimize the use of resources.

Other meetings’ statements also link back to trade and the international disruption wrought by COVID-19:

The Extraordinary G20 Digital Economy Ministerial Meeting, held virtually on 30 April, released a COVID-19 Response Statement that emphasizes the role of digital technologies in response to the pandemic. The Statement highlights, inter alia, the importance of: communication infrastructure and network connectivity; secure data exchange; research and development of new health technologies; and the leveraging of digital technologies to promote international trade cooperation and maintain the stability of global supply chains, including through e-commerce and the digital supply of services.

The G20 Labor and Employment Ministers’ Statement on COVID-19 from the virtual meeting, held on 23 April, notes that workers are facing “elevated risks of job losses, reduced working hours, suspended employment relations and income loss” as a result of the pandemic. The Statement commits to a human-centered approach to promote employment, bolster social protection, stabilize labor relations, and ultimately minimize the impacts of COVID-19 on operations, resources, supply chains, and workforces.

The G20 Tourism Ministers’ Statement on COVID-19 from the virtual meeting, held on 24 April, estimates that a 45-70% decline in international tourism is expected for 2020, putting up to 75 million jobs at risk. The Ministers commit to working with relevant authorities “to ensure that the introduction and removal of travel restrictions are coordinated … and ensure the safety of travelers.” The Statement welcomes efforts by other working groups and further commits to “fostering innovation and digital technologies that enable sustainable practices and seamless travel.”

The G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting Statement from the virtual meeting, held on 24 April, laments that COVID-19 has “contributed to the destabilization of global oil and gas markets and compromises energy security for many nations.” The Ministers “recognize the vital role that well-functioning, stable, open, transparent and competitive energy markets play” in economic activity, and commit to ensuring “the uninterrupted flow of energy.”

In addition to the above statements’ calls for action on COVID-19, the Saudi G20 Presidency called for USD 8 billion, and pledged USD 500 million, to fight the pandemic.

The report has been prepared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

SDG 7

Sustainability

According to the report, significant progress had been made on various aspects of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 prior to the start of the COVID-19 crisis. This includes a notable reduction in the number of people worldwide lacking access to electricity, strong uptake of renewable energy for electricity generation, and improvements in energy efficiency.

Despite these advances, global efforts remain insufficient to reach the key targets of SDG 7 by 2030.

“Even before today’s unprecedented crisis, the world was not on track to meet key sustainable energy goals. Now, they are likely to become even harder to achieve. This means we must redouble our efforts to bring affordable, reliable and cleaner energy to all – especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need is greatest – in order to build more prosperous and resilient economies,” noted Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of IEA.

The number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 789 million in 2018, however, under policies that were either in place or planned before the start of the COVID-19 crisis, an estimated 620 million people would still lack access in 2030, 85% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. SDG 7 calls for universal energy access by 2030.

Other important elements of the SDG 7 goal also continue to be off track. Almost 3 billion people remained without access to clean cooking in 2017, mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Largely stagnant progress since 2010 leads to millions of deaths each year from breathing cooking smoke. The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is only inching up gradually, despite the rapid growth of wind and solar power in electricity generation.

An acceleration of renewables across all sectors is required to move closer to reaching the SDG 7 target, with advances in heating and transport currently lagging far behind their potential.

Following strong progress on global energy efficiency between 2015 and 2016, the pace has slackened.

The report says the rate of improvement needs to speed up dramatically, from 1.7% in 2017 to at least 3% in coming years.

Accelerating the pace of progress in all regions and sectors will require stronger political commitment, long-term energy planning, increased public and private financing, and adequate policy and fiscal incentives to spur faster deployment of new technologies an increased emphasis on “leaving no one behind” is required, given the large proportion of the population without access in remote, rural, poorer and vulnerable communities.

Riccardo Puliti, Global Director for Energy and Extractive Industries and Regional Director for Infrastructure in Africa at the World Bank, commented: “The report provides solid data and evidence that build the case for why it is necessary to act now, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where under the status quo, 530 million people–or more than two times the population of Nigeria–will still be without electricity in 2030.”

Moving towards the 2030 Agenda

The 2020 report introduces tracking on a new indicator, 7.A.1, on international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy.

Although total flows have doubled since 2010, reaching $21.4 billion in 2017, only 12% reached the least-developed countries, which are the furthest from achieving the various SDG 7 targets.

The five custodian agencies of the report were designated by the UN Statistical Commission to compile and verify country data, along with regional and global aggregates, in relation to the progress in achieving the SDG 7 goals.

“This report is an exemplar case of cooperation between the custodian agencies of SDG 7 to present comprehensive data and analysis, delivering a common message regarding the progress towards ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

As to the current situation, it concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic can either widen the sustainable energy access gaps or accelerate the path towards achieving SDG 7, depending mostly on priorities of national economic stimulus packages and the global response to support those most in need,” said Stefan Schweinfest, UNSD Director.

The report presents policymakers and development partners with global, regional and country-level data to inform decisions and identify priorities for a sustainable recovery from COVID-19 that scales up affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy.

This collaborative work highlights once more the importance of reliable data to inform policymaking as well as the opportunity to enhance data quality through international cooperation to further strengthen national capacities.

The report has been transmitted by SDG 7 custodian agencies to the United Nations Secretary-General to inform the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s annual review.

123,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-charts-businesses-path-through-covid-19-crisis/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ITC Charts Businesses’ Path Through COVID-19 Crisis,"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a 15-point action plan to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSMEs, the action plan notes, are “the driving force behind” many essential services in the pandemic. However, they are also particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of the crisis, especially in developing and transition economies. Beyond facing weaker consumer confidence and being overrepresented in the hardest-hit sectors such as retail trade, tourism, and personal and professional services, MSMEs have fewer assets, reduced access to credit, and a more challenging trade environment relative to large companies.

The plan for MSMEs is centered around five recommendations for businesses, five for business support organizations, and five for governments. An ITC news release featuring a consolidated set of recommendations reminds the reader in each of the three sections to both “prepare your immediate response to the crisis” and to “get ready for the ‘new normal’.”

Free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food.

The plan’s introduction highlights that the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates a decline in cross-border investment flows by up to 30-40% in 2020-2021. Accordingly, trade aspects feature prominently throughout the action plan, and are especially strong in the section for governments, though the plan emphasizes that governments, business support organizations, and small business alike should coordinate the immediate response in a collaborative manner. The plan calls on governments to implement support measures built around concessional financing, tax reductions and grants, employment incentives, and targeted interventions.

Resisting the allure of trade protectionism is paramount, the plan argues. It emphasizes that free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food. Thus, the plan also recommends that governments facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services, and streamline the movement of essential products by following best practices as outlined in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Actions include, inter alia: certificates for medical equipment and essential food items; enhanced border management coordination, for example between customs and sanitary authorities; special regimes for expedited clearance of certain goods; and accelerating clearance processes for trusted traders or authorized economic operators who respect health-related rules and regulations.

The plan also notes that governments can expand and facilitate access to trade finance for MSMEs, including those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The pandemic, the plan notes, has negatively impacted the availability of trade finance for small business due to higher liquidity costs and the perceived risk of short-term finance, leaving a void for governments to fill. The document notes that several economies have expanded short-term programmes that provide financial support to national exporters. Flagging that nearly all MSMEs rely on goods that have been sourced internationally, the plan stresses that now more than ever is the time “to conserve the links between small businesses and international markets.”

The plan underscores that trade documents and procedures can be digitalized in collaboration with the private sector, noting that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement encourages countries to introduce digital clearance processes. As noted above, such processes can simplify cross-border trade whilst limiting physical contact and in-person interactions. While the plan points to the private sector as having responsibility for digitalizing trade documents, it acknowledges that the onus is on governments to provide legal certainty that these documents will be recognized within their respective jurisdictions.

County elected officials and staff are taking part in the Regional Emergency Response Council’s program to pack and deliver 1,500 food hampers for seniors in Cornwall and the United Counties who can’t leave their homes.

The United Way/Centraide of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry and the members of the Regional Emergency Response Council were awarded $100,343.00, funded by the Government of Canada’s New Horizons for Seniors Program. The New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP) provides grants and contributions for projects that help improve the well-being of seniors and foster their social inclusion.

“We’re thrilled to be helping our partners to ensure that our most vulnerable are able to access food while remaining in lockdown,” said SDG Warden Frank Prevost, who joined his daughters in packing food hampers Thursday at the Benson Centre in Cornwall. “We also support other ongoing efforts to help our seniors and ensure they have access to programming to ease the burden of the coronavirus pandemic.”

County library staff have offered the use of its large delivery truck to help cart food hampers to strategic locales in SDG where the material is dispersed to those in need. Many local agencies, non-profits and charitable organizations such as the County, Carefor, Seaway Valley Community Health Centre, the City of Cornwall and the Service Clubs of Cornwall to expand the offer related to food access.

If you are a senior and need help accessing food during this crisis, a centralized phone referral program, which begins with a call to 2-1-1, will best guide them to the services that they may need during this crisis. A team of professionals will answer questions and ensure individuals are referred to the right food service, be it Foodbank, grocery delivery, Meals on Wheels, or the new emergency food hamper program that best fits current needs.","The United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry is pitching in to help a program that is feeding area seniors who have been shut-in as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAN) is preparing to open the region’s first virtual farmers market in collaboration with the City of Cornwall, United Counties of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry, United Counties of Prescott Russell, and several local farmers markets.

“We know residents across the region are looking to buy local food and support our many local producers,” said Alain D’Aoust, coordinator for the Eastern Ontario Agri-food Network. “By developing the virtual farmers market, coordinating local distribution to consumers, and promoting on behalf of all vendors, we believe this effort will be a win-win for everyone.”

The virtual farmers market is being developed using Local Line, a uniquely designed e-commerce tool for producers and agri-food vendors. The new website will feature a unique online store for each vendor, as well as a shared market store offering products from all 100 vendors. Consumers will be able to buy from any number of vendors at once, select the preferred delivery option, and pay online using a single point check-out. The software will immediately notify the vendor of the sale, identify the delivery point, and transfer the payment automatically.

“We wanted to make it as easy as possible for everyone,” said D’Aoust. “Consumers will be able to order from a full catalogue of products, manage their delivery options, and easily pay online.”

The EOAN plans to waive the monthly administrative fee from now until September.

“Thanks to sponsorship from local partners and surplus funds from last year’s Eastern Ontario Local Food Conference, we are able to focus our time on getting local producers online before the summer season without presenting any additional cost to their bottom line” said D’Aoust.

The formal vendor application will open at www.agro-on.ca on Tuesday, May 19.

“Paramedics have been testing vulnerable residents for COVID-19 through the Community Paramedicine Program since the beginning of the pandemic,” said Chief Bill Lister. “Paramedics who volunteered to be part of the response team received additional training and will proactively test groups identified by the Eastern Ontario Health Unit.”

The response team is testing staff members and residents in long-term care homes, as part of a provincewide initiative to proactively test residents in vulnerable areas, and can test other paramedics who become symptomatic.

“I’m proud to know paramedics are leading the way with proactive testing,” said Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement. “When we ask you to stay home, wash your hands, and respect restrictions, it’s with frontline workers like paramedics in mind. Together we are helping keep them safe while they do the essential work of testing for COVID-19.”

Cornwall-SDG Paramedics also decided to pay it forward to the Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU), after having received lunches from St. Joseph’s Continuing Care Centre.

On Friday, the paramedics, in partnership with CUPE Local 5734, donated lunches to EOHU staff members.

“Paramedics have felt so much support from our community in recent months,” said Lister. “In partnership with the union, our service is proud to be able to pay it forward.”

Deliveries were made safely, with physical distancing and a minimum number of staff involved.

“Paramedics have also challenged the Health Unit to pay it forward,” concluded Lister, a challenge the EOHU quickly accepted on Facebook.","Article contentResidents living in Cornwall and SDG long-term care homes are now being tested for COVID-19.

The top 12 nominated entrepreneurs will be able to pitch their products and solutions at the Summit, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021 during the Building Bridges Week and will get support to access strategic partners to scale up their venture.

According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.) to nominate from their own pipelines, up to 3 entrepreneurs which meet the eligibility criteria. Self nomination is not be accepted. The call will remain open till 15 July.

The call is for growth stage impact ventures for SDGs aimed at identifying and showcasing mature impact ventures in emerging countries with the catalytic potential to drive both large impact and yield sustainable profit.

The UNDP said 2020 the Call for Nominations only accepts Post Series A impact ventures providing products and services which reduce inequalities (with particular attention to gender inequalities) by providing solutions that empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to access to quality health, affordable and clean energy, and by reducing and recovering waste. Only ventures with headquarters, primary workforce and service provision or product market in developing countries can be eligible for the selection.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

In 2019, 76 third-parties submitted 119 proposals from 40 developing countries. Eighty-five percent of the nominated ventures had raised at least half a million dollars at the time of nomination, and closed their Series A. All 12 finalists were mid-sized, with an average of up to 50 employees, annual revenue of over US$3 million, and with a cumulative impact on more than 15 million lives through their products and services.

Today, 22nd May 2020, marks another globally important day for the reflection, appreciation and action towards securing our natural world and the diversity of plants and animals that thrive in it and are crucial for the survival of every person living on this earth.

This year’s theme ‘Our Solutions are in Nature’ is captured to reflect the fact that biodiversity still remains the answer to many of the sustainable development challenges that we all face. From nature-based solutions to climate change, to food and water security and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity remains the basis for a sustainable future. The recent global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystems services by the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services reports of mass extinctions that need our urgent action if we are to prevent a repeat of these crises.

The UN declared a decade of biodiversity from 2011 to 2020, which ends soon. Even as the quality of the environment continues to decline, we are called to rally in solidarity behind negotiations to work towards a strong Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. This is very urgent, as onset of Covid-19 pandemic demands that we re-examine the way we interact and use the natural world. Without doubt, the evidence points to the fact that, without the natural world, humans will cease to exist.

This important day also provides a crucial opportunity for Ghana to reflect on how we interact with the natural environment and plan for a sustainable future that prioritizes the wellbeing of nature and of every Ghanaian.

Ghana is endowed with rich natural resources and biological diversity from all corners of the country providing critical livelihood solutions to Ghanaians from all walks of life rich and poor. We can mention the many beautiful birds, butterflies, and other animals we see mostly in rural communities in areas set aside for the protection of forests and other biological assets such as the Achimota Forest in Accra, Atewa Forest close to Kyebi, Kakum National Park in the Central Region, Mole National Park in the Savanna Region as well as several sacred groves in the country serving important cultural, spiritual and aesthetic functions. We can also mention the Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, Sakumono Ramsar Site, Keta Lagoon and all the forests and wetlands providing important habitats for the protection of specific species and also providing crucial live support services to every Ghanaian.

The beautiful natural areas notwithstanding, we also observe many negative practices from individuals, companies, and state agencies that deplete or destroy or indirectly perpetuate acts that are incompatible with the wellbeing of some of these natural areas so crucial for our survival and sustainable development as a country.

Key issues of concern that need urgent attention are as follows:

The increasing incidence of mining in state gazetted forest reserves across the country from galamsey activities as well as state approved mining in areas set aside purposely for the protection of forests and the security of biological diversity. Forest reserves serve as important habitats that support a large diversity of plants and animals. Unfortunately, most forest reserves in Ghana’s high forest zone are under threat or pressure from mining activities and this needs to be addressed with all the urgency that the state can mobilize. Current attempts by government to turn critical biological hotspots like Atewa Range Forest Reserve into a bauxite mine is inimical to our commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and derails all efforts locally and globally to secure the wellbeing of our natural environment as a guarantee for our wellbeing.

The legal frameworks to support efforts by state and non-state actors in the protection of our natural areas remain limited. The Wildlife Resource Management Bill that empowers communities to participate in and benefit from the management of natural resources in community lands has been in and out of Parliament for more than 16 years now. Another republic is going to end and there is no clear evidence to show the bill will be passed before that time. When finally passed into law, it will also domesticate some key important biodiversity security and regulatory mechanisms such as the protection of migratory species, and entrench regulations that address the increasing incidence of illegal exploitation and trafficking of endangered species like pangolins, and restricted trade species like rosewood, and many others from Ghana.

All across the country, we see hope, the young ones, and the elderly trying hard to reconnect with nature, travelling to natural areas as much as possible. Domestic tourism to natural areas has surpassed international tourist visits compared to a decade ago. We have experiences where individuals are using their own money to purchase, rescue and set free illegally captured species along our highways. Several communities across the country are struggling to manage wildlife in their communities’ lands. These efforts are hampered by the continuous absence of key legislation to enhance enforcement and compliance of the protection of our natural areas and biological diversity, lack of enforcement of the laws that do exist, as well as the wanton destruction of our biological and natural areas that are essential for our wellbeing and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

As we celebrate and reflect on this important day now and for life after Covid-19, we cannot continue to watch and act with indifference and impunity as our natural world fades away without taking the necessary steps to address the challenges as mentioned above. We need to rededicate and commit to halt the destruction of forest reserves and biological diversity and pursue a development agenda that is founded on nurturing and safeguarding the natural world as an imperative.

World Biodiversity Day

The United Nations proclaimed May 22 The International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues.

When first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, 29 December (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity), was designated The International Day for Biological Diversity.

In December 2000, the UN General Assembly adopted 22 May as IDB, to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on 22 May 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

This was partly done because it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of 29 December, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year.

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

The UN Joint SDG Fund (the Fund) supports countries as they accelerate their progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Fund operates through a series of calls for the United Nations (UN) system that lead to the implementation of transformative Joint Programmes (JPs), under the leadership of Resident Coordinators (RCs). In doing so, the Fund is committed to forge paths and partnerships that unlock public and private capital for the SDGs at scale. All allocations made by the Fund will be in the form of grants to UN agencies.

This call operationalizes the following “Terms of Reference” of the Fund:

● Reinforce the SDG financing architecture (Component 1): The Fund will support UN Country Teams in the development of financing strategies and enabling frameworks for SDG investment. This work will include the strengthening of the capacities of the national and sub-national SDG financing architecture, piloting of integrated national financing frameworks, establishment of partnerships through convening networks and consortia comprised of actors from the public and private sector and the production of SDG-aligned financing strategies.

● Catalyze strategic investments (Component 2): The Fund will support UN Country Teams in investing in key initiatives that leverage public and private financing in order to advance the SDGs. These initiatives will provide a demonstration of concept and will be scalable both in country and elsewhere.

FINANCING THE AGENDA 2030: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

World leaders have made ambitious commitments to achieve the SDGs. Yet, securing enough resources remains a major challenge, with developing countries facing a gap estimated between US$2.5–3 trillion per year. Financing is theoretically available, given the size, scale and level of sophistication of the global financial system—with gross world product and global gross financial assets estimated at over US$85 trillion and US$ 200 trillion respectively. While the world has never been as rich as it is today, financial flows and wealth, mostly private, do not (or cannot) reach the geographies and people that need them the most.

There is no lack of opportunities to fill the gap and reorient public and private investment towards the SDGs.

SDGs are being increasingly integrated into public budgets and development cooperation. Despite growing concerns on public debts, the median tax revenue is growing in the developing world: 80 countries have reported an increase in their tax-to-GDP ratios in 2017. The digitalization of finance—or fintech—has opened new venues at a speed unimageable at the beginning of the new millennium.

Not only Governments, but also the financial markets and investors have positively reacted, by starting to demand and claim a stronger integration of the SDGs in public and private investment decisions. Commitments were supported by increasing evidence that investing in the SDGs makes economic sense, with an estimated US$12 trillion of market opportunities. Responsible investment strategies, from exclusion lists to impact investing, have grown to US$30.7 trillion in 2018. New markets and asset classes have emerged: the green bond market increased from virtually zero in 2010 to over US$200 billion in 2019. Despite opportunities, bottlenecks and intensified risks—from vulnerability to climate change and economic recessions to health epidemics—persist. Most private investments are not channeled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed required. SDG investment opportunities in many countries, such as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and fragile countries are underinvested.

Private investments in SDG-related infrastructure in developing countries were lower in 2018 than in 2012. The financing for the 2030 agenda is constrained by a range of challenges, including:

• Limited fiscal space and institutional capacity to formulate a pipeline of bankable SDG investment projects, and weak public finance management systems, notably in countries most at risk of being left behind.

• Weak tax collection systems and underperforming public finance management that result in reduced revenue generation and lower performance and budget execution, thus limiting the available space for increasing SDG-relating spending.

• Misaligned incentives and regulations, limited awareness, and difficulties in identifying, measuring and reporting on sustainable investments, which impede private investment in the SDGs at scale.

• Public planning and SDG-aligned strategies remain de-linked from financing and budgeting, leading to less effective spending and poor service delivery. The same strategies are also not designed to attract different sources of financing, including from the private and financial sectors.

• There is often a mismatch between what private “capital” wants and needs and the environment and bankability of businesses and projects that impact the SDGs.

• The lack of common definitions, impact measurement standards and rigorous frameworks for reporting are challenging the way impact is measured.","THE JOINT SDG FUNDThe UN Joint SDG Fund (the Fund) supports countries as they accelerate their progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

In the first article in this series, it was noted that the SDGs can help us chart a path out of the current socioeconomic crisis and into a more resilient and regenerative future. At this point you may be thinking: Our company has already figured out our SDG approach. Well, before you get too comfortable, not all SDG responses are created equal.

The Future-Fit team has examined hundreds of sustainability reports over the past few years, and we’ve found that business responses to the SDGs typically follow one of three patterns: Defensive, Selective or Holistic.

Image credit: Future-Fit Foundation

Defending the status quo merely justifies ‘business as usual’

The first pattern is to defend the status quo — to tell a story about what the company is already doing on topics relating to the SDGs, rather than seeking out opportunities to change.

For example, a company which already has a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions might claim it is aligned with SDG 13 – Climate Action. But most of today’s GHG targets fall far short of the rapid decarbonisation trajectory we need.

Or a company might say it is contributing to SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – merely because it is creating jobs. But what if those jobs pay less than a living wage, or if working conditions are so onerous that employee wellbeing suffers?

Emphasising storytelling over action merely justifies business as usual — which is what got us into this mess in the first place.

A defensive approach to the SDGs may appeal to CEOs who still believe in the primacy of shareholder value, whereby companies exist only to deliver financial returns. But defensive claims lack both ambition and authenticity, and only leave companies open to accusations of SDG-washing.

Any company taking a defensive route is unlikely to attract and retain great employees, loyal customers, and increasingly-concerned investors.

A selective response can be counterproductive

The second pattern is to consider just one or a few of the 17 SDGs.

This selective approach is akin to the notion of Creating Shared Value: focusing on areas where the company’s current business model already intersects with a societal need.

For example, a pharmaceutical company may choose to focus on SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being – by making medicines that help people to live productive lives. Such efforts may indeed make a genuine contribution to SDG 3 — if the medicines are affordable and accessible to those who need them most.

But is that enough? What if manufacturing the medicines uses huge amounts of fresh water, and the production takes place in a water-stressed area? For local communities in that region, the company may actually be undermining SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation.

And what if that same company can only bring its medicines to market profitably by relying on low-cost suppliers who aren’t paying their workers a living wage? In that case, the company’s success may actually be slowing down progress toward SDG 1 – No Poverty.

The reality, of course, is that today’s companies exist only as part of a complex value web that touches multiple, interlinked systems: markets, communities, ecosystems and so on.

In this sea of complexity, linear notions of cause and effect start to evaporate — and without careful consideration, any action in one area can lead to undesirable consequences elsewhere.

So, a selective approach to the SDGs can be counterproductive: Even the most well-meaning company might be inadvertently exacerbating one problem attempting to solve while another.

Are such trade-offs acceptable? Possibly, but how can we be sure if we do nothing to identify and measure them?

A holistic approach measures and mitigates trade-offs

That brings us to the third pattern: taking a holistic approach — one which considers all of a company’s SDG impacts, both positive and negative, across the company’s value web.

No business decision is ever free of trade-offs. But if we take a systems approach — by looking at all interactions between the company and its suppliers, its customers, other socioeconomic actors, and the environment — it is possible to identify otherwise unforeseen issues. Negative trade-offs across the company’s value web can then be anticipated and avoided — or at the very least mitigated.

This kind of systems approach to managing extra-financial performance is crucial, because positive and negative impacts almost never cancel each other out. Greenhouse gas emissions are an exception: a ton of CO2 emitted in Johannesburg may be ‘neutralised’ by a ton of CO2 drawn down from the atmosphere in Tokyo. But other kinds of impact — product waste, water stress, land use change, human rights violations — cannot typically be netted out, across time or location.

Gradual improvements in one area, and the expense of exacerbating problems elsewhere, aren’t going to bring the SDGs in reach. We must eliminate — and eventually reverse — all of the damage done to our natural systems and social fabric; and that means striving to maximise the good while working consciously, continuously and collectively to eliminate the bad. Such a holistic response is essential if we are to make the SDGs a reality.

We can think of this third option as striving to create not just shareholder value, or even shared value, but system value.

Take a minute to scan your last sustainability report’s CEO statement, and to peel back the glossy SDG infographics. Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is holistic? Are you committed to creating system value?

If the answer is yes, that’s fantastic — and I’d love to hear from you, because such examples are few and far between. And if you’re not so sure, maybe the Future-Fit Business Benchmark can help you get there. Take a look at our SDG Explorer, which explains what every company must strive to do, to be sure it in no way undermines our collective progress toward a resilient and regenerative future.","Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

Tiwana highlights the persistence of “MDG mindsets” and an increase in censorship and surveillance. He also suggests five ways to build a better post-pandemic world.

What have you observed about the SDG community’s responses to the pandemic?

Significant attention is being focused on the negative impacts of COVID-19, especially on impoverished and excluded communities. Important issues such as debt relief and financing for development have come to the fore. For example, the IMF announced immediate debt service relief for 25 countries in April, and further efforts are underway.

Yet, across the board, “MDG mindsets” remain stubbornly prevalent. The MDGs were weak in their comprehension of development by focusing on a small sub-set of rights. They were also charity-oriented in their approach, and reinforced top-down aid in the Global South.

The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential. However, five years since the passage of the SDGs, the impulse in many quarters is still to scale up existing approaches. A lot of the emphasis remains on “soft” communications and feel-good actions, rather than to push for fundamental changes in how our societies and economies function to better realize rights.

What impacts do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda?

COVID-19 could be a turning point. I have guarded optimism that we could overcome the paucity of ambition that has held us back from making transformative shifts.

COVID-19 has exposed and accelerated existing problems in our societies. Inequality, exclusion, and lack of voice were already marring progress on the 2030 Agenda. With COVID-19, the worst impacts are being felt by the disadvantaged as hunger and deprivation abound. Violence against women and excluded minorities has spiked. All of this is undermining the commitment to leave no one behind. Recent protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world highlight the importance of people’s participation for overcoming structural inequities and getting States to discharge their responsibilities to ensure proper health care, education, and access to justice for those most at risk. Thus, a silver lining has been renewed purpose among activists and civil society organizations to demand radical shifts to ‘leave no one behind.’

However, a less constructive trend has emerged as well. As public safety has taken center stage, censorship and surveillance have ramped up along with official propaganda. Many governments have sought to control the narrative about their pandemic response by clamping down on civic freedoms. Even before COVID-19 struck, only three percent of the world’s population lived in countries where the fundamental civic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association were adequately protected, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, our participatory research platform that measures civic space around the world.

There are worrying signs that COVID-19 emergency restrictions could be used as a smokescreen for a broader crackdown on dissent. The negative legacy of COVID-19 could last as long as the wave of dubious security measures passed in the wake of 9/11. This would undermine accountability for the 2030 Agenda.

Have any new lessons emerged that can inform plans and strategies to “build back better”?

Our vulnerabilities stand exposed by COVID-19. However, as we begin this Decade of Accountability for the SDGs (a multi-stakeholder campaign to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development), we still have an opportunity to build better forward by creating greener and fairer societies. In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.

First, civic freedoms and democratic rights are essential as our leaders are making life-or-death choices that could define the fate of generations. Concerned citizens, the media, and civil society organizations must have access to credible information and be able to exercise fundamental civic freedoms, in order to shape decisions in people’s best interests and hold decision makers to account. In a positive example in Paraguay, the government has set up a website that allows the public to track COVID-19 expenditure and engage directly with public officials.

Second, now is the time to rethink how our economies are structured. This means avoiding harsh austerity policies or market fundamentalism that prioritizes the interests of big business in recovery. To make a dent in inequality we need radical shifts such as progressive taxation and reinforcing the state’s responsibility to directly provide quality essential services. State funding for military infrastructures and repressive state apparatuses should be repurposed towards social safety nets.

We also urge better protection of worker’s rights. Towards this end CIVICUS has put in place a social security protocol to ensure job security, and to protect the mental and physical well-being of our co-workers.

Third, the needs of the most excluded people should be placed front and center. Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first. Steps must be taken to safeguard the rights of women and the health and wellbeing of older people and children, and to prevent violence against them. Economic stimulus plans should target those who are most vulnerable. For example, Spain has taken steps to introduce a basic monthly income for about a million of the country’s most impoverished households. We encourage other countries to adopt a similar policy.

It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts. CIVICUS is urging funders to exercise flexibility and listen to their partners as they navigate disruptions in programme activities and planned convenings. We also call for a greater proportion of funds to be delivered to organizations directly serving people on the ground.

Fourth, international cooperation remains vital. Multilateral institutions need to be adequately resourced and supported by governments in the spirit of multilateralism. Responses to the pandemic must strengthen and uphold the autonomy of international institutions, not only the World Health Organization but also institutions that promote human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Like pandemics, major contemporary challenges such as conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation have spillover effects beyond their borders. Strong international institutions and cooperation are needed to realize initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire.

Fifth, now is an opportune time to ramp up action on climate change. The healing of nature seen in so many places should be nurtured. New ways of working introduced during the crisis that reduce carbon footprints should continue where possible. The Paris Agreement must receive new life to ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and rises in global temperature are kept to a minimum. Recovery plans are an opportunity to invest in employment that advances the transition to a green economy.

Human rights cut across many of your proposals, for example in the need for transparency, protecting workers and the most disadvantaged, and strengthening human rights institutions. Why are human rights so relevant during COVID-19?

Countries that appear to have done better are ones that have empathetic leaders who have been inclusive in their policy responses and have involved civil society in decision making. This is all part of a human rights approach. In April this year, over 650 civil society organizations from around the world co-signed a letter calling on world leaders to respect human dignity and rights in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We can’t turn the corner towards transformation after COVID-19 without a human rights approach.

Mandeep Tiwana is Chief Programmes Officer, CIVICUS.","The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential.
In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.
Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first.
It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts.

Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.

On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated “elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.

Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.

According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.

The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.

Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).

Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:

Summit on Biodiversity (proposed to reschedule to 30 September);

High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); and

High-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).

The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.

In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.

A virtual meeting to discuss the proposal took place on 12 June. Member States are invited to submit written comments by 19 June.","UN Member States and officials are considering changes to the format of the UN General Debate for the 75th UN General Assembly session and the surrounding high-level meetings in September 2020.

138,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/finlands-second-vnr-presents-civil-society-assessments-of-progress/,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Finland's Second VNR Presents Civil Society Assessments of Progress,"Finland has released its second voluntary review of SDG implementation at the national level, following its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) in 2016. Finland is one of 47 countries that will present a VNR during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report, which was released by the Prime Minister’s Office, covers all 17 Goals and 169 targets of the SDG framework. It focuses on progress achieved between 2016 and 2020, and summarizes key changes and lessons learned regarding: methodology for preparing the VNR; policy and enabling environment; and means of implementation.

As noted in the foreword by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, preparation of Finland’s 2020 VNR introduced new approaches for “intensified stakeholder participation,” with several stakeholders providing their own assessment of progress. Progress on each SDG is presented in the report through two assessments: one from government officials, covering all targets; and another from civil society, providing an overall assessment of progress as well as recommendations for further progress.

The preparation process also included peer review, with the Governments of Mozambique and Switzerland reviewing the draft report and sharing their views.

At the national level, Finland’s VNR notes that a sustainability assessment has been integrated into the annual cycle of policy planning, budgeting and reporting. Environmental aspects have been easier to integrate into policy than social aspects, the report reveals.

The VNR also reflects SDG localization in Finland, noting that cities’ engagement in implementing the 2030 Agenda has increased, and three cities have prepared Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). In addition, the autonomous region of Åland has integrated the SDGs into its core strategies.

The report provides an update on two major features of Finland’s approach to sustainable development – the circular economy, and the ‘Society’s Commitment to Sustainable Development 2050.’ On circular economy, after creating the world’s first roadmap to a circular economy in 2016, its objective is now to “bring the circular economy to the core of competitiveness and economic growth strategy, transition to low-carbon energy, start considering natural resources as a scarcity and promote the shift to a sustainable lifestyle.” Per the national roadmap, Finland aims to be a leading nation in circular economy by 2025.

On the Society’s Commitment, the report describes the tool enabling anyone in Finland to register a concrete action towards the SDGs, and reports that as of March 2020 over 2,000 commitments are listed, with private companies, schools and individual citizens being the most active partners. The latest version of the platform allows users to calculate their personal carbon footprint, draw up a personal plan to reduce their footprint, and track their contribution to the national emissions reduction target.

Looking forward, the government notes that:

A national implementation plan for 2020-2025 will be submitted to the Parliament later in 2020;

In 2021, Finland will prepare a national 2030 Agenda Roadmap, to support a “systemic, long-term approach” to sustainability transformations;

The Government will commission an evaluation of national sustainable development policy in 2023;

Finland is striving for carbon neutrality by 2035; and

Finland is preparing a long-term national roadmap for increasing Finland’s Official Development Aid to 0.7% of GNI; the report notes that Finland has not yet been able to restore ODA to the level preceding budget cuts in 2016.

The government indicates that it will present its next VNR to the HLPF in 2025.

The 2020 session of the HLPF will convene from 7-16 July, most likely in an entirely virtual format. All side events and exhibitions will take place virtually. The latest programme was released on 14 May 2020.

The main messages for the other countries’ VNRs are posted on the HLPF website.

139,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-covid-19-impacts-on-investment-flows/,"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNCTAD Report Details COVID-19 Impacts on Investment Flows,"The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released the World Investment Report 2020, which states that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a “steep drop” in investment flows and has hit developing countries the hardest. The report finds that lockdown measures have slowed existing investment prospects and caused multinational enterprises to reassess new projects.

The World Investment Report 2020 titled, ‘International Production Beyond the Pandemic,’ projects that global foreign direct investment (FDI) will decrease up to 40 percent in 2020, bringing FDI below USD 1 trillion for the first time since 2005. FDI is expected to decrease 5-10 percent in 2021 and to begin to recover in 2022, led by global value chains, replenishment of capital stock, recovery of the global economy, and restructuring for resilience. UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said the outlook is “highly uncertain” and depends on “the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.” He stressed that the transformation underway in international production will “impact developing countries over the coming decade” and requires a “major policy rethink.”

The 2020 report highlights three technology trends of the industrial revolution that are expected to shape international production: additive manufacturing; enhanced supply chain digitalization; and robotics-enabled automation. The policy environment for trade and investment and sustainability concerns, such as differences between regions and countries on emission targets and environmental, social, and governance standards, will influence the pace and extent of technological adoption. The report states that there is an opportunity for increased sustainability if countries and regions take advantage of the new industrial revolution and overcome growing economic nationalism. The report describes four possible trajectories: reshoring; diversification; regionalization; and replication.

The outlook depends on the duration of the health crisis and on the effectiveness of the policies mitigating the pandemic’s economic effects.

The report features a chapter on investment in the SDGs, which finds that international private sector flows to four out of ten key SDG areas have “failed to increase substantially since the adoption of the goals” in 2015. Progress on investment in the SDGs is visible in infrastructure, climate change mitigation, food and agriculture, health, telecommunication, and ecosystems and biodiversity. Although sustainability-themed funds are growing rapidly in number, size, and variety, these finances are not yet translating into investments on the ground in developing countries. The report also finds that very few national strategies on sustainable development address the promotion of investment in the SDGs, and further warns that existing investment promotion instruments related to the SDGs are “limited in number and follow a piecemeal approach,” with countries most often promoting investment in the SDGs through incentive schemes. To ensure that increased interest in SDG finance translates into increased SDG investment, the report presents an ‘Action Plan for Investment in the SDGs.’

The Action Plan presents six transformative actions: mainstreaming the SDGs in national investment policy frameworks and in the international investment treaty regime; reorienting investment promotion and facilitation strategies towards SDG investment; establishing regional SDG investment compacts; fostering new forms of partnerships for SDG investment; deepening environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices’ integration in financial markets by establishing a global monitoring mechanism with a harmonized approach to disclosure; and changing the global business mindset. The Plan is a response to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution on ‘Promoting Investments for Sustainable Development’ (A/RES/74/199) that calls for concrete recommendations for advancing investment to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In Africa, investment flows are predicted to decline 25-45 percent in 2020, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and low commodity prices, especially for oil. The region’s manufacturing and service industries, including aviation, hospitality, leisure, and tourism have also been “hit hard,” a trend that is projected to persist into the future. The report identifies two factors that “offer hope” for the recovery of investment flows in Asia: major global economies are recognizing ties to the continent and promoting investment in infrastructure and industrial development; and trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is deepening regional integration.

In Asia, investment flows are predicted to decline 45 percent in 2020. The pandemic caused lockdown measures and factory stoppages that impacted factories’ production and supply chains in the region. In addition, decreasing corporate earnings and the economic slowdown have resulted in multinational enterprises postponing investment plans.

In Latin America, investment flows are expected to halve in 2020. The pandemic has compounded structural weaknesses and political and social unrest, exacerbating foreign investment challenges and triggering a “deep recession.” These shocks are expected to have the most impact in the commodities, tourism, and transport sectors. In addition, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, which depend on FDI in extractive industries, will be hurt by low oil and commodity prices. The Caribbean is expected to be “hit hard” by the collapse in tourism. The region is also predicted to be “strongly affected” by the global slowdown in demand, particularly in trade with China and the US.

The statement titled, ‘On the Black Lives Matter Protests and other Mass Demonstrations against Systemic Racism and Police Brutality,’ stresses that, “To merely condemn expressions and acts of racism is not enough. We must go beyond and do more.” Highlighting outrage at the “injustice of racism that continues to be pervasive in our host country and across the world,” the signatories note that, as leaders in the multilateral system, it is incumbent upon them to “advocate for effective responses that would contribute to fight systemic racism, a global scourge that has been perpetuated over centuries.”

The statement highlights that 2024 will mark the end of the International Decade for People of African Descent, and indicates the leaders will use their collective voice to “contribute towards the realization of Africa’s own transformative vision contained in Agenda 2063,” which is consistent with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The 22 signatories, all of whom hold the rank of Under Secretary-General, welcome initiatives by the UN Secretary-General to strengthen the global anti-racism discourse and to address systemic racism at all levels, including by having an “honest assessment of how we uphold the UN Charter within our institution.” These leaders emphasize that they “share the core beliefs and the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations that do not leave us the option to keep silent.”

The statement was released on 14 June 2020, in the context of the global protests at the killing of George Floyd in the hands of police. June 2020 also marks the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of the UN Conference on International Organization and signature of the Charter of the United Nations. Signed on 26 June 1945, the preamble to the UN Charter identifies the determination of the peoples of the united nations to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small” as one of four defining objectives.

By the latest version of the text, the UNGA would specify eight SDGs for in-depth review during the 2021 session of the HLPF, and hold more forward-looking discussions during the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021).

Kaha Imnadze (Georgia) and Jean-Claude do Rego (Benin), co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations for the review process of ECOSOC and HLPF, explain that they focused the revised draft only on 2021 partly in order to “bridge the gap between the positions of delegations.”

The co-facilitators released the zero draft of the resolution on 24 April, which proposed themes, SDGs, and “areas for acceleration” to be discussed at the next three HLPF session (2021, 2022, and 2023). By that draft, SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnership for the Goals) would be reviewed each year. Member States discussed the zero draft on 8 May, and several delegations subsequently submitted written inputs: Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, the Group of 77 and China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The revised version of the text, dated 8 June, now identifies SDGs for review only during the 2021 session of the HLPF. Preambular paragraphs in the revised draft note that the COVID-19 pandemic poses threats to sustainable development, including in the areas of health and the world economy, and that the poorest and most vulnerable people are the most affected. This hampers progress towards the SDGs. The introductory text continues, “implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial to help better equip the world for future systemic shocks,” and the SDGs provide a “blueprint” for recovery that leaves no one behind.

The revised draft proposes that the 2021 theme for ECOSOC and HLPF would be ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action.’ The 2021 HLPF would take up three “areas of acceleration”: health and human well-being; sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies; and healthy nutrition patterns.

In-depth reviews would be held on several SDGs – “namely, but not limited to” the eight SDGs most closely associated with these areas: Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and wellbeing), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals). The in-depth reviews will address interlinkages between the SDGs to promote actions that “create co-benefits, address synergies and trade-offs, and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.” They would also account for the impacts of COVID-19 on the SDGs.

By the revised draft resolution, the UNGA would decide to conduct the reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF during its 75th session, which begins in September 2020. The informal meetings for the review would be open to major groups and other relevant stakeholders.

Discussions during the 75th session also would define the themes for the HLPF and ECOSOC sessions in 2022 and 2023.

A virtual consultation will convene on 15 June for a paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the revised text.

The events allowed for an exchange of information while also demonstrating progress that is underway, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The June Momentum for Climate Change was conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The events took place during the time period that the annual meetings of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies would have convened as the Bonn Climate Change Conference, but they did not involve formal negotiations.

Over eight days from 1-10 June 2020, 17 open events and six additional events requiring registration, including meetings of the constituted bodies, took place. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary from the events indicates that several focused on the work of the constituted bodies, which are the bodies that focus on implementing various aspects of the Convention and the Paris Agreement on climate change. These technical bodies provided updates on their work and future plans. Formal meetings also took place, with the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement holding its first meeting and lead reviewers of biennial reports and national communications met to share experiences. Other events discussed ongoing and emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

During an opening session on the theme, ‘UN and the UNFCCC Vision for 2020 in the Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Opportunities for Sustainable Recovery,’ Selwin Hart, Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team, reported that the UN Secretary-General’s six climate-related actions to shape the recovery range from investing in green jobs and tying bailouts to the Paris Agreement’s goals, to ending fossil fuel subsidies, accounting for climate risks, and ensuring no one is left behind as we recover better, together. President-designate of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, Alok Sharma (UK), highlighted energy, transparency, nature-based solutions, adaptation, and finance as key COP 26 themes. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa emphasized that 2020 is still a critical year for countries to fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement, including by submitting enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by the end of the year.

During a closing segment, youth non-governmental organization (YOUNGO) representatives delivered messages highlighting the need for sustainable, low-emissions climate change conferences, calling for access to food, energy, education, jobs, and medicine for the most vulnerable, and supporting grassroots communities to decentralize decision making.

SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) noted that there had been more than 12,000 views of the 17 open events over the eight-day June Momentum event, and of the 136 panelists, 48% were female. With SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), she noted that several of the activities would advance the agenda, including on Action for Climate Empowerment and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture. They also noted events that emphasized the need for sustainable recovery, including by using NDCs as frameworks.

143,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/unlocking-natures-potential/,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Unlocking Nature’s Potential,"The world is facing multiple, interdependent global crises, where dislocation in one area can ripple through and impact many others. COVID-19 comes just as the public was beginning, slowly, to come to terms with the climate crisis and its far-reaching implications. The pandemic highlights how interconnected we are, and how impossible it is to disentangle the problems we all face in a globalized world. Holistic approaches to these problems are needed and they are needed fast. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), an umbrella term to describe a wide array of ecosystem-based actions that incorporate the natural environment to mitigate climate change and ensure ecosystem sustainability, has grown in prominence in recent years as potentially being such an approach.

Many companies are increasingly aware of the impact their unsustainable commodity production has on the environment and are recognizing that business cannot thrive in a world of environmental stress, poverty, and uncertainty. Some of those companies are starting to plan and implement preventive and restorative actions within their operations, with NbS providing a cost-effective tool to create a seemingly more responsible and sustainable forest-risk commodity value chain.

Detailed information on how companies are carrying out NbS within their operations, however, is still lagging. In a recent briefing, CDP analysed its 2019 Forests disclosure data on 543 companies that gathered information about the integration of NbS into their operations. We found that only 15% of companies reported having implemented any form of NbS, as well as a lack of consistency amongst those who did. The results spoke a clear message: we have a long way to go to encourage more widespread and ambitious implementation of NbS. As stated in the recent #TogetherWithNature statement, NbS must be considered a complementary approach to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, in addition to following a pathway of decarbonization, enacting comprehensive climate policies and enforcing proper accountability.

In the last year, NbS has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions on the environmental crisis. They featured heavily in the UN Climate Action Summit, particularly in the NbS Coalition co-led by China and New Zealand. At COP 25 in December, NbS were constituted a central theme in the high-level segments and the Santiago Call for Action on Forests. NbS are also set to take centre-stage in the negotiations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. For the private sector, it pays to be transparent, as businesses that disclose and take leading action on climate change can better identify and measure their environmental risks and opportunities. Data from STOXX has shown that CDP’s ‘A List’ has outperformed its global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a 7-year period.

The private sector presents a largely untapped opportunity for the implementation of NbS, when implemented in accordance with the best available science-based targets and with appropriate safeguards. As the COVID-19 crisis recedes, policymakers should seize the political momentum for the 2021 – 2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and recognize the role and participation of non-state actors in driving NbS, creating regulatory environments that are both institutionally and financially conducive for all stakeholders to take ambitious, measurable action. To start, they could:

1. Encourage corporate environmental disclosure

Disclosure is the bedrock of action. Corporate environmental disclosure needs to be more transparent and common, including for NbS. For this to occur, there needs to be improved regulatory frameworks to promote transparency in supply chains, fostering the integration of environmental protection assessments in business operations.

2. Mainstream NbS into legislation and regulatory frameworks for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development

Situating NbS as a cross-cutting policy tool within NDCs, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the SDGs (especially SDGs 12, 13 and 15) would not only help with the implementation of projects but would promote more accurate measurement of their effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

3. Improve the criteria, metrics and measurement of NbS

Whilst NbS are present in the majority of NDCs submitted to date, most of these do not include quantifiable targets. In order to harness private sector potential on the implementation of NbS and be part of a coherent global response to climate and biodiversity, there must be adequate and science-backed targets outlining the direction of action.

International policy efforts have multiple windows of opportunity to introduce integrated solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, and human development. All these issues are underpinned by our relationship with nature. Policymakers and corporate actors must engage in mutually supportive, ambitious, and carefully implemented action, to ensure that the potential of nature to be an important part of the solution to the current crises is unlocked.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations.

The UN SDGs are an urgent universal call for action to change the world and steer it towards a better and more sustainable path. One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

What are the SDGs?

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 following decades of work by countries and the UN and were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015. They replaced the Millennium Development Goals, which started a global effort in 2000 to address poverty.

The UN Development Programme supports countries in implementing and achieving the SDGs through integrated solutions. Because of their global nature, achieving the SDGs requires the establishment of global partnerships, including governments, private actors, civil society, and citizens. Moreover, creativity, technology, and financial resources from all of society are necessary to achieve the SDGs.

The need for the 18th SDG

Planet Earth and the human race are strongly connected to each other. Sustainability of this planet is something that can be achieved from on Earth but also from outer space. Natural disasters and other phenomena that can lead to the extinction of the human race in the long term can be observed from outer space through satellites that provide essential information.

As public and private interest in the quest for exploration and use of outer space increases, the UN can spread awareness on issues that would protect humanity and the outer space ecosystem.

With the development of counter-space technologies and ‘space forces’ by several nations, a constant need exists for the protection of space against military use. Space, although infinite, is a scarce resource due to the limited availability of orbital space near Earth and in view of orbital congestion and space debris, there is a need for the protection and sustainability of space for future generations. Any set of SDGs without a focus on environmental impact would be incomplete. Formulating guidelines on environmental compliance reporting will go a long way to protect the outer space environment. A new SDG 18 could also address how data obtained about new celestial bodies in the process of commercial exploration is shared for the benefit of humanity.

Remote sensing satellites providing data for monitoring land use, soil, drought, crop development, water cycles, and other aspects of the natural environment, as well as the epidemiology of infectious diseases, are vital for addressing the problems incorporated in the SDGs on hunger, poverty, sanitation, energy, life on land and life below water. While the SDGs on quality education, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, are addressed by telecommunication technologies enabled by satellite communication, the unique opportunities for partnerships and collaborations in space foster cooperation vital for ‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’ (SDG 16). Therefore, it could be said that SDG 18 would not only be a sustainable development goal itself but also a catalyst for all the other 17 SDGs!

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’ – Stephen Hawking

Initiating space as the 18th SDG

Placing space on the UN SDGs agenda has already seen several initiatives. In a joint report published by UNOOSA and the European GNSS Agency in January 2018, global cooperation and recognition of the ability of space to support the SDGs were recognised as a key for the success of the UN SDGs.

Additionally, The National Space Society, a US organisation for space advocacy, calls for ‘Recognizing the Imperative Role of Space in our Future’ as the 18th SDG. According to the NSS, the sustainable development of space economy must be recognised as a development goal that will include the principles of space exploration and utilisation, and the development of space communities.

Finally, a group of students from the Windesheim Honours College in Zwolle, the Netherlands, calls for the recognition of SDG 18: ‘Space for all’ by emphasising the responsibility of humanity for the bigger system beyond Earth. Their work introduces four pillars for that goal: respect and care for the community of life in our galaxy and universe; ecological wisdom and integrity towards biological systems in space; social and economic justice towards other planets and their resources; and global commitment to democracy, nonviolence, and peace towards potential new forms of life.

It is clear that space plays a crucial part in the achievement of the existing 17 SDGs. However, as the reliance on space to meet these goals is growing, space sustainability should be recognised as a goal in itself. As Stephen Hawking stated:

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’","One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

Saturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

The update, posted to the EOHU website shortly after 2 p.m., showed three new cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, and one in Prescott-Russell. This brings the total number of confirmed cases within the EOHU region to 158 and represents the largest single-day jump in weeks.

Three of the cases are dated to Thursday, with one Wednesday and the last on Friday. The EOHU does not hold its briefings on weekends, so any further information about these five new cases, and any added to the count on Sunday, will await Monday afternoon’s briefing. Based on the episode dates alone, none of these new cases should be related to the region entering Stage 2 on Friday.

The EOHU also noted two additional resolved cases, both in Prescott-Russell. That leaves 21 unresolved cases in Prescott-Russell, four in SDG, and five in Cornwall. Another bright spot is that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Foyer St- Viateur in Limoges was declared over on Saturday— it dated back to a staff member testing positive. An outbreak was declared for a second time at the Pinecrest long-term care facility in Plantagenet on Wednesday, after an asymptomatic staff member tested positive. All residents and staff members at the facility will be tested again.","Three new COVID-19 cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, one in Prescott-RussellArticle contentSaturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

In the wake of the crisis, visibility and urgency on issues such as climate change, income inequality and human rights have risen and the five-step framework seeks to support investors in creating investment outcomes that are aligned with the UN goals, the PRI said in its report.

It comes as the investor organisation, with $89trn (€78trn) in assets managed by its signatories, has registered an increase in its members mentioning the SDGs in their reporting, with 650 in 2020, compared to 418 last year.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) estimates that meeting the 17 SDGs by 2030 will require $5trn to $7trn per year from the private sector, the PRI report said.

To support the SDGs, investors need to increase the positive outcomes and decrease the negative outcomes of their actions.

Investors need to redirect existing capital and engage with investees to improve positive outcomes.

The PRI report states that there is a continuous feedback cycle between environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities and (SDG-aligned) outcomes, shaped by investor actions (see figure 2 below).

This applies particularly for ‘universal owners’, who are long-term investors and so large that they hold a slice of the overall market.

“For such investors, overall economic performance will influence the future value of their portfolios more than the performance of individual companies or sectors, incentivising them to support sustainable growth and well-functioning financial markets,” the report noted.

Focusing on SDG outcomes allows investors to, for example:

identify opportunities, such as through changes to business models, across supply chains and through new and expanded products and services;

prepare for and respond to legal and regulatory developments, including those that may lead to asset stranding; and

protect their reputation and licence-to-operate (eg the trust of beneficiaries, clients and other stakeholders), particularly in the event of negative outcomes from investments.

The framework follows previous work by the PRI on the SDG investment case in 2017 and is the starting point for more work on the subject. It will also be the basis for future guidance and support, the report explained.

Next steps

Going forward, the PRI will work with signatories, who seek to shape outcomes in line with the SDGs, to provide best practices and develop a consensus on how to address common challenges, it said.

The PRI will also include an initial set of questions on shaping real-world outcomes in the pilot year of its new reporting framework in 2021.

Junko Nakagawa, president and chief executive of Nomura Asset Management, commented: “It is clear that large asset managers have a crucial role to play in supporting outcomes in line with the SDGs through both investments in equities and engagement with publicly-listed companies.

“Whilst we recognise the difficulties associated with pursuing impact through public investing for certain SDG targets, large public companies are among the most important stakeholders for achieving success. These companies have the resources, scale and investment power to bridge the huge funding gaps, while major asset managers are uniquely positioned to engage with these companies and help to enhance their impact.”

Darryl Murphy, managing director, infrastructure at Aviva Investors, said: “As long-term investors, we believe infrastructure – and real assets more broadly – have a critical role to play in moving towards a truly sustainable future.

“[The SDGs] help us to define objectives for a project and shape terms and conditions of an investment agreement, ensuring that borrowers adhere to certain practices and standards over the long-term.”

Below is the Nigeria Country Report No. 2020/177, titled ""Nigeria: Technical Assistance Report-Additional Spending Toward Sustainable Development Goals"", issued in April 2020.

Preface

In response to a request from the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), a technical mission visited Abuja, Nigeria during January 29-February 11, 2020 to collaborate on an assessment of the spending associated with making substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mission comprised Mauricio Soto (head) and Mariano Moszoro (all FAD), and Julieth Pico (FAD expert).

This technical mission was financed by the European Union under the EU-IMF Public Financial Management Partnership Program (PFM-PP).

The mission was hosted by D.M. Dauda (Secretary of Programme, OSSAP-SDGs) and Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa (Senior Technical Advisor, OSSAP-SDGs).

The mission met with Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed (Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning), Prince Clem Ikanade Agba (Minister of State for Budget and National Planning), and Suleiman H, Adamu (Minister of Water Resources). The mission also met with Didi Walson-Jack (Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power), Emmanuel Meribole (Director, Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Health), Babangida Hussaini (Director of Special Projects, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing), and Adeoye E.O. (Acting Director, Department of Educational Planning, Research, and Development, Federal Ministry of Education).

The mission also met Katrine Mulvad Thomsen (Team Leader, Economic Cooperation and Energy, European Union Delegation), Amarakoon Bandara (Senior Economic Advisor, UNDP), Shubham Chaudhuri (Country Director, World Bank), Moses Ongom (Health System Adviser, WHO), Anthony Simpasa (Lead Economist, African Development Bank), and other staff of development partners.

The mission expresses its sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support given by officials and staff of these various organizations with whom the mission met. The team is especially grateful to Chukwuemeka Olanrewaju Ogbuehi (Ministry of Finance), Ogunleye Femi (OSSAPSDG), and Zainab Mangga (IMF Resident Representative Office) for the excellent coordination and support during the mission. The mission is also thankful to Laraba Bonet (IMF Resident Representative Office) for facilitating mission logistics.

Since the mission took place before COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the report does not reflect the impact from COVID-19 on economic activity in Nigeria. The report focuses on some of the medium-term challenges that Nigeria will face after the COVID-19 crisis, namely the additional spending needed to ensure substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Executive Summary

Making progress in the SDGs requires substantial additional resources. Concomitant with the reform priorities identified by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and other international development institutions, the mission estimates additional spending of 18 percentage points of GDP by 2030-a level higher than the average low-income and developing countries. Relative to other low-income and developing countries, additional spending is higher in education and water and sanitation, and lower in health, electricity, and roads (Figure).

Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. The authorities have made important progress in developing long-term plans in sectors such as health, electricity, and water and sanitation.

Education-increasing access and improving quality. The relatively low resources devoted to education are insufficient to deliver quality education for all. With 50 percent of the population in school-age, we estimate that total annual spending in education would need to increase by 7.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. A pragmatic approach should be taken depending on resource availability. For example, expanding enrollment could be done at a more modest cost of some 1 percentage points of GDP.

Health-tackling inefficiencies. Nigeria should deliver better outcomes at its current level of spending. Rebalancing the system, with an emphasis on primary care with public support, is critical. In the medium-term, additional annual spending of 4 percentage points of GDP would be needed to expand health workers, improve infrastructure, and improve health outcomes.

Electricity-rehabilitating and expanding power infrastructure. Annual investments of 1 percent of GDP are needed to expand electricity access and keep up with population growth. Rehabilitating the existing capacity can help meeting part of these investments. Mini-grids can play an important role in mobilizing capacity to remote and vulnerable communities.

Roads-expanding the road network. Increasing access roads from 26 to 75 percent of the rural population will cost 2 percent of annual GDP. It is critical to outline the road network and identify projects with high economic and social returns. The private sector can play an important role in this sector, supported by strong oversight to ensure value for money.

Water and sanitation-picking low-hanging fruit. A priority is improving access for the most vulnerable. Ending open defecation and expanding basic water and sanitation can be achieved at a modest annual cost of 0.6 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, providing safely managed water and sanitation for all will cost an additional 2.5 percent of annual GDP.





Beyond resources, improving coordination and strengthening governance is critical to delivering on the SDGs. The federal administration through its Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) is committed to advance towards the 2030 goals. In line with policy options outlined by the World Bank and the United Nations, progress in these sectors requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by strong coordination between the federal, state, and local administrations.

While development partners and the private sector can help, the government should be in the driving seat of these efforts. To support decision-making based on evidence, one priority is to collect and analyze data to inform best practices and better target scarce resources.

The UN office in Uganda is awaiting confirmation from the president to launch a youth innovative campaign for solutions to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals were adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.



They focus more on achieving a world free of poverty and hunger, one with good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, climate action, peace, justice and strong institutions.



The United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango said that through the initiative, the UN will launch an innovative campaign of 1 million SDG solutions giving the youth a chance to showcase how they can solve the country's development challenges.



//Cue in; “with Honorable Okurut…



Cue out…the parliamentary committee.”//



Malango was speaking at the handover the second Voluntary National Review Report on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Uganda to the Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga by the Minister in Charge of General Duties in the Office of the Prime Minister, Mary Karooro Okurut.



The Voluntary National Review encourages countries to conduct self-assessment to identify challenges and map strategic interventions for the progress of the goals. The Report highlights the progress made in integrating and implementing SDGs in Uganda's development planning frameworks.



Malango says the submission of the Review report is a clear signal that Uganda embraces accountability to international frameworks. Uganda ranked 18 out of 52 African countries based on 97 indicators across all SDGs. The UN Resident Coordinator said that the country has an overall score of 54.8 per cent which is higher than the regional average of 52.7 per cent.



Minister Okurut, who is Cabinet’s focal person on SDGs, called for more support in Parliament, especially in the promotion and adoption of people-centred policies and legislation to ensure that no one is left behind.



The Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga praised Malango for having adamantly pushed the Prime Minister to ensure that Cabinet appointed a specific minister to oversee the implementation and achievement of SDG Targets. She pledged to ensure that the budget process and oversight focuses on achieving the development Agenda as outlined.

“We call this a scope change, but it’s really just an add-on to a scope we have with WSP,” said Benjamin de Haan, director of transportation and planning services.

The county hires engineers for the bridge design itself and then it asks for an hourly rate for construction and administration support.

“Everyone can bid that differently, and then it starts to impact the financial analysis of a RFP (request for proposals), and it can impact the financials,” said de Haan. “And often, until you have a design done, you don’t really know what kind of effort you need in designs for construction.

About 3,000 active battalion Highlanders went overseas to fight in the war, leaving behind 300 of their comrades in the cemeteries. The reserve members in SDG, consisting of about 18 platoons, encouraged young people to get involved in the force to potentially serve in the army, air force or navy.

“They were one of the three infantry battalions of 9th Brigade and 3rd Canadian Infantry Division,” said Shearing. “The brigade was the reserve brigade. About 570 Glens landed on D Day.

He’s been associated with the group since 1929, when he signed on with a regiment when he was 13 years old. He served as a lieutenant and ended his career as a captain after many stints overseas.

The Highlanders were received orders to form the battalion and its start dates to June 20, 1940.

Article content Gault attended and qualified as a sergeant signal instructor at the Royal Canadian Corp of Signals in Camp Borden. “He instructed and trained the SDG Highlanders signal platoon through the 1930s,” said Gault. “He was the RSM, which stands for regimental sergeant major, of the Cornwall Collegiate Institute, a cadet core in 1932 and later as a lieutenant, organized and instructed a school of cadets.” Gault Sr. was appointed to the 2nd Battalion of the Highlanders and then volunteered for active service and attended the officer’s training school, went on to instruct at two training centres before being posted to England in 1943. “In England, he attended two battle schools, and qualified at the anti-tank school in England,” said Gault. “He then instructed in anti-tank warfare. He went from the 2nd Battalion to the 1st Battalion, being the active force in Europe.” Gault was wounded just before the liberation of Boulogne. He became an active supporter of the 1st Battalion Association, helping organizing tours, arranging for memorial plaques, and planning reunions. The association recognized him as an honourary life member. “My father was wounded, hit by shrapnel by a German motor grenade, wounded in the right side of his head, forearm and leg,” said Gault. “He was evacuated to England.” He spent four months in the hospital, next four to five months on rehabilitation and training reinforcements – anti tank – and was then appointed chief instructor later on.

The Municipality of South Dundas marked its first civic-address sign installation under the program on Wednesday morning, planted on farmland owned by Coun. Archie Mellan.

What is the Emily 911 Farm Entrance Program? A lifesaver, potentially.

It’s a movement taking root in counties and communities across the province, inspired by a tragic occurrence in 2014, when a young girl, Emily Trudeau, 7, was killed in a farm injury in Hastings County west of Belleville. First responders could not immediately find the scene of the incident, in rural area near Tweed.

Emily’s parents helped launch the Emily 911 Farm Entrance Program a couple of years ago, and civic address signs are up in different parts of the province and of SDG, including South Glengarry and North Dundas. These civic address signs are meant for rural parcels without buildings (these properties mostly all already have civic address signs at their laneways), such as cropland and woodlots.","HULBERT — It’s another sign that the Emily Project continues to grow in the region’s agricultural heartland.

Article content Hospitals in the region are starting to increasing services as the number of active COVID-19 has dropped and remains low. This comes as the provincial government entered Stage 2 of its economic reopening within the Eastern Ontario Health Unit. Per the guidelines, the process will take weeks and months.

Hospitals in Cornwall/SDG to resume services Back to video “Our initial focus has been surgeries and endoscopies, which is really part of the surgical services,” said Cholly Boland, chief executive officer of Winchester District Memorial Hospital. “We’re beginning to ramp up those services. “We have both patients that have been waiting for several months, literally, and patients were presenting today. We are scheduling the patients with the most pressing needs, whether it’s a need that has progressed over the last few months or it’s a need that presents today.” Hospitals in the region are collaborating to meet the provincial requirements prior to increasing services. Provincial criteria include a lower-than-average number of patients in hospitals across the region, appropriate staffing levels, and a sufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) among other conditions, according to a news release. Boland spoke to WDMH, but the same steps and procedures are being taken at Cornwall Community Hospital and at Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria.

They will however, continue in-person visits where the doctor needs to do an examination or procedure. “Within a couple of weeks, we hope to be up to about 50 to 60 per cent of the number of volumes we saw pre-COVID, but the hospitals are a different place right now and will be for the foreseeable future,” said Boland. “Everyone is wearing a mask, everyone has to distance themselves when they come in and take enhanced precautions.” There are only a number of procedures they can conduct in the operating room during the day as there are enhanced preparations between cases. “In all likelihood, we won’t get up to 100 per cent of what we were before pre-COVID,” said Boland. “If we are, it’ll take a good long while now. By the same token, we also have to be prepared if by some chance, in a couple of months, another wave comes by and we’ll have to actually ramp down.” The hospital is limiting the amount of people in the waiting room and in the operating room. Staff members have placed tape on the ground to ensure a safe distance is met.

Patients that enter the emergency room are served based on who needs immediate care first. “What we’re talking about are people who didn’t require emergency or urgent care in March, maybe by virtue of them having to wait, their conditions has become serious and those are the people we want to address,” said Boland. “We continue to do emergency surgeries and emergency services as we always have. It’s the next level of priority that we’re addressing now and we do have a bit of a backlog on that, not only a daily basis but looking at the last few months.” Hospitals are prepared for a second wave of COVID-19. Boland said they may have to ramp down services again as they did in March. That will be dependent on the environment and situation, such as if the rate of infection is greater or if there’s a greater demand on services for COVID-19. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Today we are facing an implausible pandemic that has affected the lives of the entire population. The economy is slowing, if not stagnating; it is like an invisible hand suddenly pressing the pause button.

The pandemic has also put the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) global agenda in jeopardy. Even before COVID-19 struck, many had cast doubt over whether all the goals would be achieved in 2030 as targeted when the SDGs were launched during the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015.

Economics professor William Esterly from New York University quipped that SDGs could be abbreviated to ""senseless, dreamy, garbled"". In one of its reports, The Economist describes SDGs as ""sprawling and misconceived, […] unfeasibly expensive"" costing US$2 trillion to $3 trillion per year and are impossible to realize. In fact, many say the SDGs are utopian and ambitious.

A year before the pandemic, the lack of global commitment to SDGs was beginning to be felt, particularly in terms of advocacy and media communication. A World Bank study (2019) showed that 31 percent of its ""knowledge products"", which include recommendations for the SDG action plan, had never been downloaded and 87 percent had never been cited.

In a 2018 report titled ""How the Indonesian Media Deals With SDGs"", University of Indonesia (UI) lecturer Irwansyah claims that not all SDGs are understood by the local media and only a few are framed based on public policy concerns. He concludes that the Indonesian media is not well informed about SDGs and the goals are not considered an interesting news topic.

Today, the media is more interested in political issues, especially in the time of COVID-19. SDGs have disappeared from the news, overshadowed by coronavirus headlines.

Looking at the performance of Asia-Pacific countries over the last five years, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) reported that in line with the current trajectory, the region will not achieve any of the 17 SDGs by 2030. Progress exists but at a sluggish pace, with efforts to meet over a half of the goals stagnating or even moving to the opposite direction.

In Indonesia, not all provinces have regional action plans to meet SDGs, let alone include them in their middle and long-term development plan. At the national level, some targets have not even been determined.

Based on monitoring conducted by the SDGs Center of Padjadjaran University, progress had been made up 2018 in achieving SDG target indicators. The SDG target score increased in 28 out of 34 provinces that year.

The arrival of COVID-19 has surely slowed down the country’s bid to meet its SDG targets. Almost all goals will be directly or indirectly affected, given that each goal does not stand alone but is interconnected with another. The UN SDGs report 2020 stated that now due to COVID -19 crisis, efforts to achieve the coals are even more challenging.

COVID-19 is impacting health, the economy, education, poverty alleviation, gender equality, the environment, climate change and other issues to be addressed under the SDG agenda. A quick simulation by Andi Sumner et al. (2020) in 138 developing countries and 26 developed countries shows that even in a moderate scenario, COVID-19 has added a poor population of 85 million people. While SMERU Research Institute found about 8.5 million Indonesians would plunge into poverty due to the pandemic.

The delay in achieving SDGs is unavoidable as states have reallocated their budgets to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. A study by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNDESA) shows there has been a change in the quality of the environment amid COVID-19, but it may not last long as large-scale recovery measures post-pandemic may warm the planet again.

The role of nonstate actors such as the private sector is difficult to predict, given that the pandemic has severely affected businesses.

The pandemic, however, is not an excuse to stop efforts to achieve SDG targets by 2030. COVID-19 is instead offering opportunities for us to do more to fulfill the goals. For one, the health crisis has taught us how to live a healthy life, to care for and share with others — the renewed mindset we need the most to achieve SDG targets.

The pandemic has also proven that everybody is equal. COVID-19 affects the young and old, poor and rich, men and women; the pandemic has put us all on the same boat.

Other blessings in disguise of this pandemic are the rise of global cooperation and strengthening of science-based decision-making, both of which provide an ideal opportunity for states to achieve their SDG targets.

The question is: How can we maintain this momentum? First, it is important for all actors to improve the communication strategy of SDGs and step up their campaigns. Second, there is a need to reset national and regional SDG targets for all indicators. Third, identify the right policies and suggestions needed to achieve the SDGs. This will require the government to determine the level of urgency, with priority given to the low-hanging fruit. Fourth, renew political will and commitment.

Fifth, develop knowledge, capacity and innovation to implement SDGs. Sixth, seek more funding sources for SDGs through partnerships, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility and synchronization of a national SDGs financing hub and the SDG Indonesia One platform.

Although all countries agreed to work towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, no country is on track. Recent assessments paint a bleak outlook: inequality is widening, hunger is on the rise, biodiversity is eroding at an alarming rate, climate change threatens all SDGs, and a pandemic is rampaging the world.

To accelerate impacts, the United Nations declared the 2020-2030 period a “Decade of Action”. All stakeholders are called on to contribute to the SDGs, but the private sector in particular was identified as being able to make a difference between complacency and action. The economic activities they undertake can advance, but also be detrimental to, the SDGs.

Defining interactions between economic activities and SDG targets

In societies, companies undertake numerous, highly heterogeneous types of economic activities. These activities sustain livelihoods and produce goods and services that help people attain a better life, but they also create negative externalities. Different types of economic activities thereby impact different SDGs. From the start of the SDG effort, the importance of ‘interaction-’, ‘linkages- or ‘nexus’-’ effects have been deemed vital for progress. Many research and knowledge-exchange efforts have been initiated: the Nexus community, SDG Interaction Knowledge Platform, LinkedSDG platform and the SDG Synergies approach. Most of these initiatives – as well as the related studies – concentrate on macro-economic or sector specific analyses. There is insufficient focus as well as evidence on how individual economic activities – as a proxy for corporate strategies – interact with the SDGs. This lack of evidence complicates the efforts of companies, governments, and investors to create smart SDG strategies that steer towards net positive impacts.

We have undertaken research to fill this gap. This research systematically reviews 876 articles, published between 2005 and 2019 and covering 420 economic activities (defined by the ISIC Rev. 4 classification), to synthesize the literature on the interface between individual economic activities and sustainable development impacts.

Moving forward

The research results identify the positive and negative interactions between individual and detailed economic activities and the topics defined by the SDGs’ underlying targets, as reported in the literature. At an overarching level, the findings reveal that economic activities bring ample opportunities for advancing SDGs. Most are sources of economic productivity (SDG 8) and drive industrialization (SDG 9) while many create and/or distribute goods and services that help people meet their basic needs (SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11). However, negative impacts are widespread, most prominently afflicting ecosystems (SDGs 14 and 15), driving climate change (SDG 13) and harming human health (SDG 3).

Yet these interactions vary widely across individual economic activities. Agriculture activities, for instance, feed the world, thereby having clear potential to help achieve SDG 2 (zero hunger). However, they also account for some 70% of water withdrawals globally which raises concerns for SDG 6 (water and sanitation), and the use of fertilizers and pesticides threatens SDGs 14 and 15 (life on land and below water).

As another example, electricity generation promotes SDG 9 (industrialization). But if electricity is generated through non-renewable sources, SDG 13 (climate action) is at risk, while SDG 3 (health and well-being) may be harmed due to air pollution. Estimates suggest that in China 15 million and in India 11 million years of life lost can be avoided by eliminating power generation emissions.

These findings can inform the creation of improved SDG strategies. Scientists and policy makers increasingly recognize that progress on the SDGs can be accelerated through a “nexus approach”. Recognizing that progress on one SDG can promote, but also be detrimental to, progress on another SDG, a nexus approach aims to manage the interactions between SDGs in order to advance multiple SDGs simultaneously and reduce the risk of trade-offs.

For example, eradicating hunger (SDG 2) improves health and well-being (SDG 3) and can help people escape poverty (SDG 1). Targeting these SDGs together, instead of treating them as isolated silos, brings opportunities for bigger impacts

The economic activities undertaken by organizations present a key lever for operationalizing this SDG-nexus. Economic activities drive positive and negative impacts on the SDGs, which are themselves entwined. Hence, there is an imperative to adopt a nexus approach to economic activities’ impacts on sustainable development, in order to promote the co-benefits of economic activities on SDGs and mitigate their trade-offs. The nexus approach not only deserves attention as part of policy agendas, but increasingly as an integral part of corporate strategies, for instance in the management of well-designed partnership portfolios.

The VLR Series seeks to provide guidance, definitions, and technical support for local and regional governments to engage in the VLR process. During the VLR process, local governments confirm their commitment to the SDGs and voluntarily assess progress toward specific targets.

During the launch event, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, UN-Habitat Executive Director, emphasized the need to empower cities and local governments through spatially-disaggregated data and sufficient resources. She called for integrating VLRs into the VNR process. Representatives from a number of communities that have developed VLRs discussed their experiences. The communities include: New York City, Madrid, Moscow, Oaxaca, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and Barcelona.

UN-Habitat announced that, in collaboration with the Madrid City Council, UN-Habitat will organize an Expert Group Meeting on strengthening the VLR process by the end of 2020.

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.

The SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), also published its third series of policy briefs on SDG 7 and its interlinkages with other SDGs in support of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

‘Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report,’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), monitors and assesses the world’s progress towards global targets for universal access to sustainable, affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It also identifies best practices, policies, measures, and scenarios to accelerate further progress and simultaneously pursue other SDGs.

On universal access (SDG target 7.1: “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services,” including access to electricity (indicator 7.1.1) and access to clean cooking solutions (indicator 7.1.2)), the report finds that over 1 billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, increasing the connected proportion of the population from 83% to 90%. However, 789 million people still do not have access to electricity, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 70% of this deficit. The report estimates that by 2030, 620 million people will lack electricity access, 85% of them in Africa. The report recommends that governments respond to the COVD-19 crisis by working with donors and investors to ensure that off-grid developers, utilities, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain active and that governments adopt a suite of safeguards to protect energy consumers.

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report. While the global proportion of the population with access increased by 200 million between 2010 and 2018, 2.7 billion people remained without access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of those without access increased from 750 million to 890 million. The report concludes that 2.3 billion people, 30% of the world’s population, will continue to lack clean cooking fuels by 2030. It recommends that governments utilize more comprehensive household surveys to support more effective evidence-based policy and investment decisions.

On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption. This increase was driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy in the power sector. The report finds that while adoption of renewable energy in the heating and transport sector lags behind its potential, it will be required to achieve SDG 7.2 by 2030.

On energy efficiency (SDG target 7.3: “By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”), the report states that in recent years, the rates of improvement in global primary energy intensity have fallen to 1.7%, although the average rate of improvement between 2010-2017 was 2.2%. To achieve the SDG 7.3 energy efficiency target of doubling the historic improvement rate, annual improvement will need to increase to an average of 3% per year between 2017-2030. The report recommends that countries make energy efficiency a policy and investment priority through minimum energy efficiency standards, market-based mechanisms, financial incentives, and other means.

On international public finance (SDG target 7.a: “By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology,” with indicator 7.a.1 focusing on international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy), the report finds that while total international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy doubled to USD 21.4 billion in 2017 over 2010 flows, only 12% reached least developed countries (LDCs), which are the furthest from achieving SDG 7 targets.

167,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/jamaicas-updated-ndc-incorporates-land-use-change-and-forestry-sector/,"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Jamaica’s Updated NDC Incorporates Land-use Change and Forestry Sector,"Jamaica has submitted its 2020 nationally determined contribution (NDC), joining the few Parties to the Paris Agreement on climate change that have already done so, the majority of them island States. The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

Nonetheless, growing food insecurity, deterioration of the natural environment, and persistent inequalities remain and have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

On the issues of poverty, healthcare, and education, the 2020 edition of this annual report documents:

the first rise in global poverty since 1998, with an estimated 71 million people expected to be pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020;

the disruptions to health and vaccination services and limited access to diet and nutrition services could cause hundreds of thousands of additional under-5 deaths and tens of thousands of additional maternal deaths in 2020; and

school closures have kept 90% of students worldwide out of school.

This report was launched at the opening of the 2020 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2020), on 7 July. The report uses data as of June 2020 for selected indicators in the global indicator framework for the SDGs, as developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 July 2017.

The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 is the third of three global assessments on SDG progress that are released in preparation for the annual HLPF session. The yearly report of the UN Secretary-General on progress towards the 17 SDGs (SDG Progress Report) is released several months before the HLPF. The 2020 edition reported that progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) annually releases a Sustainable Development Goals Report along with indexes that list countries by SDG achievement. Their 2020 edition focuses on ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Covid-19.’ The report indicates that all regions have made progress in the SDG index since 2015, with East and South Asia having progressed the most.","The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 finds that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world had been making progress in several areas, including maternal and child health and access to electricity.

AstraZeneca, Deloitte and BP are among a cohort big-name businesses to have jointly unveiled £500,000 of grant funding for young innovators working on projects driving progress towards the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Coordinated through the One Young World platform, the funding will be complemented with mentorship sessions between the businesses and the entrepreneurs. It is hoped that, for every £1 invested through the scheme, £15 of social value will be delivered.

In order to receive funding, each project had to prove how it is driving progress towards one of the Global Goals, across the entire scope of its aims and targets. The initiative was open globally and has named winners from Asia, Africa, Canada, Central America and Latin America, as below:

The SDG 2: Zero Hunger prize was awarded to Canada-based Tailored, a startup producing plant-based, culturally relevant food products at price points accessible to families facing poverty. Reckitt Benckiser, the parent firm of brands including Air Wick, Nurofen and Lysoll, is supporting this category.

The SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing prize went to Colombia-based BIVE. BIVE’s BR13 initiative provides best-practice advice and leadership tools centred on issues such as non-communicable diseases, mental health and sexual health in a digital format. It is specifically tailored for young people living in rural areas without rapid access to quality, affordable healthcare. AstraZeneca is supporting this category and will also allocate funding to Create Purpose, a Mexican organisation promoting non-communicable disease prevention for orphans and other vulnerable children.

The SDG 4: Quality Education category winner is CAYSTI, a Cameroonian initiative boosting access to STEM and arts education in rural locations using tech-based solutions. Deloitte is the category sponsor.

The SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation prize was awarded to Ekogroup H2O+. This Colombian project is driving behaviour change around rainwater harvesting in the country’s urban areas and will receive support from Reckitt Benckiser.

The SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy funding has been awarded to Climatenza, an initiative accelerating the deployment of solar thermal technology across India’s business sphere. This category is sponsored by BP, which recently invested $200m in solar developer Lightsource.

The SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure category winner is Nepal-based fintech social enterprise Aeloi. Aeoli specialises in tracing climate impact finance and will receive support from Standard Chartered Bank.

The SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities prize went to Blend Edu, a startup working to promote diversity and inclusivity in Brazilian businesses through educational experience. The category sponsor here is Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).

The SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production winner, backed by Mondi Group,is Canadian biotech firm Genecis. Genecis takes low-value organic waste streams and turns them into materials which can be used to replace single-use plastics.

The SDG 13: Climate Action category was specifically open to entrants from the sustainable agriculture space, given that agriculture is a key driver of both emission and nature loss. The winner is Xillinat, a Mexican natural substitute for sugar and sweeteners which requires less land, water and pesticides to produce and is suitable for diabetics. Asahi will support Xillinat.

The SDG 14: Life Below Water funding is being provided by Credit Suisse to repurpose, an Indian social enterprise helping businesses achieve plastic neutrality. Credit Suisse is notably The World Bank’s partner on its sustainable water bond, and, in 2019, aligned its strategy with the SDGs.

Decade of deliverance

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”. Previous backers of the initiative, which is called Lead2030 and has been running since 2018, include KPMG and Porter Novelli.

The announcement of this year’s prize winners comes shortly after UN Global Compact published the results of a survey conducted among representatives from the sustainability teams or C-suite of 615 businesses. Of the respondents, less than one-third said their sector is moving rapidly enough to deliver adequate progress against the SDGs which it should be framing as a priority and just 39% believe that the SDG-related targets set by their own business are ambitious enough.

UNGC argued that while many businesses may feel that social and economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis will hamper their sustainable development progress, they must ultimately seize the moment to increase their ambition, given that the pandemic has highlighted social and environmental issues and could ultimately exacerbate them.

SDG target 17.11 is one of 21 targets with a “2020” deadline (Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ (LDCs) share of global exports by 2020). Likewise, SDG target 14.6 calls for, by 2020, prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, while those subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing are to be eliminated entirely. After nearly 20 years, World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations were closing in on concluding talks on this issue. The WTO Ministerial Conference was set to convene in June 2020, with many eyeing the event as an opportunity to address these and other pressing trade issues, some of which have languished for years.

Instead, the year 2020 will be recalled for very different reasons for the global trade regime. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, including international trade flows. News about trade policy during the last few months has, in many ways, provided a barometer on the unfolding, multi-pronged crisis. As borders closed to stem the human-to-human spread of the virus, implications for trade in essential medical supplies were quickly singled out as priorities for exceptions. The need for continued trade in essential supplies also brought the inequalities that the pandemic exposed into focus. Moreover, the need for collective action to ensure intellectual property rules (IPRs) do not create a hindrance to the crisis response has also been raised in the context of the World Health Organization, where the final COVID-19 resolution includes language referring to the use of previously agreed flexibilities in the WTO’s IPR rules. The growing number of export restrictions on agricultural goods has raised concerns over whether a repeat of past food price crises and a rise in global hunger levels and food insecurity may be on the horizon.

While there were acknowledgements that the extraordinary circumstances justified breaching global agreements or taking advantage of their existing flexibilities, there have also been calls to ensure that multilateral approaches resume as soon as possible, along with reminders that multilateralism will be essential to efforts to build back better.

Furthermore, leadership changes have added to the uncertainties that the pandemic has wrought, while also focusing attention on what is needed to emerge stronger from the pandemic. The May 2020 announcement by World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo of his surprise decision to step down launched a “politically charged” selection process for the next Director-General, despite having a full year remaining in his second term. His successor’s task will be to help the multilateral trading system respond to new economic realities caused by COVID-19.

The SDG Knowledge Hub is publishing news about these and more trade-related policy developments, thanks to support from the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID). The summary below offers a brief overview of the news during the last two months. We encourage you to visit our “Trade” coverage webpage often. IISD is also establishing a peer-to-peer community list to further foster the information flow on trade and sustainable development policy. Sign up for the Trade and SD News group here.

COVID-19 Puts Development Gains at Risk

As projections of the extent of the damage caused by the global pandemic are revised downward, there are growing concerns about sustainable recovery and resilience of the global economic system to future crises.

Already back in April, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a new debt crisis, and recommended actions to build back better for sustainable development, including the elimination of trade barriers and restrictions that affect supply chains. In a Communiqué following its virtual meeting on 17 April, the World Bank Development Committee recognized the pandemic’s “exceptional negative shock” on the global economy and disruptions to trade, supply chains, and investment flows, warning about its potential to “erase development gains for many countries.”

The same month, the WTO forecast that world trade would fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the pandemic. A May 2020 report by the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that COVID-19 had cut global trade values by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, projecting the decline to accelerate, with an expected 27% quarter-on-quarter decline.

The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2020 found that the coronavirus pandemic had caused a “steep drop” in investment flows, hitting developing countries the hardest. During an informal briefing among UN system leaders to discuss building on the UN’s operational framework for social and economic responses to the pandemic, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Mona Juul cited “incomprehensible setbacks to our hard-won development goals” due to COVID-19.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report warned that LDCs, land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, insufficient social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade. Among trade-related impacts in LDCs, a WTO information note highlighted a “significant decline in export earnings” among these countries since the outbreak of COVID-19, which may affect their graduation prospects.

Overcoming the Pandemic

As the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has suggested, the pace of post-COVID-19 recovery will depend on the length of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of policy responses. Over the past months, world leaders, UN agencies, and relevant stakeholders have engaged on various levels to address the crisis and chart the path towards global recovery.

Some of the actions, many of which were spearheaded by the WTO or groups of WTO Members, included:

The Ottawa Group, comprised of 13 WTO Members and devoted to developing options for reforming the organization, outlined six action areasto focus on in light of COVID-19: transparency and withdrawal of trade-restrictive measures; keeping open and predictable trade in agricultural and agrifood products; e-commerce; trade facilitation through the use of information technology and streamlined procedures; an initiative on medical supplies; and deepening engagement with stakeholders.

During the 1 July meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Services, many WTO Members highlighted the importance of sharing experiences, including on trade facilitating measures adopted to address the crisis and promote economic recovery.

The WTO and six multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint statementhighlighting measures taken to step up trade finance programmes to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WTO’s ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020’ report featured market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies as the “special topic.”

The WTO’s 23rd biannual monitoring reporton trade measures, covering the period from mid-October 2019 to mid-May 2020, found that Group of 20 (G20) economies implemented 154 new trade or trade-related measures over the time period, of which 60% were linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several G20 ministerialsconvened in April, many of which were special meetings devoted to the pandemic. Ministers highlighted efforts to promote international trade cooperation while minimizing impacts of COVID-19 though “a coordinated global response.”

A UNCTAD reportoutlined ways to facilitate trade in areas related to process optimization, cost reduction, transparency and cooperation enhancement, and full use of technology to ensure cross-border trade continues while reducing face-to-face interaction.

Another UNCTAD reportdiscussed how South-South cooperation can help build solidarity to weather the interconnected economic and public health crises.

UNCTAD and the five UN regional commissions launched a projectto help governments and businesses keep transport networks and borders operational and facilitate the flow of goods and services, while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.

The International Trade Centre (ITC) released a 15-point action planto support micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Representatives from the UN and its Member States considered actionsto mitigate the potential socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on food availability and supply, and to attain food security.

A webinarconvened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s (IISD) Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) addressed trade and climate change in the context of COVID-19, showcasing examples of national responses and policies being implemented.

A webinar convened by IISD addressed the interlinkages between trade, public health, and intellectual property rights, especially given the COVID-19 resolution negotiated and adopted for the 73rd World Health Assembly.

Engagement with China included an EU-China summit on 22 June where European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, drew attention to “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between China and the EU.

Selection Process for Next WTO Director-General

Amid efforts to bring about the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he will step down on 31 August 2020, cutting his second term short by one year. The selection process for the next Director-General normally spans six months, but following a 10 July announcement by WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), the process has been shortened, with the third and final phase now scheduled to begin on 7 September.

Eight WTO Members (Egypt, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the UK) submitted nominations for the post of WTO Director-General to succeed Azevêdo. Following the closure of the nomination period on 8 July, candidates are meeting with WTO members at a special General Council meeting from 15-17 July to present their views and take questions from the membership. They will then have the remainder of July and all of August to continue making their case for the role.

The platform's standard and artificial-intelligence driven data enables investors to assess companies on their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The product will be available via distribution partner Qontigo.

Solving data challenges

Global investors increasingly consider the SDGs relevant to their investment strategy, policy, asset allocation, investment decisions and active ownership, according to research by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). However, a lack of quality data to identify contributions to the SDGs has been an impediment for investors, and companies struggle to adapt their disclosures to meet investor needs. By providing a globally consistent SDG measurement framework, the SDI Asset Owner Platform helps investors to imbed the SDGs into their investment processes.

Shared understanding of Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs)

The SDI AOP allows asset owners and their managers to connect around the shared objective of measuring and understanding their portfolio investments' contributions to the SDGs. These goals, set by the United Nations in 2015, aim for a better, more prosperous world, by addressing urgent global issues such as water scarcity, healthcare access, and protecting the environment. Investments in companies whose products or services contribute to the realization of the SDGs are called Sustainable Development Investments (SDIs).

AI-driven actionable insights

The SDI Asset Owner Platform provides a common definition, taxonomy, and data source for investments into the SDGs. Powered by AI-technology, data science company Entis generates SDI classifications for 8,000 companies to date. This enables investors to assess their global capital markets' portfolios on their contribution to the SDGs and to report to their clients and external stakeholders transparently and consistently, using a common and auditable standard. The SDI classifications will be commercially available through Qontigo. The SDI definition and taxonomy are public and equally applicable to private market investments.

Asset-owner led platform

The SDI AOP is asset owner-led and asset owners make all methodological choices. The platform builds on the direct input and feedback from asset owners and their managers, and feeds the participating asset owners' policy and investment needs into the assessment process. Subscribers and other stakeholders will also be invited to provide feedback. The SDI Asset Owner Platform will host a virtual event in September to provide interested investors with additional insight into the workings of the platform.

Commitment to the SDGs

The participating asset owners believe it is essential to invest into the SDGs, and to do so at scale. In September 2019, APG and PGGM, at the behest of their pension fund clients ABP, bpfBOUW and PFZW, announced their cooperation to set up the SDI Asset Owner Platform. These pension funds, among them the two largest in the Netherlands, have set ambitious targets for investing in the SDGs. AustralianSuper and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) have since joined the platform. The SDI AOP welcomes investors across the globe to subscribe, creating a critical mass of investors who together define the meaning of investing in the SDGs.

Claudia Kruse, Managing Director Global Responsible Investment & Governance, APG

""The SDGs are global and launching this standard with asset owners from three continents shows our commitment to contribute to the SDGs, and we look forward to extending the collaboration. SDGs and AI-based technology are at the forefront of innovation. This investment is part of our commitment to our clients on whose behalf we invest in order to provide affordable pension in a sustainable world.""

Andrew Gray, Director ESG and Stewardship, AustralianSuper

""As a founding member of the SDI AOP, AustralianSuper strongly welcomes the opportunity to jointly establish a global standard for investors to identify sustainable development investments. The platform will progress how we assess and engage with investee companies on their SDG contribution, measurement and reporting. This will promote real world sustainable outcomes which are vital for creating long-term value for beneficiaries.""

Jennifer Coulson, Vice President ESG, BCI

""Standardization of data is one of the biggest challenges facing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) landscape. For this reason, we are excited to be part of this asset-owner led initiative which sets a global standard on SDG contributions for all investors and brings consistency and comparability to company-level data. This is the type of quality data that BCI relies on when making investment decisions that are required to generate value-added returns for our clients.""

Eloy Lindeijer, Chief Investment Management, PGGM

""For PGGM this platform is an important next step in a process to mobilize ever more institutional capital around the big challenges of our time, as described in the SDGs. By collaborating with asset owners from different continents we hope that this SDI AOP will contribute to being a global standard for investors.''

Sebastian Ceria, Chief Executive Officer, Qontigo

""The application of transparent rules-based methodologies, common definitions, taxonomies and strong data are the bedrock elements required for effective sustainable investing. We are proud to be a part of the SDI Asset Owner Platform's efforts to enhance the ability of investors to achieve their commendable goals in sustainable investing.""

Wim Scheper, Managing Director, Entis

""Contributing to the development of a global standard for SDG investments is truly inspiring. It will guide the decision-making by investors and companies towards a more sustainable world.""

172,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/wto-report-finds-trade-measures-facilitate-imports/,"Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WTO Report Finds Trade Measures Facilitate Imports,"The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) 23rd biannual monitoring report on trade measures finds that the Group of 20 (G20) has continued to facilitate imports, particularly of products related to COVID-19. The report covers the period from mid-October 2019 to mid-May 2020, making it the first one to cover the coronavirus pandemic time period.

The report titled, ‘Report on G20 Trade Measures,’ finds that world trade “fell sharply” in the first half of 2020. Before the pandemic struck, world trade was already slowing due to slowing global economic growth and heightened trade tensions. G20 economies implemented 154 new trade or trade-related measures over the time period, of which 60 percent were linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the COVID-19 related measures, 65 facilitated trade and 28 restricted trade.

Overall, the report notes, 95 measures were of a trade-facilitating nature and 59 were trade-restrictive. New import-facilitating measures, such as the elimination of import taxes, reduction of export duties, and tariff reductions, amount to an estimated USD 735.9 billion in trade, the highest figure recorded since 2014. G20 countries introduced new import-restrictive measures unrelated to COVID-19, amounting to approximately USD 417.5 billion. These import bans, export duties, tariff increases, stricter customs procedures, and other measures affected 2.8 percent of G20 trade.

Although many governments introduced trade restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak, including export bans on medical products, G20 countries have now repealed 36 percent of these restrictions. G20 countries have also lowered import barriers for many pandemic-related products. By mid-May, approximately 70 percent of pandemic-related trade measures were trade facilitating. In addition, governments implemented 468 COVID-19-related economic support measures such as one-off grants, stimulus packages, and support programmes.

The WTO report also highlights evidence of progress towards more open trade policies across sectors, including intellectual property, goods, and services. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo welcomed signs that trade-restrictive measures adopted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic “are starting to be rolled back.” He called for building on these positive indicators and for G20 governments to “work together to facilitate a rapid and inclusive economic recovery.”

WTO members also continued to advance trade negotiations on fisheries subsidies in 2020, the report notes. In late 2019, members stated that they were “fully committed” to reaching an agreement at the June 2020 WTO Ministerial Conference. They affirmed that they were aiming to achieve an “ambitious outcome based on the mandate from” SDG target 14.6, to reach agreement on prohibiting fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, and to eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing. However, the Ministerial Conference was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and restrictions on movement and logistical challenges have hindered members’ ability to engage in detailed negotiations. Still, WTO Members have indicated that they “remain committed to a meaningful outcome.”

The WTO Secretariat has prepared the WTO trade monitoring reports since 2009. G20 members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, and the US.

Azerbaijan has ranked 54th among 166 countries with an overall index score of 72.6, the report revealed. The country of 10 million people demonstrated a strong commitment to all seventeen goals given the overall indicators outlined in the document.

""According to the sustainable development goals index, Azerbaijan is a regional leader. Our country ranks 54th, leaving behind all its neighbors,"" Vusal Gasimli, Executive Director of the Center for the Analysis of Economic Reforms and Communication was quoted by Fed.az as saying in response to the report. ""Russia is 57th, Georgia 58th, Iran 59th, Kazakhstan 65th, Turkey 70th, Armenia 75th, and Turkmenistan 114th in the report.""

He went on to add that Azerbaijan made progress on UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as health, welfare, poverty, nutrition, clean water, clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, peace, justice and strong institutions.

The SDGs are a key focus of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all member states of the United Nations in 2015. Under the key principle of “leaving no one behind,” the agenda mandates a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all around the planet now and into the future. The 17 SDGs, aimed at transforming the world for the better, include no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequality; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships to achieve the goal.

Azerbaijan achieved sustainable development goals in terms of ""no poverty"" according to this year's records. The entire population of the country has access to electricity, while 91.4 percent use basic drinking water services and 98.5 percent have access to improved water sources, according to the report. Around four-fifth or 79.8 percent of the country's ten million population use the internet.

The Caspian country improved its performance in the category of security and safety, compared to the previous report. The homicide rate per 100,000 people is 2.0, which was 2.1 in the 2019 report. Walking alone at night in the city or area where they live is safe for 82.4 of the population, meant to be 7.7 percent more than in the last year.

Despite the 99.9 percent literacy rate among the population aged 15 to 24, Azerbaijan recorded a decrease in the quality of education index due to the declined net primary enrollment rate (92.4%) and low secondary completion rate (84.4%). In the previous report, these two rates were indicated at 93.7 percent and 88.45 percent respectively.

""Azerbaijan scored 72.6 out of a possible 100 points in the Sustainable Development Goals Index. For comparison, the average Sustainable Development Goals Index in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is 70.9,"" Gasimli said while mentioning also the 38.6 Gini coefficient of the country, which, according to him, is one of the world's best outcomes of its kind. The Gini coefficient or Gini index/Gini ratio is a statistical measure of economic inequality in a population.

The government of Azerbaijan approved a strategic roadmap for the social and economic development of the key sectors with short-term (by 2020), medium-term (by 2025), and long-term target outlooks (beyond 2025), of which many goals fit in with the SDGs. The country was among the pioneers of the region to undertake missions designed for identifying definitive steps that would help accelerate the implementation of SDGs.

These achievements followed drastic improvements in ease of doing business in Azerbaijan. In the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report for 2018, Azerbaijan claimed a spot among the top ten socio-economic reformers. During the same year, Azerbaijan hosted the first high-level forum on sustainable development, a platform for looking into practical solutions to challenges involving inclusive economic growth, productive employment, gender equality, youth participation, peaceful coexistence and justice for all, as well as access to clean resources and tackling climate change.","Azerbaijan scored the best results among Caspian Sea and South Caucasus countries evaluated in the Sustainable Development Report 2020, which measures the commitment of 166 nations to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by the United Nations.

Addressing climate change is a crucial part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, yet countries have made little progress on this goal. In the years ahead, countries have to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can join us in taking action on this issue here

Dozens of developing nations across the globe have achieved the targets for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action — reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate resilience — while developed countries remain far behind, according to a recent report by the UN.

The Sustainable Development Report 2020 notes that 43 countries in Africa have achieved the targets for SDG 13, alongside more than a dozen other countries throughout Asia and Latin America. Moldova is the only country in Europe to have achieved SDG 13.

A color-coded map in the report shows where countries stand in terms of general progress on the goal based on several academic papers from the past few years, including from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Countries that have achieved the five targets of SDG 13 are in green, while those farthest behind are in red.

This map shows progress made towards SDG 13. Countries in green have achieved the SDG. Yellow indicates that challenges remain; orange that significant challenges remain; red that major challenges remain; grey that information is unavailable.

Of the top 10 greenhouse gas emitters in the world, which account for nearly 70% of global emissions, only India is in green. China, the largest emitter in the world, has improved on climate action in recent years, but faces challenges that currently make achieving the goal by 2030 unlikely, including an overreliance on coal, a relentless construction industry, and growing energy demands.

The US, the second largest emitter, has regressed on goal 13 in recent years and is nowhere near achieving the targets. In recent years, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, scrapped plans to improve the gas mileage of cars, unraveled a plan to increase the efficiency of power plants, and has made it easier for companies to drill for fossil fuels.

Countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Vietnam, and Pakistan have all reached the targets of goal 13. In the case of Ethiopia, the government is working to reduce agricultural emissions, promote forest growth, invest in renewable energy, and implement energy efficiency throughout industries.

What this means in terms of achieving the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, isn’t discussed at length in the report. The SDGs do not include concrete emissions reductions or temperature increase targets.

As a result, critics have argued that the SDGs fail to meaningfully address climate change and that even if they’re achieved, the global environment will continue to deteriorate and emissions will remain at catastrophic levels.

The Climate Action Tracker, which assesses how the emissions reductions of countries relate to a warming climate, found that only Morocco has developed a plan compatible with the Paris climate agreement. Only two countries — India and Ethiopia — have plans compatible with staying under a 2 degrees Celsius rise.

Because leading polluters have failed to take climate change seriously, the world is far from achieving SDG 13 by 2030, and will likely blow past the Paris climate agreement goal of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unless dramatic interventions are made, then the world could pass the 1.5 degree Celsius mark in the next four years and temperatures could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which would usher in apocalyptic consequences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in global emissions, but analysts forecast that emissions will bounce back in the years ahead because emissions had been steadily rising in recent years, despite record levels of investment in renewable energy.

The fact that renewable energy is booming around the world, yet emissions continue to rise, shows how growth-oriented economies undermine climate action.

For emissions to decline at levels required by the Paris agreement, countries would have to overhaul their entire economies. In the aftermath of the pandemic, countries have the opportunity to embark on green economic recoveries that scale down carbon-intensive and environmentally harmful industries like fossil fuel production.

Projects such as the Great Green Wall in Africa — which seeks to regenerate landscapes across the Sahel and create community-based economic development — are a powerful model for the years ahead.

This year marks 10 years to go until the 2030 target to end extreme poverty and achieve the targets set out under the SDGs. With the release of the Sustainable Development Report 2020, we’re taking a deep dive into the successes we’ve already made — and barriers that still exist — when it comes to achieving the SDGs and ending extreme poverty by 2030.

The event was organized by the UNU Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA), UNU Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS), UNU Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA).



The session built on the UNU-INRA report on African Development in the Age of Stranded Assets, which discusses Africa’s development in light of potential asset stranding. The report aims to raise awareness on the need for effective natural resource management by African governments to achieve lower-carbon economies.



Osabarima Owusu Baafi Aboagye III, Chief of Akyem Dwenase, presented a keynote message on behalf of Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, King of Akyem Abuakwa, Ghana. He said Africa’s policymakers must avoid the risk of stranded hydrocarbon resources and use them to drive the continent’s industrialization agenda.



Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, Japan, highlighted partnerships with developing countries to support the SDGs through integrated policy approaches.



Fatima Denton, Director, UNU-INRA, said COVID-19 has created major problems for hydrocarbon-dependent economies, with the sharp decrease in global oil prices. She explained Africa faces a paradox of plenty with rich hydrocarbon and mineral resources, while remaining largely energy poor. She highlighted the need to, inter alia:

decouple economic growth from carbon intensive investments;

scale up solar PV deployment;

harness renewable energy potential;

investment in digital economies; and

unlock climate finance.

On ways to manage the risks of stranded assets and opportunities of green transitions in Africa, panelists emphasized, among others, the importance of public sector investment to leverage private investment in clean energy solutions. They also discussed ways to ensure green transitions in urban spaces and support sustainable cities in Africa, emphasizing that decarbonization creates green jobs. Panelists also emphasized the need to include measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in COVID-19 recovery strategies, and break policymaking silos and follow diverse pathways that include renewable energy.

The event took place on 10 July 2020 in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Addressing ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council) commemoration of UN's 75th anniversary, the Prime Minister said the 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' (together for everyone's growth with everyone's trust) motto resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind.

""India also contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the SDGs. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We are also supporting other developing countries in meeting their SDGs,"" he said.

""Our motto is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. This resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. Be it access to nutrition, health education, electricity or housing. We are making great progress through our inclusive programmes,"" the Prime Minister said.

He said other developing countries can learn from the scale and success of India's development programmes.

""It is this realisation that underpins India's own development partnership with the Global South,"" he said.

Noting that over the past few years India has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, he said this was achieved by electrifying our villages, providing clean cooking fuel to 80 million poor households and the introduction of energy-efficient measures.

""We have set a target to install 450 Gigawatt of renewable energy and restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. We have an age-old tradition of living in harmony with nature,"" Modi said.He said that the government has launched one of the largest campaigns for cleanliness and discouraged usage of single-use plastic. He stated that the setting up of International Solar Alliance was a practical manifestation of climate action.

""Similarly, the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure brings together all relevant stakeholders for a comprehensive approach. We have always prided ourselves as the first responder in our region -- a friend in need,"" the Prime Minister said.

Modi said that his government has given the highest priority to deliver benefits to the poor households.

""We have announced a package of more than USD 300 billion. It will bring the economy back on track, build modern infrastructure and put in place a technology-driven system. We have put forward a vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', a self-reliant and resilient India, integrated with the global economy,"" the Prime Minister said.

Talking about the COVID-19 fight, the Prime Minister said that the grassroots health system is ""helping India ensure one of the best recovery rates in the world"".

Speaking about his government's initiatives, Modi said that India achieved full sanitation coverage in 6,00,000 villages on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also spoke about the country's improvement in rural sanitation cover, food security and how women-oriented programmes have transformed lives and livelihoods.

""In five years, we built over 110 million household toilets, which improved our rural sanitation cover from 38 per cent to 100 per cent. Our massive awareness generation programmes are empowering our women. We have achieved gender parity in elementary and secondary education,"" he said.

The Prime Minister noted that nearly 70 million women in rural India are part of self-help groups under the Livelihood Mission. ""They are transforming lives and livelihoods on a big scale. Over a million women are elected representatives of our local governments, leading the process of participatory development,"" the Prime Minister said.

""In the last six years, we opened 400 million bank accounts for the unbanked, out of which 220 million are owned by women. We have leveraged the power of technology for financial inclusion. This is based on the trinity of a unique identity number, a bank account and a mobile connection for everyone. It has allowed us to make Direct Benefit Transfers of USD 150 billion to over 700 million people. Our food security programmes reach 813 million citizens,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that the 'Housing for All' programme will ensure that every Indian will have a safe and secure roof over his head by 2022, when India completes 75 years of independence. ""By then, 40 million new homes would have been made under this programme, more than the total number of households in many countries,"" he added.

The Prime Minister said 'Ayushmaan Bharat' scheme is the world's largest health protection programme, covering 500 million individuals. He also said that India is on track to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025.

The improvement was discussed as Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of Belarus, the national coordinator for reaching the SDGs Anatoly Isachenko met with Executive Director of the Dortmund International Education Center Astrid Zam on 6 July, BelTA has learned.

The meeting was arranged as a videoconference. Astrid Zam congratulated Belarus on moving up the ranks. The SDG Index measures how countries accomplish all the 17 SDGs and ranks them on the basis of their total score.

Cooperation in reaching SDGs was discussed during the meeting, including opportunities available via the German government's Belarus support program with assistance of regional workgroups on sustainable development. Astrid Zam suggested discussing and agreeing actions in this area and other ones.

Anatoly Isachenko stressed that Belarus appreciates the ability to cooperate with the Dortmund International Education Center in reaching SDGs. The national coordinator pointed out that Astrid Zam is a participant of the recently established Belarus-Germany strategic consultative group. Thus, matters of sustainable development have become part of the bilateral agenda, he noted. The deputy speaker of the upper chamber of the Belarusian parliament thanked the executive director and her colleagues for constructive cooperation and for the attention paid to regional aspects within the framework of the support program. “The importance of work on SDGs at the regional level was stressed at a recent session of the Sustainable Development Council. We intend to pay close attention to this area,” the senator said.

During the meeting the sides discussed matters of SDG achievement at the regional level, plans to study the experience of the German parliament in evaluating draft legislation for compliance with the SDGs. Prospects of organizing a Sustainable Development Week in Belarus were discussed. Talking to reporters, the deputy speaker explained that the week will include a series of events, which can be held in various formats taking into account the epidemiological situation. “It needs to be discussed not only with the executive director of the Dortmund center but also with the Sustainable Development Council, with the partner group and other interested parties,” he said. The Sustainable Development Week in Belarus is expected to become part of similar European weeks.

The program to support Belarus has been in progress since 2002. The Dortmund International Education Center is one of the parties responsible for implementing the program. The ninth stage of the program began in June 2019.

Mirzayee says ultimately all of the youth projects are tied to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. So these are 17 goals that were put out by the UN that countries are supposed to achieve by the year 2030.

“For example one of the goals that the United Nations has put out is quality education. Another goal is no hunger, another goal is climate change, climate action, sanitation, water, water rights.”

Other goals include gender equality, goals targeting good health and industry and infrastructure, according to Mirzayee.

When youth ambassadors are accepted to the program they will go through four different weekends of training and are matched with a mentor to help with the process and each youth group is given a $500 grant to implement their project.

Youth can be between the ages of 15 and 25 to signup for the volunteer projects and mentors can be between the ages of 18 and 35. Mirzayee says the mentor will commit to around eight to 10 hours per month from August 2020 to February 2021 and they will be matched with two to three youth to help them create tangible community projects.

Part of the provincial government’s initial strategy for domestic tourism is to promote hyper-local tourism.

SDG received over $78,000 funding. Part of the funding has been used to hire two summer students as Tourism Cycling Ambassadors.

The students will cycle the waterfront trail, interacting with cycling visitors and promoting tourism in SDG.

SDG Tourism is outfitting the students with its Ride with GPS platform to map out cycling tours to bring visitors in from the waterfront trail to other parts of the counties.

The balance of the funding will be used for online, social media campaigns and digital content for the SDG Tourism website.

It was also the first day of work for Helen Thomson, who since that time has amassed more than 40 years of municipal experience in a career that began as an administrative assistant in the planning department.

“I feel very fortunate to have had such a long career at the County and I truly enjoyed my work,” Thomson said. “I have worked with many great Wardens, Councils and staff. The County has seen me through many of life’s milestones – getting married, having children and now grandchildren.”

Thomson said her decision to retire came with “mixed emotions” as she weighed her love of work along with her love of family.

“I discovered through the COVID shut down, I really enjoy being at home,” she said. “My office visitors were one-, two- and three-year-olds and a farmer who stopped for lunch. I have realized it is time.”

Thomson said she is looking forward to more time with her husband Don on their Martintown-area dairy farm. She and Don have three children, Drew, Kurtis and Kelsey, as well as five grandchildren, Brooke, Tristan, Scotlyn, Adelyn and Ashton. County CAO Tim Simpson congratulated Thomson on her decision and added a successor will have large shoes to fill.

“I have worked with many staff members over my own 30-year career in municipal government, and I can truly say that there is no one I have enjoyed working alongside more than Helen,” said Simpson. “Her loyalty to the County, professionalism, and work ethic are second to none. She has been my ‘go to’ colleague for almost 10 years and her retirement marks the end of an era in SDG.”

Warden Frank Prevost likewise congratulated Thomson on a most-deserving retirement.

“If I have a question, I know that Helen has the answer,” said Prevost. “On behalf of County Councils both past and present, I wish Helen all the best in her retirement and I know she will enjoy her time as a grandmother in the years to come.”

The County will begin work on a succession plan soon, with an update for County Council coming later this year.

The Gini coefficient for Bangladesh fluctuates around the trend line, but the overall trend is downward from 48.9 in 2000 to 31.5 in 2010 indicating declining income inequality. But a much clearer picture of income distribution emerges when one looks at the income distribution between the poorest 10 per cent and the richest 10 per cent. The picture that emerges is: the income share of the poorest 10 per cent is 3.85 per cent compared to 26.92 per cent of the richest 10 per cent. In effect, the income share held by the highest 20 per cent is 41.48 per cent. An estimated 63 million people live under the poverty line in a country of 163 million people.

Bangladesh has also witnessed rapid urbanisation with more than a third of its population now living in urban areas. Although population growth rate has come down to 1.2 per cent per annum, the country remains one of the most densely populated in the world. This urbanisation has been spurred by structural changes in the rural economy resulting from the increased commercialisation of the agriculture sector and widespread rural poverty. But this rapid urbanisation has caused heightened urban poverty with extremely poor living conditions for these rural migrants and also urban congestion.

CLIMATE CHANGE, MIGRATION AND URBAN POVERTY: The genesis of migration lies in people's quest to live or subsist in a form better than their present status. Some migrate for sheer survival, that is, to escape from poverty; others, to improve their quality of life, while still others in search for fortune. Since each of these pursuits is made by people who come from different socio-economic strata and hence have a different purpose for moving, migration is quite a heterogeneous phenomenon. In contemporary low-income economies, however, the principal reason for people to move is the worsening productive-resource-to-human-power ratio, stemming mainly from rapid population growth and an external demand for local resources. This has compelled large sections of the populace to migrate to look for work as a part of their survival strategy. Depending upon the needs and circumstances, people move seasonally, for fixed periods, or permanently. In this sense, the transition economies of South-East Asia, some of which are among the poorer ones in the world, present a picture typical of other low-income countries.

SLUMISATION AND POOR URBAN SETTLEMENTS: The role of migration in urbanisation is obvious in all societies and at almost all times, since urbanisation and urban growth take place through a combination of three components, such as (a) natural increase of the native urban population, (b) area redefinition or reclassification or annexation, and (c) rural-urban (or other forms of internal) migration. In a condition of developing urbanisation, the role of migration is even more pronounced while in the state of advanced urbanisation, where urban growth is almost stagnant or even declining, internal migration plays a minor or almost no role. Rural to urban migration may again take many forms, such as (a) permanent migration, (b) temporary migration, (c) seasonal migration, (d) circular migration, and (c) commuting. The process ranges from short distance mobility (commuting) to long distance and long term movement or permanent migration. In the case of Bangladesh, the status of academic as well as planning studies on internal migration is not too bad, although, all dimensions of internal migration might not have received enough attention. Considerable literature exists on the subject of determinants or causes of rural to urban migration. A Bangladeshi scholar working at an American University has, in a recent paper, classified the models of migration into two groups (i) one which isolates migration as a domestic phenomenon and (ii) the other which places causes of migration within an international politico-economic framework. Migration is the combined effect of both push and pulls factors and it is often difficult to separate the role of the two. Within the Push-Pull model, push factors (at rural end) may be identified for Bangladesh as: 1) Population pressure, adverse person-land ratio, landlessness and poverty; 2) Frequent and severe natural disasters (particularly river bank erosion), and 3) Lack of economic opportunities.

The impact rural to urban migration is both diverse and deep, both at the urban destination end and at the rural origin. Most of the researches have been at the urban end. Urbanisation and urban growth occurring due to migration have both positive and negative consequences and impacts. Some of the positive consequences of urbanisation are the following: Economic benefits: higher productivity, better income etc; Demographic benefits: lowering of age at marriage, reduction of fertility rate; Socio-cultural benefits: modernisation; Political benefits: empowerment, democracy.

Urbanisation is not an unmixed blessing. Its negative consequences are of great concern. These assume critical role under situation of rapid and uncontrolled or unplanned urban expansion. The negative consequences can be grouped as the following: Environmental consequences-- encroachment on productive agricultural land and forests, extreme pressure on housing, growth of slums and the pressure on and urban services; Economic consequences-- income inequality and poverty, ill effects of globalisation; Social consequences-- increased violence and crime, social degradation; Cultural consequences-- entry of alien culture, loss of national cultural identity.

HIDDEN IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AMONG URBAN POOR: Climate change can directly affect health because high temperatures place an added stress on human physiology. Changes in temperatures and precipitation including extreme weather events and storms can cause deaths directly, or by altering the environment, result in an increased incidence of infectious diseases. Air pollution can be exacerbated by higher temperature and humidity. Finally, virtually all effects of global climate change ranging from sea-level rise to impacts on agriculture and human infrastructures are linked at least indirectly to human health.

The incidence and severity of many health problems increase with increasing temperature. As temperatures increase, the body expands added energy to keep cool. The most immediate consequence, if the body temperature rises above 410 C, is heat stroke. This disturbance to the temperature regulating mechanism may result in fever, hot and dry skin, rapid pulse and sometimes progress to delirium and coma. Also, temperature stress can exacerbate many existing health conditions including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Mortality from such diseases, especially among children and the elderly, increases dramatically during periods of hot weather. Quantitative algorithms based on historical data that relate morbidity and mortality to weather conditions suggest that global warming will increase heart related mortality.

The combination of higher temperatures and potential increases in summer precipitation could create the conditions for greater intensity or spread of many infectious diseases. However, risk in the human health sector is low relative to climate change induced risks in other sectors (such as water resources) mainly because of the higher uncertainty about many of the health outcomes. Increased risk to human health from increased flooding and cyclones seems most likely. Changes in infectious disease are less certain. The causes of outbreaks of infectious disease are quite complex and often do not have a simple relationship with increasing temperature or change in precipitation. It is not clear if the magnitude of the change in health risks resulting from climate change will be significant compared to current risks. It is also not clear if increased health risk will be apparent in the next few decades. On the whole, climate change is expected to present increased risks to human health in Bangladesh, especially in the light of the poor state of the country's public health infrastructure.

In general, climate change impacts tend to be more on the poor than the rich. Inequality is not inevitable, it is a policy preference. Regarding sustainable urbanism, policymakers should improve urban efficiency in order to lower the cost of living by dealing with urban crowding and providing public goods, eliminate the causes that lead to squatter settlements, and not discourage internal migration, which fosters an efficient allocation of the population and has an equalising effect across places.

This country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

States presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations in a two week-long conference which included a high-level political forum on sustainable development and a three-day ministerial meeting held under the UN Economic and Social Council. The theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Beckles in her presentation of TTs first VNRs noted that it was centred around eight of the 17 SDGs and they were incorporated into TT’s national development strategy and vision 2030. The eight SDGs are good health care (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).

She explained that TT’s plan focused on putting people first by nurturing asset; delivering good governance and service excellence; improving productivity through quality infrastructure and transportation; building globally competitive businesses and placing the environment at the centre of social and economic development.

Beckles said, “Our commitment to “Leaving No-One Behind” has been anchored in the strengthening of the country's public policy framework through vision 2030 and the implementation of several policy initiatives directly related to SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5 and SDG 10.”

She noted that while TT and the world suffered tremendous losses due to covid19, this country minimised economic contraction through adjustments, reforms, and private sector support.

“Government has taken a multi-dimensional approach, with the introduction of a number of financial and economic measures to minimise contraction of the economy and maintain economic activity.

“This was in conjunction with the creation of a 'Road to Recovery' committee which comprised representatives from government, private sector, civil society, labour and academia, which was established to develop a plan for the reopening of society and the road to economic recovery for the post-pandemic period,” Beckles said.

She highlighted the progress within the health system through improved statistics in mortality rates with the Perinatal Information System which improves evidenced-based clinical decision-making for mothers and their new-born babies.

Beckles noted that, “The system contributed to the annual decline in the maternal mortality rate between 2015, from 42.9 per 100,000 live births to 12.3 per 100,000 live births, in 2018.

“Our nation's health sector also recorded a decline in the under-five mortality rates from 13.9 per 1,000 live births in 2016 to 11.3 per 1,000 live births in 2018.”

Beckles further noted TT’s moves to provide education for all with the increase of in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centers (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) through the increased participation of women in politics and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).

“The increase of the national minimum wage from $15 per hour, to $17.50 per hour, was in part aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable. These measures are further supported by a robust legal and policy framework which includes child protection and Gender -Based Violence units in our police service, she said.

Climate change, a big concern for small island developing states (SIDS) was of key importance to TT, Beckles pointed out and its contribution has been continued reduction in overall cumulative emissions from the electricity generation, industry, and transportation sectors.

Beckles added that TT continued to strive for strong institutions with the collaboration of government, law enforcement, academia, and civil societies among others for its effectiveness, but there remained challenges.

She said, “Undoubtedly, TT has made commendable strides. We are more cognisant of the challenges that could hinder our realisation of the 2030 Agenda. Climate change, citizen insecurity, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and the uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic can all undermine our development ambitions.”","Beckles present TT’s SDG goals progress to UNFile photo: Pennelope BecklesThis country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

Today, the UN’s Joint SDG Fund announces a historical $US60 million grant to close the SDG financing gap. The multi-year commitment, with an initial disbursement of $29 million being released this month, is considered the largest systemic UN led initiative on SDG financing in its history. With funding to be distributed across all continents, 40% will invest in Least Developed Countries and ten initiatives are to be implemented in Small Island Developing States.

“We have a historic opportunity to advocate for change, to curb inequalities and to invest in building resilience and sustainable development,” stated Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed at the recent SIDA Development Talks, Building back better – Finance and Development Leaders in Joint Action .

The Joint SDG Fund is committed to supporting a coherent and cohesive UN system. The investments in 62 Joint Programmes will offer pragmatic solutions, all assessed as relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: from addressing reduced fiscal space to align with the SDGs amidst COVID-19 recovery and financial planning to co-creating a new generation of risk-sensitive and responsive Integrated National Financing Frameworks. The results of the investment in SDG financing interventions will begin to materialize in the first quarter of 2021.

In March 2020, the Joint SDG Fund received 258 proposals to support SDG financing interventions in over 100 countries. The proposals were submitted to co-create a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) financing architecture at the national level and support countries by integrating the SDGs across national public financial systems and more effective public-private collaboration, ensuring that no one is left behind.

Mongolia’s Minister of Finance Khurelbaatar Chimed commented, ""The approval of the Joint Programme marks an important milestone in Mongolia's sustainable finance journey. The programme aims to catalyze more financial flows to deliver on the newly approved ambitious Vision-2050 by implementing several reforms that ensure better governance, coordination, and monitoring of integrated national SDG financing strategies. These strategies will also contribute to shaping a post-crisis future for Mongolia - one that is more resilient, inclusive, and ensuring gender equality. We highly appreciate the UN's timely support and partnership on this important initiative that will inspire local, regional and global stakeholders.""

The current health and economic crisis are a unique opportunity to make the world more inclusive and sustainable and this unique opportunity will not end here. The Joint SDG Fund will announce the results of the selection of Component 2, through the funding of catalytic investments able to mobilize financing at scale, in July 2020. This will give more countries an even greater opportunity to recover better.

With sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Government of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Kingdom of Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Private Sector funding, all continents will receive the historic opportunity to build back better.","Listen to articleToday, the UN’s Joint SDG Fund announces a historical $US60 million grant to close the SDG financing gap.

The report, published by Jordan Kelly-Linden under the title “COVID-19 dries up hopes of ending global water poverty by 2030, campaigners warn”, sheds light on the increasing water insecurity under the pandemic, rendering the sustainable development goal (SDG) of the UN to deliver safe water and sanitation for all by 2030 off track.

The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

The outbreak requires proper water and sanitation, and washing hands to maintain hygiene, according to the report, which adds that “more than 297,000 children less than five years die due to diarrhoea linked to inadequate wash facilities every year”.

""Poor sanitation and contaminated water are also linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid,"" the report adds.

""The water sector in Jordan has been able to provide water for all since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, especially potable, clean and safe water that matches the highest international standards,"" Assistant Secretary General and Spokesperson at the Water Ministry Omar Salameh told The Jordan Times on Monday.

Jordan has been working on securing water for all as per the UN’s SDG 6 on water and sanitation for all, Salameh said, noting that work focused on sustainable provision of water to citizens and refugees.

Salameh also said that the water sector has dealt with sanitation water through proper management and using sterilisation to prevent the transmission of the virus.

The ministry has also been working on utilising rainfall through expanding the capacity of dams, he concluded.

The UN's SDG 6 aims to provide access to safe and affordable drinking water, universally and equitably, no later than 2030, the report says, quoting International coordinator at End Water Poverty Al Hassan Adam as saying: ""Yet with just a decade to go and COVID-19 only complicating the issue, these basic human rights are not being met.""","The report quotes campaigners as saying that the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled efforts to improve hygiene standards around the world, “just when access to safe water is needed most”.

Article content DUNVEGAN — Perhaps one day there’ll be a COVID-19 exhibit. That’ll be determined down the road, but right now, the main focus for many of the cultural institutions in the region is simply re-opening during the pandemic, and another one did on Wednesday: the Glengarry Pioneer Museum, just down the road in Dunvegan. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. It's a new world too for Cornwall/SDG heritage and cultural sites Back to video “We’re excited to announce (the re-opening),” said Glengarry Pioneer Museum curator/administrator Jennifer Black, when the facility issued a new release about the beginning of the 2020 season. Acknowledging that COVID-19 has “created a new reality for Canadians,” Black noted life, like everywhere else, won’t be business as usual, that for the first time in its long history the Glengarry Pioneer Museum will be having visits made by reservation, with guests encouraged to phone or email to reserve an arrival time. “It’s a novel opportunity to reserve a heritage site knowing that there will only be a few other small groups besides you and your family,” Black said. “You can enjoy the grounds visiting the heritage buildings, (and) pack a picnic and stay a while.”

Article content Black said the museum may enjoy some advantages during the current situation, in that it is in a small and somewhat remote community in North Glengarry – an attractive destination for those in larger centres. And, because the population in Dunvegan and surroundings is small and the area is large, “it’s easier for us to meet the standards set by public health to ensure that we can once again open our doors,” she said. The museum will be open each day Wednesday to Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. More On This Topic Ontario tourism minister shares thoughts on sector's recovery Cornwall Community Museum adds model of HMCS Stormont to collection St. Lawrence loyalist association director wins youth achievement award Meanwhile, the limited public hours this month at Cornwall Community Museum in Lamoureux Park continue. There’s guided museum visitation each Saturday and Sunday, on the hour each day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and an appointment is recommended. Guided tours can have a maximum of three per group, or five if from the same household. On Thursdays, research can be done by appointment. Bookings can be made by calling 613-936-0280, or emailing cornwalllhistory@outlook.com. In Lakewood Heights near Long Sault, the Lost Villages Museum is expected to open this weekend. In Williamstown, the Glengarry, Nor’Westers and Loyalist Museum won’t be opening this season, as renovations continue at the building. Back in Dunvegan, Black said the facility has done everything possible to make sure that staff and visitors enjoy the quaint, historic site.

Article content “Staff will greet (guests) with a mask and offer either a guided or self-guided walking tour,” she said. “Physical distancing and making use of extra hand sanitizing stations around the site is necessary. (And), with several small, historic buildings on site, only one household or ‘bubble’ will be allowed in each building at a time.” There will be a strict ‘no-touching’ of the artifacts policy, and there’ll be increased cleaning and disinfecting throughout the facility. “People need to be mindful of our new reality for the time being,” Black said. “But having a fun outing to a local museum can be added to your list of things to do this summer. . .(the museum is) a hidden gem in North Glengarry. With the pandemic still looming, staying local and exploring your own backyard is something everyone should take advantage of.” For details about the site that has 10 heritage buildings spread out over 4.5 acres with vast green spaces, visit glengarrypioneermuseum.ca. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

190,https://caribbeannewsservice.com/caribbean-countries-among-those-benefitting-from-un-sdg-financing/,"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",caribbeannewsservice.com,Caribbean Countries among those benefitting from UN SDG Financing,"



As Eastern Caribbean countries strive to build back better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress toward attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), support is being provided as part of a historic United Nations Joint SDG Fund US$60 million grant launched to close the SDG financing gap and foster more inclusive, sustainable and resilient countries across the world.

In response to a global call, United Nations Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, in collaboration with the governments of Barbados, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, has been awarded a USD$1 million Joint SDG Fund Grant after successfully submitting a proposal for a joint programme entitled ‘Harnessing Blue Economy Finance for SIDS Recovery and Sustainable Development’. The initiative will support the efforts of the three participating Eastern Caribbean governments to develop financing strategies in the Blue Economy and create an enabling framework for SDG investment. The successful proposal was among 62 joint programmes selected from 258 submissions supporting interventions in over 100 countries.

The two-year USD$1,140,000 Joint Programme will be led by the United National Development Programme (UNDP), with participation from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It will also benefit from counterpart funding of USD$140,000 from the three participating UN agencies.





The joint UN SDG Fund is a critical facet of the ongoing global UN reform, which enables the UN Sub-regional team in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean to access funding for SDG acceleration support to countries, working under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, by leveraging the individual strengths of specialized funds, agencies and programmes, to ‘deliver results as one’ and ensure that no one is left behind.

In welcoming the new joint initiative, that exemplifies the UN’s approach to ‘deliver as one’, UN Resident Coordinator, Didier Trebucq noted: “This presents another opportunity for the UN development system working cohesively, to deepen its partnerships with Governments of the Eastern Caribbean and to foster blue economic growth through innovative financing mechanisms, while ensuring that the SDGs are at the forefront of national policy and no one is left behind.”

With the Blue Economy engaged as a driver for regional economic recovery and development, emphasis will be placed on creating an enabling environment for Blue Economy financing by identifying policy gaps, key opportunities and specific financing mechanisms for achieving resilient growth. This catalytic investment will address the current financial challenges of the beneficiary countries, including the additional financial burden arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and build on existing partnerships with the private sector and development financing institutions, as well as existing UN projects on Blue Economy and other SDG-related areas in-country.

Speaking on the significance of the initiative, UNDP Resident Representative Magdy Martinez-Soliman stated: “The COVID-19 crisis has affected the Caribbean’s ambitions to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It has drained away resources that were much needed to finance the SDGs. This Joint Programme will support Barbados, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in their efforts to develop financing strategies in the Blue Economy and SDG investments. The three countries are at the vanguard of the Blue Economy “wave” in the region.”

The UN investments in 62 Joint Programmes around the world will offer pragmatic solutions, all assessed as relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: from addressing reduced fiscal space to align with the SDGs amidst COVID-19 recovery and financial planning to co-creating a new generation of risk-sensitive and responsive Integrated National Financing Frameworks. The results of the investment in SDG financing interventions will begin to materialize in the first quarter of 2021, and a second component is expected to be launched by the Joint SDG Fund soon that would allow other countries to benefit.","As Eastern Caribbean countries strive to build back better from COVID-19 and accelerate progress toward attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), support is being provided as part of a historic United Nations Joint SDG Fund US$60 million grant launched to close the SDG financing gap and foster more inclusive, sustainable and resilient countries across the world.

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to video

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

Here’s a rather large sample of some of the graduation signs in Cornwall and across the area.","Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to videoBefore long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

In McIntosh’s case, he is pursuing criminology at Carleton University in the fall. He would like to defend people in court who allege they’ve been wrongly accused. He’s attended, court sessions which also sparked his interest.

“My mom worked for lawyers, ever since I was a kid,” said McIntosh. “I’ve always been around it and it was something I’ve wanted to do ever since I was young.

“I chose Carleton because the program is best suited for what I want to do when I graduated.”

He looks forward to start studying for a career in law, with an aspiration to become an attorney. He also wants to enjoy living in Ottawa as he lived and worked on a family dairy farm his entire life. He notes living in a big city will be interesting as he lived in the country his entire life.

“More people is going to be the biggest thing,” said McIntosh. “More people and more noise in the city.”

He just graduated from Tagwi Secondary School near Avonmore and was part of the web leader and link crew in school. Link crew is for Grade 9s and web leader is for Grade 7s.

“I learned leadership and that it’s important to make everyone feel included and it makes the transition to high school a lot easier for a lot of kids,” said McIntosh. “When I came to school, I knew how scary it was and link crew and web leader helped me find friends in addition to that.”

McIntosh participated in various sports and teams during his high school years, also playing competitive lacrosse for the Cornwall Celtics. He played football, soccer, and ran cross-country, where he won the spirit award.

Though the announcement was already known and shared municipally, the province announced just over $5 million in roadwork funding Thursday.

The Cornwall camp is open to children aged six to 12, whereas the Alexandria camp is open to children four to 12. “This is significantly smaller than previous years and that stems from the requirements in following the guidelines from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Eastern Ontario Health Unit,” said Jacquie Richards, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG. “Regulations in place allow us to only have a certain amount of spots available this year.”

It just wasn’t sure what kind of summer camp it would turn out to be. “Everything changes so quickly with the COVID situation,” she said. “Regardless of what was happening, we we’re going to have camp, a certain version of camp, whether that was going to be physical camp, which is on premise or virtual camp.” More On This Topic Cornwall Boys and Girls Club take part in Giving Tuesday Cornwall Boys & Girls Club kids get Best Buy scholarships When the Boys and Girls Club received the go ahead to host the summer camp, its team took the time to reformat the camp’s procedures and formats in order to comply with the many safety and health measures. “We want to offer the camp in a fun and engaging way,” said Richards. “Our No. 1 priority is the safety and the well-being of the children, their families and our staff.” The club may be the first to open registration for a summer day camp in the region. The City of Cornwall doesn’t run day camp programs, and other area municipalities and agencies either already cancelled summer programs, or haven’t announced if they will open. The St. Lawrence River Institute is running a smaller version of its summer science camp, with information on registration and the program available on its website. This year’s activities will be promoting physical distancing, while maintaining fun. These include indoor and outdoor play, crafts, science experiments, water-related activities and more. There won’t be any field trips or out-trips that require transportation.

Article content Although children won’t be forced to wear masks while at camp, they will be welcome to wear them if they want to. Staff members working in camps will be wearing masks however, when they are indoors and not capable of physically distancing. In addition, there will be daily health screenings when a child is dropped off to camp. This includes a check of the child’s temperature. Parents will also be asked to print and complete a screening questionnaire each day, prior to arriving at the camp, in order to speed up dropoff routines. “When we decided to offer a summer program, it really was respond to that need from families, specifically reaching out to us, seeking out summer child-care options,” said Richards. “Many families have reached out, needing to have a program in place for summer. Part of our role in the community is to respond to that need as best we can, as safely as we can.” In addition to the summer camp, the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG will launch next week its Virtual Summer Camp, for children aged six to 12. The free program is offered through a partnership with the Blue Jays and the Jays Care Foundation and will give youths the opportunity to connect with club staff and other children of their own age while playing games and building a strong social connection virtually. Registration and more information about the two camps is available by visiting the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG’s website, at www.bgccornwallsdg.com.

According to the community, since the inception of the settlement, they have never seen any infrastructural development by either the federal or state government.

Muhammad Adamu and Ardo of Riyom, who spoke on behalf of the community, said building the school was an indication that they were being carried along, adding that the community had never experienced such development.

He said, ""No words of thanks will equate what SDG has done to us. This is what we have been praying for in the last hundreds of years. I am 60 years old and I have never seen this kind of development in Mahanga until now. We appreciate the gesture and hope to have other social amenities like boreholes, hospitals, and electricity.

Adamu, while expressing happiness over the development, however, denied the rumour that the community's name was changed from Rankum to Mahanga, adding that the area where the school was built was not Rankum. He called on Berom communities to join hands together to move the place forward.

The youth leader of the area and secretary to the Ardo, Abdullahi Yusuf Ibrahim, thanked the SDG for showing much concern towards their plight and called on the state government to deploy teachers to handle the school effectively.

He said, ""One of our many wishes is to have primary and secondary schools for our children to be attending. We have been yearning for something like this but could not succeed. Today, Allah has blessed us with this. We are indeed very grateful. Our major problem now is to have teachers who would be giving lessons to our children. ""

Ibrahim, therefore, called on both state goverment and Riyom LG council to complement the gesture by deploying teachers to the school.","Jos — Residents of Mahanga community in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State have applauded the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Office, for building the first primary school in the area.

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);

SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); and

The theme encompasses both the UN’s milestone year and the global crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

UN Member States agreed in June 2019 that the UN’s 75th anniversary will be commemorated under the theme, ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’ In a letter of 8 August 2020, Volkan Bozkir said that given the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global crisis, he suggests a more specific theme for the General Debate, as follows: ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.’

Bozkir adds that the debate should focus in particular on the most vulnerable, as well as on ensuring efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda “adapt to the crisis,” noting the outset of the Decade of Action for the SDGs.

The Assembly previously reached agreement on other details of the high-level week, in a decision adopted via silence procedure on 22 July 2020 (decision 74/562). By this text, the UNGA’s high-level meeting to commemorate UN’s 75th anniversary will convene on 21 September. It will formally adopt a declaration that has been negotiated by Member States in advance. Following negotiations, a silence procedure concluded without objection on 7 July, and UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande informed Member States that “consensus has been achieved and the text has been finalized.”

The decision indicates that the Summit on Biodiversity will take place on 30 September, the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) on 1 October, and the high-level meeting on the total elimination of nuclear weapons on 2 October. For all of these meetings, the decision authorizes pre-recorded video statements. The video statements “shall have an equal status as any statement made by any other representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall” and shall be included in the verbatim records of the Debate or meeting.

The decision also encourages Member States to hold all side events on virtual platforms to limit the number of people in the UN building.

Immediately prior to the high-level week, the UN will hold the first annual ‘SDG Moment’ on Friday, 18 September. Details are under discussion.","The president-elect of the 75th UN General Assembly has announced the theme for the general debate, which will open on 22 September 2020.

The negotiations are expected to place “an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.”

Known as the quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR), the process was last conducted in 2016. Its implementation was assessed during the May 2020 session of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, which also assessed progress in the ongoing reforms to the UN development system. These findings are expected to guide the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in negotiating the 2020 QCPR.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed – who leads the organization’s work to reposition the UNDS – has expressed hope that the 2020 QCPR could serve as a “a forward-leaning tool that takes the system’s collective accountability for results to the next level.”

By the resolution adopted on 11 August 2020 (A/RES/74/297), Member States:

Take note of the Secretary-General’s report (A/75/79–E/2020/55), which addresses the UN’s support for governments to “recover better from the [COVID-19] crisis and deliver during the decade of action” for the SDGs;

Take note of the report of the Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group on the work of the Development Coordination Office (DCO) (E/2020/54), which marks the first annual account of the new resident coordinator (RC) system and DCO operations. The Chair reports that a “truly empowered and independent” RC system was launched on 1 January 2019, and is supported by the stand-alone global DCO;

Welcome the progress achieved by the UN development system, take note of the challenges on repositioning it, and look forward to the implementation of all reform mandates;

Regarding the UN development system’s “regional assets,” request the UN Secretary-General to continue transparent and inclusive UN consultations on their “longer-term reprofiling and restructuring” to ensure this takes place in accordance with each region’s specific needs and priorities, and stress that regional repositioning should be conducted with the support of the regional economic commissions, specialized agencies, funds, programmes, and regional offices of the DCO; and

Regarding multi-country offices (MCOs), welcome recommendations on reinforcing support in MCO settings and call for continued consultations, as part of enabling countries to implement the 2030 Agenda.

As a result, sub-Saharan Africa has the youngest population of any region, with 43% of its population under age 15. The population of 25 countries is expected to at least double between 2020 and 2050. Among these 25 countries, Angola and Benin are projected to grow by at least 150% of their current population. Niger’s population is expected to increase by almost 175%.

By contrast, the trend is towards a graying population in Europe. Older adults (ages 65 and older) account for 9% of global population, but in Western Europe and Southern Europe, 21% of the population falls into this category.

In 2020, life expectancy at birth for women is highest in Hong Kong (88) and lowest in Central African Republic (55). Life expectancy at birth for men is highest in Australia (83) and lowest in Central African Republic and Lesotho (51).

The Parties are expected to consider the draft budget decision either through a silence/written procedure or a virtual meeting that would take place within the period from 16-19 November 2020.

CBD COP 15 was originally scheduled to take place in October 2020. Following an announcement on 15 July 2020, the meeting is now expected to take place from 17-30 May 2021, in Kunming, China.

UNFCCC Considering Additional Event in 2021

On 28 May 2020, the UNFCCC COP Bureau decided that the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), which was originally scheduled to take place from 9-19 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK, will take place from 1-12 November 2021, still in Glasgow.

Subsequently, at the end of June 2020, the COP Bureau decided to postpone the meetings of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB52) until 2021, at a date to be decided. During the time frame during which the SB52 meetings were originally scheduled, the Secretariat organized a series of virtual events under the banner, ‘June Momentum on Climate Change.’

In related news, during a UNFCCC COP Bureau meeting on 25 August 2020, the Bureau decided that “there could be an additional third session in 2021 if needed to catch up on work,” in order to be prepared for COP 26 in November 2021, according to a report from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group on Climate Change.

That year will mark the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment, which took place in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972, and established the UN Environment Programme.

In May 2018, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) mandated a series of negotiations to consider possible gaps in international environmental law and environment-related instruments, with a view to strengthening their implementation (resolution 72/277, ‘Towards a Global Pact for the Environment’). These meetings took place in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2019.

The resulting recommendations did not call for creating a new international instrument to address legal gaps, but instead for the UNGA to:

Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to strengthen, “where needed,” environmental laws, policies and regulatory frameworks at the national level, as well as capacities across all sectors for effective implementation of international environmental law (IEL), including in the administrative and justice sectors, in accordance with national legal systems;

Encourage UN Member States and all members of the specialized agencies to mainstream environment into sectoral policies and programmes at all levels, including into national development and sustainable development plans;

Encourage the “active and meaningful engagement” of all relevant stakeholders at all levels in the different forums related to the implementation of IEL and environment-related instruments;

Encourage the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), as chair of the Environment Management Group, to continue to strengthen system-wide inter-agency coordination on the environment, and to call for the implementation of system-wide strategies on the environment; and

Forward the recommendations to the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) for consideration, and for UNEA to prepare, at its fifth session (UNEA-5), a political declaration for a UN high-level meeting, subject to voluntary funding, in the context of commemoration of UNEP’s creation in 1972, with a view to strengthening the implementation of IEL.

The UNGA endorsed these recommendations in August 2019 (resolution 73/333). To follow up on that mandate, the Committee of Permanent Representatives to UNEA is holding a series of three informal substantive consultation meetings. The co-facilitators for the consultations are Saqlain Syedah, Pakistan, and Ado Lohmus, Estonia.

Convening virtually from 21-23 July 2020, the Committee of Permanent Representatives held the first of its three meetings. According the report of the meeting released on 9 August, governments exchanged views on international environmental law and the appropriate focus for the political declaration.

A “large majority of States” stressed the importance of the Rio principles in the political declaration.

Some called for the declaration to advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.

The EU suggested that common understanding is needed on interpreting the principles of international environmental law, and Colombia and New Zealand called for stating the principles in the declaration. The Civil Society Group also supported agreeing on a set of principles for environmental rights.

The Africa Group and Chile preferred the declaration to focus on the means of implementation.

Turkey said the declaration should include practical measures of implementation, but no technical details.

The Civil Society Group favored “political commitments, targets and timelines.”

Japan said the political declaration is a chance to demonstrate strong political will to strengthen international environmental law and governance.

The EU called for the political declaration to include a follow-up mechanism.

206,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/08/14/esg-and-sdg-alpha-backed-by-the-blockchain/,"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes,ESG And SDG Alpha Backed By The Blockchain,"ESG means Environmental, Social & Governance. SDG means Sustainable Development Goals. SDGs are set by the UN. Most SDGs have ESG implications. ESG rated companies have become popular in investment portfolios. This is because the ESG standing of a company is a proxy for long term value, say the boosters of ESG based investing. The retail investor, by necessity, outsources research on ESG to professionals and invests in funds with a sustainable focus. The funds are meant to investigate the sustainable claims of many companies. Instead of doing so themselves, they rely on outfits like MCSI and Sustainalytics to choose the portfolio companies.

Much like the ratings agencies whose triple A rated bonds cratered as the financial crisis hit in 2008, these ESG raters do not and cannot stand by their scores when non-sustainable practices at firms with high ratings are exposed. Similar to those rating agencies who also got paid by their targets to rate the bonds that they issued, there is often a conflict of interest at the heart of these ratings. The scores are often proprietary and employ models and methods, including survey based results which rely on the enterprises to self-report. Self-reporting has never been a good method to rate enterprises or individuals.

Sustainable Development Goals Graphic from the UN

After laying bare the debate about ESG based investment strategies; some efforts to improve the quality and depth of the data and hence make the scores more objective are discussed. Some of these proposals use the blockchain to secure the truths about the business attested by programmatic or other verifiable metrics. A combination of methods probably works best, with suspicious activity getting investigated further, including the use of shoe leather.

The Skeptics

The US Labor department regulators recently released a proposed new rule, to clarify the ERISA guidelines as being concerned purely with pecuniary results. The new rule says that ESG ratings should not be used as a criteria for investment. Since this affects all investments by pension plans, it has a great influence on investment strategy and climate in the US; since pension plans control a huge chunk of investment. This new rule could be a huge problem for portfolio managers who are in charge of pension funds.

Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it. A well respected analyst has asserted that ESG ratings do not have anything to do with the better performance of ESG rated companies; since the difference in performance during the pandemic is due to the fact that energy companies and airlines who have poor ESG ratings cratered in first weeks of the pandemic. You can certainly apply this narrow logic to the performance metrics focused on a specific crisis. However, nothing can be said about the wider alpha generated by better ESG metrics. Indeed the better performance of ESG companies during the pandemic can be thought of as being generated by their resilience, better credit ratings and being relatively sheltered from black swans like the pandemic.

One more example is a company called Boohoo in the UK. Boohoo had received good ESG ratings from the ESG rating agencies which earned it a place on some portfolios in ESG funds. When news broke that their supply chain included vendors that underpaid their workers, the stock dove. These revelations resulted in its removal from the ESG funds. This points to the lack of depth in the rating; for a fashion brand suppliers matter. This is a case of a company receiving higher grades than they should have, because of the lack of proper due diligence.

ESG Proponents

The head of State Street Advisors STT , Cyrus Taraporevala, published an op-ed in the Financial Times arguing against the dept of labor rule about the Erisa guidelines and its proscription of ESG ratings as criteria for investing. Taraporevala is all for the guidelines that put the fiduciary responsibility of the portfolio managers to focus on pecuniary results. However, his argument is that ESG forward companies are better suited to weather the storms since they focus on employee well-being, resilience of supply chains and agile management. This is more true in the longer horizon which most pension plans should be focused on. He asserts that stocks with higher ESG ratings are better bets in the long term. Taraporevala does admit that there are some gray areas in measurement and accounting for ESG risks.

Measuring ESG

There was some talk in the ESG community that using the SDGs to measure ESG performance would be better, since they are finer grained and may be actually measurable. There are 17 headings there rather than just three in ESG.

For carbon emissions and other types of environmentally destructive activities where there can be a measure of objectivity, independent auditors and public data can bridge the transparency gap. The IWA has created a Carbon Emissions Token that includes several measurements and assertions. Nominally this would be on the blockchain so that the various parties who issue and monitor the token can assert to the measurements.

Another effort in the climate & accounting SIG in Hyperledger to setup utility emission channels will use public eGrid data, published by the EPA, along with the customer’s utility bills to calculate the emissions attributable to their energy consumption can be used to rate enterprises on their emissions profile. This uses a blockchain to capture this information from multiple parties. All of this point to the original use case for the blockchain to be a non-repudiable source of ordered documents.

Other ESG factors are harder to measure, especially the social and governance aspects. The ESG rating agencies who use a host of factors to calculate the ESG ratings will have to use many more automated methods using publicly available data; including some from blockchain anchored data stores. These methods will get better as time passes and ESG ratings will no longer be questioned as proxies for long term performance.","Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it.

The joint publication titled, ‘Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation: Intersections between Public Health, Intellectual Property and Trade,’ provides an update since the first edition’s launch in 2013. The study presents new data on health, innovation trends in the pharmaceutical sector, and trade and tariffs relating to medical products, capturing insights from joint technical assistance activities and taking into account developments in intellectual property legislation and jurisprudence.

The study “draws practical lessons from experiences regarding how public health, IP, trade and competition rules all interact with each other in the broader context of the human rights dimension of health and the [SDGs].” Given recent rapid changes in these policy arenas due to COVID-19, a WTO landing page for the study notes that “a standalone section on COVID-19 was added at the start of the publication to map the multiple challenges posed by the pandemic in relation to the integrated health, trade and IP policy frameworks set out in the study,” given that the report had been completed prior to the virus’s outbreak.

The COVID-19 section points readers to specific chapters, sections, and sub-sections of the report, and provides additional relevant information on:

Meeting the demand for health technologies and medical services;

Preserving effective international trade;

The global IP system vis-à-vis the pandemic;

International initiatives to support research and development of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 technologies;

Regulatory responses; and

Efforts to ensure transparency.

International trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.

The study itself describes the need for policy coherence and the role of the three authoring institutions (Chapter 1), summarizes the policy landscape (Chapter 2), and offers detailed information on the issues that specifically pertain to medical innovation and the research and development landscape (Chapter 3) and access (Chapter 4). The report draws connections to the SDGs and means of implementation such as trade throughout. Chapter 2 highlights linkages to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals), and describes key elements of trade policy such as tariffs, government procurement rules, and free trade agreements (FTAs). Chapter 4 considers the impact of trade and trade policy on access to medicines and medical technologies.

Noting that “innovation cannot take place in isolation from concerns about access,” the study emphasizes the need to preserve the global trade’s integrity. It observes that “international trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.” Recognizing governments’ recent implementation of trade-restrictive emergency measures such as export restrictions, the report also stresses “the importance of well-functioning supply chains and the need to facilitate cross-border flows of vital medical supplies and services.”

With the EU, the US, China, and Switzerland accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total share of health-related product exports, the majority of the global community appears reliant on imports. The study notes that from 1995 to 2018, “substantial and widening variations in per capita imports of health-related products” have been observed in countries at different levels of development, “highlighting stark differences in access to medicines.” Acknowledging the global trade regime’s increasing complexity, the study points to the existence of WTO agreements such as, inter alia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) as establishing rules to ensure that tariffs and non-tariff measures “do not become discriminatory or [become] unnecessary trade barriers.”

The WTO, WHO, and WIPO Directors-General each provided video remarks to support the launch of the study. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted the importance of close collaboration between the agencies, and joint global efforts more broadly, while WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry emphasized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for the removal of barriers to access, highlighting “unaffordable prices, intellectual property barriers, unjustified tariffs and challenges in ensuring effective and efficient regulatory review,” but also pointed to “unprecedented investments in collaborative, not-for-profit research” to tackle the shared threat of COVID-19.

The Angels wrapped up the tournament with a 3-1 record after losing in a semifinal game.

Finishing with a 12-5 overall record, the 13U Angels reached the semifinals in all four of the Grand Slam Baseball tournaments they entered.

SDG (Soli Deo Gloria, meaning Glory to God Alone) began its journey June 5-7 in the Back-to-Baseball Blowout held at Signature Park in Braselton. In heartbreaking fashion, the Angels lost 9-6 to the Lambert Longhorns — a team they defeated 9-3 in the qualifying round — in the championship game to finish second in a field of seven teams.

Not to be denied, the Angels next played in the 11-team June Jam Summer Series Week 3, held June 19-21 at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula. SDG beat the Orange Crush from Clemson, S.C., 11-9 in the Championship game to finish 4-1 in the tournament. Crowned Tournament Champions on Father’s Day, each Angel was presented with a championship ring.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

Copenhagen Fintech, UNDP seek to help firms establish sustainable ventures in Southeast Asia

28 Aug 2020 | The Asset

Copenhagen Fintech, a Danish organization promoting financial technology, is collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other institutions to bring Nordic fintech startups to Singapore to help them establish commercially scalable and sustainable ventures in the Southeast Asian region.

Local startups tackling some of the world's most urgent climate and poverty challenges will be involved in the programme to foster new partnerships and stronger ties between the ASEAN and the Nordics, Copenhagen Fintech said in a statement.

Also participating in the programme are UNDP's Global Center for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development in Singapore, UNDP's Nordic Office, and UNDP SDG Innovative Finance (UNSIF) in Bangkok. Signing up as partners of the programme are financial services groups Citi and DBS.

“As a global partner to Copenhagen Fintech, we’re excited to contribute to another industry-leading project focusing on sustainable innovation, which aligns to Citi's recently announced 2025 Sustainable Progress Strategy. The success of the programme will be instrumental in the development of SDGs, an area where Citi has strong commitment globally, and further boost the collaboration between the Nordic and ASEAN ecosystems,” says Rudi Baxter Warman, Citi country head in Denmark.

DBS chief sustainability officer Mikkel Larsen notes: “We look forward to extending our expertise and regional insights to the participating Nordic fintechs and plugging them into our innovation and sustainability ecosystem.”

Singapore is widely recognized as one of the world’s leading fintech hubs and a great supporter of the global fintech community. It hosts the annual Fintech Festival, the largest gathering of fintech startups, financial institutions, academia, investors and thought leaders.

The programme will bring up to six carefully selected Nordic fintech companies to Singapore for a weeklong stay. They will be selected based on challenges formulated by UNDP, Copenhagen Fintech and other partners. Applications open on September 1.

According to a just released UN report, the fintech revolution offers major opportunities to accelerate financing of the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) with more and better data, reduced transaction and intermediation costs, and innovative business models.

In the report, titled “People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future,” the UN secretary general’s task force on digital financing of SDG presents an action agenda, which outlines key opportunities, steps to evolve sustainable fintech ecosystems, and necessary digital finance governance innovations.

Says Bradley Busetto, director of the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainability: “Through its Impact Venture Accelerators, UNDP is proud to support both established and startup enterprises to scale up innovative technology and business-based solutions to drive sustainable development and respond to Covid-19.

“In this new partnership with Copenhagen Fintech, UNDP will help amplify the sustainability focus of the selected ventures and apply its proven impact measurement and management methodology. This reflects a global vision – that in order to achieve the SDGs we must work closely with the most innovative and creative entrepreneurs around the world to incorporate sustainability into the core of business.”","Nordic fintech startups plan SDG bridge to SingaporeCopenhagen Fintech, UNDP seek to help firms establish sustainable ventures in Southeast Asia28 Aug 2020 | The AssetCopenhagen Fintech, a Danish organization promoting financial technology, is collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other institutions to bring Nordic fintech startups to Singapore to help them establish commercially scalable and sustainable ventures in the Southeast Asian region.

As per data provided by the departments,15,323 schemes having a budget outlay of Rs50.07 billion were executed by the communications and works, local government and community development, housing and urban development and public health engineering departments and Cholistan Development Authority.

The federal government had allocated funds to Punjab to achieve the targets enumerated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sources said the audit report termed the criteria for selection of projects deficient in planning. It said the objectives of the SDGs were not kept in view while allocating funds.

During the audit, the AGP observed that the community participation was ignored as the criterion for selecting 15 residents was not defined and people were selected randomly to get endorsement for a scheme. The auditors reportedly stated that the aspect of planning and evaluation seemed missing and most of the funds were spent on the infrastructure and municipal sectors. Resultantly, the schemes were nor selected in line with the SDGs.

Will SDGs fail, as did MDGs?

The audit report also observed that there was a disparity in allocation of funds in the nine divisions of Punjab. Highest allocation of Rs10 billion to Rs12 billion was made to Lahore and Gujranwala divisions, whereas Rs3.5 - Rs4 billion was allocated for Dera Ghazi Khan and Rawalpindi divisions. Underdeveloped areas like DG Khan, Bahawalpur and Sargodha divisions were allocated minimum funds under the SDGs programme. The annual allocation of funds to the divisions was Lahore Rs12,642 million, Gujranwala Rs10,259 million, Multan Rs6,088 million, Sahiwal Rs4,982 million, Faisalabad Rs4,857 million, Sargodha Rs4,773 million, Bahawalpur Rs4,493 million, Rawalpindi Rs4,014 million and DG Khan Rs3,561 million.

The sources said that the audit took serious notice of the performance of executing departments, which was not up to the mark as 481 schemes, including 46 of communications and works, 259 of housing and urban development and public health engineering and 176 of local government and community development could not be launched and the allocated funds lapsed. It also reportedly noted that completion certificates (PC-IVs) and final bills of contractors of many completed schemes were not prepared in violation of the cabinet division’s directions and contractual obligations.

It stated that the supervisory tier failed to exercise vigilance for proper utilisation of funds and execution of schemes. The audit reportedly found financial irregularities of Rs576.397 million involving overpayment due to higher or incorrect rates, non-recovery of government dues, unauthorised utilisation without approval of the competent authority and violation of PC-1.

Promoting affordable and clean energy

Funds transferred by the cabinet division to the tune of Rs4.5 billion remained unspent and they were neither transferred back to the federal government nor their accounts were submitted to the audit department. The report recommended that non-production of record needed to be dealt with strictly to avoid its recurrence.

Each of these young actors had a brilliant starring role in an extraordinary, structurally audacious recent movie, Lean on Pete for Plummer and Waves for Russell.

Words on Bathroom Walls, based on the young-adult novel by Julia Walton and directed by Thor Freudenthal (Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters; Diary of a Wimpy Kid), is predictably more conventional than those films. I was reminded at times of The Fault in Our Stars, another YA adaptation about illness with low-key religious themes and a central relationship that morphs from platonic friendship into romance.

But compelling performances elevate the sometimes familiar material, along with a gratifyingly frank, therapeutic depiction of mental illness, in this case schizophrenia.

Adam Petrazelli (Plummer), a high-school senior, has trouble knowing what’s real and what isn’t. Like Russell Crowe’s John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, he’s orbited by a cast of supporting characters that only he can see and hear, representing various aspects of his psyche.

The film also echoes A Beautiful Mind in the protagonist’s struggle between the liberating and debilitating effects of medication. One of the major themes is that Adam has an illness but the illness is not him, though he discovers that attempts to control the illness may have consequences for parts of himself that he cares about.

John Nash did math; Adam cooks and finds liberation in the kitchen. His dreams of culinary school, though, are imperiled by his first psychotic break, an incident with supernatural horror-movie resonances that inconveniently strikes in chemistry class during his senior year of high school. Someone is hurt, and Adam is expelled.

His hopes to get his life back on track involve a convergence of two paths: an experimental drug study and a Catholic school named for St. Agatha, where he meets brainy, jaded Maya (Russell) and a taciturn priest named Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), whom Adam mostly encounters in the confessional, despite not believing in God.

Molly Parker (House of Cards) is utterly credible as Adam’s mother, Beth, a constant advocate for her son whose biggest challenge may be persuading him that they really are on the same team. Their quarrels are among the film’s most true-to-life elements. Walton Goggins (Ant-Man and the Wasp) is nicely ambiguous as Paul, Beth’s new boyfriend, whom Adam resents without in any way pining for his deadbeat dad. (Adam says his dad split over Adam’s illness, which he considered “a buzzkill for his creativity.”)

Maya is so gifted that she’s not only St. Agatha’s top student but also props up other students on the sly for cash, a “side hustle” leading to a legit gig as Adam’s tutor, paid by Adam’s grateful mom. Initially it seems Maya is drawn to Adam’s quirkiness as a kind of puzzle to be solved, and how long Adam will be able to keep his schizophrenia a secret from her and everyone else at St. Agatha’s is a key dramatic question.

Maya could have been a magic girlfriend existing to solve Adam’s problems, but the story gives her issues and secrets of that go some way toward giving her an arc of her own. I would have liked more of a third act for her, as well as more attention to the socioeconomic issues the film raises (particularly as regards questions like who gets expelled and who doesn’t).

Adam’s other defining “relationships” are with characters who don’t exist: benevolent Rebecca (Soul Surfer’s AnnaSophia Robb), decadent Joaquin (Devon Bostick) and the unnamed, bat-wielding Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian). There’s also a malicious, demonic voice that addresses Adam from the darkness behind doors left ajar, confronting him with anxieties and whatever thoughts would most torture him.

Like many literary adaptations, Words relies heavily on first-person voice-over narration. I’m told the book takes the form of a series of journal entries written by Adam for his therapist, whom he refuses to talk to, which the movie wisely adapts as in-person therapy sessions. (Adam speaks directly to the camera, and the therapist is never seen or heard.)

In the book, I guess, Adam’s exchanges in the confessional with Father Patrick would be a therapeutic breakthrough, a setting in which Adam is willing to talk directly about his problems to someone in a way he won’t talk to his therapist.

Since the film’s Adam does talk openly to his therapist, there’s a smaller significance to the confessional scenes, highlighted when Adam realizes with a sense of betrayal that everything he tells his therapist gets back to his mother. What Adam tells the priest in the box, on the other hand, stays between the two of them (and God, the priest adds, acknowledging that, since Adam doesn’t believe in God, from his point of view it’s just the two of them).

Father Patrick is a sympathetic figure, if not a model priest. He gives Adam absolution in their first encounter, which is obviously bogus since not only hasn’t Adam confessed anything or expressed contrition, we don’t even know if he was baptized. (In the book I understand Adam’s family are mostly lapsed Italian Catholics who still go to Mass for Easter.) More trivially, Father Patrick cites verses from 1 John and 2 Timothy without the initial number, as if he’s not entirely sure which epistle he wants.

Father Patrick ultimately explains to Adam that we need confession because acknowledging our flaws to others is important in overcoming them. That’s true, and while for Catholics there’s obviously a deeper religious significance to confession, it’s the truth Adam needs at the moment, and it sets up the climax. (Father Patrick does get to offer a real Christian prayer for Adam, so his faith isn’t entirely elided by psychology.)

The principal, Sister Catherine (Beth Grant, Jackie), is a more mixed figure, well-meaning but ultimately representing the small-minded failings of religious institutions.

In a striking early visualization of Adam’s psychosis, when Adam, Beth and Paul first go to St. Agatha to meet Sister Catherine, Adam sees the principal calmly talking in the midst of an increasingly out-of-control fire like the viral “This Is Fine/On Fire” dog.

It’s an early example of how Adam’s hallucinations are sometimes played for laughs, and while the visual suggestion of fiery perdition could be merely ironic and not rancorous, by the end of the film the latter take is more plausible.

For what it’s worth, it seems Adam in the book is much more antagonistic toward Catholicism than comes across in the film. Another notable omission: As in The Fault in Our Stars, the book depicts a transgressive first sexual encounter (the book’s Adam has sex for the first time with Maya while wearing a Jesus beard for a Stations of the Cross play; in The Fault in Our Stars the main characters have sex for the first time after kissing at the Anne Frank house). In the film the romance goes no further than a first kiss (and Jesus beards are not a thing).

The film’s insightful portrayal of mental illness and strong character moments exist in tension with the more clichéd genre elements. Halfway through I found myself rooting for the film to be the best version of itself, a sign that a film is working even when it’s not completely successful.

My favorite moment, which might also be the sneakiest, is the one in which the significance of the title is revealed. If the ending is too tidy and too conventional, there have been lots of endings like this for neurotypicals, and perhaps people with mental illness — and the people who love them — deserve some, too.

216,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-fatima-a-compelling-visually-lush-religious-drama,"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Fatima,’ a Compelling, Visually Lush Religious Drama","The story of the 20th century’s most celebrated Marian apparitions comes to life in a fine retelling from co-writer and director Marco Pontecorvo and Catholic screenwriter Barbara Nicolosi.

Note: Theatrical and home viewing information for viewing Fátima is available at the film’s official website.

Marco Pontecorvo’s Fátima is the first screen version of the Marian apparitions at Fátima and the “Miracle of the Sun” I’ve seen that feels like the characters are living through the story’s events in the present tense.

That’s more than a little ironic, because it’s also the version that most emphatically places those events in the past, almost but not quite presenting them in flashback from the perspective of an aging Sister Lúcia (Brazilian actress Sônia Braga, Aquarius) discussing her experiences with a skeptical professor of religion named Nichols (Harvey Keitel) visiting her at the Carmelite convent in Coimbra, Portugal, in 1989.

The 2009 art-house indie The 13th Day offered a simpler framing device — Sister Lúcia writing her memoirs — but relied on it more extensively, allowing frequent voice-over narration to carry much of the narrative. The 1991 Portuguese docudrama Apparitions at Fátima (Aparição or Apparition is the Portuguese title) also relied on voice-over, sometimes clumsily.

Neither film was much interested in dramatizing what motivated the adult figures who become effective or formal antagonists to the three visionary children: Lúcia’s disapproving mother; the skeptical parish priest; the anticlerical mayor. Nor was the classic Hollywood version of the story, the 1952 film The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima , which too obviously tried to emulate the crown jewel of Golden Age Hollywood piety, The Song of Bernadette , without matching its depth of humanity or level of craft.

All of these Fátima films emphasized the turmoil in Europe, and in Portugal in particular, at the moment in 1917 when Our Lady appeared, from the horror of the First World War to the oppression of the Church by Portugal’s hardline secular government.

Only Fátima — written by Barbara Nicolosi, Valerio D’Annunzio and Pontecorvo — captures the sense of life going on at the moment that the three children, 10-year-old Lúcia (Stephanie Gil) and her younger cousins Francisco (Jorge Lamelas) and Jacinta (Alejandra Howard), start to talk about having seen a Lady from heaven at the Cova da Iria, the family pastureland where Lúcia watched her family’s flock of sheep.

Above all, there is the grimly regular ritual of residents of Ourém, the municipality where Lúcia’s village of Aljustrel on the outskirts of Fátima is located, gathering to listen in suspense while the mayor (or civil administrator), Artur Santos (Croatian-American actor Goran Višnjić, Beginners), reads the latest list of local soldiers who have been declared dead or missing.

The list is alphabetical, so there are sighs of relief when the first name is uttered that comes after the name one is most hoping not to hear — in the case of Lúcia’s family, that of Lúcia’s brother Manuel. (This is one of the film’s more notable fictionalizations; the relative at war was a cousin of Lúcia, not a brother.)

Filming entirely in Portugal, frequent collaborators Pontecorvo and cinematographer Vincenzo Carpineta (Game of Thrones, Rome) create rich, atmospheric images with a vivid sense of place, from the medieval town center of Ourém — where, incongruously, the mayor holds forth on the triumph of modern secularism over religious superstition — to the rustic houses of Aljustrel and the rugged beauty of the Cova da Iria. (The scenes in Ourém were filmed in the central Portuguese town of Tomar, which has a picturesque medieval town center with a Renaissance-era church dedicated to John the Baptist. The stone village of Cidadelhe, also known as Piñel, stands in for Aljustrel.)

When the Lady appears, the transcendent nature of the experience is suggested not with luminous special effects or heraldic scoring but with subjective, impressionistic camerawork and editing.

“She was as real as you are,” Lúcia insists to her mother, and, indeed, Portuguese actress Joana Ribiero, serene and benevolent in elegantly simple white garments, walks barefoot on the earth of the Cova as naturalistically as anyone else.

But our glimpses of her are brief and partial — eyes gazing at the children; hands extended to them, holding a rosary; a trickle of blood on her breast — interspersed with the empty space that others see (including, at first, Francisco, who doesn’t immediately see the Lady and later sees her but doesn’t hear her voice when her lips move).

This approach seems to me more evocative than, say, overly familiar computerized glowy effects that we’ve seen in any number of superhero movies over the last decade or so. No cinematic technique, no human art of any kind, can accurately recreate the transcendence of a religious experience, and the most effective religious art has never aspired to representational exactness.

For the first time in any film I’ve seen, Lúcia’s mother, Maria Rosa (Portuguese singer and actress Lúcia Moniz), is a developed character: devout, with some education, loving and wanting what’s best for her daughter, but understandably upset and angry over what she can only conceive as a startling pretense taken too far. A moment in which Maria defiantly faces down disapproving neighbors movingly shows us for the first time the mother suffering with her daughter, rather than being just one more voice against Lúcia.

Artur Santos, the mayor, is cast as a sort of Pilate figure, caught between, on the one hand, pressure from political higher-ups in Lisbon and the consequent need to maintain order and avoid awkward viral religious hysteria and, on the other, the gentle but firm resistance of his Catholic wife, Adelina (Iris Cayatte). (The Santos’ relationship is not entirely unlike that of Pilate and his wife in The Passion of the Christ , and an expression of solidarity between Santos’ wife and the pious protesters recalls Pilate’s wife bringing linens to the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene to wipe Jesus’ blood after the scourging.)

The filmmakers don’t shy from some of the more challenging aspects of the Fátima message, from the emphasis on mortification and the offense given to God by sin to the children’s dreadful visions of war and hell. When Lúcia fears that her brother may have been killed in battle, she spends hours shuffling on her knees in prayer in the Cova, trailed by her respectfully concerned father. (The Lady does tell the children, though, not to keep punishing themselves with ropes tied around their waists.)

As the Lady asked a great deal of the three children, Pontecorvo asks a great deal of his young actors; the film rests on their credibility, as the visionaries’ story rested on theirs.

Pontecorvo seems to have a flair for directing children (first seen in his acclaimed feature debut Pa-Ra-Da), and Gil as Lúcia especially is thoroughly persuasive both in rapture and in conflicted confusion. Lamelas brings sensitivity to Francisco and Howard charm to Jacinta.

Keitel’s skeptical Professor Nichols is a very rough functional counterpart to Gilbert Roland’s softhearted rogue in The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, a nonbelieving character meant to serve as a point of entry for non-Catholic viewers.

Perhaps surprisingly, the latter-day segments with Sister Lúcia — which would form a framing story, were it not for a prologue-like opening sequence depicting an early apparition (not of the Virgin Mary but of the Guardian Angel of Portugal) and the somewhat abrupt ending in the immediate aftermath of the “Miracle of the Sun” — wind up being the film’s weakest links.

Keitel and Braga are a pleasure to watch, but Nichols’ line of questioning is too often more sophomoric (or village atheist) than professorial. (If the nails through Christ’s hands would actually have been set in the wrists, does that mean that God deliberately chose the “wrong” location for stigmata?)

If there’s any reason for the latter-day storyline to be set in 1989 — any relevance of the events at Fátima to that moment toward the end of the 20th century, and perhaps by extension any resonance with our own historical moment — it doesn’t come out. (The filmmakers couldn’t have known at the time production wrapped that Fátima would debut in the midst of a global pandemic, eerily resonating with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic in which young Francisco and Jacinta died shortly after these events.)

Notably, while Nichols questions Sister Lúcia at length on her visionary experiences, they never get around to discussing the widely witnessed Miracle of the Sun — where it might have been her opportunity to cross-examine him.

This lapse not only leaves their dialogue more static than it might have been, it also leaves the “Miracle of the Sun” as the last sequence, without any reflection or perspective except what can be provided by closing titles.

Those issues aside, Fátima is easily the most compelling dramatization of the Fátima story to date and fills a long-felt need in the world of religious cinema. It’s sturdy enough to hold up to periodic rewatchings, for example on May 13, the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima.

The line is part of the company’s Toronto-Montreal and transcontinental routes.

“CP is continuously looking for opportunities to improve its track infrastructure,” said Andy Cummings, media relations manager for the company.

The project involves removing one track of the Smiths Falls-Dorion line, known as the CP Winchester Subdivision, and installing four long passing sidings.

Those sidings are located between Merrickville-Kemptville, Inkerman-Winchester, Finch-Avonmore, and Apple Hill-Green Valley.

221,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/39-countries-form-alliance-for-poverty-eradication/,"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,39 Countries Form Alliance for Poverty Eradication,"The UN General Assembly has inaugurated the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, aimed at galvanizing multilateral and bilateral efforts. The Alliance was the focus of a high-level virtual meeting on trends, options, and strategies for eliminating poverty.

Thirty-nine countries are listed as members of the Alliance. The Alliance will be led by Interim Coordinator Samson Itegboje, Permanent Mission of Nigeria. Itegboje said poverty is “the number one goal among the SDGs” and the most topical issue facing the global community apart from the impacts of COVID-19.

SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met.

Itegboje said the Alliance must “chart a new course” for poverty eradication. To be effective, he said, a strategy to eradicate poverty must reflect its multi-dimensional nature, incorporating economic, social, cultural and political dimensions.

Olivier Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, said the Alliance is extremely important for three reasons:

The number of people in extreme poverty is still unacceptably high, and this is not a result of natural disasters but of inappropriate policy choices. He called for a policy-oriented study on why people are still poor.

Other stakeholders must be involved in improving global governance practices. He called for collaboration on trade, investment, international property rights, and other interventions critical to the realization of SDG 1 (no poverty).

Developing countries need support to establish social protection floors, due to their current budget deficits.

Schutter informed participants of a process underway to establish a Global Fund for Social Protection. This will aim to coordinate various countries’ efforts to strengthen social protection. It would also work to mobilize resources to support developing countries in bridging financing gaps and establishing social protection floors. Finally, the Fund would also provide a reinsurance facility, allowing poor countries to protect themselves against shocks and thus maintain the functioning of social protection systems.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Mona Juul, said women must be at the center of the Alliance, just as with all other development efforts. She said the Alliance should strive to shift world attention to a resilient development path that leads to human rights for all.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said policymakers should not lose sight of the urgency of climate action, which can unlock “massive economic and social benefits and accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development.” She also reminded participants that the UN’s framework for immediate socioeconomic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a roadmap for a systemic, multifaceted approach.

Mohammed cited a World Bank estimate that COVID-19 could push between 71 and 100 million more people into extreme poverty in 2020, “effectively wiping out progress made since 2017.” On 6 August 2020, the World Bank released a publication on these “new poor,” finding that the global poverty rate was originally projected to fall to 8.2% in 2019, but due to COVID-19, is now projected to increase to 8.8% (baseline) and 9.2% (downside) in 2020.

The discussion during the high-level meeting highlighted challenges in poverty eradication, noting that SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met, as roughly 75% of employed youths work in the informal sector and lack protection, while 126 million young workers still live in poverty.

The report of the meeting provides recommendations emerging from the meeting. These include:

Institute people-centred policies to allow for scaled up investment in universal healthcare, education, social protection, equitable access to digital technology, and support to micro- and medium-sized enterprises;

Scale up investment in agriculture and rural development within the context of national poverty eradication policies and plans;

Implement credible anti-corruption policies and strengthen the integrity of public institutions;

Prioritize reform of judiciary and law enforcement agencies, to provide an enabling environment for allocating resources productively; and

Improve support for developing countries to establish social protection floors.

While preparations are underway for this year’s UN General Assembly and the UN 75th anniversary, the world is still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on all areas of life.

Cooperation and partnerships on the local, national, and international levels, as called for in Sustainable Development Goal 17, are more vital than ever. Many multilateral bodies have yet to show real leadership when it comes to this. The pandemic has exposed their internal rifts and animosities.

In the meantime, civil society, academia, and citizens are collaborating to help humanity soften the blow of the most significant event in recent history. COVID-19 has impacted the world as a whole, but some populations are more affected than others. That is why voices from developing countries in the Global South are critical at this moment.

Like most organizations, the Southern Voice network has had to adapt. Luckily, our 51 member think tanks across Africa, Asia, and Latin America generated timely analysis of how the new coronavirus was affecting their countries. At the network’s Secretariat, we felt that researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders outside the network, should be able to access this knowledge. Hence, we created a sort of “one-stop-shop” on information on COVID-19 in the Global South. At first just a page on our website, it has now evolved into a full-fledged digital knowledge hub.

The digital hub shows how each SDG is being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Southern Voice’s researchers from 25 countries are analyzing the impact the pandemic is having in areas such as the economy, gender equality, education, and the digital divide. The user has direct access to information on how each region (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) is dealing with the virus. In addition, information can be searched at the global level.

The hub also shows how each SDG is being affected by the pandemic. For example, the gulf between the “digital have and have nots” became even more evident this year. For the majority of people in the Global South, working or learning from home via virtual means is not an option. This fact is further widening the poverty gap, with a direct impact on SDG 1 (no poverty) and various other Goals.

The next generation of humans will be affected more than any other by the aftershock of COVID-19, in particular through impacts on education. Achieving SDG 4 (quality education) is critical to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

As a “bonus”, Southern Voice is also making available a database of experts from across the Global South. Various Southern Voice research centers are now teaming up to offer concrete solutions and recommendations to the crisis. Updates on their work will be available in the hub.

We hope that the database will be used for conference organizers and media outlets, but also by policymakers seeking advice on how to “build back better” with the help of fact-based, timely analysis.

Spaces like this hub represent a glimmer of hope among all the bad news this year. A concrete example of cooperation and partnership, it proves that humanity can come together. It shows that we can tackle a problem that affects us all, much in the spirit of the upcoming Declaration on the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary. In it, the UN Heads of State and Government pledge to “boost partnerships” across the whole of society to “ensure an effective response to our common challenges.” To achieve that, new and diverse voices from all walks of life and cultures are pivotal. For this reason, Southern Voice members are working tirelessly not only to understand the effects of the pandemic, but also to promote hands-on solutions for the short and long-term.

We hope that the COVID-19 in the Global South knowledge hub becomes a go-to place for analysis and recommendations. It is a testament to the cooperative work of hundreds of researchers across the Global South and beyond.

2020 can go down in history as an apocalyptic year. Or it can be a time in which we finally join hands to make SDG 17 a reality, through a more robust multilateral system.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected modalities of delivery of capacity-development activities around the world. Like many other organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) had to quickly adapt face-to-face training contents to the online environment. Some critical components of capacity-development activities needed to be carefully evaluated in order to identify the right format, volume, and overall feasibility of delivery considering the fact that learning would be conducted virtually and across various time zones.

FAO is the custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators and a contributing agency for a further five. In this capacity, FAO is supporting countries’ efforts in monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. FAO’s Land and Water Division is leading the work related to indicators 6.4.1 (Change in water use efficiency over time) and 6.4.2 (Level of water stress), using the AQUASTAT database for data collection and management.

One project, ‘Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 – IMI-SDG6,’ carried out by FAO, along with other UN agencies, and coordinated by UN-Water. Together with data collection and reporting, its main objective at this stage is to support countries to increase their technical and institutional capacity for the monitoring of the indicators related to Goal 6 targets (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all).

In the pre-COVID-19 era, face-to-face regional and national workshops and trainings represented the key modality for the delivery of capacity-development support under the project, due to the high level of interactivity, the possibility of direct exchange of experience and knowledge, as well as the networking potential among participants. Distant learning tools were then used to complement face-to-face interaction and to offer support in situations when a physical meeting was not possible. In most cases however, distance learning tools were used to target single individuals or small groups of participants.

The global pandemic, which caused the cancellation of scheduled face-to-face activities, served as a catalyst, stimulating and accelerating a global shift towards an effective and robust distance learning highway. What made this possible is not only organizational adaptation to the new conditions but also the ability and willingness of the audiences worldwide to take advantage of distance learning tools, overcoming their limitations.

At FAO, we had to change our mindset, and design and implement online capacity-development activities having such a level of scale and degree of interactivity as to be able to continue supporting countries’ SDG monitoring efforts. As a result, in June and July 2020, we organized two five-week regional interactive online courses on monitoring SDG indicators on sustainable water use: one, in Spanish, for Latin American countries and the other, in English, for countries in South and South-East Asia. More than 200 water monitoring and management professionals and statisticians from 33 countries participated in the courses, offering positive feedback on the module.

The courses consisted of five sessions, each lasting 100 minutes. The sessions included presentations by FAO staff, complemented by videos, polls, and question-and-answer exercises using the chat box of the teleconference platform. Each session concluded by highlighting recommended readings and exercises in preparation for the following session.

This delivery modality enabled us to reach many more relevant country staff than through in-person workshops, and strengthened the interaction within country teams as most of the exercises had been designed as country group work. We also noted significantly higher follow-up interaction between the participants and the FAO team than with face-to-face activities, most likely due to the fact that the courses had been conceived as online modules from the outset.

This experience has revealed that it is crucial to rethink the nature of capacity-development interventions, both from the side of the provider and the recipient. While face-to-face capacity-building activities remain an important element for IMI-SDG6 project, and will resume as soon as possible, interactive online courses have proven to be not just an emergency substitute but also an excellent complementary modality for capacity-development products’ delivery. The two modalities can be used to deliver different kinds of support: in-person activities are crucial in establishing relationships and in facilitating exchange of experience, while remote learning can be effective for addressing more technical subjects and for increasing the outreach and potential impact of our interventions. The online delivery modality will remain an integral component of the FAO IMI-SDG6 capacity-development portfolio, enriching the set of tools that we can put at our partners’ disposal.

FAO looks forward to using new tools to develop new capacities for reaching beneficiaries around the world to work together towards the achievement of the SDGs with an open mind, constantly adapting to the changing global conditions.

224,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-economic-social-impacts-of-covid-19/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UNCTAD Report Details Economic, Social Impacts of COVID-19","A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretariat finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to “reverse much of the economic and social progress already made” towards SDG achievement. However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

A group of technology and finance leaders, development experts, and government and UN officials launched a report on using financial technology and digital finance to advance sustainable development, focusing on empowering citizens to better align their money with their needs.

The Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs was established by the UN Secretary-General in 2018, as part of a four-year strategy on financing the 2030 Agenda, and as a complement to the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. The 17-member Task Force is led by Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, and Maria Ramos, ABSA Group’s former CEO.

Citizens need to have a say over where their pension contributions go.

The Task Force launched its report titled, ‘People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future,’ on 26 August 2020. It lays out a five-part Action Agenda to “empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs,” which are collectively expressed in the SDGs. These five catalysts are:

Aligning the “vast pools” flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs;

Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance;

Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance;

Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs; and

Accelerating “lifeblood financing” for small and medium-sized businesses.

At the virtual launch of the report, Steiner said “the Task Force was keen to bring back the notion that the citizen is at the center of the economy. Citizens need greater transparency, and to have a say over where their pension contributions go,” as well as to see public benefits from their contributions. He noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the popularity and adoption of digital tools, such as digital cash transfers, connecting schools to broadband, and remotely connecting people to government and parliamentary processes. In addition, the widespread adoption of smartphones enables people to manage their finances more actively. He suggested that the financial system could be remodeled to reflect the role of citizens’ pensions and savings in global investment flows.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that among all of the Task Force’s findings, “what has truly drawn my attention is the conclusion that digitalization will make a difference by giving people greater control over how global finance — their own money — is used,” and that it increases the ability to hold financial institutions accountable. He endorsed the Task Force’s “vision of citizen-centric finance.”

Citing the “dislocation” between the commitment to the SDGs and decision-making around public financing, Guterres said the report provides a set of ideas to “deliver financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, by shifting the center of gravity of the financial system towards empowered citizens.” [Publication: People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future] [Task Force website] [UN News story] [UNDP press release]","A widespread shift to digital finance could provide the means to meet the costs of achieving the 2030 Agenda, according to a UN task force.

WASHINGTON — With elusive progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in fragile contexts drastically compromised by COVID-19, there is a critical need for effective aid spending, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “States of Fragility 2020” report.

The annual report examined the most fragile contexts in 2020 in two parts: the global state of fragility before the virus struck, and how the resulting pandemic is dramatically impacting that landscape. It examines fragile state progress on the SDGs, and reviews levels of finance available to support them, calling for urgent action by OECD countries to maintain official development assistance levels, support access to other types of financing, and promote policies for fragile contexts.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment ...” — Susanna Moorehead, chair, OECD Development Assistance Committee

Of those living in extreme poverty globally, 76.5% live in fragile contexts — representing 23% of the world’s population. Only small improvements were found in the 2020 analysis of 57 countries and territories, and they are expected to be jeopardized by COVID-19, which has contributed to mass unemployment, increased poverty, heightened inequalities, political unrest, and rising gender-based violence.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health, economic, and social crisis without precedent in living memory. It’s also revealed the immense importance of strong states, efficient governments, and solid social security systems to confront the pandemic,” said Jorge Moreira da Silva, director of the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate, at a launch event on Thursday. “The early estimates, using the most recent projections from the World Bank, suggest that the pandemic will result in 26 million additional people in fragile contexts falling into extreme poverty by the end of this year.”

How off track are the SDGs, exactly? We don't know, but it might not matter Lagging official data makes it challenging to have an up-to-date picture of the pandemic's impact on the SDGs. But it is clear that the goals require renewed support and financing, experts explain ahead of the U.N. General Assembly.

Susanna Moorehead, OECD Development Assistance Committee chair, called the numbers in the report “terrifying” and said the figures show that poverty reduction is not merely off-track, but in reverse. She said DAC must mobilize political momentum and resources for fragile countries by spending ODA more wisely and making funds go further.

In 2018, $76 billion in bilateral ODA went to fragile contexts — more than ever before. After remittances, ODA is the second largest form of external finance to fragile countries, and it has increased every year since 2014.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment … Official development assistance is under enormous pressure and it is certain that demand will outstrip supply,” Moorehead said. “You only have to think about the humanitarian burden that the world’s facing, and it is DAC donors who will pick up a very substantial part of the costs of that over the course of the next year or so. But fragility, we know, is expensive … if you don’t invest in stability, it costs you more.”

Making ODA more effective means making sure the international community is coordinating assistance and that there is less competition between agencies. It also requires a focus on programs that prioritize resilience and investment in conflict prevention and peace building, she said.

Helder da Costa, general secretary of the g7+, a group of fragile states, said that despite the pandemic, ending active conflict and war around the world must remain the number one priority.

“Conflict prevention cannot and should not be summed up as compilation of ad hoc projects and activities funded and fragmented in analysis and theories. Pursuing stability that rests on a capable state, functioning institutions, and [a] vibrant economy should be our end,” da Costa said. “For the g7+ countries, we did not need a pandemic to learn this hard lesson. Our member countries have been living such a reality for decades.”

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said that the coronavirus has aggravated multiplied issues of fragility — the burden of which tends to disproportionately fall “on those who are already vulnerable and marginalized.” Before COVID-19, only 8 of the 48 fragile contexts where data is available were on track to meet SDG 1, ending poverty.

Thirteen of the countries examined in the report are categorized as extremely fragile, with the top five being Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 2012 and 2018, the gap in levels of fragility between the extremely fragile states and non-fragile contexts increased every year. In 11 of the 13 extremely fragile states, progress has stagnated on hunger and gender equality-related SDGs while in more than half of nonfragile contexts, progress is increasing or on track for meeting the goal.","“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else.

Participants adopted a Declaration that recognizes multilateralism as a necessity for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, and that implementation of the 2030 Agenda is necessary for survival.

The official commemoration of UN75, which took place at a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government joining virtually, focused on the theme of ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’

The UN Secretary-General warned that the world faces a “surplus of multilateral challenges, and a deficit of multilateral solutions.” In January 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres had launched the UN75 initiative as “the world’s largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.” The UN crowdsourced views on its future priorities and solutions from the global public, through a survey of over a million people in all 193 UN Member States; more than 1,000 dialogues in 82 countries across the world; and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.

Improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty.

Presenting findings from the consultation during the high-level commemoration, Guterres noted they demonstrate the public appetite for increased global solidarity, and emphasized that improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty. Guterres identified gender inequality as the “greatest single challenge to human rights around the world” and expressed concern about the “climate calamity”, rising poverty and nuclear weapons.

UN Security Council President Abdou Abarry said the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exacerbated challenges such as the illicit arms trade, human trafficking, and international terrorism. He also noted that there is no other global organization with the legitimacy and convening power of the UN.

The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Munir Akram said his presidency will focus on mobilizing finance to address the pandemic, achieve the SDGs, avoid the climate catastrophe, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. Four youth leaders called for concrete actions to support those who are left behind and to tackle climate change, among other issues.

President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera, for the least developed countries (LDCs), listed five focus areas for the UN: strengthening multilateralism, including through UN reforms; addressing inequality, including the gender gap and digital divide; financing to implement the 2030 Agenda; pursuing holistic approaches to reflect the singular objective of all SDGs; and promoting a people-centric approach. President of the European Council (EC) Charles Michel, for the EU, underscored the need for COVID-19 treatment to be accessible to all. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), called for revitalizing the UN General Assembly and reforming the Security Council. Many other speakers expressed support for UN reform, and emphasized the importance of multilateralism in COVID-19 recovery and progress towards a more equitable, sustainable world for all.

President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa noted that climate change, environmental disasters, transnational crimes, and migration can be solved only through multilateralism. Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Löfven announced that Sweden will host a conference in Stockholm in 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment.

During the event, Heads of State and Government adopted a ‘Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the UN (A/75/L.1).’ In the Declaration, Member States recognize that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago has not yet been realized: it is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics; people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge and safety; the LDCs are falling behind; and complete decolonization has not been achieved. Further, Member States recognize that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agree that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

In the Declaration, Member States resolve to:

Leave no one behind, with particular attention to people in vulnerable situations.

Protect our planet, including through transformative measures, and by building back better and greener.

Promote peace and prevent conflicts, including through preventive diplomacy and mediation, and respect for international humanitarian law.

Abide by international law and ensure justice.

Place women and girls at the center, and accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women’s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains.

Build trust, by addressing growing inequalities within and among countries, and addressing root causes of inequalities, including violence, human rights abuses, corruption, marginalization, discrimination in all its forms, poverty, and exclusion, as well as lack of education and employment.

Improve digital cooperation and ensure safe and affordable digital access for all.

Upgrade the UN, including by supporting ongoing reform by the UN Secretary-General. They also commit to instill new life in the discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council, continue the work to revitalize the UNGA, and strengthen ECOSOC.

Ensure sustainable financing, including by paying assessed contributions in full and on time; and through the full and timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD).

Boost partnerships, by engaging with all stakeholders including regional and sub-regional organizations, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians.

The guide titled, ‘Gender norms and women in politics: Evaluating progress and identifying challenges on the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform,’ published in August 2020, is authored by Rachel George with Emma Samman, Katie Washington, and Alina Ojha.

The 1995 Beijing Declaration includes a goal to ensure women’s equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision-making. The ALIGN publication finds that women are increasingly exercising their right to political participation, but many still “find their way barred by the gender norms that see politics as a masculine space.” The guide highlights how, 25 years after adoption of the Beijing Declaration, gender norms still influence women’s parliamentary representation, women’s experiences running for and standing in leadership positions, and women’s engagement in civic action and social movements.

The authors determine that “across many cultures and societies, it is increasingly common for young generations of girls to aspire to political leadership.” This is due to rising access to and achievement in education and economic shifts, as well as women’s movements and women leaders of wider social movements, among other factors. At the same time, the authors report, coalitions and movements that don’t support gender equality also are growing in power and influence.

The guide also presents statistics showing trends in women’s political participation. Women’s parliamentary representation has doubled since 1995, from 12% to 25% worldwide. The number of countries with more than 30% female representation has risen from 5 to 51. At the level of heads of state and government, the authors report that women account for just 10% of leaders worldwide – but in 1966, no country had ever had an elected female leader. Sub-nationally, fewer than 5% of the world’s mayors are women, and women account for just 20% of local councilors worldwide on average, although data on these trends are limited.

ALIGN is a digital platform and programme of work aiming to create a global community of researchers and thought leaders committed to gender justice and equality. The initiative provides research, insights, and grants to examine and change discriminatory gender norms. ALIGN is currently led by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Government of Canada.

On 1 October 2020, the UN General Assembly will convene a high-level meeting to commemorate Beijing+25. The high-level meeting on 1 October will focus on ‘Accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.’ The concept note indicates the plenary segment will focus on concrete actions to achieve this goal.

We are facing a planetary emergency – a nature crisis, a climate crisis, and an inequality crisis all at once. Yet the world’s level of ambition to tackle our nature crisis to date has been lackluster, with a recent report highlighting that the world has failed to achieve most of the global biodiversity ambitions that the world agreed to in 2010, as part of a decade-long strategic plan for nature.

The result of low levels of leadership and political will in implementing the global plan, along with ever increasing threats to ecosystem and biodiversity coming from economic sectors, has been predictable – a recent report on the state of biodiversity found that the world has lost 68% of all wildlife populations since 1970.

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global diversity framework requires eliminating “negative money.”

To fully respond to this emergency, we need bold ambition, commitment, and action at all levels, from local to global, and across different sectors and constituencies. We need a multi-pronged “whole-of-society approach” to redefine our relationship with nature towards constructing a nature-based planetary safety net.

This article provides updates on progress in five areas.

Committing to Financing Nature

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework will require a significant increase in financial resources from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue.

It also requires eliminating “negative money.” For example, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year as agriculture, fisheries, and other subsidies to incentivize activities that degrade or destroy nature. All told, the finance gap for protecting 30% of the planet is about USD700 billion a year. However, a new report shows that this finance gap is not as large as it seems – it accounts for just under one percent of global GDP, and is a tiny fraction of the USD5.2 trillion we spend in fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the benefits of protecting nature outweigh the costs by at least 5:1. The best investment ever!

Reversing Biodiversity Loss by 2030 Through Global Commitment

Global, national, and sub-national leaders can no longer ignore our planetary crisis. Indeed, more than 1,700 jurisdictions have already declared a climate emergency. Now world leaders have begun to mobilize around a pledge for nature. More than 50 heads of state have already signed a pledge for nature, and 30 more are in the process of endorsing.

Among other statements, this pledge includes a recognition of the nature crisis, and calls for an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. To accompany this commitment, the Club of Rome has developed a concrete plan to emerge from our emergency.

Creating a Nature-Based Planetary Safety Net

The year 2021 will see the agreement by the world’s governments on a bold biodiversity framework through 2030, with an eye towards a planet in harmony with nature by 2050.

Building on the indivisible relation between the wellbeing of people and the wellbeing of nature, the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) will begin by looking back to the past decade, identifying reasons for hope in national and local action on biodiversity. COP 15 will then look forward, identifying key elements required for achieving success, including bold political will, coherent and aligned government policies, integration and alignment of a wide range of economic sectors, adequate resource mobilization, and decisive action, among others.

Greening Covid-19 Recovery Efforts and Creating Green New Deals

COVID-19 has taught us that business as usual is no longer an option. This crisis highlights the socio-economic threats and costs posed by our planetary emergency, and offers an opportunity to accelerate the transition to more inclusive, greener, and more resilient economies. Decisions made now on how to stimulate growth, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and prevent the next pandemic will determine the future health, well-being, and stability of both people and the planet.

To take action, countries can:

“green” their stimulus packages and longer-term national recovery plans;

promote green public work programs;

redirect harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies;

integrate nature-climate concerns into agriculture, water resources, forestry, tourism, industry, mining, energy, and infrastructure; and

promote sustainable public/private finance and investments.

Mapping Nature for People and Planet

More than 2,200 satellites circle the earth, enabling humanity to monitor the planet in ways never imagined possible. Enabled by the UNDP-led UN Biodiversity Lab, governments are beginning to use spatial data from these satellites, and combine these datasets with local and national data to generate new insight.

Supported by UNDP, and with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Government of Sweden, and One Earth, five governments – Uganda, Costa Rica, Peru, Kazakhstan and Colombia – have initiated a new process, called Mapping Nature For People and Planet: Essential Life Support Areas. Using satellite data, local and national data, and the principles of systematic conservation planning, these governments are able to pinpoint where actions on nature protection, restoration, and sustainable management will help them meet their nature-dependent national development goals, especially for water, food, climate, livelihoods, safety, and biodiversity. As Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the new head of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Francis Ogwal, co-chair of the working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, explain in a recent blog, such maps are an essential component for planning, implementing, and monitoring bold ambition and action on nature.

2020 was supposed to be a ‘Super Year for Nature.’ But even though all major biodiversity events have been postponed or cancelled, the recent gains in these five trends give us reasons for hope. To learn more, and for a dose of hope, visit www.NatureForLifeHub.org.

230,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/ministers-consider-policy-menu-for-financial-recovery-sdg-achievement/,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Ministers Consider Policy Menu for Financial Recovery, SDG Achievement","A group of finance ministers has prepared a menu of policy options on recovering from the COVID-19 crisis and mobilizing the financial resources needed to achieve the 2030 Agenda. Heads of State and Government will consider the policy menu at a high-level event on 29 September 2020.

Just like people with pre-existing conditions, countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19.

Speakers explained that developing countries are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many ways. As Ghana’s minister for finance said, the pandemic’s effects on Africa are “not a passing frigate, but a … dislocation of at least three years.”

Among the examples given:

Fiji has no active cases of COVID-19, but has lost revenue due to tourism and remittance declines. Similarly, the Maldives felt economic impacts of the pandemic before a case of COVID-19 was discovered locally, as it had to stop tourism for over three months – “the engine of our economic growth.”

Ghana could lose USD 1 billion through illicit financial flows, which is more than its entire health budget.

South Africa has the same debt-to-GDP ratio as Germany, but South Africa’s debt service payments are 4% of its GDP, while Germany’s are 0.7%. “This cannot be the right thing to do” in a time of such dire need, said Vera Songwe, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). High debt payments mean compromising test kits, tracing programmes, and acquiring vaccines.

Africa has no reserve currency, and will need USD 100billion/year to begin recovery.

The meeting on 8 September 2020 was convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and the finance ministers of Canada and Jamaica. Opening the meeting, the two convening ministers stressed the need for a multilateral response to the pandemic and the related economic crisis. Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance of Canada, acknowledged that the least developed countries (LDCs) feel the effects most acutely, lacking the resources to adopt recovery measures. Nigel Clarke, Minister of Finance of Jamaica, said the need for a global response to the pandemic has only increased, as its center of gravity has shifted to developing countries.

International officials then highlighted economic trends resulting from the pandemic, three priorities for policy makers, and the menu of policy options. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19, just like people with pre-existing conditions. She said countries that already had high debt levels are in terrible trouble, and tourism-dependent economies “are on their knees.” The priorities now are to: maintain support for these countries until their economies are fully turned around; extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) for another year; and invest in education, digital capacity, human capital, health systems, and social protection.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, said the menu of policy options provides measures for emergency response, recovery, and stability. Emergency mobilization measures could include extending and broadening the DSSI, declaring remittance services essential, and extending debt swap lines and special drawing rights (SDRs). Sustainable and inclusive recovering measures could include debt cancellations, debt-for-climate or debt-for-SDG swaps, and scaling up social protection and health coverage. Policy options for enabling a sustainable and resilient future including adopting climate-related financial risk disclosures, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and integrating the SDGs into national budgets.

Members of six discussion groups presented key findings of their work in June, July and August 2020, which generated the menu of policy options. For the group on external finance, remittances, jobs, and inclusive growth (Group 1), Japan reported that the G20 and Paris Club have agreed on an extension of the DSSI, and called for private sector funding. China announced that it is actively considering the DSSI extension. Egypt supported debt equity swaps to finance SDG-related investment.

On recovering better for sustainability (Group 2), the European Commissioner for Crisis Management stressed the need for a “green, digital, just, and resilient” recovery. Related policy options would support strong health systems, resource-efficient growth, and an open and secure digital society. He said this requires both public and private investment to fully align with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Rwanda said that in addition to an extended DSSI, developing countries also need: adjustments to the DSSI terms, debt restructuring, a replenished IDA 20, and access to financial markets at zero cost. “This is the road map” to recover better.

The UK said countries’ recovery plans should incorporate updated and enhanced climate NDCs, and they should align spending with the Paris Agreement. The UK will host the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021 (UNFCCC COP 26).

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) said digitalization can help mobilize finance and is a lifeline in this crisis. The International Development Finance Club (IDFC) said public development banks (PDBs) can help bridge the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and local policies, and momentum us growing between PDBs and stakeholders. IDFC announced that it will hold the ‘Finance in Common Summit’ on 12 November 2020, the first global meeting for all PDBs.

On global liquidity and financial stability (Group 3), Costa Rica announced a proposal for a USD 1 trillion fund to support emerging and poor countries with concessional loans for COVID-19 impacts. The World Bank echoed the importance of concessionality. Ghana said the SDR system should be extended. He cited a “disaster waiting to happen [in 2021] as countries begin to default.”

France and the World Bank indicated support for extending the DSSI. The World Bank added that more participation is needed from the private sector.

The Maldives proposed a tourism fund to ramp up testing in airports to restore trust in global travel. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) recommended a liquidity and sustainability facility to bring down the rates for debt service payments.

On debt vulnerability (Group 4), Pakistan said participation in the DSSI should not affect credit ratings. The African Union (AU) Commission said extending the DSSI is critical: “African countries need liquidity.”

The US said the G20 and Paris Club could consider further steps in 2021, depending on countries’ actions in the meantime, such as improving public financial management and directing investment to projects that strengthen economic growth).

The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) called or a debt swap for climate change to create a Caribbean resilience fund, which would require 12% of the total public debt (USD 7 billion).

On private sector creditors engagement (Group 5), Senegal said private sector DSSI might be relevant for certain countries, but it is not relevant for all, and “certainly not for Senegal.” Instead, it would “kick the can down the road” for countries that already have expensive commercial debt. Official debt cancellation will be needed for some countries, he stressed.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the aftermath of COVID-19 for developing countries – hunger, starvation, and poverty – will make its health consequences look very small.

Finally, on illicit financial flows (IFFs) (Group 6), Nigeria called for mutual legal assistance to address barriers to international cooperation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATAF) reported that the pandemic has been used to generate illicit funds, which are now flowing out of developing countries just when health services need it most. The solution is to implement the FATAF standards, he suggested.

Oxfam endorsed the recommendation to support the Addis Tax Initiative’s (ATI) 2020 mandate, and called for a UN tax convention to address tax havens, tax abuse, and other IFFs.

The ministers’ meeting will be followed by a Meeting of Heads and State and Government on 29 September to consider the policy options, and a series of thematic and regional meetings from October to December.

A follow-up meeting in December 2020 is being planned in order to benchmark progress in the context of the Decade of SDG Action.

Deutsche Post DHL Group, Microsoft Corp. and the PwC network (“PwC”) have already joined the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility and the initiative is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to contribute.

The Global Facility is a response to corporate calls to action for private sector leaders and governments to work together to address the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The initiative has been established to better coordinate their responses, helping to ensure that immediate stimulus efforts flow into the real economy.

The Global Facility will operate at both the global and national levels. It aims to co-create solutions that are tailored to the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given area and the specificities of the local private sector and government context. Guided by the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Facility will support a multisectoral, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to face the multidimensional nature of the crisis. Recovery efforts will focus on how to rebuild more inclusive economies and societies, to set a new course for a socially just, low-carbon and climate-resilient world where no one is left behind. Initial projects will focus on the countries of Colombia, Ghana, the Philippines and Turkey. Both the geographical scope and participating partners will expand as the Global Facility develops.

“Solidarity to ‘Recover Better Together’ can boost our collective efforts not only to cope with the crisis but overcome it. UNDP’s footprint across some 170 countries and territories, combined with the UN Global Compact’s network of more than 10,000 companies and 68 Local Networks around the world, and the International Chamber of Commerce’s network of over 45 million companies, multiplies our collective capacity and potential. The Facility is the first of its kind – designed to join forces across public and private sectors to serve humanity in an imperative moment,” said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility was announced by Mr Steiner at the SDG Business Forum during the UN General Assembly, the largest and most inclusive UN convening of private sector leaders. Launched under the motto “Recover Better Together”, the timing of this initiative has special importance, marking the commemoration of some important UN-related milestones: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations; the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Compact; and the Centenary of ICC’s founding after WWI at a time when multilateralism is facing the greatest challenge of its generation.

Initiating partners

The Initiating Partners are UNDP, UN Global Compact and ICC. Together, they will bring their unique access to global expertise on responsible business practices, economic recovery, green business transformation and multi-hazard risk management.

“As COVID-19 disrupts societies, development agendas must adjust accordingly. There is a need for inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the critical contributions of civil society, business, foundations, the research community, local authorities, cities and regional governments. By unlocking public-private and private-private cooperation for a sustainable response to COVID-19 challenges, it is possible to recover better and build more resilient economies,” said Mr Steiner.

The private sector has been acutely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact affirm the belief that businesses exist to serve and advance their societies, and their success cannot come at the cost of social or environmental regression.

“It is a moment of human tragedy and intense economic and social upheaval. But it is also a moment of possibility. Through partnerships like the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility we will support companies to Recover Better Together from the pandemic and finally confront global inequality by taking action, as well as mitigate the worst impacts of a climate emergency that threatens all of humanity. Together we can construct a new paradigm of resilience,” saidSanda Ojiambo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced around 70% of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to shut down their operations. SMEs represent 50% of global GDP and more than 70% of global employment. The partners of the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility, representing multinational, global and local private sector stakeholders, commit to joint projects to develop policy and financial solutions for pandemic relief.

ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said: “ICC’s local networks can bring value to the cooperation by reaching small business owners who want to have their challenges understood, their ideas heard, and their efforts to Recover Better recognised and built upon by others. SMEs need a way to facilitate this vital exchange of ideas, learning and experience with each other and with organisations and institutions in a position to support them.”

﻿

Private sector involvement

The COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility is supported by strategic partners DHL, Microsoft and PwC, and is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to join this initiative. The strategic partners will add their expertise and technology to support this transformational recovery.

“In the current situation our employees recognize more than ever before their contribution to the well-being of the population. Under extremely difficult circumstances Deutsche Post DHL Group kept the global flow of goods, secured supply chains and provided the world with the necessary protective equipment. We want to share our experience of operating during one of the biggest health crises in recent history to protect lives against the pandemic. Join our efforts of connecting people improving lives to address the upcoming challenges together with our long standing partner UNDP,” said Monika Schaller, EVP Group Communications, Sustainability and Brand.

Deutsche Post DHL Group embarked upon the idea to support the Global Facility before its launch. The company underlined that their world-wide network enables them to make a difference on the ground for the local SMEs and helps them to survive in the present situation by solving logistical constraints.

“In line with Microsoft’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, we firmly believe technology can be a force for good in these challenging times and we’re proud to partner with public and private sector partners in an effort to accelerate global recovery. We see The Global Facility as an opportunity to create economic opportunities for all, bring our sustainability investments forward to support growth and recovery in a manner that advances our shared environmental agendas, and use data and AI to a build a system of intelligence to help all stakeholders better target their efforts to the communities that need the most help.” said Justin Spelhaug, Microsoft VP and Global Head of Tech for Social Impact.

Firms from the global professional services network PwC joined the initiative at its conceptual stage with UNDP. PwC will continue to play an instrumental role in supporting the design and establishment of this flagship global public-private cooperation. Additionally, PwC will help to develop finance and policy solutions and coordinate multistakeholder engagement. PwC’s role in the Global Facility is led by PwC Poland and supported by PwC Canada, PwC Hungary, PwC India, PwC Norway, PwC Middle East, PwC Switzerland, PwC Turkey and PwC UK.

“At PwC, our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Together with our clients and communities, we are working to assess and mitigate the major challenges that the pandemic poses for our economies and societies. We are proud to be working with our public and private sector partners to help structure and implement real pandemic relief solutions that make a difference in people’s lives,” said Agnieszka Gajewska, PwC Poland Partner, CEE Public Sector and Infrastructure Leader.

In order to effectively reach the most vulnerable in the most efficient ways, the facility aims to expand the list of strategic partners.

Organisations that want to play a leading role in the global pandemic recovery and join this call to action are encouraged to contact the UNDP project coordinator at global.facility@undp.org for a discussion on how they can get involved.","Deutsche Post DHL Group, Microsoft Corp. and the PwC network (“PwC”) have already joined the COVID-19 Private Sector Global Facility and the initiative is open for other like-minded private sector organisations that want to contribute.

Gates Foundation presents new data,"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters. Photo by: ganphotography / Flickr / CC BY-NC-ND

SAN FRANCISCO — The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a 7% increase in extreme poverty, with an additional 37 million people living below $1.90 a day, according to a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Devex @ UNGA 75 How is COVID-19 affecting progress on the SDGs? Will online meetings mean greater international representation? Our reporters are covering the all-virtual 75th United Nations General Assembly to find out.

The fourth annual Goalkeepers report, which launched on Monday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, draws on new data to provide what the Gates Foundation describes in a press release as “the most current global dataset for how the pandemic is affecting progress toward the Global Goals.”

In addition to quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on the Sustainable Development Goals, Bill and Melinda Gates called for global collaboration on, and equitable delivery of, COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments in order to end the pandemic and get the SDGs back on track.

In its first three Goalkeepers reports, the Gates Foundation outlined steady progress on the SDGs, from reductions in malnutrition to improvements in literacy. But the 2020 report illustrates how COVID-19 has both stalled and reversed progress. For example, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the Gates Foundation’s data partner in the Goalkeepers report, found that COVID-19 will cause vaccine coverage to drop to levels that were last seen in the 1990s.

“In other words, we’ve been set back about 25 years in about 25 weeks,” Bill and Melinda Gates note in the report, speaking to vaccine coverage, which they call “a good proxy for how health systems are functioning.”

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic. After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.” — Bill Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

On a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Bill Gates said he had just spent three hours on the phone with Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote about the ripple effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

“Other than South Africa and some countries in Northern Africa, the actual number of infections and deaths has not been large in Africa,” he said. “Sadly, as our report documents, there’s probably more negative effects on health because of the disruption to the health system including malaria bed nets, HIV drugs, TB drugs, and routine immunization or measles campaigns.”

In Africa, where most primary health care systems fell short of where they should be even before the pandemic, there is a particularly urgent need for progress on the SDGs to resume, Bill Gates said.

The Gates Foundation has also spent time examining the implications of COVID-19 on agriculture and food security, said Rodger Voorhies, president of the Gates Foundation’s Global Growth & Opportunity Division.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the COVID-19 economic crisis is building on worsening climate stresses, as well as the locust infestation, to create unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, he said.

Due to the economic shocks of COVID-19, the number of people suffering from food insecurity is expected to increase by 83 to 132 million, Voorhies said, adding the Gates Foundation is still trying to get a grasp on the impact of the pandemic on hunger and nutrition.

While the Goalkeepers report is filled with charts of how the world is backsliding on nearly every SDG indicator the Gates Foundation measures, COVID-19 is likely to accelerate progress in one area: financial inclusion.

“Faced with the urgent need to get cash to people quickly while helping them maintain social distance, more than 130 governments have created or improved digital cash transfer programs,” the report explains.

As countries make these transactions easier for communities with high levels of poverty, it is critical they seize this moment to ensure that rising bank account ownership leads to meaningful financial inclusion, particularly for women, Voorhies said.

“How do we build back in a way that really targets the most vulnerable?” he asked. “We say in my group: ‘Everyone benefits from an economy that includes everyone.’ How do we turn that into a reality?”

The Goalkeepers report includes models demonstrating how, if countries buy up COVID-19 vaccines in order to protect their own people, they will extend the life of the pandemic globally.

Northeastern University ran two scenarios: one where 50 high-income countries received the first 2 billion doses out of 3 billion doses and another where all countries received the 3 billion doses proportional to their populations and regardless of their ability to pay.

In the report, Bill and Melinda Gates describe the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a global collaboration focused on the development and distribution of tools to fight the pandemic, as “the most serious collaborative effort to end the pandemic to date.”

During the press call, Bill Gates applauded commitments by French President Emmanual Macron, German President Angela Merkel, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and said the ACT Accelerator will be close to the funding it needs for procurement “once the U.S. shows its interest.”

Gates emphasized the need for more tools to fight COVID-19, but added that once those tools are available, the question becomes “how do we get the manufacturing and generosity up?”

Already aspirational, some SDG targets may need to be redefined, while others may be entirely out of reach — but the goals remain a critical framework for cooperation, Bill Gates also explained.

“The importance of the goals, if anything, is reinforced by the pandemic,” he said. “After all, the pandemic has in almost every dimension made inequity worse.”

But Bill Gates expressed concern about donor financing for the SDGs as countries turn inward to deal with the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation headquarters.

However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that this has become the norm, but if the meeting had been taking place in person, governments would have been able to adopt it by a vote. “In the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was found.

On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”

In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.

Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.

The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.

According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.

If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.

Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.

The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council announced that only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries have expressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’

It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariat reports that it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.

In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’s Montreal Protocol has facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.

The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, which came into force in January 2019. It calls for reducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, several negotiation sessions and the meeting during which the post-2020 global biodiversity framework was expected to be adopted – the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) – have been postponed until 2021. A key event on the 2020 agenda remains on the sustainable development calendar, albeit in a virtual format: the UN Summit on Biodiversity.

To prepare for this meeting, share information with CBD Parties, and reinvigorate the global discussion on biodiversity issues, the CBD Secretariat organized a series of online sessions from 15-18 September 2020. The sessions were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the 24th meeting of the CBD’s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) and third meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI).

The fifth edition of the Global Biodiversity Outlook was launched on the first day of the virtual sessions. This flagship report provided a final report card on progress against the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by CBD Parties in 2010 and meant to be achieved by 2020. The report examines progress and prospects for interdependent transitions by 2050 related to eight areas: Land and Forests; Freshwater; Fisheries and Oceans; Sustainable Agriculture; Food Systems; Cities and Infrastructure; Climate Action; and One Health. The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” to:

enhance conservation and restoration of ecosystems;

mitigate climate change;

take action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation;

move towards more sustainable production of goods and services; and

reduce consumption and waste.

On the second and third days, five countries presented reports on their implementation efforts, in an exercise to test a process for conducting party-led reviews of implementation of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. This test was organized to support the effort to develop an enhanced review mechanism in the context of COP 15 and the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

Also on the third day, participants discussed a report from the Expert Panel on Resource Mobilization, which has identified challenges, including the presence of subsidies that are harmful to biodiversity, a lack of mainstreaming, a failure to address the private sector and other financial mechanisms, and a lack of priority for biodiversity outside environment ministries.

On the final day, the Co-Chairs of the Open-ended Working Group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, Basile van Havre and Francis Ogwal, provided an update on the zero draft of the framework. The Co-Chairs reported that the draft includes a new goal on means of implementation, milestones to ensure progress, and a deadline of 2030 for each target, among other changes. A target on the recovery and conservation of wild flora and fauna was added as well.

The UN Summit on Biodiversity is taking place as part of the opening weeks of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 75), with a high-level dialogue on the the theme, ‘Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development’.

The meeting aimed to set a work plan for 2021, the last year in a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Convention, among other objectives.

The Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) guides work between meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP). Building on outcomes of the 19th COP in 2019, the 12th meeting of the OEWG convened for the first of two segments – an online segment on 1 and 3 September 2020 (with 2 September featuring online side events on legal issues for the Convention). The second segment is expected to be an in-person segment in March 2021. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the online segment of OEWG12 “paved the way for quick decisions at the March 2021 face-to-face segment, if the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.”

The OEWG worked to advance technical guidelines on:

wastes containing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury;

incineration on land and on specially engineered landfills; and

the identification and environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic wastes and their disposal.

Participants also followed up on actions taken in 2019: amending the Basel Convention annexes to deal with plastic waste, and creating a new Plastic Waste Partnership. In his address to OEWG12, Basel Convention Executive Secretary Rolph Payet pleaded with parties not to backtrack on their commitments to reduce single-use plastics and to renew efforts in this regard.

In the discussion, countries differed over whether they should further address upstream matters on preventing plastic waste. They also considered the value of an effectiveness assessment of action so far. The ENB reports that intervening parties supported vigorous follow-up to the 2019 amendment and the work of the Plastic Waste Partnership, but several expressed concern whether an effectiveness assessment is premature.

As explained by the ENB, OEWG12 still needs to decide the fate of an update of the technical guidelines on plastic waste, guidance on creating national inventories on plastic waste, a report on possible future activities on the issue under the Convention, the status of the Plastic Waste Partnership, and a proposal to the World Customs Organization to amend the Harmonized System to identify plastic wastes.

The OEWG also discussed technical guidelines on transboundary movements of e-waste and used electrical and electronic equipment, which were adopted in 2019. A deadline of 30 October 2020 is in place for parties to use and test the guidelines. Two countries introduced a proposal to make all e-waste shipments (whether or not considered hazardous) subject to the prior informed consent procedure. While some parties expressed support for the idea, several observers raised concerns that it would not improve the e-waste trade situation and would not support the transition towards a circular economy.

On ESM of waste lead-acid batteries, many participants indicated an urgent need to update the technical guidelines.

The Group also spent time on a ten-year strategic framework for implementing the Basel Convention (2012-2021), which will end next year. The Group reviewed the status of the draft report on the evaluation of this framework.

Per the ENB, as the online segment closed, OEWG12 still needed to reach agreement on a number of proposals to improve Convention implementation before COP15:

recommendations of the evaluation of the Strategic Framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention;

a practical manual for stakeholders to ensure that notifications of transboundary movements meet ESM requirements under the Convention;

recommendations for possible amendment proposals to the Convention’s annexes;

options for a system under the Convention to allow the automation of processes and the electronic exchange of information relating to the notification and movement of hazardous and other wastes; and

practical manuals on preparing national inventories on priority waste streams.

OEWG12 is now suspended. It plans to reconvene at a face-to-face meeting in March 2021, in Nairobi, Kenya (back-to-back with the fifth UN Environment Assembly, UNEA-5). This tentative plan is subject to the availability of resources and a positive development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outcomes of the deliberations of the OEWG will be transmitted to COP 15, scheduled to be held back-to-back with the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention (RC COP-10) and the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention (SC COP-10) from 19-30 July 2021, in Geneva, Switzerland.

The report titled, ‘Valuing Nature Conservation: A Methodology for Quantifying the Benefits of Protecting the Planet’s Natural Capital,’ was issued on 22 September 2020, ahead of the first UN Biodiversity Summit.

The report highlights the global economy’s dependence on natural capital, and argues that “analysis of opportunities to expand nature conservation can help determine where natural capital could have the biggest impact on climate, jobs, and health.”

Noting scientists’ call for the permanent conservation of at least 30% of the planet’s surface by 2030, the report identifies the need for “rigorous data-driven analysis” to enable decision makers to design conservation efforts that would also capture benefits and manage risks, and to make informed trade-offs. In an effort to contribute to such efforts, the report provides a methodology to evaluate the full spectrum of co-benefits from nature conservation.

The report’s authors used “advanced geospatial analytics to create and evaluate alternative nature conservation scenarios and explore trade-offs.” The authors divided the planet’s surfaces into “pixels” (land areas of 5 kilometers by 5 kilometers and marine areas of 30 kilometers by 30 kilometers), reaching a total of around 6 million pixels. They overlaid the resultant “global map with thousands of spatial data layers” covering variables such as biodiversity, carbon stock, and human footprint “to establish a baseline for nature conservation and define six alternative scenarios to maximize the value from expanded conservation.” The authors then assessed the impact of expanded conservation on climate change, jobs, gross domestic product (GDP), zoonotic disease risk, and biodiversity, calculating the additional operating costs of conservation.

The report finds that, depending on the conservation scenario, doubling the amount of conserved land and national waters could require an additional USD 20 billion to 45 billion a year. In more than half of the conservation areas identified, it notes, “the economic benefits from ecotourism and sustainable fishing alone could outweigh these costs by at least three times.” At the same time, the benefits of doubling the amount of conserved land and national waters could include:

annual reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by 0.9 gigatons to 2.6 gigatons;

creation of 400,000 to 650,000 jobs in conservation management fields, along with generating or safeguarding USD 300 billion to 500 billion in GDP and 30 million jobs in ecotourism and sustainable fishing; and

lowering the risk of new zoonotic diseases.

The authors acknowledge that expanding the conservation of natural capital at the local and global levels would require action by multiple stakeholders. They offer the following recommendations:

Private-sector organizations would benefit from understanding the growing risks to supply chains and operating assets from the loss of natural capital, which could also help them identify nature conservation investments to address these risks.

would benefit from understanding the growing risks to supply chains and operating assets from the loss of natural capital, which could also help them identify nature conservation investments to address these risks. National governments could use the methodology “to better understand the investment case for expanding nature conservation.”

could use the methodology “to better understand the investment case for expanding nature conservation.” Intergovernmental organizations could “use analytics to identify conservation targets, support national governments in making conservation investment decisions, and promote international dialogue.”

could “use analytics to identify conservation targets, support national governments in making conservation investment decisions, and promote international dialogue.” Conservation practitioners and donors could use the geospatial approach to identify areas to invest in and build alliances for stakeholder engagement to increase the number of conservation projects worldwide, while ensuring their effective and efficient implementation.

This fall, a passionate team of students—known as the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Working Group—will educate, connect and mobilize students to make positive change on campus, as well as advance the SDGs at the University of Manitoba.

The group will raise student awareness of the United Nations SDGs, mobilize students and student groups around the SDGs, and act as a point of contact between the UM student body and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Youth. They will help students learn about and take action on the SDGs as well as work with UM leadership and faculty to promote the integration of the SDGs into campus activities.

Saving and protecting SDG's rural heritage, one old barn at a time Supplied

Article content My hometown could have looked very different today. Just after the Second World War in downtown Toronto, large swaths of late Victorian buildings were demolished to put up the Gardiner Expressway and construction began on what is now a cement and steel celebration of height in office towers and condominium buildings. And then, in 1965 a most spectacular 64 years-old stone and marble homage to money was demolished for what is now the iconic Toronto Dominion Centre, a full block of sleek black glass and steel anchoring Bay Street in the psyche of our nation.

Saving and protecting SDG's rural heritage, one old barn at a time Back to video A cemetery of sorts for the Corinthian columns of this dismantled Bank of Toronto building plundered for the modernist ground-breaking design was created along the Scarborough Bluffs, a park now popular for wedding photos. In 1972, two men took a road trip around Ontario and Quebec to document barns. One man was Eric Arthur a professor of architecture at the University of Toronto and a Companion of the Order of Canada. The other man was Dudley Witney photographer and writer.

Article content At a time in Toronto when architecture was focused on topping this sleek beauty of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s TD Bank Complex and the pending start to the CN Tower they set out to study the humble barn. The product of their quest was The Barn: A Vanishing Landmark in North America. The first sentences of their introduction to the book summarizes the motivation for these two men to seek out the agricultural structures which are a beacon to rural life: “Is it possible that millions now living in North America have never seen a barn, let alone been in one. In the foreseeable future, there is more than a possibility that, for many, the kind of barn illustrated in these pages will not be there to see. When one considers the exposure of our old barns to the winds of change,… the marvel is that any are left for those who would try to comprehend the secrets that they hold.” Possibly in rural communities, the ordinary barn does not hold the extraordinary draw it does for city-folk like us. If you were to ask us why we chose Apple Hill to live and work on our organic farm it is most definitely because we fell in love with our stone house and the three barns and not necessarily in that order. At Springfield Farm, we are fortunate to have three examples of barn architecture from the large dairy barn, the mid-sized Drive Shed and the smaller shingled Chicken Coop. While my barn-love went immediately to the large dairy barn, it is the Drive Shed that holds the most promise for our future operation as an AgriTourism destination and equally as an outstanding example of barn architecture having withstood well over 100 years of use and weather.

Article content There is something awe-inspiring in standing inside these barns and looking upwards at the hand-chiseled beams and trusses. One can imagine the day that the barn was raised and the men that climbed precariously to lift each truss in place without the assistance of modern machinery and safety precautions. In South Glengarry, the go-to barn restorers are Hamelin’s Restoration and co-owner Bob Hamelin provided his insights on barns in our region during a recent interview: “From the point of view of someone who has had the privilege of being part of several barn preservation projects in SDG over the last 24 years, in and around Glengarry, my brother and I have earned the reputation of being the old barn brothers. We regularly receive calls to come have a look at an old barn or granary to give our humble opinion on its condition. I never pass up the opportunity to visit a neighbour who has concerns about his aging barn. Usually the conversation starts with we would like to save it, but we aren’t sure it’s worth it…” Barns were a must have for our ancestors in Glengarry. For me it was my grandparents. They needed their barn to survive and to feed their family. The barn was part of the family, it was part of daily life. They stuck with it through the good times and the hard times. Part of the enjoyment I get when visiting a barn is piecing together the story it tells — changes that were made over the years, efforts to patch up damage when money was scarce, ingenious methods to hold something up when you could only use what you had available on hand, renovations made to accommodate new equipment when you had a good year… It reminds me that I’m not the first to work on the barn and hopefully not the last.

Article content A testimony to the respect an old barn can inspire is when I think back about some of the most extensive restoration projects I have done with clients from the city, Montreal or Toronto, who purchased property in SDG. Several of them confided in me that if there hadn’t been an old barn on the property, they probably wouldn’t have bought it. Funny thing — these people had very little use for the barn, but they were so impressed with the structure, and they imagined the history behind it, and they imagined that maybe one day they would use it for something too…They were convinced it was worth it. I feel we should save our last barns — it is worth it. For me saving doesn’t necessarily mean a full restoration, saving could just mean hiring a qualified person to patch the roof, or brace a failing timber, fix a section of crumbling stone wall… Just care enough to save it for the time being. Who knows what the future holds, you might need that barn yet! And Hamelin’s perspective is shared by Stratford Architect, Krista Hulshof Duynisveld, Veld Architecture Firm and Co-Founder, Ontario Barn Preservation Society when she states: “Barns contribute to our cultural rural heritage landscape. They are important and iconic landmarks in the countryside. Much like in the UK, where your mind’s picture is that of small farms, with brown brick buildings and hedge rows, barns are part of their preservation plan to maintain their iconic landscape. They contribute to agritourism. Their simple shape and form is so embedded in our culture that we teach children that a barn looks like a red heritage barn, not a long low modern barn!”

Article content There is a lot to learn about the vernacular development of communities. The barn types and construction tell us a lot about the heritage of the people there. I think this type of research can really contribute to the revitalization of rural communities. The ecology of settlement, and construction is fascinating. It makes me very sad when one (barn) goes missing as I drive familiar routes. I feel a hole in the landscape where it no longer stands. They are disappearing faster than I would like, that is why, despite my time constraints with a small family and growing architecture practice, I couldn’t wait any longer to start the Ontario Barn Preservation group and begin an inventory of barns across Ontario. Thankfully, in South Glengarry, as well as in the rest of SDG, there is growing support and interest for the preservation and re-purposing of barns. Through the COVID-lens, the opportunity is upon us as a community to collect an inventory of our barns, those with significant heritage or purpose, those with owners who are concerned for the future of their barns and those that possibly could be moved to a local park area and preserved for generations to come. We should not want to miss an opportunity to become an AgriTourism destination with the added attraction of hosting barn tours and heritage talks. And, as a community we should be cautioned by Toronto’s tale of demolishing the artistry of their buildings for the cause of modernization. Are we rural or urban? Why not make your next COVID-19 project a Sunday drive down memory lane and through our beautiful fall countryside to find that barn worth saving! M. Eleanor McGrath is a member of the Standard-Freeholder’s community editorial board.

Titled ""2020 Taipei City Voluntary Local Review"" (VLR), the report listed four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were not included in the 2019 edition: quality education; gender equality; decent work and economic growth; and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The SDGs are a set of 17 global objectives that constitute a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all as set forth by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.

Taipei has incorporated the SDGs into its response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. Related actions include establishing quarantine hotels and tracking systems, promoting online courses to ensure the right to education, launching bailout packages to prop up the economy, and disinfecting public places and transport to reduce the risk of transmission.

The city has also made efforts to bolster disease control at the community level, implement proper waste disposal management to ensure a zero transmission environment, and compile relevant standard operation procedures in English to more easily share the city's experience with the world.

As for the four additional SDGs in this year’s report, the city pledged measures such as increasing subsidies for public daycare centers, raising public awareness of domestic violence, and providing employment matchmaking services. In terms of infrastructure, the city is upgrading its public transit network to integrate the MRT, buses, and bicycles as solutions to the ""last mile"" problem while improving accessibility to public facilities.

Centered around climate action and energy transition, the international forum was held in Taipei, and sessions were live-streamed. Representatives from the EU, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), the Netherlands, France, and Japan shared their experience in sustainable development policies at the forum, with some participating via videoconference or recorded videos.

Artur Runge-Metzger, director of the European Commission’s DG CLIMA, shared how the EU will strive to promote post-coronavirus climate action under the European Green Deal. IGES Joint Program Director Yatsuka Kataoka gave an overview of cities’ SDG strategies.

Akiko Okubo, director at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Bureau of Environment, told attendees about the Japanese capital’s path to zero emissions. The Dutch and French representative offices in Taipei as well as the governments of Los Angeles and Utrecht Municipality shared their respective journeys to promote low-carbon alternatives.

As for Taiwan’s answer to the energy transition, Sunny Founder proposed energy generation that involves citizen participation.

249,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-mulan,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Mulan’,"Replacing songs, bickering ancestral spirits and a tiny dragon sidekick with a shapeshifting witch and high-flying martial arts, this live-action remake doesn’t quite rise to the heights of Disney’s best remakes, but still manages to stand on its own.

At this point it seems pretty clear that the kiss of death, creatively speaking, for Disney’s new line of live-action/CGI remakes is a Broadway musical.

Until now, the better Disney remakes have been inspired reworkings of older films (Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Pete’s Dragon) that improved on their predecessors. The beloved cartoons of the Disney Renaissance (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin), on the other hand, have been adapted with stifling “fidelity,” serving only to highlight the superiority of the hand-animated originals. (Tim Burton’s Dumbo makes the point that loose adaptations of non-Renaissance cartoons can also be uninspired.)

Disney’s 1998 Mulan, loosely inspired by Chinese folklore about a woman named Hua Mulan who disguises herself as a man to take her father’s place in battle, is a Renaissance cartoon — but the remake, from director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) and several writers, including husband-wife reboot specialists Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes; Jurassic World; Avatar 2), doesn’t treat the cartoon as a sacred text.

Instead, following in the footsteps of Cinderella and The Jungle Book, the new Mulan weaves elements of the cartoon with new threads drawn from older sources (in this case The Ballad of Mulan and the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties) as well as new material invented for the film.

For example, Mulan’s ancestors are still reverentially invoked, along with the family’s “ancestral guardian,” here represented by a stone phoenix rather than a stone dragon. But the ancestors no longer appear as bickering luminous spirits or in any other form, and Eddie Murphy’s wisecracking dragon sidekick has been replaced with a silent, kite-like phoenix that may or may not exist in Mulan’s imagination.

The new Mulan isn’t even a musical — a liberty that would be unthinkable if the brand extended to Broadway. Instead, it’s a visually lavish, wuxia-influenced martial-arts action movie with warriors running on sheer walls or flying through the air to kick spears or arrows in midflight toward new targets with superhuman precision.

The result, while it doesn’t necessarily improve on its animated predecessor, isn’t overshadowed by it either and finds its own reason for existing.

Most notably, the redoubtable Gong Li plays a shapeshifting witch named Xianniang who serves the leader of the Rouran Khanate invading force led by fearsome Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee).

In the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties, Xianniang was a warrior daughter of the enemy king who bonded with Mulan after learning that Mulan, too, was a woman in a man’s world. Li’s Xianniang likewise feels a connection to Mulan (Liu Yifei), even if the feeling isn’t mutual.

Hated and feared even by her allies because of her magical powers, Xianniang serves the Khan in the hope of a future in which she might be accepted.

Mulan isn’t a witch, though she may be at risk of being branded one. From her youth she has had a natural gift for wielding chi — life force or energy — and her doting father, Zhou (Tzi Ma), a disabled veteran, couldn’t resist training his little girl as he would a son.

As she grows, though, Mulan’s exuberant antics — highlighted in a fun opening set piece involving a chicken — are increasingly socially unacceptable.

A daughter, we’re told over and over (a lot of things are repeated over and over), brings honor to her family by making a good marriage; Mulan must hide her gifts and learn to comport herself as a traditional Chinese bride.

This is potentially the stuff of “Squelched Girl Syndrome,” and, while Mulan is too spirited to be fully squelched, she does internalize the pressure to hide her gifts a bit too well.

Even passing as a man in Imperial Army boot camp, she berates herself after being provoked into revealing her abilities during a sparring match with a handsome recruit named Chen Honghui (Yoson An). (Donnie Yen plays the commanding officer who takes an interest in Mulan’s prowess. In contrast to the cartoon, Mulan’s romantic feelings are for her fellow recruit rather than her commander, reflecting post-Me Too concerns about romantic or sexual interest between leaders and subordinates.)

Xianniang, of course, sees through Mulan’s pretense — and, strikingly, sees her deception as a kind of compromising weakness, one with consequences. One of the themes in this telling is that Mulan fails to live up to the third of three virtues engraved on her father’s sword: “Loyal,” “Brave” and “True.” The cartoon Mulan’s true identity is accidentally revealed following an injury; the live-action film takes a different path.

Crucially, Caro directs combat sequences with flair; standout sequences include a face-off between Mulan’s company and Rouran fighters in a narrow corridor in the Imperial City, the capture of the Emperor (who mounts a terrific resistance, as you’d expect from Jet Li, but is overcome in a clever way) and the final showdown between Mulan and Bori Khan.

At times the wuxia elements seem inconsistently deployed. Long after it’s established that Mulan can run on walls and fly through the air, she has to clamber laboriously over rooftops — but only sometimes — at a moment when speed is of the essence. And while I liked that corridor fight in the Imperial City, shouldn’t Rouran fighters who can wield chi well enough to run on walls be more than a match for a similar number of Imperial troops who can’t?

I enjoyed Mulan, but I couldn’t avoid the sense of disconnect inherent in watching a wuxia-style period piece with Chinese actors speaking accented English dialogue. I imagine the disconnect will be sharper for Asian viewers for whom the essential Americanness of the production, and the shallowness of the Chinese cultural setting, will be more glaringly evident.

250,https://theseeker.ca/2020/09/united-way-centraide-of-sdg-launched-2020-campaign-on-facebook-live/,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Seeker,United Way/Centraide of SDG launched 2020 Campaign on Facebook Live,"[CORNWALL, September 10] The United Way/Centraide of SDG officially launched its 2020 Campaign on Facebook Live today. A key theme of the 30-minute video was the importance of strategic partnerships and collaboration to effectively meet the challenges of poverty in our community, and how the United Way of SDG strives to be a leader in poverty reduction.

“A dollar to the United Way is spent in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing costs, sharing expertise and building together the community we call home,” said Juliette Labossière, Executive Director of United Way of SDG, during the live virtual event.

The United Way/Centraide of SDG members continued to grow in 2020 with the organization funding 16 local agencies and 20 programs compared to 14 agencies and 16 programs in 2019. In 2020-2021, the United Way of SDG will invest $337,786 into the community through these 16 agencies who all fall under the organization’s three pillars: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be and building strong and healthy communities.

Labossière further talked about the increased relevancy of The United Way of SDG and several local organizations during the current pandemic, touching on how strategic partnerships with the Social Development Council of Cornwall & Area, 30 members of the Emergency Response Council, and the generosity of the City of Cornwall and citizens across our entire region contributed to fewer people being negatively impacted by the pandemic than could have been. It was the advocacy and a coordinated approach through these partnerships that enabled the United Way of SDG to distribute $530,000 into our region over the last 5 months. This included Akwesasne, Cornwall and all of our counties.

The work to ease our way out of the pandemic, however, is far from over and the United Way of SDG worries about the real social impact of the pandemic that will emerge in the next few months.

“I urge you to think about the United Way as the united front that will assist our community and non-profits to weather this upcoming storm and support the community on all levels as necessary,” Labossière asked of the viewers as their support is vital to the United Way’s continued work in the community.

David Booyink, Campaign Chair, also shared a few words on why he volunteers, “I’ve always had this growing desire since I was a young boy to save lives, to make a difference.” Volunteering is a way everyone can help, and the United Way of SDG urges you to research its member agencies and look for opportunities to get involved.

Maureen Miller, a mother of two, shared how volunteers changed her life. She discussed her experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall (a United Way of SDG member agency), emphasizing just how much of an impact the program has had on her kids’ lives. It has given them the support and friendships they need to find happiness and explore new opportunities that they may not have had if not for the mentorship of their Big Brothers and Big Sister.

And to end the live event, John Hoyles, Executive Director of the Community Information Centre of Ottawa, shared an important resource that everyone in SDG can use. 211 is an informational helpline and website that connects people to the right information and services to navigate life’s challenges. This resource saw a 20% increase in SDG during the first few months of COVID-19 and Hoyles expects it will increase in popularity as we move into winter.

“The most important thing for us is to get more people to know about 211,” Hoyles stressed as this is a service for people to turn to when they have nowhere to go. His goal is to “make 211 just as known as 911,” and encourages viewers to help spread the word about this lifeline for the people who need it.

Article content GLEN WALTER — Some are predicting a very harsh winter, so it’s a good idea to have a reliable snow removal service lined up. That could be problematic, however. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Cornwall-SDG snow removal companies say they're struggling to survive Back to video Several local residential snow removal operators are sounding the alarm the industry is in a struggle – with its very survival at stake. “We’re fighting for our future,” said Frank Aroz, who operates Cornwall Snow Removal along with his wife Brenda, who technically is the owner, and son Matthew. The retired couple started operating the company back in 2014, a seasonal family business, with a list of drivers to call upon, a three-tractor operation. But times have gotten a lot tougher in recent years due to rising liability insurance costs, costs that seemed poised to rocket higher, and could launch the Arozs and other operators across the province right out of the industry. “Our fight is with the insurance companies, we need them to stop this nonsense,” Frank Aroz said. “We want fair premiums for fair coverage. . . right now we’re in line to provide the services (this upcoming winter), but it’s an urgent situation.”

Article content Another local operator, who wished to not have his name used in this article, said he believes it’s a strong assumption a lot of the mom-and-pop snow removal businesses may not be able to continue operating – even this year. He said it’s not known if some of them will be able to afford the premiums. The Arozs say they recently received a letter from their insurance company that, as of mid-October, their coverage would end, and that they suspect it’s due to potential liability claims. That’s had Brenda contacting “many, many brokers,” looking to get coverage, and without luck so far. Frank said he’s confident Cornwall Snow Removal will be able to, ultimately, get coverage, and provide services, but he knows it’ll come at a hefty price. “Our premiums will be going up – they’ll quadruple this year,” he said. “(But) we’ll do our damnedest to provide (services) to our clients, we have a rapport with them.” The Arozs said last year their premium was $345 a month, and with a huge increase expected, the best hope this season might be to merely break even. “We will survive this season, but who knows after that?” Frank said. The issue of skyrocketing costs in the snow removal industry came up early last February – before the pandemic – when the need to reduce layers of bureaucracy and red tape was a prevalent theme at MPP Jim McDonell’s pre-budget consultation meetings in Cornwall. Small business owner Mike Dominick, of Bainsville, was among the speakers at the table the owner/operator of Husky Services Snow Removal telling McDonell he and many other small business owners were continuing to struggle with rapidly rising liability insurance costs.

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content “(Snow-removal businesses) cannot support insurance rate increases of 400 per cent in two years,” Dominick said, telling McDonell it was his fervent hope Bill 118 would be “expedited to pass before summer break” of the Ontario Legislative Assembly. Bill 118 is seen as possible relief for snow removal operations, as it would amend the Occupier’s Liability Act and help relieve some of the risk of slip and fall claims caused by snow and ice. The bill, which passed second reading in June of 2019, would decrease to 10 days the amount of time one can decide to start a law suit; individuals have been able to sue for personal injuries up to two years after an injury. One local snow removal operator told the Standard-Freeholder on Thursday that slip-and-fall lawsuits in the last year became a big problem, leading to out-of-control liability costs. He said snow removal companies working at commercial jobs are susceptible, but claims against companies plowing or blowing snow from residential driveways are almost unheard of. In six years with their insurance company, the Arozs said they have had no claims. But, the operators agree that the costs for commercial property claims are getting passed on to the little guys, to those providing residential services. And some might not survive because of it, even though it’s arguably a very essential service – just ask a senior citizen who needs the driveway cleared to get out to a medical appointment. “A lot of our clients are senior citizens,” Frank Aroz said. “If we don’t plow the driveway, guess what, they can’t get to the appointment.’’ And what could make matters worse this year, the Arozs say, is that so many seniors normally down south in the winter won’t be going anywhere. “Our main concern is our clients,” Brenda said. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

253,https://guardian.ng/news/lagos-launches-maiden-sdg-week/,"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Guardian,Lagos launches maiden SDG week | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News,"The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

According to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals and Investment, Mrs Solape Hammond, the endeavour is a symbol of the State’s strong leadership, vision and commitment towards greater development.

Hammond also stressed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s spirited resolve to address the development needs of Lagosians, particularly in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

“The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has heightened the call for renewed dedication to sustainable development by governments at various levels, which Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has taken as a great priority and infused in the state’s development agenda codenamed THEMES (Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism as well as Security and Governance).

“While the pandemic has significantly exacerbated some of the problems Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are set to solve, it has also triggered the necessity for more concerted actions in addressing many developmental issues troubling our world,” she asserted.

Hammond disclosed that the event, in commemoration of the United Nations’ Global Goals Week, will run till the end of September 2020, and will mobilise collaborative efforts to connect SDGs actors and cross-sector stakeholders with a view to identifying solutions, reviewing progress, amplifying awareness, collaborating and reaffirming commitment towards accelerating efforts to achieve the 17 SDGs and the 2030 agenda.

She explained that the State Government is setting lofty precedence in the country, and perhaps in Africa by effectively mobilising individual action towards the attainment of the SDGs, and added that the administration would continue to drive, extract and utilise available platforms towards improving the living standard of the people.

In his remark, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on SDGs, Mr. Lekan Fatodu, said the focus is to double up our efforts and galvanise more actions towards the attainment of the global goals.

“Lagos State is reputable for audacious strides and accomplishments. And these remarkable traits are consistently being brought to bear in our approaches towards realising the SDGs. This maiden SDGs Week is a clear demonstration of our acknowledgement of many dynamic and relevant ways of amplifying the significance of the SDGs and, more importantly, a strategic way of identifying and attracting passionate drivers of the SDGs in Lagos State to join hands towards achieving the goals.

“The effort to reach everybody, including the most vulnerable and marginalized, requires strong community and citizen engagement and organic participation. This strategy holds great value as we approach the last decade of SDGs,” he affirmed.

Fatodu further stated that “the Sustainable Development Goal Week is a proactive and ground-breaking initiative to implement joint efforts towards meeting the targets and indicators of the SDGs”.

While applauding the unalloyed contributions of prominent individuals, Corporate Institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Governor’s aide revealed that “the initiative will further bring to fore the need for urgent and collective effort towards finding sustainable solutions to current and impending challenges facing humanity”.

The SDGs week will feature sustainable development-related activities that are intrinsically linked in their purpose to fast-track efforts towards progress in realizing the SDGs. Some of these activities include the Open Goals Adoption by top state functionaries and prominent Lagos residents, the Neighbourhood Outreach Campaign to enlighten citizens on their roles in achieving the Goals and an SDGs discourse with CSOs and youth groups that are focused on the SDGs.

The highlight of the week will be the distribution of support items and relief materials donated by corporate organisations and well-meaning Lagosians to vulnerable people in some communities and the disbursement of exercise books to primary schools in rural communities. This is in tandem with the ‘Turn It Around’ theme of the Global Goals Week, which seeks to empower people and communities to stem the negative tide of the pandemic as the deadline for the achievement of the global goals draws nearer.

In support of the Lagos SDGs Week and SDG 2 – Zero Hunger, the Old English Bakery will open all its outlets across Lagos State, where thousands of free loaves of bread will be given to Lagosians.

Amongst the reputable organisations and individuals supporting the inaugural Lagos SDGs Week are Procter & Gamble, Post Assurance Brokers, accomplished entrepreneur and global SDGs advocate, Mr. Tonye Cole; CEO, Post Assurance Brokers, Mr. Lekan Ajisafe; Human Resources expert, Ms. Mary Dinah and businessman, Akogun Lanre Alfred.","The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

It was back in 2014 when McGrath, a documentary filmmaker, and McCarthy, an engineer – the couple has four children – purchased the over 200-year-old, 118-acre farm, and began splitting their time between what is life in the Toronto rat race and the solitude of Glengarry, working to establish Springfield in the growing agri-tourism/local food economy. There were organically-grown vegetables for sale at Springfield, walking tours, a variety of other activities – and lots of interest in a work-in-progress café. McCarthy talked about the “field-to-table” experience and Springfield’s experimenting in different crops over the years. “Some have been very successful,” McCarthy said. “This year garlic was very successful here.” The Farm Hop event ran in two, two-hour blocks, late on Saturday morning and from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.

Freezer beef and freezer chicken is sold at Jamink Farm, which has been organic since 2002, and owned by Thomas Booijink since 2013 when he bought it from his parents. “(Farm Hop is) all about reconnecting with your farmer and (learning more about) where your food comes from,” Julia said. “(Organic farming is) all about the quality of the food and leaving the land better for the next generation.” It’s a passion for the Booijinks and, in Julia’s case, goes back to her growing up on a dairy farm in Almonte. And after graduating from University of Guelph, and when Julia was living in the Woodstock area, she was milking cows in a rented barn there. Fifty cows were eventually moved from Woodstock to Jamink Farm, which had to get certified again as organic, and in 2013 it started shipping organic milk once again. Other Farm Hop participants included Alexandria’s Dream Small Farm, as well as at sites in Dalkeith, St-Eugene and St-Pascal-Baylon. Participants were asked to register online and choose which farm or farms they wished to visit, in order to comply with COVID-19 safety measures. thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

259,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/boosting-education-for-greener-forests/,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Boosting Education for Greener Forests,"With every new forest fire or flood, and with every new report on the loss of wildlife or increase in desertification, we are reminded that we urgently need greater attention and efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the world’s forests. Fewer natural disasters, a more stable climate, healthier people, and stronger economies are just some of the benefits that we stand to gain from helping forests to thrive.

But do we know enough about the world’s forests to take care of them properly?

There is growing international concern over the quality and availability of training and education needed both to prepare those whose daily work and decisions most closely impact the sustainable management of forests, and to inform new generations who will look after forest resources in the future.

We can only guess at how many children these days dream of being a forester when they grow up – likely too few. For the sake of our forests, we have to turn this situation around.

We need talented students to enter forest education programmes. We need well-trained forest managers and policymakers. We need to provide more opportunities for informal training and continuing education for forest communities and forest owners and businesses. And we need to reach the broader public.

After all, there is important work to do.

Internationally agreed targets for improving lives and protecting the planet recognize the vital importance of forests, which provide livelihoods for over a billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures.

SDG 15, for one, aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Other SDGs, such as those concerned with clean water (SDG 6) and the elimination of hunger and poverty (SDGs 2 and 1), depend to a great extent on the sustainable management of forests and urban green spaces.

To ensure that forests fulfil their potential in helping to achieve many development goals, including SDG 13 (climate action), we need to enrich forest education and inspire a new generation of forest managers. This is no easy task.

Heads of forestry from across the world are meeting online for the 25th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Committee on Forestry and 7th World Forest Week. Here, FAO and international partners are unveiling details of an assessment of forest education being conducted across six regions.

The first of its kind, the survey will gather comprehensive information on where, how, and how well forest education is being taught, from primary and secondary schools to technical and vocational institutions and universities.

The survey (open for responses until 31 October) is part of an ambitious project led by FAO, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO). The project, funded by the German government, aims to enhance forest education at national and local levels, and to address the considerable deficiencies in forest education in many parts of the world.

There are several ways we can try to achieve this. Providing easy access to information on forest education and to learning materials, including through web-based platforms, will expand the opportunities of forest-related learning to a far wider audience.

And instilling young children with an appreciation of forests, the many benefits they bring, and the need to manage them sustainably is also key to inspiring the next generation of foresters.

For this last reason, Germany is also supporting an FAO project to bring targeted forest education to schoolchildren aged 9-12, starting with a pilot lesson series tailored for Tanzania and the Philippines. The interactive lessons are designed to help children understand how forests help combat climate change and contribute to food security, lives, and livelihoods.

Forests are the most biologically diverse ecosystems on land, home to the majority of terrestrial species of animals and plants. If forest education remains insufficient, outdated, and deteriorating in many places, we will struggle to keep pace with changing societal demands on forests and increasing pressures on forest resources.

We need to improve forest education – and more widely, public understanding of forests and forestry – to help to prepare current and future generations to do a better job of protecting land and water resources, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

During the last three weeks, the following countries have indicated their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR):

Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, Nicaragua, and San Marino, for their first VNRs;

Cabo Verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Japan, Namibia, and Tunisia, for their second VNRs; and

Colombia, for its third VNR.

The following 30 countries had already expressed an interest as of 30 September 2020:

First-time presenters: Angola, Bolivia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, and Myanmar;

Second-time presenters: Bahamas, Bhutan, Chad, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Zimbabwe; and

Third-time presenters: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has indicated that no more than 42 countries will be able to present VNRs during HLPF 2021, due to time constraints.

An informal “group of friends” made up of UN Member States, established in 2019, will support the countries presenting VNRs in 2021. The group is coordinated by the delegation of Mexico to the UN.

The 2021 session of the HLPF will convene from 6-15 July under the auspices of ECOSOC. It will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ HLPF 2021 will review nine SDGs in depth:

Goal 1 (No poverty);

Goal 2 (Zero hunger);

Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing);

Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth);

Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities);

Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production);

Goal 13 (Climate action);

Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and

Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

One outcome of the HLPF is expected to be a ministerial declaration adopted at the end of the ministerial segment. At the 2020 HLPF, governments did not reach agreement on the ministerial declaration. UN Member States had attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration leading up to the HLPF, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were unable to finalize negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that if the meeting had taken place in person, governments could have voted on the draft, but “in the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was reached.

In September 2020, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, but the Council did not adopt it. ECOSOC President Munir Akram indicated that he would to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

Akram has explained that notwithstanding the lack of agreement on a Ministerial Declaration, in the HLPF discussions, Member States:

Expressed their firm commitment to a multilateral response to COVID-19;

Stressed that vulnerable countries must not be left behind in the recovery;

Called for adequate financing, debt relief and debt waivers to be provided, particularly for low- and middle-income countries; and

Acknowledged that once developed, a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone and everywhere, rich or poor, at affordable prices.

He said governments expressed that the means of implementation for the SDGs must be strengthened to meet both the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda, and the need for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited, in particular, financing, sustainable infrastructure and investment, international trade, science and technology, capacity building and partnerships.

The high-level event convened in the margins of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 30 September, in a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government and ministers joining virtually. The Summit focused on the theme, ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development.’

The opening segment included a “fireside chat” between the heads of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). They described biodiversity as a “shock absorber,” and said the time to “pollute our way to wealth” has passed.

Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said degradation of nature spans economics, social justice, and human rights, and can result in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Many expressed concern that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Speakers warned that biodiversity loss threatens food security, water supplies, and livelihoods, as well as our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events.

Munir Akram, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), said political will, not finance, is key to contain “economic greed” and “policy negligence.” UNGA President Volkan Bozkir called on Member States to use the Summit to build political momentum towards a post‑2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Kunming, China in 2021. “Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change,” said Bozkir, by placing the biodiversity discourse firmly on the political agenda.

A plenary session followed, during which participants highlighted the connections between biodiversity, societies, and economies.

The report aims to help countries align their development pathways with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change through long-term strategies that promote climate resilience of food and water systems, energy, transport, and cities, among other sectors.

The report titled, ‘World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization,’ highlights the “huge risks” climate change poses to countries’ long-term development and growth, with critical implications for poverty, food security, and health. In a foreword, Juergen Voegele, World Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development, cautions that all countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, are now facing “the compound impacts of the twin challenges” of climate change and COVID-19.

The report notes that the ambition reflected in the first round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) would only limit global warming to 2.7-3.7°C above preindustrial levels. It warns that a continued focus on short- and medium-term targets could make decarbonization more difficult, and calls for long-term strategies to help countries develop sustainably. “By planning ahead, these strategies can boost new economic activity and innovations, creating the jobs of the future, while also securing a safer climate, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable,” said Mari Pangestu, World Bank’s Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships, at the report’s launch.

The Outlook 2050 recognizes the need for a “bold economic transformation” to realize the vision of the Paris Agreement and make the SDGs “more achievable,” which includes aligning finance flows with low-emissions, climate-resilient development pathways. It proposes a “whole-of-economy” approach to decarbonization, which prioritizes four economy-wide strategic directions:

Embed long-term climate priorities in countries’ macroeconomic frameworks;

Embed long-term climate planning in national budgets and expenditure frameworks;

Embed long-term climate objectives in financial sector regulations and incentives; and

Embed long-term climate objectives in systems planning.

The report identifies cross-sectoral opportunities and makes recommendations across eight areas that are essential for achieving the SDGs: 1) transforming food systems; 2) protecting land-based ecosystems and carbon sinks; 3) transforming energy systems; 4) transforming mobility; 5) building low-carbon, more resilient urban areas; 6) transforming water systems; 7) transforming the ocean economy; and 8) digital transformation. The Outlook 2050 finds that investing in cross-sectoral opportunities, including as part of stimulus packages, can aid in a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report was launched on 24 June, during the ‘Kickstarting the Sustainable Recovery’ event series, organized by the World Bank’s Climate Change Group in partnership with Innovate4Climate. The series focused on the role of sustainable finance in the COVID-19 recovery to help countries “build back better and stronger.” [Publication: World Bank Outlook 2050 Strategic Directions Note: Supporting Countries to Meet Long-Term Goals of Decarbonization] [Publication Landing Page] [World Bank Press Release]","The World Bank has published a report that outlines economy-wide actions to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable development as the world recovers from the COVID-19 global pandemic.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

The coming decade is of utmost importance for global governance of biodiversity, the authors stress.

The brief titled, ‘Biological Diversity: Protecting the variety of life on Earth,’ authored by Elsa Tsioumani and Asterios Tsioumanis, highlights recent findings that “nature is vanishing before our eyes,” and up to one million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. The brief notes the need for “transition pathways,” and reviews the negotiations to establish and further the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its protocols as the main forum for the international community to conserve biodiversity, use its components sustainable, and share fairly and equitably the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.

The brief notes that the coming decade is of utmost importance for global biodiversity governance, and a failure to adopt and implement a post-2020 global biodiversity framework “may lead to irreversible biodiversity loss in the near future.”

The brief is the second in the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series from the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team, which builds on the message of the landmark 1972 UN report, ‘Only One Earth,’ reminding humanity we have no other home but this planet. The series is being released in the lead-up to the 50th anniversaries of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which will be marked in 2022.

The policy briefs assess the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy, drawing on the environmental negotiation insights of the global ENB team. The briefs aim to guide future efforts to address the causes of climate change, support the sustainable management of natural resources, and foster fair and sustainable economies.

The first brief in the series, titled ‘Stockholm and the Birth of Environmental Diplomacy,’ by Pamela Chasek, considers the lessons held in the 1972 Conference as it launched a new era of global cooperation on environmental issues and paved the way for the concept of sustainable development and the birth of UNEP.

A website for the campaign from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint provides resources for raising awareness and regulatory action.

Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

The manufacture and sale of lead paint is still permitted in over 60% of countries, and is a source of lead exposure, especially for children and workers. Young children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure because lead affects the developing brain, potentially resulting in reduced intellectual ability. Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

Eliminating lead paint will help achieve SDG targets 3.9 (substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030) and 12.4 (by 2020, achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, and significantly reducing their release to air, water and soil to minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment).

ILPPW 2020 will take place from 25-31 October 2020, engaging governments, civil society organizations, health partners, and industry, all of whom are organizing campaigns throughout the week of action. ILPPW aims to: raise awareness about health effects of lead exposure; highlight the efforts of countries and partners to prevent led exposure, particularly in children; and urge further action to eliminate lead paint through country-level regulatory action.

The ILPPW website provides a range of materials to support campaign activities have been developed by the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance). These include infographics, posters, web banners, graphics, and a social media kit. It also includes a list and description of registered events, as well as fact sheets, Questions and Answers, resources on the risk of lead and lead paint, and ways to eliminate lead in paint.

Thus far, registered events during ILPPW 2020 will take place in Australia, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam. Registered activities include rallies, drama and dance, school programmes, and media and advocacy events, including lobbying activities for national legislation on lead-free paint.

The various events aim to, inter alia:

strengthen or enforce existing lead paint laws;

increase consumer awareness about the health and environmental impacts of lead exposure, including on children;

increase public awareness and support for eliminating lead paint;

ensure draft lead paint laws are supported by stakeholders;

encourage implementation of new lead paint laws;

urge the paint industry to stop using lead-based ingredients in paints;

develop safe school standards without lead paint on buildings;

increase industry support to phase out the addition of lead to paint; and

convince policymakers and regulators to begin work on developing a law to eliminate lead paint.

Established in 2011, ILPPW is an initiative of the Lead Paint Alliance, which is jointly led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Alliance promotes the global phase-out of lead paint through establishing legally binding measures to stop the manufacture, import, export, distribution, sale and use of lead paints in every country.

The study provides 21 recommendations on amplifying the “substantially muted voices of women” in COVID-19 news coverage.

The study titled, ‘The Missing Perspectives of Women in COVID-19 News: A special report on women’s under-representation in news media,’ released in September 2020, focuses on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, UK, and US. It draws on a computational news content analysis of 11,913 publications and 1.9 million stories between 1 March and 15 April 2020, as well as a mix of other quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

The study finds that in the six countries analyzed, women are effectively political invisible in COVID-19-related decision-making processes. Moreover, in times of crisis, journalists may revert back to “established sources” who are significantly more likely to be men. The study finds that every individual woman’s voice in the news on COVID-19 is “drowned out by the voices of at least three, four, or five men.”

The findings reveal not just how many women are represented in COVID-19 news, but also how they are portrayed in the story. The author explains that the women who are given a platform in the COVID-19 story are “rarely portrayed as authoritative experts or as empowered individuals but more frequently as sources of personal opinion or as victims/people affected by the disease.” Women constituted 19% of experts while men constituted 77% in the 175 most highly ranked COVID-19 articles across the six countries.

In addition, few women feature as “protagonists” in COVID-19 news coverage, even less so than in news not related to COVID-19. The absence of women’s perspectives in COVID-19 news means that women have limited influence over the framing of the crisis. This results in limited influence over policymaking directions, and thus further marginalization within societies.

Recommendations to redress the bias include steps to focus on women as sources of expertise and protagonists, cover gender equality, consider the implications of the framing of stories, and seek to understand the implications of reporting on women’s lives.

The study is authored by Luba Kassova, international audience strategy consultancy AKAS Ltd. This report is the precursor to an expanded publication on the entire news value chain, commissioned in support of UN Women’s Generation Equality Forum. The expanded study will offer a gender parity checklist for news providers around the world.

The researchers divide the suggested interventions into three focus areas:

On the farm—including training for farmers, developing climate-resilient crops, and improving livestock feed (USD 9 billion);

Food on the move—ensuring food can get from the farm to market, through investments in storage, transport, and other infrastructure (USD 2 billion); and

Empower the excluded— measures to ensure the poorest are included, such as steps regarding social protection spending or training for rural youth (USD 3 billion).

This Ceres2030 project was led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The researchers used two interlinked research approaches to develop their findings. The first involved the development of a machine-learning tool to analyze over 500,000 published reports and articles. This tool helped the team of 78 researchers from 23 countries to summarize the evidence from over 20 years of agricultural development literature. The second part of the research involved economic modelling. The researchers created a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how much it would cost to end hunger, increase incomes and protect the climate by 2030.

The proposed additional USD 14 billion per year until 2030 would represent a doubling in the amount of aid currently given for food security and nutrition each year. The researchers note that it must be accompanied by an additional USD 19 billion a year from low- and middle-income countries’ own budgets.

The research findings support an integrated approach, recognizing that “agricultural interventions are more effective with a population that enjoys at least a minimum level of income, education, with access to networks and resources such as extension services and robust infrastructure.” The research also revealed that it is more effective to create integrated portfolios of interventions rather than to support improvements in isolation from one another.

Regarding women’s empowerment, the researchers indicate that the evidence base is sparse, due to the fact that only 10% of the papers reviewed considered gender differences in the outcomes of the interventions.

The researchers organize their 10 key recommendations for donor governments based on the three focus areas for interventions, as follows.

Empower the excluded:

Support participation in farmers’ organizations

Invest in vocational programs for rural youth that offer integrated-training in multiple skills

Scale up social protection programs to help create a bridge for people living in poverty to find productive jobs

On the Farm:

Invest in information and training, particularly for women, to increase the uptake of new technologies

Ensure new environmentally-friendly farming methods are also economically viable

Support the adoption of climate-resilient crops

Increase research on how to help small-scale producers in water-scarce regions

Target improvements in the quantity and quality of livestock feed to small and medium-sized commercial farms

Food on the Move:

To reduce post-harvest losses, look beyond the storage of cereals to also focus on other food groups and other parts of the food value chain

Invest in the infrastructure, regulations, services and technical assistance needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that supply or buy from small-scale farmers

Once in force, the emission reduction commitments of participating developed countries and economies in transition (EITs) become legally binding.

The Doha Amendment’s entry into force, a UNFCCC press release notes, is “critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.” Its entry into force also means that “accounting of the Kyoto Protocol’s second phase can go ahead as anticipated and that the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance committee can fully fulfill its legal functions.”

Since our last update in July 2019, 15 countries have ratified the Doha Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 145. The Amendment will formally enter into force within 90 days from 1 October 2020, when the 144th instrument of acceptance was received by the Depositary.

The Amendment’s entry into force is critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.

Angola submitted its instrument of acceptance on 22 September 2020; Bolivia on 17 September 2020; Egypt on 3 February 2020; El Salvador on 18 September 2019; Georgia on 16 June 2020; Ghana on 24 September 2020; Guatemala on 15 October 2019; Jamaica on 1 October 2020; Jordan on 3 January 2020; Nigeria on 2 October 2020; Niue on 10 December 2019; North Macedonia on 18 October 2019; Senegal on 27 May 2020; Sierra Leone on 15 June 2020; and Zambia on 22 August 2019.

The Amendment sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 18% compared to 1990 levels for participating countries. This, according to the UNFCCC, “represents an increase from an average reduction of 5% compared to 1990 levels” during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period from 2008-2012.

“The Doha Amendment’s entry into force is a strong signal of a unified, multilateral commitment to address climate change,” said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. She noted that it represents political commitment to pre-2020 action, which, she said, is necessary to build trust ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.

The entry into force of the Doha Amendment occurs at a time when global emissions are likely to result in an increase of global average temperatures of 3°C above preindustrial levels, the UNFCCC warns. Therefore, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries are expected to submit in 2020 remain critical for reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep global warming “well below” 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.

In a Communiqué, published after a virtual ministerial meeting on 22 September 2020, the ministers expand upon each of these commitments, and recommend that “these important topics” be considered by leaders at the G20 Leaders Summit in Riyadh in November. The Communiqué includes a summary of discussions under the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO, G20 policy guidelines on boosting MSMEs’ international competitiveness, two synthesis reports on G20 members’ best practices and lessons learned on trade in services and special economic zones (SEZs), and a G20 statement on technical assistance for investment attraction.

The G20 Trade and Investment Working Group Chair’s Summary of discussions held as part of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO notes that “by identifying common ground of WTO objectives and trade policy principles under the Riyadh Initiative, the G20 can play an important role in providing political support for reform discussions.” The summary notes that G20 discussions on the multilateral trading system and the future of the WTO revolve around a set of four strategic questions. The questions cover: how the multilateral system can advance shared objectives relating to growth, productivity, innovation, job creation, and development; foundational principles and underlying objectives; forward-looking policy visions; and sources of policy principles.

G20 Policy Guidelines on boosting international competitiveness of MSMEs, which account for 95% of all firms globally, aim to help national and international policy makers ensure that MSMEs are supported on resilience, access to information, technology, digital, finance, compliance with standards, technical regulations, and connections to supply chains, among other areas. Such efforts, the ministers note, serve to not only augment MSMEs’ capacity to compete internationally through upgraded capabilities and trade facilitation, but also empower them to contribute to realizing inclusive economic growth and other elements of the SDGs.

On fostering economic diversification, the ministers highlight that trade in services and special economic zones (SEZs) can help reduce vulnerability to economic shocks and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘Synthesis Report of Members’ Best Practices and Lessons Learned on Trade in Services’ notes that trade in services has expanded faster than trade in goods over the last decade and that services have played an increasing role in international trade and investment. Services, it underscores, serve as inputs to other economic activities, can have lower entry costs, and are considered by many as a means to achieving goals on women empowerment and youth employment.

The ‘Synthesis Report of Members’ Best Practices and Lessons Learned on Special Economic Zones (SEZs)’ emphasizes that SEZs are widely used in the majority of G20 members and can carry benefits around export growth, job creation, regional development, and elevated environmental standards. The report flags, however, that concerns remain in areas of tax fraud, intellectual property rights infringement, and money laundering, among other illegal activities. Factors that can enable success of SEZs include a strategic focus, access to intermodal transport or proximity to ports or large cities, an independent regulator or SEZ authority, and appropriate incentives and supporting services. The report summarizes good practices in SEZ development, including zone evaluation and monitoring and investment facilitation measures.

The ‘G20 Statement on Technical Assistance for Investment Attraction’ highlights the importance of foreign direct investment (FDI).

The Communiqué concludes by recognizing the relationship between industrial, investment, and trade policies. It also notes the process underway to select the WTO’s next Director-General, which is set to conclude by 7 November 2020.

The Global Education Forum convened virtually on 10 September 2020 in the lead-up to the 2020 Global Education Meeting (GEM), an extraordinary session that will convene from 20-22 October.

Forum participants discussed a white paper from the Save Our Future campaign, which provides a roadmap for education in COVID-19 recovery and across the Decade of Action for the SDGs. The paper builds on the UN Secretary-General’s August 2020 policy brief titled, ‘Education during COVID-19 and beyond.’ That Policy Brief:

States that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly 1.6 billion learners across all continents, and school closures have impacted 94% of the world’s student population and up to 99% of learners in low and lower-middle income countries;

Details the impacts to education and learning while stressing that the impacts go beyond education, affecting the provision of essential services to children and communities, access to nutritious food, the ability of many parents to work, and the potential risks of violence against women and girls; and

Makes concrete recommendations to prevent the “learning crisis from becoming a generational catastrophe,” including: suppressing transmission of the virus and planning for school re-openings; protecting education financing and coordinating for impact; building resilient education systems for equitable and sustainable development; and reimagining education and accelerating change in teaching and learning.

Addressing the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed urged making education a top priority in the pandemic response and recovery spending in international investments and national budgets. She emphasized the need to ensure that every dollar invested “leads to maximum possible impact, especially for our girls.”

A policy paper released by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2020 cites a USD148 billion annual financing gap in low- and lower-middle-income countries to achieve SDG 4 from now until 2030. COVID-19-related school closures could increase this financing gap by up to one-third, the paper reports.

From 20-22 October, an extraordinary session of the Global Education Meeting (2020 GEM) will convene on the topic, ‘Education post-COVID-19.’ The meeting is co-hosted by UNESCO and the UK. The session aims to be a platform for participants to “protect and rethink education in the current and post-COVID-19 world,” and set priorities for educational recovery and progress in the Decade of Action for the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘The Human Cost of Disasters: An Overview of the Last 20 Years: 2000-2019,’ was issued on 13 October – the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The report serves as a reminder to countries of their commitments under the Sendai Framework, to enact national and local DRR strategies by 2020, and highlights the urgency of taking action on climate change.

The report finds that 7,348 major disaster events occurred between 2000-2019, killing 1.23 million and affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), and resulting in USD 2.97 trillion in economic losses. This represents an increase over the previous twenty-year period, during which 4,212 natural disasters killed 1.19 million and affected 3.25 billion people and caused USD 1.63 trillion in economic losses. A significant portion of the increase was driven by a rise in climate-related disasters, like extreme weather events such as floods and storms, which nearly doubled from 3,656 to 6,681. Shifting rainfall patterns and greater precipitation variability also contribute to the increase by placing the 70% of global agriculture that is rain fed, and 1.3 billion people dependent on it, at significant risk.

Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century.

The report recommends that countries improve disaster risk governance by strengthening vision, plans, guidelines, funding, and cross-sectoral coordination. While the report credits improvements to early warning systems and disaster preparedness and response for “a reduction in loss of life in single-hazard scenarios,” it highlights the “increasingly systemic nature of disaster risk.” Events’ overlap and interplay with other risk drivers, including poverty, climate change, population growth in hazard-exposed areas, uncontrolled urbanization, and biodiversity loss, expose the need to further strengthen disaster risk governance, the report notes. The report warns that inability to understand and manage systemic risk jeopardizes the achievement of the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.

To mark the International Day, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for DRR Mami Mizutori also held a public online conversation. The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote coherence between DRR and climate change adaptation in national strategies for DRR and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Espinosa stressed the need to enhance “efforts to address climate change and help build resilience to it.”

Mizutori called for “an integrated approach which recognizes the increasingly systemic nature of risk and how climate interacts with other drivers of risk.” “Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century,” she said.

OSM data that can be accessed through the Pacific Environment Portal, comes as a bundle of individual Geographic Information System (GIS) layers, pre-styled in a Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) project, which people can use as a base map or combine with other spatial datasets.

Datasets like buildings, roads, rivers, and points of interest are available for all 14 Pacific Island countries involved in the Inform Project: the Cook Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM); Fiji; Kiribati; the Marshall Islands; Nauru; Niue; Palau; Papua New Guinea (PNG); Samoa; Solomon Islands; Tonga; Tuvalu; and Vanuatu. In addition, OSM data for seven Pacific territories will also be added: Guam; Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; American Samoa; French Polynesia; New Caledonia; Tokelau; and Wallis and Futuna.

The goal is to increase awareness among Pacific GIS users of the richness of OSM data in Pacific countries, as well as potential gaps, so that they can take advantage of the tool and contribute to it by joining the OSM global community.

A representative from Kiribati highlighted the usefulness of the data. He noted that “the available OpenStreetMap data was well received by the newly established GIS Unit from the Environment and Conservation Division (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development) in Kiribati,” which “explored the use of the OSM map of Tarawa as a base map for our ongoing waste management map project, particularly for the densely populated urban areas.” “Over the course of time,” he said, “the staff plan to make some adjustments, map additions, and corrections to the OSM project, at least for Tarawa,” and highlighted the potential of the OSM project to carry “other benefits for our project reports and presentations in the future.” [IISD Knowledge Hub Sources] [Pacific Environment Portal]

The brief titled, ‘Role of economic instruments for the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ calls for greater understanding of cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments as potential tools to mobilize resources and help countries achieve sound chemicals and waste management.

Costing instruments can create incentives to not pollute, and create a level playing field for producers.

The authors explain that some external costs arising from the unsound management of chemicals and waste are not accounted for in the price of goods and products. With the global chemicals industry (including pharmaceuticals) worth approximately USD 5.7 trillion and expected to double by 2030, many have called for more action to internalize these costs throughout the chemicals value chain.

Cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments aim to provide signals and incentives to stimulate behavioral change across the value chain. They can bring about benefits including:

internalizing and reflecting the true cost of the production, consumption, and final disposal of goods;

creating an incentive to not pollute or create waste;

providing revenues so countries can, for example: fund national chemical authorities and develop infrastructure for waste collection, sorting, and recycling;

responding to increased consumer demand for sustainability and accountability;

creating a level playing field so producers follow the same rules and standards; and

contributing to national commitments towards the SDGs.

SDG 3 calls for reducing illness and deaths linked to chemical exposure (SDG target 3.9), SDG 12 is ‘ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,’ and three other Goals (SDGs 6, 14, and 15) address the need to reduce pollution as a key driver of biodiversity loss.

The brief reports that governments are using cost recovery measures and economic instruments to generate additional resources, which on chemicals management include taxes, fees, tradeable permits, and subsidies. On waste, targeted tools include: extended producer responsibility (EPR); deposit refund schemes to discourage improper disposal; and pay-as-you-throw, which supports waste collection activities.

Prerequisites for governments to use cost recovery mechanisms and economic policy instruments, the authors say, may include:

political will and national vision;

ambitious targets;

public-private collaboration;

financial resources, including seed funding to institutionalize a policy framework for chemical safety;

a flexible legal foundation based on sound data and design;

designated institutional body;

third-party verification of products;

revenues from cost recovery fees that go toward ensuring chemicals safety and waste management; and

monitoring framework to track progress.

The Beyond 2020 framework is currently under deliberation, and outcomes are expected at the fifth session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in 2021. To secure financing beyond 2020, the brief describes next steps such as to conduct research drawing on lessons from the “biodiversity incentives” of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Bank’s carbon pricing programme. On providing capacity support, the brief suggests collecting best practices at the national level to create a “living document” for inclusion in the SAICM knowledge management platform to guide national action. On developing policy and tracking progress, the brief mentions developing: a global cost internalization programme; relevant indicators for Beyond 2020 to monitor use of mechanisms and instruments; and a common harmonized framework to improve tracking, reporting and assessment of finance flows.

The brief draws from and complements an earlier SAICM document, ‘Review of cost recovery mechanisms and other economic instruments for financing of the sound management of chemicals and waste,’ which was prepared in advance of ICCM4.

275,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wef-report-describes-digital-trade-trends-challenges-in-asia/,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WEF Report Describes Digital Trade Trends, Challenges in Asia","The Global Future Council on International Trade and Investment has identified seven digital trade trends in Asia, and highlighted challenge areas for digital trade policy, in a community paper published by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

The paper titled, ‘Advancing Digital Trade in Asia,’ considers how officials across Asia have responded to the explosive growth of digital trade in the region. Noting that digital trade is not new – the World Trade Organization (WTO) created a work programme on the matter in 1998 – the paper emphasizes the importance of the digital economy, which has been reinforced by COVID-19 and associated lockdowns.

However, the authors emphasize that multiple and changing definitions of ‘digital trade’ do not always align with existing trade agreements, which can fail to capture four key dimensions of the term: 1) digital goods and services (e.g. software); 2) tangible goods and services delivered digitally (e.g. apparel); 3) digital enablers of trade in tangible goods (e.g. logistics tracking); and 4) emerging transformative digital technologies (e.g. blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI)). Accordingly, the paper examines new trends, and considers how digital trade deals and other regulatory responses, like the application of digital taxation policies, may affect the growth of digital trade in Asia.

The paper identifies seven overarching trends in digital trade:

the rise of digital ecosystems and increasing connectivity in the region; linkages by regional platforms, or “unicorns” that may be less familiar outside the region; Asian firms’ leading position in providing digital/physical interfaces, powered by 5G; the increasing role of Asia as a hub for cloud services, including data collection and analytics; consumers’ increasing preference for subscription services, including livestreaming; growing numbers of applications that solve digital financial services and payments gaps; and the growing potential for misuse or harm that could flow from digitally connected devices and users.

Noting that these trends are often picked up by or accounted for in trade agreements – including the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), and the Digital Economy Agreement (DEA) – the paper flags that agreements from the region have been at the forefront of rule making on digital trade issues. These agreements generally aim to reduce trade barriers to the digital economy, the paper summarizes, and build compatible standards to facilitate interoperability and cross-border consumer trust. The paper compares the DEA, DEPA, and CPTPP across 23 digital trade provisions, highlighting whether the provisions are identical across the agreements, whether a provision in one agreement is more or less comprehensive than the others, and if a similar provision is lacking in the agreement.

The report identifies five challenge areas for digital trade policies that have emerged as key points for debate, where governments are struggling to reach consensus despite having made progress via the above agreements. Challenges remain on data transfer mechanisms, consumer protection, digital trade facilitation, emerging technologies, and digital taxation policies.

The WEF’s Global Future Council on International Trade and Investment is a multi-stakeholder and interdisciplinary knowledge network dedicated to promoting innovative thinking to shape a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future. The Council aims to help stakeholders make sense of the new global economic landscape and signal developments on the horizon.

CMU says its “Voluntary University Review” is the first in the world, adding that it “sends a strong signal that universities are a critical partner” in achieving the SDGs.

To conduct the review, the university pulled together a team including students, professors and staff who reviewed published information about Carnegie Mellon’s activities, writes Inside Higher Ed. The review included 17 Zoom meetings, each organized around one of the SDGs. Initial findings will be supplemented by additional information provided by CMU community members over the 2020/2021 academic year.

The intention is for CMU’s Voluntary University Review to be “a framework for us to track what we are doing across the 17 Global Goals and where we might find opportunities to do more. We also hope that by issuing this VUR, we will spark action at other institutions of higher education to do the same.”

Carnegie Mellon calls the review a stepping stone. With the initial review complete, the university plans to work on enhancing its progress toward the SDGs by working within the CMU community as well as within the higher education community at large.

In September, 2019, CMU launched its Sustainability Initiative, which it says builds on its committed to enhancing its sustainability practices within the framework of theSDGs.

PEOPLE use wide a range of goods for their livelihood, comfort and amenities. The use or consumption pattern of goods varies because of changes in the way of life, predominantly contributed by economic development, technological diversity and population growth. The goods that people use for sustenance are discarded as they reach the end of their use. Waste management comes at play in protect the environment to manage the discarded goods.

The goods that people use can be divided into two principal categories: solid and liquid. Different streams of wastes originate from these two categories. Streams of wastes like perishable household wastes, construction and demolition wastes, electronic and electrical wastes, rubber, metal, glass, plastic, hazardous medical wastes, etc originate from the solid waste category. Industrial effluent, grey water, black water, paints, chemicals, etc fall in the category of liquid waste. Wastes in each of these categories and streams have the potential to damage every fabric of the environment. To prevent any harmful effects, each waste stream is handled in different ways.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are an urgent call for action by all countries, developed and developing, in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The common purpose and objective of both waste management and Agenda 2030 are to protect the environment for human benefits. The goals that the Agenda 2030 adopted for a sustainable development involve a range of functions and activities. Those functions and activities are also found in waste management. The 3R — reduce, reuse and recycle — approach in waste management is recognised globally. It encompasses a series of activities with contribution to the environment and society. For example, reuse activities create jobs, save energy, cut disposal costs, reduce the use of virgin raw materials, reduce CO2 emission, extend life of landfill and reduce pressure on land.

Waste management value addition

Goal 1 has the target to ‘end poverty in all its form everywhere’ through the development of social protection systems with targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. Waste management prevents the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbon, CO2, etc which improves environmental degradation narrowing down the risk of human vulnerability to natural disaster. Waste management also prevents the pollution of water, another area of human vulnerability.

Goal 2 eyes ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Food security is a global concern against the backdrop of the population growth and shrinking agricultural land which include cropland, forest, mangrove forest, river, lake, tea estate and salt span etc. Countries are losing agricultural land every year because of population settlement, infrastructure development, industrialisation, etc.

Food loss and waste annually contribute to 3.3 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. If a fourth of the food loss or wastes across the globe could be avoided, it could feed 750 million people. Food loss and waste affect the food supply chain, lowering income for food producers and wholesalers, increase consumer cost for food and constrain the access of low income groups to food. Minimising food loss, which waste management compliments, can improve food security and environmental gains.

Goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all in all stages. In Bangladesh, there is a large informal recycling sector in different streams of wastes. The glass recycling sector recycles about 180,000 tonnes of discarded container glasses every year. According to industry sources, the economic value of this quantity of discarded glasses at waste pickers’ level is estimated at Tk 180 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 1 a kilogram. The value of glass recyclables at the wholesaler level is estimated at Tk 450 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 2.50 a kilogram. It is estimated that annually about 96,000 tonnes of plastic waste is recycled across the country. This plastic waste has Tk 288 million in economic value at the waste picker level. Recycling has created employment for thousands of people which gives them an earning.

Goal 6 ensures an available and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Leachate percolating from decomposing waste goes into surface and ground water systems, if not protected. Given the composition and character, municipal solid waste can contain 20–50 per cent of water which it releases as it decomposes. Leachates, if not treated, contaminate ground and surface water. Besides leachate, millions of litres of black water and industry effluents from households and factories are also released into the environment. These are elements of a potential contamination of surface and ground water and it happens quietly. For example, one gallon of paint can contaminate 10 million gallons of drinking water. Waste management requires the treatment of all liquid wastes before being discharged into the environment. This requirement has a direct contribution to ‘sustainable management of water and sanitation’. There are instances that large water body such as rivers, lakes, etc get ruined when ‘waste management’ does not work.

Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Waste treatment technology producing biogas and power from waste provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces waste volume, mitigating pressure on land for waste disposal which can contribute to food security. Second, the residual of biogas can be converted into compost to use as soil stabiliser. Biogas from organic wastes or furnace oil from tyre recycling can be used as additional fuel in waste-to-energy plant where waste has low calorific value. Residuals in waste-to-energy plant, ie bottom ash, can be converted into slag and slag can be used in cement industry to produce bricks, slabs, etc, which can be used in construction works such as the preparation of road base, footpath, etc. The reuse of glass items from cullet consumes 40 per cent less energy than making new glasses from virgin raw materials on the grounds because cullet dissolves at a much lower temperature. Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 per cent. Around 900 litres of oil, a person’s two months’ water use and two people’s energy consumption for a year, can be saved by recycling just one tonne of plastic wastes.

Goal 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation. Waste management through the promotion of the reduction approach encourages industries to produce less waste in the production process where innovation is the key. Industry to sustain in the long term needs to have in-house waste management like effluent treatment plants to treat liquid wastes. Through the reuse approach, waste management promotes an extended use of product and also alternative use through recycling.

Goal 11 makes cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Human settlements in cities and towns cannot be safe with heaps of garbage on their front yard or backyard. Waste management through community activities can involve people to do their part of waste management for a safer living environment.

As countries develop, more urbanisation takes place and construction and demolition waste, a harmful component of waste stream, is on the rise. Generally, the largest part of construction and demolition material is concrete, which encompasses around 70 per cent of waste generated before recycling. There is a range of environmental and economic benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it in a landfill.

The benefits include cheaper source of aggregate, reduction in landfill space required for concrete debris, using recycled material as gravel that reduces the need for gravel mining and, increasingly, high-grade aggregate for road construction is available only at greater distances, increasing the associated economic and environmental cost impacts associated with the longer haulage distances versus using recycled aggregate.

Goal 12 targets a sustainable consumption and production pattern. Sustainable consumption and production is about the use of products and manufacturing process of products that will produce minimal waste, which invokes the 3R approach of waste management. The 3R approach minimises resource consumption in the level sufficient for basic need, which is the reduce component, use goods and materials until they can be repaired or fixed to perform its function recurrently, which is the reuse component, and reprocess the materials being discarded into new products, which is the recycle component. This approach increases resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable consumption and production. For example, it takes 1.5 tonnes of water, 22 kilograms of chemicals and 243 litres of fossil fuel to produce one computer. An extended use of a product can reduce the consumption of water, chemical and fossil fuel and also reduce waste generation. Its overall impact comes on environmental improvement.

Goal 13 encourages urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. As decay starts, waste emits methane, a greenhouse gas, impacting climate change. The emission of methane is visible in landfill during the dry season. Methane is also a cause of fire in the landfill. As waste burns, CO2 is generated. CO2 is another greenhouse gas. The contribution of the 3R approach to mitigating climate change is found in waste, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land use change and forestry sectors. In the waste sector, methane emission is reduced by gas recovery in the landfill. Energy recovered from waste reduces emissions from fossil fuel. Reduction in food loss and waste is an action in the agricultural sector to combat climate change. Food loss and waste represent the wastage of resources, including the land, water, labour, and energy resource used to produce food. It strongly contributes to climate change because greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution activities, and methane is released during the decay of food waste.

Goal 14 conserves and sustainably uses the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 6, 12 and 14 are interlinked. An uneconomical consumption of materials in production and irresponsible discharge of waste combined with absence of waste management has not ensured the availability and sustainable management of water bodies like the River Buriganga, the River Turag and the River Balu. An irresponsible discharge of plastics in the world oceans threaten marine lives.

Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manages forests, combats desertification and halts and reverses land degradation and halts biodiversity loss. Activities embedded and innovations in the 3R approach have all potentials to address the issues stated in Goal 15 on Agenda 2030.

The SDGs are for public good to improve different facets of environmental sustainability. Goals are attached to human well-being and environmental improvement through a series of activities. A wide range of activities in waste management are naturally aligned with the SDGs. An improved waste management directly complements the achievement of the SDG. While 11 of the 17 goals get direct contribution, 6 receives indirect support from waste management.

DPS, Gurugram, conducts webinar on parenting skills

Delhi Public School, Sector 45, Gurugram organised the Wellness Webinar Series 9.0 ‘Let’s Talk – Parenting’ to discuss effective parenting skills which help us as a society to nurture strong, responsible and happy children. The discussion was moderated by school director-principal Aditi Misra. The eminent panelists comprised psychologist and relationship therapist Vichitra Dargan Anand, counsellor Sonia Pillai as well as author and educator Rohit Kumar. The panel also included DPS Gurugram vice principal Santvna Thadani; dean, student welfare, Sapna Dhawan, and parents’ body representatives Sachin Chugh and Nipun Marya. The webinar was attended by 6,485 people and garnered 1,400 views on Facebook.

Aditi Misra initiated the discussion by greeting all the panelists and asking them to share one parenting lesson which they learnt from their parents and imparted to their children and another lesson which they didn’t carry forward. The discussions brought forth important lessons in parenting, like giving respect to all, involving children in important family decisions, perseverance, generosity and active listening skills etc,

While discussing the different styles of parenting, Anand said that it is her firm belief that building a child is like building a skyscraper with a strong foundation. Marya observed that parents should not compare their children with others as each child is unique. Pillai said parents must build a circle of trust with their children. The speakers emphasised various techniques of positive parenting in today’s time. Kumar said parents should be good role models for children. Chugh felt that as parents one must never forget to hug and cuddle one’s children. A very effective positive discipline tool that was explained by Kumar was – ‘no correction without connection’.

Thadani advised parents to be good listeners and love their children and Dhawan stressed on the importance of inculcating strong values. The discussion was concluded by a rapid-fire round wherein the panelists answered questions posed by the moderator. Misra thanked the panelists for sharing their insights.","Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar, celebrated the SDG-Fest 2020 on a virtual platform to mark the fifth anniversary of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with unprecedented fervour and zeal.

Montoya, executive director of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), was appointed recently by UN Secretary General António Guterres as one of the 15 eminent scientists to draft the 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), said a UN official announcement in New York City.

“We are honored to be selected as part of the distinguished experts to author a very significant report on the global SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],” Montoya said in a DOST-PCHRD news release.

“Being a health research scientist in the Philippines, a developing country, enables us to contribute unique and substantial information that is relevant to sustainable development. It is without a doubt that I assure our UN member states and our fellow Filipinos that our efforts will always be directed towards the benefit of all through science and technology,” he added.

Philippine Science Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña, in a news release, said he is “very happy about the announcement” of the appointment of Montoya to be among the authors of GSDR.

“The whole DOST family is very proud of this recognition given to Dr. Montoya,” de la Peña said in the news release posted on DOST’s Facebook account.

Produced once every four years, the SDG report aims to employ the scientific perspective in guiding policy-makers on the state of global sustainable development, and serve as a “strong evidence-based instrument” in eradicating poverty.

The report will also feed the “high-level global review” of the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations in September 2030.

The designation of the independent group followed an extensive consultation process that involved nominations from UN member states which concluded in December 2019.

The 15 scientists were selected by Guterres to author the GSDR and conduct a follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for SDGs.

The “diverse group,” according to the UN, represents a wide range of disciplines and are composed of the following scientists: John Agard (Trinidad and Tobago), Kaltham Ali Al-Ghanim (Qatar), Sergey N. Bobylev (Russian Federation), Opha Pauline Dube, (Botswana), Ibrahima Hathie (Senegal), Norichika Kanie (Japan), Nyovani Janet Madise (Malawi), Shirin Malekpour (Australia), J. Jaime Miranda (Peru), Jaime C Montoya (Philippines), Jiahua Pan (China), Åsa Persson (Sweden), Ambuj D Sagar (India), Imme Scholz (Germany), Nancy Shackell (Canada).

Led by Agard and Scholz, the independent group will author the second report of its kind. The first GSDR has been released in September of 2019 titled, “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development.”

PCHRD is at the forefront of the country’s fight against the current Covid-19 pandemic.

As the country’s lead coordinator for health research and development initiatives, PCHRD supports Filipino researchers in health research innovation, policy recommendations, and technology commercialization.

It provides scholarships to Filipino students in the field of health and medicine, and establishes information and communication systems to disseminate health research information both for local and international stakeholders.","“We are honored to be selected as part of the distinguished experts to author a very significant report on the global SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals],” Montoya said in a DOST-PCHRD news release.
“Being a health research scientist in the Philippines, a developing country, enables us to contribute unique and substantial information that is relevant to sustainable development.
Produced once every four years, the SDG report aims to employ the scientific perspective in guiding policy-makers on the state of global sustainable development, and serve as a “strong evidence-based instrument” in eradicating poverty.

Self-checkout units could be set up at libraries in SDG if Safe Restart Funding were to eventually include capital expenditures.

That was one of the messages delivered at the SDG council committee of the whole virtual meeting on Monday by director of financial services Rebecca Russell during a key information report.

Russell said self-checkout at library branches could be “quite beneficial at this time,” but those units are costly – approximately $10,000.

This summer Ontario announced it would be providing municipalities with $1.6 billion in a first round of emergency funding due to the pandemic, the SRF Agreement resulting in approximately $1.7 million for SDG to assist with the financial burden, but it’s money eligible only for revenue losses and operating expenses.

283,https://thepolicytimes.com/indias-progress-towards-sdg-7-affordable-and-clean-energy-and-covid-19-impacts/,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",thepolicytimes.com,"India’s progress towards SDG-7, affordable and clean energy and COVID-19 impacts","The United Nations, in 2015, set up the sustainable development goals as a universal call and blueprint for achieving comprehensive development with social, economic and environmental balance. Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

Article content The fact Cornwall, SDG, and Akwesasne have had fewer COVID-19 numbers than neighbouring Prescott-Russell is due in part to luck, but also to hard work and diligence from local residents, said Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement. “A lot of people have said, in Cornwall particularly, that we have been lucky with our number of cases, but I always respond to that by saying that I don’t know if it’s luck,” she said. “I think that people here have worked hard too, to follow the rules and to adapt. We’ve made some sacrifices too. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser.

I just want to make sure that people know that it’s not just luck. That we’re fortunate that those numbers are low, but we work hard to keep them low.” As of Tuesday, the Eastern Ontario Health Unit (EOHU) recorded a total of 35 cases of COVID in Cornwall — seven of them active. The SDG townships on the other hand, had recorded a total of about 67, 18 of them being active.

Article content The number is in stark contract to municipalities north of SDG that lie within the Eastern Ontario Health Unit’s jurisdiction. Russell alone has recorded a total of 47, with 19 of them active. Clarence-Rockland on the other hand, has had 61 cases and currently is home to 18 active cases. Alfred-Plantagenet, which boasts a significantly smaller number of residents as opposed to Cornwall, has had 51 cases. For of them are active. So what has led the Prescott-Russell region to have far more positive cases than SDG and Cornwall? Well for one, the county itself shares more borders the Ottawa area, which has itself seen a giant leap in cases. According to the EOHU, many residents of the Clarence-Rockland and Russell area work in Ottawa. “This is why I think we have more cases in the western part of Prescott-Russell as compared to SDG and Cornwall,” Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health for the EOHU, told the Standard-Freeholder. “However, we are seeing case numbers in SDG/Cornwall increase as well, so our recent case count surges are not exclusive to Prescott-Russell.” Roumeliotis has always been cautious with discussing caseloads in different areas of the EOHU region, stressing the virus can travel anywhere and that continued practise of public-health measures and vigilance remain important. All three of the regions under the EOHU’s umbrella, declared a state of emergency at the same time earlier this year.

Article content “I declared that alongside my colleagues, Pierre Leroux (Prescott-Russell warden) and Frank Prevost (SDG warden),” said Clement. “We all worked with Dr. Paul (Roumeliotis) closely.” The rising number of cases in both Ottawa and Prescott-Russell has and continues to be a worry, according to Clement, who spoke of the challenge the pandemic has created for municipalities and elected officials. “When you run for office, whether for city council or any office really, you run because you want to move things forward,” she said. “You want to make sure that there’s growth and that the potential of your community is fulfilled. That’s why I ran. You never run thinking that you’re going to have to manage a crisis. That’s never in your mind.” Being mayor as well as executive director of the SDG legal aid clinic, Clement said she has witnessed the many emotions currently running high in the community during the pandemic — sadness, anger and frustration. “I know very well that the more vulnerable individuals in our community are even more vulnerable due to this pandemic,” she said. “The disparity between people who have little and people who have more is I think accentuated by the pandemic, and I feel that.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Prevost, the South Glengarry mayor and incumbent warden, and North Dundas Coun. Tony Fraser, were vying for the position, and the two were deadlocked after two rounds of voting at the end of the regular meeting on Monday morning. So, Helen Thomson, director of council services/clerk, was called upon to make the pick.

Prevost thanked everyone at the table for their continued support, and said “I certainly won’t let you down, and I’m very hopeful to be able to get out into more communities in 2021 (than has been possible much of this year).”

Prevost and Fraser put their names forward late in September.

Prevost in announcing his candidacy said he felt quite short-changed this year of the pandemic – much of what the warden does in the community couldn’t happen because of COVID-19 limitations. Just before Monday’s vote, he reiterated that point, saying he’s felt somewhat cheated during the current term. Prevost was warden two decades ago, but he didn’t think that was a reason to not seek a second consecutive modern-day term.","Article contentFrank Prevost has been voted as the next warden of SDG council.

Article content “We’ve implemented important safety measures in direct consultation with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit under Stage 3,” said Rick Ladouceur, director of recreation and facilities, in a township news release. “We’re all in this together and want to ensure everyone has a safe return to the ice this season. The upgrades and guidelines we’ve implemented will help accomplish this.” Facility users are being greeted with a sign-in process upon entry to maintain contact tracing security. There’s freshly painted spectator seating areas, distanced and marked appropriately to maintain a two-metre distance, and high-standard electro-sanitation packs are being used between each reservation. Recreation co-ordinator Cathy McDonell in the news release said township staff have “worked diligently these past few months in preparation of welcoming back the community. . . we’re excited to finally have our doors re-open, and are currently accepting reservations for icetime bookings in (the remainder of October).” In early September, North Glengarry announced its two arenas – the Glengarry Sports Palace in Alexandria, and the Maxville & District Sports Complex – would have staggered openings, with an anticipated early October opening in Alexandria, followed later in the fall by the sports complex. The Alexandria Minor Hockey Association has also taken to the ice – the Glens’ first group will be the U-17 level, who had time scheduled late on Wednesday afternoon.

Article content Procedures that need to be followed will include all players arriving at the arena fully dressed, except for skates, gloves and helmets. And, due to the limit of 50 people in the stands, only one parent per child will be admitted to the facility. In South Dundas, the Morrisburg Arena re-opened late last week. The municipality prepared a video that highlighted the regulations that are in place during the pandemic, and the complete operations plan is also available. Ice time can be booked by calling the arena, and there are also numerous free public skating sessions, including moms, tots and seniors on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 10:30-11:30 a.m. each of the two days. The municipality also had announced registration is open for fall recreation programming, which includes yoga, kickboxing, and high-intensity interval training, at the Iroquois Civic Centre and Matilda Hall. In North Dundas, the ice season that got underway in late September got busier this week in Winchester and Chesterville, with the Family Stick and Puck Program. There are sessions in Winchester on Monday and Saturday afternoons, and in Chesterville on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons.

“We don’t want spraying at the guardrails, it’s our right to not have leakage,” Faubert said during the presentation. “Obviously this will happen again if you spray (the guardrail area). . . you have a bylaw giving us a right to put up (the signs). We need to know the no spray bylaw is abided by.”

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Diane Faubert at the virtual meeting detailed a “significant incident” back in mid-July when a stretch of pesticide spraying over two metres wide was done along County Road 43 guardrails, located between organic farms in the Alexandria area and where “no spray” signs are posted. She said the guardrails are above a steep embankment, and that the chemicals leaked onto the farmland below.

SDG council’s committee of the whole got into the weeds Wednesday, when a delegation presented regarding “no spray” signs and landowner concerns.

Article content

Faubert says she’s all in favour of roadside mowing, but why is the “excellent solution” of whipper snipping at the guard rails being abandoned in favour of pesticides?

Faubert said the signs have been going up for 11 years, and she thanked SDG for never spraying in that area, until 2020. She said her farms include conservation wetlands, organic fields and swamps, and beehives and honey bees, insects that are at-risk if there’s spraying.

Faubert spoke about 270 acres of organic land, all managed without spraying any “dangerous chemicals.” She said 8,000 trees were planted last year on her land, that lawnmowers are “used around every single tree” and that there’s “not one iota” of herbicide used, yet those trees are doing very well.

When councillors commented on Faubert’s presentation, Coun. Carma Williams struck a conciliatory tone, saying “I happen to be sensitive to the contents of your delegation today. . . we have to modernize our thinking, how we deal with (signs).

“In the future we have to be more respectful with regards to spraying.”

Coun. Steven Byvelds said as an agriculturalist, he found Faubert’s “blanket statement” that all spraying is bad to be an overstatement, and the science on the issue has to be followed.

“There’s a balance (to strike), but we can certainly work together on making that balance happen,” he said. “I look forward to (the debate at county council).”

Faubert said she agreed with the spirit of compromising, but “we also have no spray signs – those have to be respected. . . it’s not easy to put up those signs, it’s a lot of work. I’d appreciate them being respected.”

Byvelds in a follow-up comment said SDG crews did make “an error by spraying in your area.”

The expected fall “second wave” has been occurring, and hospitals in Cornwall, Alexandria and Winchester all have the same capacity as in the spring – or greater.

Cornwall/SDG hospitals say they remain prepared for COVID-19 cases Back to video “We’ve taken a multi-layered approach to ensure our hospital can provide exceptional care for local patients – no matter the circumstance,” said Jeanette Despatie, CEO and president of Cornwall Community Hospital. Despatie referenced the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its passengers quarantined at Nav Centre last February, in noting CCH has been well-prepared for potential COVID-19 patients for many months, and that the hospital’s approach has always “been robust, and continues to evolve to meet the needs of patients during this challenging time.”

Article content Unlike in the early spring, area hospitals – and all of the facilities across Ontario – are dealing with COVID-19 while offering a lot of the regular services that had been suspended during the first wave. But the months of experience and opportunity to work at establishing safe processes for maintaining services – including diagnostic tests/procedures or outpatient surgical clinics – has been invaluable. Over the months since the pandemic began, Despatie said, CCH has provided staff and physicians with additional education and simulation training, as well as training in infection prevention and control measures. She said that, over the longer time period, the hospital has had the opportunity to purchase additional equipment required to expand patient capacity, should the situation worsen. “We’ve reconfigured our flexible spaces to identify up to a 30 per cent increase in bed capacity, should we need it,” Despatie said. “Fortunately, we’ve also been able to expand our supply of (PPE).” More On This Topic Cornwall, SDG hospitals to receive money for infrastructure upgrades Cornwall and area hospitals preparing to slowly resume regular service Plenty of COVID-19 capacity within SDG hospitals, for now At Winchester District Memorial Hospital, capacity hasn’t changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 late in the winter, and precautions and restrictions remain in place. Cholly Boland, the hospital CEO, said that, like all hospitals in the province, WDMH eventually restored outpatient and non-urgent surgical services, but that it did not alter the facility’s inpatient capacity.

Article content “Most of our surgical patients are admitted and discharged on the same day, and do not occupy an inpatient bed,” Boland said. Boland added the hospital has more people coming to its emergency department than was the case in the spring, and that “we’ve configured our waiting room and screening process to accommodate that increase.” And while Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria also is well-prepared and capable of treating patients with the COVID-19 virus, CEO and president Michael Cohen said there’s a very big difference between the spring and now for many hospitals in the region, in that the demand for inpatient beds “has never been greater. . . in the spring, the hospital system suspended elective activity in order to free up capacity and staff to respond to the pandemic. Provincially, elective activity resumed, and, at the same time, the wait for long-term care has never been higher. “I’ve been in the business for over 25 years, and I’ve never seen (Alternate Level of Care) numbers so high.” Cohen said that, regionally, over 700 patients are waiting for placement in hospitals. “Unfortunately, the (LTC) sector is suffering from outbreaks, staffing shortages and isolation requirements that limit and impede the flow of patients from hospitals,” Cohen said. “We’re just not able to access these beds as quickly as we once did. “Collectively we’re working with the province to develop temporary alternatives to get readily available beds into the system soon, which should bring welcome relief.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

292,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-shows-sdg-data-trends-with-interactive-atlas/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Illustrates SDG Data Trends with Interactive Atlas,"The World Bank has released the 2020 edition of its SDG Atlas. This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

293,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-risk-of-losing-the-2030-agenda-in-brazil/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Risk of Losing the 2030 Agenda in Brazil,"By Alessandra Nilo and Claudio Fernandes

COVID-19 found a perfect storm in Brazil, which has the sixth-largest population in the world and the seventh-highest level of inequality.

The health and economic crises triggered by the pandemic have exposed our multiple inequalities. While Brazil’s population is now paying the high price of pandemic unpreparedness and government irresponsibility, the planet is bound to pay an even longer-lasting price for environmental recklessness and devastation.

This warning comes from 105 specialists from the Civil Society Working Group for the 2030 Agenda in the latest Spotlight Report on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Brazil, which monitors the implementation of the SDGs. This fourth edition is based on the analysis of 145 of the 169 global SDG targets. The report shows that there is no progress in 88% of the environmental targets – only two out of 91 show progress. In addition, more than a third show regression, another third is either threatened or stagnant, and 17.6% of them have no data available.

Environmental Issues: Worsening Statistics, Shrinking Resources

Deforestation hit a record level this year, increasing by 35% in the Amazon (between June 2019 and June 2020) and 30% in the tropical Atlantic Forest, which had already lost 75% of its area throughout history. While 43 million people were hit by droughts, the 2019 budget on disaster prevention was the lowest in 11 years, and less than a third of it was disbursed.

The report shows also an increase in pollution, land grabbing conflicts, and violence against indigenous people and human rights defenders. In this context, it must take a great deal of disregard for governing for the current administration to cut bodies of democratic governance, keep civil society out of discussions, and lose international partners in the Amazonian Protection Fund, which resulted in stopping disbursement for projects led by CSOs[1].

Moreover, due to the administration’s lack of transparency, we do not have recent data on subsidies for fossil fuels, internal consumption of solid materials, or the amount of hazardous waste generated or disposed.

Economic and Social Issues: Less Public Money, More Inequality

The pandemic is highlighting the consequences of fiscal austerity policies. As those policies were implemented, legislation that increases inequality was simultaneously reinforced. A 2016 constitutional amendment established a cap on public investment in health, education, science and technology, and social assistance, effectively transferring wealth from the bottom to financial investors for the resources cut from the programmes used to pay off debt interests. It is not surprising that, of the 85 SDG targets linked to the social dimension analyzed in the report, 68% show no advancement whatsoever in the last two years (2018-2019).

In 2019, when 77 million people (37% of the population) lacked access to basic sanitation and unemployment, and job informality rose sharply, only 1.26% of Brazil’s federal budget targeted poverty reduction programmes, the same ratio since 2016. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) will have to update its hunger map because, according to our National Statistical and Geographic Institute (IBGE), hunger in Brazil reached more than 5% of the population for the first time since 2013.

Other social indicators are also worrying, including:

Brazil is the fourth, in absolute numbers, in child marriage and sexual abuse cases against children and adolescents. In 2019, these were the highest since 2011[2].

Violence against women and LGBTI+ population increased, while the budget for the VAW Program decreased 75% in the past five years.

HIV infections have increased in the North and Northeast regions (the poorest ones) and follow a pattern that points to structural racism: black people make up 60% of the deaths associated with HIV in these regions.

Governance Issues: Perceptions, Rights, and Regulations

Corruption in Brazil has worsened for three years in a row, based on citizens’ perceptions. In 2019, out of 180 countries, Brazil occupied the 106th position in the Corruption Perception Index, and saw a 20.1% increase in deaths from police intervention alongside the dismantling of the social participation policy: the National SDG Commission created in 2016 was dissolved by Presidential Decree 9.759 in April 2019. This decree also affected approximately 500 commissions and councils that had the participation of civil society representatives.

The Brazilian federal administration is openly opposed to the 2030 Agenda, as evidenced by its deregulating policies, weakening environmental protection agencies, and denying science and the climate emergency. The latest attack on the SDGs was published on 26 October 2020: Presidential Decree 10.531/2020 replaces the 2030 Agenda with the Federal Strategic Development Plan 2031. The plan seeks to justify a proposed regressive tax reform, policies of privatization for health and education, and social exclusion by reinforcing the traditional binary family arrangement, among other things[3].

It is symptomatic that while we are experiencing an extraordinary public health event, specialists are being replaced by unqualified military personnel. The current Minister of Health – Brazil’s third since February – is an Army General ready to follow the science-denying orders from the President.

Many of the rights-based accords currently in the multilateral arena were negotiated with leadership and participation of the Brazilian diplomatic corps. These same agreements are under threat at the national level, a situation that affects people and planet beyond our own borders. Losing Brazil on the path to sustainable development and environmental responsibility is a risk neither Latin America nor the world can afford, especially in this accelerated Decade of Action.

A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

In September 2020, DESA released a synthesis of the 2020 VNRs with a specific focus on the reported impacts of COVID-19 in each country.

Will COVID-19 push the SDGs to the back of the global agenda, or will it underscore the persistent need for sustainable development? The answer depends in part on how the 2030 Agenda survives this “stress test” of its first five years. In our latest article, published in Journal of International Business Policy, we look into this question, and suggest three ways for the SDGs to help make societies more equitable after COVID-19.

COVID-19: A Stress Test for the SDGs

COVID-19 is exposing the true relevance of the SDGs. Before the pandemic, assessments on how the world is doing on achieving the SDGs already painted a bleak picture of widening inequality, more hunger, alarming erosion of ecosystems and biodiversity loss, and continued global warming.

Prioritizing economic growth over social inclusion and the environment undermines the “systems logic” of the SDGs.

COVID-19 further deteriorates progress: the resulting economic crisis is estimated to push 400 million people into abject poverty, meaning they will have to get by on less than USD1.90 a day. Moreover, the disruption of food value chains is estimated to double the number of people likely to face acute food shortages to 265 million. And as the virus is particularly affecting people living in poverty and those with underlying health conditions, COVID-19 is expected to exacerbate inequality.

Scientists have suggested that two-thirds of the SDGs are unlikely to be met amid a pandemic, and countries therefore should better define their priorities, and focus on a few broad strategic goals rather than all 17 SDGs. The editorial team of Nature added that it now is time to revise the SDGs to make them more achievable. This criticism echoes an early critique from the Copenhagen Consensus group that the 2030 Agenda has too many goals and too few priorities.

Others are not so sure. One group of scientists stated, also in Nature, that “great feats are rarely a product of lowered ambition” and the pandemic only “reinforces why the goals were established in the first place: to chart a better course towards common economic, social and environmental ambitions that will guarantee humanity’s long-term future.” The UN itself underscores this position and has not suggested revising or narrowing the sustainable development agenda. On the contrary, it has doubled down on the SDGs, asserting that they are “vital for a [COVID-19] recovery that leads to greener, more inclusive economies, and stronger, more resilient societies.”

Therefore, although it is good to remain critical about the design of the SDGs, they are likely to represent the best framework for navigating societies through the pandemic, and towards resilience and sustainability. COVID-19 is truly a stress test for the SDGs in general, and its universal and integrative ambitions in particular.

The Three-Part Logic of the SDGs

We argue that the SDGs provide three distinct “logics” that could help make societies more equitable after COVID-19. After the SDGs were adopted in 2015, a wave of reports, road maps, websites, and research papers investigated how the Goals could best be achieved. This has increased the world community’s intelligence on how to create more sustainable and resilient societies.

In our paper, we identify three types of logic illustrated by the SDGs: (1) a governance logic, (2) a systems logic, and (3) a strategic logic. These could facilitate a sustainable transformation during this crisis and beyond. But each faces significant hurdles.

Source: van Zanten & van Tulder (2020)

First, according to the governance logic of the SDGs, progress takes place by setting policy goals at the macro level, creating policies to achieve them, and measuring progress over time. The 2030 Agenda provides 17 SDGs with 169 targets and 232 approved indicators to guide this process. Policies are increasingly being formulated to achieve these. Vast data gaps in measuring progress remain, but they are gradually filled.

The way many governments have been dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, with ad hoc and fragmented approaches, has actually created a key hurdle for effective action. Short-term priorities may get in the way of maintaining the needed longer-term focus. In our paper, we discuss the diverging approaches of the EU (more holistic) and US (more fragmented) in setting longer-term policy objectives and their influence on the SDGs.

Second, the SDGs’ systems logic works through the interactions between SDGs, in which contributions to one SDG can advance progress on another SDG or target, but they can also undermine progress on other targets or goals. Tackling sustainable development challenges requires targeting the interactions between the SDGs rather than focusing on individual goals. A quick analysis issued by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in July 2020 shows both the impacts of the pandemic on many SDGs, and that the SDG framework can help map wider systemic effects of a crisis.

The main hurdle facing this logic is that SDGs that drive economic growth are given priority over SDGs aimed at social inclusion and environmental sustainability. It would be useful to pursue more targeted approaches that look into the net impacts of each type of economic activity.

Third, the SDGs feature a strategic logic. This works by actively involving private companies in sustainable development. Most major companies have responded supportively to the adoption of the Goals and begun to incorporate them in their operations and communications. Yet companies face a real hurdle in moving from intention to realization: they need to improve their impacts. Crossing this hurdle requires companies to integrate the SDGs into their entire organization, rather than positioning the goals in CSR or communications departments, and to measure and report on the results.

Outlook

Milton Friedman once famously said: “Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.”

In our paper, we argued that there are a number of interesting and relevant ideas constituting our SDG intelligence, that can help us move beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability and resilience. We only must avoid a parsimonious approach of focusing on separate elements of the 2030 Agenda at the expense of others, to ensure we do not throw away the child (the collective intelligence build-up) with the bathwater (crisis management).

Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C scenario.

The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.

There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.

Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.

A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.

“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”

The Protocol is available for comment for one month, from 13 October till 13 November.

Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, launched by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020. The Framework was developed with 70 leading global investors representing USD 16 trillion in assets. [Publication: Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol] [UNEP FI Press Release]

297,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/5-ways-businesses-can-rebuildbetter/,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: 5 Ways Businesses Can #RebuildBetter,"By Zahid Torres-Rahman

We are a decade away from the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, yet when they were set in 2015, very few people would have anticipated a global pandemic affecting almost every country and territory across the world in 2020. The predictions are dire, from the projected number of people who will die from the virus, to the impact on food security, livelihoods and markets, to the effect on the social fabric of many communities.

However, among the crisis and chaos, there is also a real opportunity to rebuild better following the pandemic, in a way that leaves vulnerable people and communities significantly better off than they were before.

Decent jobs must be top priority as “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic.

Business Fights Poverty has conducted extensive collaboration with businesses, organizations and individuals, and held online events in July and during the UN’s high-level week in September. Through these discussions we have identified five primary ways that businesses can help with the global effort to rebuild better.

1. Demonstrate a purpose beyond profit

There will be increasing demand from employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders for companies to more actively articulate and demonstrate their wider societal purpose beyond profits (recognizing that firms with purpose also do better financially). Such purpose should include tackling inequality, protecting human rights, supporting climate action and acknowledging their carbon footprint, and being better at, and more transparent about, measuring impact. Practical measures could include a company’s board of directors issuing a “Statement of Purpose” committing to bringing a positive return for their communities and stakeholders, not just shareholders.

2. Support the most vulnerable people and communities within value chains

The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing fragilities in global value chains. Such fragilities include micro, small, and medium enterprises without the cash reserves to endure the economic impact of lockdowns, and hourly workers without access to sick pay or social protection. We have produced an action toolkit, which is free to download from our website, looking at vulnerable workers whose health is at risk due to exposure to the virus, and those whose livelihoods are at risk because they depend on export sectors that have ground to a halt. Articles on tackling hidden labor and a video on enhancing social justice in global supply chains offer additional insight.

3. Invest in building new skills and personal resilience

COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive to the world of work and learning, accelerating trends towards automation and new technology. There is an urgent need for upskilling and reskilling workers – not only with technical skills, but also with the soft skills that are increasingly demanded by employers.

As “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic, decent jobs must be top priority. With support from The Lab at the International Labour Organization (ILO), Business Fights Poverty has created the Better Jobs Action Toolkit to provide guidance to businesses and organizations on ensuring that recovery efforts prioritize decent work.

We have also launched an innovative partnership with life sciences company Bayer, to explore how a wider uptake of “self-care” approaches can reduce pressure on health services, improve health incomes, and empower individuals and communities. Learn more through this online discussion.

4. Prioritize action on equity

The pandemic has affected people differently, based on their gender, race and income level. Women have been more exposed to infection as they make up the majority of front-line health workers. Women also are often in the most vulnerable positions in workforces and value chains, they have faced a surge in domestic violence, and they taken on the burden of unpaid care. At the same time, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery in the U.S. and the resulting protests have exposed deep-rooted, systemic racism and an urgent need for action.

Natalie Deacon of Avon writes that flexible, digital earning opportunities can support women’s well-being and avoid the rolling back of gender gains. On 3 December 2020, Business Fights Poverty will host a one-day online learning and collaborative event on gender equity in pandemic responses. Uwe Gneiting from Oxfam America also shares thoughts on how businesses can tackle inequalities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

5. Build system-level partnerships

COVID-19 has highlighted how truly interconnected we all are as well as the large-scale challenges we face, such as inequity and climate change. So, we need to rethink how we partner – shifting from traditional, transactional-style partnerships to ones that bring together multiple partners from across a company’s value chain, among peer groups, with government and civil society. With Seth Green, founding director of the Baumhart Center, an interdisciplinary center at Loyola University Chicago that prepares leaders to tackle society’s most pressing challenges, we created a “How To” video for companies on how to partner for transformational change.

The global pandemic is far from over and the consequences will be felt for many years to come. Business Fights Poverty will continue to play a key role in helping businesses to respond to threats, build trust, and connect partners for purposeful collaboration. It’s crucial that we leverage the learnings and changes brought on by COVID-19 to forge ahead into the Decade of Action to improve millions of lives by 2030.

Launched ahead of World Cities Day 2020, the publication highlights the importance of local leaders and city governments in implementing the SDGs, and notes that VLRs are gaining in momentum.

‘Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines on Voluntary Local Reviews’ was launched on 30 October 2020. The guidelines were developed by ESCAP and the Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanisation (PPSU) in partnership with cities in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand.

In the report’s foreword, Stefanos Fotiou, ESCAP, and Norliza Hashim, PPSU, explain that by pursuing sustainable urbanization, cities can be “change agents” and help solve the climate crisis, unsustainable resource use, widespread inequality, discrimination and injustice. This is particularly true of Asia-Pacific cities, where most of the world’s urban population lives. They add that most of the global SDG indicators have an urban dimension, and about one-third of SDG indicators are measured at the local rather than national level. Therefore, the authors write, “any country serious about [achieving the SDGs] will find the path to sustainable development runs through its cities.”

The report notes that VLRs can help cities and regions to: localize the SDGs; demonstrate their capacity and commitments; rethink their planning process; better engage local communities to understand their needs; and get communities involved meaningfully in recovery strategies and long-term development efforts.

However, no specific template or official format exists for VLRs. The publication provides the first region-specific guidance on how to conduct a VLR and produce a report.

The guidelines build on existing resources to provide practical tools, checklists, and templates for conducting a VLR. The resources are designed to be complimentary with the respective country’s Voluntary National Review (VNR). The publication includes an overview of the VLRs produced already by several Asia-Pacific municipalities, including: Hamamatsu, Japan, which reviewed all 17 SDGs and has incorporated them into its 30-year development plan; Kitakyushu, Japan, which includes a focus on pollution abatement; and Shimokawa, Japan, highlighting extensive stakeholder engagement.

Observing World Cities Day 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “local action is the key” to rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic and engaging in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. He said that the pandemic response has brought the value of communities “into sharp focus…. Let us maintain this recognition of their value.”

UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif said the only way to achieve the SDGs is to create wider opportunities for communities to “network, co-create and finance their initiatives.” She said the value of communities “goes far beyond supporting emergency responses…. communities must be at the centre of designing their own, longer term solutions.”

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

‘State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs‘, a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020 prepared by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES);

‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’ which provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation; and

‘Guidelines for Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs)’ in a VLR Series by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).

Organizers said the Discover the SDGs event is underwritten by Arch and Hook, Artistic Milliners and Lenzing with support from Interwoven, ITL Group and Orta. The event “serves as a catalyst for a new era of fashion; exploring the intersection of the SDGs and fashion business including climate action, gender equality, industry innovation, digitization, life of land and responsible production and consumption,” organizers said.

Tricia Carey, director of global business development at Lenzing, noted, that, “As we close out a tumultuous 2020, we have optimism for a new year with a path to recover better together. Discover the SDG’s by the Conscious Fashion Campaign provides the fashion industry with the tools to make educated choices with regards to both the environment and society.”

Carey said Lenzing uses the SDGs as a “framework for our initiatives to be a responsible wood-based cellulosic fiber producer making Tencel, Lyocell and Modal.”

Murtaza Ahmed, owner and managing director of Artistic Milliners, stressed the importance of partnerships and collaboration to advance the SDGs. He said he believes “any one entity alone cannot rely on fragmented work to achieve global impact.”

“Therefore, we are leveraging the power of SDGs as the most comprehensive framework of collective action to bring about real impact,” Ahmed explained. “Our efforts have led to our recognition by the United Nations Global Compact as the Global Pioneer of SDG 5: Gender Equality. We want to share our best practices with our peers and partners and the Conscious Fashion Campaign provides the perfect platform to inspire the global fashion industry to action.”","The Conscious Fashion Campaign, which is an initiative founded by social entrepreneur Kerry Bannigan to “accelerate fashion industry action in support of the Sustainable Development Goals,” has launched a monthlong “virtual educational experience” that is in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Partnerships.
The event features designers such as Anyango Mpinga, Tracy Reese, Gabriela Hearst and Maria Cornejo, among others.

Governments have long recognized the links between migration and development, but insufficient implementation may hinder progress on the SDGs. Analysis of the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) presented by governments in 2019 as part of their follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda suggests that migrants and refugees are at risk of being left behind.

A recent report by the UN’s Committee for Development Policy (CDP) highlights numerous gaps in SDG performance. It shows that foundational principles of the 2030 Agenda, such as the commitment to leave no one behind, lack practical examples of implementation. So too do responses to migration: only 26 of the 47 VNRs presented in 2019 show tangible policy action on migration, according to the CDP.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has shown migration being increasingly reflected in VNRs (at least 96% of VNRs in 2020 addressed the topic,[1] compared to 91% in 2019). However, the quality of references varies considerably. Some reviews provide in-depth analysis of migration patterns and the policy actions taken by governments to address its multiple dimensions, but others refer to the issue in passing, without citing any related policies or actions to enhance the impact of migration on development.

These analyses suggest that although governments continue to recognize the importance of migration to their development outcomes, many have still not integrated it effectively in their development plans and frameworks. IOM continues to encourage governments to do so. Its Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development provides a general framework for understanding why a whole-of-society and whole-of-community approach to migration is crucial to SDG achievement.

Recent UN reports and conferences have similarly called for more action on this front. In 2018 governments adopted the Global Compact for Migration, committing to “integrate migration into development planning and sectoral policies at the local, national, regional and global levels.” In 2020, the Secretary-General’s report on international migration and development emphasized whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to migration, “with a view to mainstreaming migration across all relevant policy domains ….”

Despite these concerns, several VNRs do present practical examples of how governments are addressing migration in their SDG implementation. For example, the Republic of Moldova’s VNR addresses the impacts of migration on human capital development, school attainment, de-skilling and remittances investment. The VNR process led to strong commitments by the government on protecting Moldovan migrant workers abroad, skills validation for returnees, and opportunities to invest in small and medium enterprises.

In Timor-Leste, the VNR has made it much easier for migration to be addressed in the UN’s principal development plans, and has created space for migration issues to be included in cross-sectoral development projects (for example, to mobilize diaspora financing for SDG implementation). At the national level, the country’s parliament has scheduled a session on migration, recognizing its importance to national development, and the role of migrants is now being considered in the government’s budget analysis for the first time.

These examples provide two key lessons for governments in the decade remaining to achieve the 2030 Agenda. First, migration must be mainstreamed more effectively into development plans and frameworks, in order to promote better development outcomes from migration. This requires more than just passing references in VNRs. More robust analysis and policy solutions must also be included. Improving data on migration is essential to this.

A second lesson from the country examples is on ensuring effective follow-up to the VNR itself. While producing VNRs is a crucial part of governments’ SDG monitoring efforts, it is not an end in itself. VNRs are intended to help identify both successes and areas where further action is needed. They provide an important platform – if utilized as such – to develop new policies, inform prioritization exercises, and focus resources and funding for accelerated SDG progress.

With only ten years left to meet the 2030 Agenda, turning commitments into tangible action is critical. Migration is one issue on which concerted effort is needed. Governments should look to the good examples that exist for ensuring planning and action to improve lives for migrants and leave no one behind.

301,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/wto-members-mull-easing-restrictions-on-humanitarian-food-aid/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: WTO Members Mull Easing Restrictions on Humanitarian Food Aid,"Negotiators at the World Trade Organization (WTO) are considering a proposal from Singapore that would ensure humanitarian food aid is exempt from export prohibitions and restrictions, ahead of the trade body’s General Council meeting on 16 December.

Proponents say the move will make it faster and easier for the World Food Program (WFP) to provide urgently-needed assistance to save the lives of people in crisis situations – and ensure that trade rules support progress towards SDG 2, which commits governments to ending hunger and malnutrition.

The move follows a declaration by agriculture ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) on 21 April, reaffirming their agreement to exempt from export restrictions food bought for humanitarian purposes by the WFP.

After a wave of food price spikes in the late 2000s, G20 leaders made a similar statement at their Cannes summit in November 2011 – although disagreement among WTO members prevented the trade body adopting an agreement on the issue at its ministerial conference in Geneva one month later.

This year, the issue has again risen up the trade agenda as several countries initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by restricting food exports, raising concern that poor consumers in net food-importing countries would face difficulties in accessing food. Although many such measures have since been lifted, WFP staff told an informal WTO meeting on 10 November that the organization had faced difficulties procuring humanitarian aid in the new market and policy environment.

With the WFP now set to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its work to combat hunger, especially in conflict-affected areas, trade officials acknowledged that there was increased awareness of the agency’s work, and a stronger determination among WTO members to support it. “It would be a good moment for the WTO to deliver”, one developing country trade official told IISD.

Growing momentum

Around 30 countries would be willing to co-sponsor Singapore’s initiative, which would take the form of a General Council decision, trade sources told IISD. Furthermore, as many as 50 members are believed to have expressed support for the move. Countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific are among those co-sponsoring the proposal, including those which are recipients of food aid.

Support is also spread across different world regions and negotiating coalitions, including both exporting and importing countries, and those classed as developed, developing, and least developed countries (LDCs) at the WTO.

On 23 November, a virtual ministerial meeting of the cross-regional Ottawa Group of trade ministers discussed the proposal and “agreed to encourage” its adoption by the wider WTO membership, according to a press release issued after the event. The meeting was convened by Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, Mary Ng.

Sources told IISD that the EU is also consulting internally on the proposal, while the US has spoken in support of the move, and China voiced cautious support. The LDCs are reportedly also in favor, along with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group, although some countries in the group are seeking to address the concern that food aid procurement could exacerbate domestic shortages. India is the only WTO member to express objections to the proposal in its current form, trade officials said.

However, negotiators said some countries’ concerns may have been allayed by the WFP’s presentation for WTO members, which emphasized the agency’s “do no harm” principle underlying its procurement policy. WFP Chief Economist Arif Husain outlined the steps the organization took to support food security through its food purchases, as well as describing the obstacles which food export restrictions create for the safe, timely, and efficient delivery of humanitarian aid.

Both rice and maize procurement had both been affected by export restrictions, Husain said. In the case of maize, procurement costs were higher, and deliveries took two to three times longer, resulting in the loss of at least 3.9 million meals. In the case of rice, food aid to West Africa was delayed by at least one month, and rice procurement prices rose by 20 percent.

WFP Executive Director David Beasley has also spoken out in support of the initiative, telling a meeting of the agency’s Executive Board in November that the proposal “will help us save both money and time in reaching the most destitute.” He asked Board members to urge their governments to support the exemption.

Seven issues

The topic of export restrictions is one of seven issues on the agenda of the WTO agriculture committee’s negotiating body. Members are also discussing: domestic support to the farm sector; the issue of public food stockholding; market access issues, such as tariffs and other border measures; a “special safeguard mechanism” for developing countries; export competition, including export subsidies and comparable measures; and cotton.

The chair of the WTO agriculture negotiations, Costa Rica’s Ambassador Gloria Abraham Peralta, has asked facilitators to support her efforts to identify potential areas of consensus on the seven negotiating issues. Leonardo Rocha Bento (Brazil) is facilitating the talks on export restrictions, and, alongside other facilitators, reported back on his discussions to date at the 10 November meeting.

Most members consider there is positive momentum towards a General Council, Rocha Bento told the meeting. However, there was less consensus around a separate question concerning how governments could best improve transparency when food export restrictions are imposed.

Prospects for progress

Rocha Bento is due to convene an informal meeting open to all WTO members on 26 November to hear their views on the issue and discuss possible ways forward.

Progress on WTO agriculture negotiations has been slowed by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, negotiators said, with the postponement of the next WTO ministerial conference one factor affecting the dynamic in the talks. The transition to a new administration in the US and the delay in concluding the selection process for the new WTO Director-General have also affected the mood among members and the political context for the negotiations.

However, trade officials were at pains to emphasize that WFP food aid represents only a tiny fraction of total global trade in food – and that humanitarian principles, rather than traditional trade issues, were at stake. “We’re just trying to help WFP to do its life-saving work”, one supporter of the proposal told IISD.

302,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/stakeholders-outline-options-for-trade-and-environment-agenda/,"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Stakeholders Outline Options for Trade and Environment Agenda,"Nearly two dozen representatives from civil society and intergovernmental agencies gathered to discuss what items should be a matter of priority in the trade and environment debate. This was the second of two civil society-led events of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade and Environment Week.

The event, which took place on 18 November, was organized by the Geneva Trade Platform, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Environment and Trade Hub, the Global Governance Centre at the Graduate Institute Geneva, and Chatham House’s Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy.

Coming just one day after a WTO member group launched “structured discussions” devoted to trade and environmental sustainability, the interventions largely built around what items could be raised in these talks, and what approach these could take.

Anja von Moltke, UNEP Environment and Trade Hub, opened the event by calling for “all hands on deck to push leadership and action for a sustainable future.” With event co-organizer Carolyn Deere Birkbeck, Global Governance Centre, Graduate Institute Geneva, she stressed that the new narrative on trade and environment “must be about looking at how to ensure trade policy is a central part of the toolkit” that governments use for achieving their sustainability objectives.

Carlos Vanderloo, Canadian Mission to the WTO, said global cooperation and the involvement of all stakeholders will be crucial for addressing sustainability imperatives. Several panelists echoed the need for collaboration, inclusiveness, and coherence.

Many speakers described the convening power of the WTO as a valuable strength in this agenda-setting process. They highlighted a range of policy priorities that governments should address together with other actors in the trade and environment arena, many of which were directed at the “triple threat” of biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution.

One of the recurring themes was the circular economy, with speakers like Vanessa Erogbogbo, International Trade Centre (ITC), noting the need to manage environmental trade-offs, while calling for a better understanding of the environmental impact profile of value chains.

Malena Sell, Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra, described the circular economy as “the only way forward” in addressing the triple threat, as this approach “cuts to the heart of how we produce, consume, and trade.” Trade facilitation could be a tool for supporting the circular economy, said Aditi Sara Verghese, World Economic Forum (WEF).

Elisabeth Tuerk, UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), highlighted the issue of supply chains, referring to UNECE’s work on transparency and traceability. Åsa Persson, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), called for a better understanding of climate and sustainability risk in supply chains.

Speakers including Soledad Leal Campos, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), David Vivas Eugui, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Shardul Agrawala, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Rashid Kaukab, CUTS International Geneva, identified environmentally harmful subsidies as another crucial priority for a future trade and environment agenda. Kaukab noted that this does not only include fisheries subsidies, but also those directed at agriculture.

Several participants, including Lily Sommer, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), Posh Pandey, South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE), and Crispin Conroy, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), referred to the need for lowering barriers to trade in environmental goods and services. Conroy said in the business world, many are talking about progress in this area as a “must-have” moment.

Many participants said development considerations must be front and center in the new agenda on trade and environmental sustainability. For example, Sommer called for examining carbon border adjustment measures, which are being debated in many countries as a trade policy tool for tackling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to ensure that these do not undermine developing countries’ development priorities. Kaukab cautioned against a “carrot-and-stick” approach, and urged greater support for capacity building and other assistance for least developed countries (LDCs). Leal Campos stressed that the policy community must “place sustainable development at the heart of any initiative, not only at the multilateral level, but at all levels and by all actors.”

Jan Yves Remy, Shridath Ramphal Centre for International Trade Law, Policy and Services, University of West Indies, said we need a better understanding of countries’ vulnerability to shocks, such as climate change and pandemics. He called for a better metric for country needs than traditional measures, such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

Vicente Yu, Third World Network (TWN), highlighted the need for greater flexibility and special differential treatment for developing countries, and the value of agreeing on a “peace clause” for developing countries to protect them from legal disputes when they undertake environmental measures that impact trade.

Céline Charveriat, Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP), called for greening trade for a green recovery. She stressed the need to “go beyond plastic litter” to talk about waste prevention and the challenges inherent in the petrochemical sector.

Angela Francis, WWF UK, called for a closer look at food and farming, especially the environmental challenges linked to agricultural production and trade.

Manuel Ruiz, Peruvian Society for Environmental Law, urged exploring the relationship between biodiversity, intellectual property rights (IPRs), fair and equitable access and benefit-sharing, and the wider trade regime.

The summit brought together a worldwide community of more than 5,000 sustainability leaders, including business representatives, industry federations, national partner organizations, NGOs, and policy makers to promote dialogue on how to strengthen sustainable supply chains and create an economic system that contributes to the UN SDG Goals.

The participants included Mariette Herman, President of the Dutch Economic and Social Committee, Koen Doens, Director General in the European Commission, Johan van Zyl, President and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe, Mariam Dao Gabala, chairperson of the International Supervisory Board of the international civil society organization Solidaridad, Sun Luhui, Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals (China), and Björn Böhning, the Permanent State Secretary of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS THROUGH THE LENS OF SDGs

Looking at global supply chains through the lens of the SDGs, the minister highlighted the significant role of global supply chains in achieving the SDGs, as it represents over 80% of global trade and engages over one in five workers.

It can specifically help achieve Goal 8 for decent work through job creation and trade support for developing countries, Goal 9 for industry and innovation through increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises to markets and enhancing the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, and Goal 17 for partnerships for the goals through improving cooperation and increasing the exports of developing countries.

Al Mashat noted that enabling sustainable supply chains is a shared duty between the public and private sector, as governments play a role in ensuring that supply chains are sustainable through enforcing legal framework that protects the public interest and underpins responsible business practices, and regular monitoring of business performance.

In regards to the private sector, she added that the SDGs explicitly call on businesses to solve sustainable development challenges, as business is considered to be a vital partner in achieving sustainability and the development goals.

To push for sustainable supply chains, Al Mashat stated that governments and policy makers should practice “stakeholder capitalism,” which are principles that foster and promote meaningful engagement and offer economies a unique opportunity to prioritize a circular economy centered around human and social aspirations.

RETHINKING COOPERATION



On the cooperation between Egypt and the European Union, the minister stated that the two partners have a strong strategic partnership than spans over several decades, with more than 37 projects across transportation, energy, health, education and environment amounting to more than €1.35 billion grants.

She added that there has been a shift in development cooperation to a new paradigm – development cooperation effectiveness, where the emphasis is about partnerships - governments, development partners, the private sector and civil society – working together to advance global and national economic strategic goals, as well as well as accelerating progress in this decade of action to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

To achieve this, Al Mashat noted that Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation has been working to strengthen economic diplomacy through three main principles: regularly organizing multi-stakeholder platforms to ensure that all projects between development partners are streamlined and effectively aligned with the national agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); adopting a consistent Global Partnerships Narrative People&Projects&Purpose (P&P&P); and mapping ODA financing to SDGs for all projects with multilateral and bilateral development partners.

Since the launch of the lending operations in Egypt in 1979 till present, the European Investment Bank’s investments amounted to €10,640 billion for the public, private, banking, equity funds, and finances more than 95 projects in various priority sectors for the Egyptian government such as: renewable energy, transportation, water and waste water, and SMEs.","CAIRO - 1 November 2020: Minister of International Cooperation, Rania Al Mashat, participated in the European Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit for 2020, which makes it the first for Egypt to ever take part in the annual gathering.

In an attempt to capture some progress and further focus the negotiations, the Chair of the WTO negotiating group in charge of fisheries talks, Ambassador Wills of Colombia, introduced a revised version of the draft consolidated text he had initially circulated to WTO Members in July. The text, however, was not discussed in detail by negotiators.

Delegations also considered a range of pending issues to narrow down differences, including: the duration of a possible subsidy prohibition for actors engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; unassessed stocks; dispute settlement and remedies; and special and differential treatment for developing countries. Gaps between WTO members’ positions, however, remain significant on a number of key topics.

A number of new proposals were also presented last week. These include a proposal from the Philippines on dispute settlement in cases where territoriality is disputed; a “discussion text” from Chinese Taipei on dispute settlement procedures; and a proposal from four landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) – Afghanistan, Mongolia, Nepal, and Paraguay – concerning transit transportation of fish and technical assistance. A new proposal by Brazil proposing quantitative limits to the total amounts of subsides WTO member would be allowed to disburse was discussed intersessionally between the two last meeting clusters.

While progress has been achieved in negotiations in recent months, delegates and observers alike warn that clinching a deal by the talks’ 2020 deadline enshrined in SDG target 14.6 will require a quick and significant intensification of negotiations. Last week, a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) launched a global campaign titled, ‘Stop Funding Overfishing,’ to support the conclusion of a meaningful WTO agreement by the end of the year. The campaign’s policy statement, which has been signed by 169 organizations from around the world, including leading environmental NGOs, such as WWF, Greenpeace, Oceana, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), calls on governments around the world to “fulfil their commitment to curb the public money that supports overfishing and degrades our ocean.”

The last meeting cluster of 2020 is planned for the week starting on 30 November.

A Step Forward

The revised draft consolidated text presented last week updates the first version of the draft consolidated text presented by the negotiations’ Chair on 25 June 2020. All WTO members accepted this text as a basis for further discussion, a step that was widely perceived as a significant sign of progress. For the first time in more than a decade, negotiators are focusing on one single negotiating document and proposing amendments to it based on common concepts.

Most key delegations have also reportedly started to think in terms of possible options for compromise and flexibilities. While this has not led to tangible headway in terms of substance yet, this change of dynamics is perceived as a necessary step towards concluding a deal.

The revised draft consolidated text presented by the Chair last week is an attempt to move in that direction. It contains a number of revisions of varying degrees of importance as well as a number of additions, in particular to replace some of the placeholders that were included in the first version of the text.

“I am confident that all delegations will find things to like in the changes that I am proposing, and that this revision thus will represent a step forward in the evolution of our work toward that full consensus,” the Chair said when introducing the document, according to the WTO Secretariat.

What’s in the Revised Draft Consolidated Text?

In essence, WTO negotiators are currently considering new subsidy disciplines in three substantive areas: (1) subsides to IUU fishing; (2) subsidies to the fishing of stocks that are already in an overfished condition; and (3) subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity more broadly.

No major changes were introduced in the new text regarding the rules related to IUU fishing and overfished stocks. In the case of IUU fishing, the most notable revision is simplification of the language that describes the conditions a determination of IUU fishing would have to meet in order to trigger a prohibition to subsidise a vessel or operator. The revised text states that an IUU finding would need to be based on positive evidence and follow due process, without specifying the steps required.

The most significant modification concerns the possible qualitative prohibition of subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. The previous version of the text stated that subsidies that reduce the operating costs and capital costs of fishing would be prohibited in specific situations where fishing capacity or effort is excessive. The revised text simply lists a number of subsidy types that would be prohibited, including subsidies for fuel, boat construction and modernization, or price support.

This simplification increases the potential reach of the prohibition, but is closely linked to another change made to an exception to this rule. To benefit from this revised exception and continue to provide subsidies, WTO members would need to show that they implement measures to maintain relevant stocks at sustainable levels. The revised exception drops the requirement that such fisheries management measures be effective, meaning that it would likely be easier for members to invoke the exception to continue to subsidize fishing.

In order to clarify which marine species the proposed agreement would apply to, the revised text also introduces a definition of “fish,” which, like other key definitions, has been taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures. This constitutes an attempt by the Chair to move forward on an issue some members feel required a disproportionate amount of time during the previous meeting cluster in October.

The Chair also proposed new text to replace three placeholders relating to: transparency and notification requirements, with specific information to be notified still to be defined; institutional arrangements; and dispute settlement.

Finally, the revised Chair’s text includes a new exception for subsidies for disaster relief – a general idea around which there seemed to be convergence during the October meeting cluster – under certain conditions.

Quick Intensification Needed to Meet 2020 Deadline

Despite positive signs in the dynamics of fisheries talks in recent months, significant efforts will be needed from delegations to overcome their differences on various parts of the disciplines. Recent work by IISD highlights that a number of important decisions will need to be made by WTO members in order to successfully reach an agreement.

One of the key questions for negotiators relates to the issue of special and differential treatment (S&D) for developing countries, a notoriously sensitive topic in the context of WTO negotiations. The topic is underlined in the negotiations’ mandate and in SDG target 14.6, which specifies that “appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.”

Last week’s cluster of meetings highlighted the divergence of views on this topic. Ambassador Didier Chambovey of Switzerland, recently appointed “Friend of the Chair” to facilitate S&D discussions, said members’ positions remain “quite far apart.”

While some members would like S&D provisions to exempt developing countries from parts of the main subsidy prohibitions, others think that new disciplines should instead provide only for transition periods and technical assistance for implementation. Ambassador Chambovey called on delegations to be pragmatic, creative, and flexible to find acceptable solutions that could gather consensus.

With only weeks before the start of the last meeting cluster on fisheries subsidies in 2020, S&D is only one of the numerous questions still outstanding in WTO fisheries talks. To be able to clinch a deal by the 2020 deadline, WTO members will need to intensify efforts in the coming weeks and to demonstrate they have the political will to reach compromise on these various issues.

As we note in our preview, it included meetings of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), a high-level session on the role of trade in promoting an environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery from COVID-19, and a series of WTO member-led events and workshops, which explored “issues at the forefront of the trade and environment agenda,” showcased experiences in making global trade more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive, and exchanged ideas on what role trade and the WTO can play in “building back greener and better” from COVID-19.

The Week also featured two sessions organized by civil society. A panel convened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) brought together stakeholder perspectives on trade, environment, and sustainable development. An event organized by Geneva Trade Platform, the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Environment and Trade Hub, the Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Governance Centre, and Chatham House’s Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy sought to identify priority areas for the trade and environment debate at the WTO.

The Week’s discussions provided an important impetus to the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference.

The Week kicked off with a CTE meeting where the EU introduced its European Green Deal, describing it as “a decisive action” “to transform the EU’s economy for a sustainable future” while leaving no one behind. The EU highlighted efforts to introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism to manage the risk of “carbon leakage” to make up for situations where “climate action ambitions are not shared globally.” The EU is conducting assessments covering the measure’s various impacts and its legal feasibility in light of WTO rules, EU trade agreements, and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Canada, Colombia, India, Norway, Paraguay, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Turkey offered comments on the European Green Deal, with several, including the US, expressing concerns over the carbon tax. Members called for the EU to ensure its initiatives comply with WTO rules and bilateral and regional agreements, recognize the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), ensure costs are not solely born by producers, and maintain transparency in policy making, among other actions.

On 17 November, a group of WTO members launched “structured discussions on trade and environmental sustainability.” Its proponents intend “to collaborate, prioritize and advance discussions on trade and environmental sustainability” and involve interested WTO members and external stakeholders. The structured discussions will be based on a statement to the CTE by Australia, Canada, Chad, Chile, Costa Rica, the EU, the Gambia, Fiji, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, and the UK. It is supported by 49 members.

Another group of members launched an “open-ended informal dialogue” to promote a sustainable plastics economy. The informal dialogue aims to “explore how improved trade cooperation, within the rules and mechanisms of the WTO, could contribute to domestic, regional, and global efforts to reduce plastics pollution and transition to a more circular and environmentally sustainable global plastics economy.” Proponents of this process are Australia, Barbados, Canada, China, Fiji, Jamaica, and Morocco.

In addition, the SDG Knowledge Hub provided coverage of the following events convened during the WTO Trade and Environment Week:

The events sought to help inform the deliberations of the CTE, which reconvened on 20 November. Several members reported back on the events they had organized during the Trade and Environment Week. Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and CTE Chair, expressed confidence that the Week’s discussions provided “an important impetus” to the Committee’s work and the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12).

Other updates and presentations heard by the CTE covered, among other issues:

Ongoing discussions among Costa Rica, Fiji, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland relating to the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), which is now in its third round of talks;

The Glasgow Climate Change Conference scheduled to take place from 1-12 November 2021, with the UK pledging to accelerate progress towards reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement;

Environmentally friendly coffee growing in Colombia;

Sustainable mechanized production systems for agriculture in Paraguay;

Manufacture of paper from bio-waste in Sri Lanka; and

Members’ trade-related environmental measures as reflected in their 2019 Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) where the agriculture and energy sectors were found to have the highest number of such measures.

306,https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/323894/world-risk-poll-provides-compass-sdg-road-map.aspx,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gallup Poll,World Risk Poll Provides a Compass for the SDG Road Map,"The 17 goals that make up the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) build on the earlier success of the Millennium Development Goals and provide a framework for policymakers and others to use to focus global development ambitions. The 169 targets and 231 unique indicators that quantify each of the 17 goals provide a multidimensional lens to view the development challenges that each of the goals tackles.

The SDG indicators are extensive, but the indicators themselves do not have a hierarchy. This makes it challenging for policymakers to determine what needs to be prioritized. The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas the following open-ended question: ""In your own words, what is the greatest source of RISK TO YOUR SAFETY in your daily life?""

With road-related hazards topping the list, the World Risk Poll data clearly highlight the significance of SDG 11.2: ""By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety.""

Bar chart. In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas to name their biggest source of risk in their lives. Road-related injuries were mentioned most often.

Despite some of the successes of the World Health Organization's decade of action for road safety, road traffic injuries are still the leading cause of death among young people aged 5 to 29. The World Risk Poll reinforces calls for a second decade of action, to double down on activities to address this self-identified greatest global risk.

Although road safety is the most frequently given response to the ""greatest risk"" question, residents of countries that have the lowest numbers of road traffic fatality rates per hundred thousand are those most likely to report road safety as the greatest issue.

Bar chart. Percentage worldwide who name road-related hazards as the top risk to their daily lives, according to country income group and traffic fatality rates.

The individual country-level data provide insights into what underpins this apparent contradiction. Madagascar, the country with the lowest levels of road safety reported as the ""greatest risk,"" has 28.6 deaths attributable to road safety per 100,000, about six times greater than Finland, which -- at 4.7 per 100,000 -- is the country with the highest levels of road safety reported as the largest risk.

The prevalence of more-pressing risks to daily life in lower-income countries such as Madagascar helps explain why people in lower-income countries and territories were less likely to mention road-related risks than people in higher-income countries. People living in low-income economies often face extreme poverty, poor infrastructure and weak public services, all of which form relatively more immediate threats to safety in daily life than road- and traffic-related risks.

Therefore, these threats may overshadow road-related risks despite the statistics that show how many people are injured in road accidents. This is true in Madagascar, where crime and violence are the single-largest risks, with 30% of Malagasy mentioning them.

With 12% of people worldwide mentioning crime, violence or terrorism as their top risk, people in Madagascar are hardly alone in their concerns. It also illustrates why achieving SDG target 16.1, to ""significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere"" is so crucial, and why leaders need a laser focus on indicator 16.1.4 -- the proportion of the population that feels safe walking alone at night where they live.

Based on World Poll data that measure indicator 16.1.4, while Malagasy in 2019 were not the least likely in the world to say they feel safe walking alone at night where they live, they did rank 133rd out of 144 countries on this measure.

Implications

The United Nations' most recent progress report on its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 maintains that, ""conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice"" remain threats to sustainable development. These threats have only been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, further jeopardizing the world's admittedly slow progress toward achieving ""peaceful and inclusive"" societies.

If the SDGs are designed to be a road map to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030, the World Risk Poll provides a complementary compass of how to navigate safely toward that destination.","The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

“The global coronavirus pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt,” he said. “The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe.”

The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, certainly seems to agree with Defoe (see below) that the world should now look on things with “differing eyes”.

“Another plague would remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes, than those which we looked on things with before.”

These are the words of Daniel Defoe in A Journal of the Plague Year, a vivid account of life in London in 1665 when bubonic plague wiped out 15 percent of the city’s population, and brought the economy of the whole of England to a standstill.

Many of those who didn’t die, lost their livelihoods, and just as in the global pandemic of 2020, after a period of fear, isolation and hysteria, the great and pressing concern was how to build a better world from the devastation. Defoe’s graphic description of the plague, and the subsequent economic ruin has distinct echoes for our times.

Some economists are forecasting a V-shape recovery; a fast bounce-back. But many more suggest the most likely outcome will be an L-shaped impact – a rapid dip followed by a long period of no significant growth, perhaps continuing for many years.

The United Nations, in its response to the pandemic is perhaps facing the greatest test since its inception in 1945. But the organisation is determined not to be blown off course in its pledge to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

The task of finding a way through this world-wide catastrophe has fallen to 71 year old Mr Guterres who became Secretary-General of the UN in 2017 having served two terms as Prime Minister of his native Portugal. The leader of the country’s Socialist Party, he was widely admired at home and abroad for his support for humanitarian causes. He began his career at the UN as High Commissioner for Refugees where he became convinced that sustainable development would be essential for the eradication of poverty and inequality.

Since his appointment as Secretary-General, he has enthusiastically championed the UN’s blueprint of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to achieve “a better and more sustainable future for all”. These include an end to poverty and hunger, promotion of good health and education, gender equality, clean water provision, clean energy and action on climate change.

This holistic response to the root causes of conflicts – integrating peace, sustainable development and human rights – was going to be challenging enough without an unforeseen global crisis like the Covid-19 virus.

The UN had hoped to achieve their SDG aims by the end of the decade, but the pandemic has thrown a giant spanner in the works, threatening destabilisation in many of the developing countries of the world, most notably in Africa, where progress was being made towards the SDG target.

Mr Guterres, attending a virtual high-level UN the meeting aimed at finding solutions to tackle the damage done by the pandemic to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, warned that Covid-19 would cause “unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world”. He predicted that millions would be pushed into extreme poverty, that there would be famines of “historic proportions”, and that we would witness the sharpest contraction of the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis – because of a microscopic virus,” he said.

He said that there must be immediate, collective action in six crucial areas: Global liquidity and solutions to debt; incentives for creditors; incentives to boost sustainable development; a crackdown on illicit financial dealings; the alignment of incentives in global financial systems with SDGs to boost confidence and relaunch investment in sustainable development; and finally, the creation of an over-arching global framework to aid rapid recovery.

“All our efforts must go towards building sustainable and resilient pathways that enable us not only to beat Covid-19, but to tackle the climate crisis, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty and hunger,” he said.

“Getting through Covid-19 and recovering better will cost money, but the alternative will cost far more. This is a global crisis and it’s up to all of us to solve it. Let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future.”

Mr Guterres has been at pains to insist that in the pursuit of sustainable economic recovery world governments must build upon the UN’s SDG blueprint. There was a triple imperative, he told the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in May, to stem the pandemic, safeguard development gains already made, and ensure that all recovery efforts followed the SDG 2030 Agenda.

“Working together, with our foot on the pedal and our eyes on the (SDG) 2030 Agenda, we will get through this crisis and reach our destination, protecting hard-won development progress and accelerating our joint efforts,” he said. “Our objective remains clear; to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.”

One element of the SDGs is gender equality, and Mr Guterres singled out the role of women in the world economy. The pandemic, he said, had laid bare the extent to which national economies are sustained by the unpaid domestic labour of women. He urged governments to tackle the issue in the post-pandemic world to ensure a better recovery. “Returning to our previous path is simply not an option,” he said.

His words were echoed by ECOSOC president, Mona Juul, who said that the pandemic had exposed the disproportionate burden on women who perform unpaid care work and are overrepresented as frontline health workers. She said that the inclusion of a gender perspective, as enshrined in SDG, into social and economic responses to the virus was essential.

Mr Guterres emphasised that bold action taken now, based on the UN’s SDGs, would not only protect the weakest, it would help ensure a stronger recovery. And he again stressed the regularly-quoted phrase that he would “leave no-one behind”. The recovery, he said, had to be focussed on building inclusive and sustainable economies that are more resilient in the face of future global challenges.

At the beginning of the year, the UN announced a “Decade of Action” for SDGs. The conversation at the time was about how to build momentum in the final ten years of the initiative. In its 2019 SDG report, the UN had warned that progress towards the goals was slowing, even reversing in some areas.

Now there are many who paradoxically believe the pandemic, far from being an unanticipated obstacle to SDG progress, may help reinvigorate the project. The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), for instance, pointed to the way many businesses supported communities and the vulnerable during the pandemic, showing a willingness to help society and go above and beyond the normal.

UKSSD blogger, Emily Auckland, said: “It is only by working together that we will create a post-pandemic future that is fairer, just and sustainable.”

Failure to respond quickly at this point in history, said Mr Guterres, could jeopardise progress already made towards achieving SDGs. The UN has drawn attention to several areas where a substantially improved outcome might be achieved because of the effects of the pandemic – one being the question of remittances.

Remittances – the money sent by migrant workers in developed nations to their families in poorer countries – currently account for more than five percent of GDP in as many as 60 low-income countries. During the pandemic, this flow of cash has been dramatically reduced, causing great hardship in developing countries.

But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the global remittance system, said Gilbert F. Houngbo, president of the UN agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He called for an overhaul of money-transfer systems to ensure more of the cash reaches needy families, and less is lost in transfer fees. IFAD is currently in negotiation with financial technology firms, mobile operators, banks and postal networks to find a solution to high transaction costs.

Mr Guterres focussed specifically on the effects upon mental health as a result of the pandemic, especially among the young. “Mental health is at the core of our humanity,” he said. “The virus is not only attacking our physical health, it is also increasing psychological suffering. Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief and anxiety will continue to affect people and communities.”

His observations were confirmed in late May 2020, when the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warned that more than one in six young people worldwide had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus.

The ILO reported that under 30s had been particularly hard hit, claiming that their financial prospects could be blighted for decades. Guy Ryder, the ILO’s Director-General said that many young people would simply be left behind. Youth unemployment in the EU for instance, which still stands at around 15 percent, had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, he said.

This was just one aspect of the potential fall-out from the pandemic. Mr Guterres also drew attention to the plight of the world’s developing nations, especially those in Africa, whose progress towards the UN’s SDG targets was being thrown off course as a result of the economic damage caused by coronavirus.

Mr Guterres had earlier called on UN member states to adopt a “war economy” to fight the effects of the virus. Defeating coronavirus, he said, was the first stage, but the world should seize the opportunity to create a global economy which was more “inclusive and sustainable going forward”.

“We need to prepare for a recovery for a better economy, a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” he said. “We don’t need to replicate exactly the economy of the past. Many things will change, I would say irreversibly in our lives.”

He said that the world needed to use the current situation wisely; “to seize it as an opportunity” to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability in national economies. He also expressed the hope that another effect of the pandemic would be to force governments to re-evaluate relationships with the environment, and redouble efforts to combat climate change.

Unsurprisingly for a man who sees his fundamental role as UN Secretary-General to be the achievement of the eradication of poverty and inequality, Africa is at the heart of his Covid-19 concerns.

As the virus began to spread across the continent, Mr Guterres called on warring factions in several African states to agree to a general ceasefire, in the hope that the pandemic would somehow make peace easier to achieve.

Mr Guterres knows that the pandemic will not be defeated until Africa is safe. Economic instability could lead to catastrophic collapse in the region, leading in turn to more conflict, famine and an upsurge in migration.

“In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people,” he said. “Economic growth has been strong; the digital revolution has taken hold. A free trade area has been agreed. But the epidemic threatens Africa’s progress. It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.”

It was already the case, he said, that African exports were in serious decline because of coronavirus, and demand in the continent’s tourism industry had all but dried up. The opening of a pan-African trade zone, upon which so much is staked, and which was due to take place in 2020, has been postponed as a direct result of the pandemic.

Mr Guterres praised the way African countries had moved rapidly to establish regional co-operation to fight the spread of the disease, including co-ordinated quarantines and lockdowns. He also commended African governments for drawing on their experience of epidemics like HIV/Aids and Ebola in the fight against rumour and misinformation, debunking anecdotal speculations and overcoming mistrust of government agencies.

But the international community, he argued, had to step in to help strengthen local health systems, and try to avoid a financial crisis which could push millions of Africans into poverty.

Elsewhere, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shone the spotlight on the effect of the pandemic on environmental issues, insisting that the world’s response must not be seen as simply a philanthropic reaction. Sustainable recovery and development will need to be fully future-proofed, she said. The threat posed by rising global temperatures increases the likelihood of more pandemics, flooding, droughts and the destabilisation of economies.

Meanwhile attention has also been focussed on the generational response to the crisis. Those reaching adulthood in the early 21st century – Millennials and Generation Z – were initially accused of having too carefree an attitude to the virus, even being blamed for helping to spread infection. But it is becoming clear that the response of young people is leading to intergenerational innovation to find ways to survive and grow.

Millennials and Generation Z make up nearly 40 percent of workers in fragile areas such as childcare, restaurants, and tourism – and are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of measures designed to tackle Covid-19. But these young people are also collaborative, comfortable with electronic communication and the use of technology, and above all, adaptable.

They are the generations most likely to seek out sustainable brands, say economists. Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is a pioneer of in this field. In 2018 their 28 Sustainable Living Brands grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business – up from 46 percent the previous year. Much of this growth, Unilever believes, is down to the attitudes of younger generations.

Elizabeth Uviebinené, the British author of Slay in You Lane: The Black Girl Bible, summed up this opinion, saying: “Despite the uncertainty ahead, I take comfort in the fact that millennials are a resilient and adaptable generation because we’ve always had to be, and this setback will be no different.”

The Business & Sustainable Development Commission, launched in Davos, Switzerland in 2016, believes that at least $12 trillion could be unlocked through the expansion of sustainable business over the next decade, creating up to 380 million new jobs by 2030.

Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, the Director of SDG Impact at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), says that the pandemic has exposed the world’s weaknesses, and “reminded us about how interconnected all our fortunes are”.

“We now have the opportunity to create a better, stronger, more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for all,” she says. “Rather than assume that the pandemic makes our task harder, we should capitalise on the opportunity and space it provides to challenge conventional wisdom.”

In 2018, KPMG reported that of the world’s 250 largest companies, only 101 mentioned SDGs in their corporate reporting, and of these, just eight made the business case for SDGS.

Ms Davidsen says: “Too often the SDGs are used as just another reporting lens to communicate existing activities differently, rather than to make different decisions. While interest in the SDGs has been building, business leaders tell us they still do not have all the tools and information they need.”

Her role, as the pandemic recedes, is to build a common business framework to guide companies, creating a greater sense of confidence in an uncertain time, she said.

António Guterres believes that people have finally become conscious of the seriousness of the virus and its effects, and now understand that global solidarity and co-ordination of action was required not only to defeat coronavirus, but also to keep the wheels of the world economy turning.

Despite the apparent chaos in the global response to coronavirus, the conflicting advice of experts, the attempts to pin blame, the rhetoric of leaders like Mr Trump, the failure to follow WHO guidance by some, the opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties by others, Mr Guterres remains optimistic that the world can recover, and a new, equitable future be created.

And it would seem that his cautious optimism is shared. Global Web Index, a London-based consumer research body, believes that optimism is a key factor in navigating the coronavirus crisis – and its extensive market research appears to bear that out.

An internet survey of 14,000 people across 13 countries conducted during the height of the pandemic in March 2020 found a reassuringly high level of optimism for recovery among respondents, though there were significant variations between countries.

China saw the highest levels of optimism at 93 percent, while in Japan only 17 percent were hopeful of a positive outcome. In the USA and UK, there was an approximate 50:50 split between confidence and pessimism. According to Global Web Index, good communication appears to be the key to maintaining consumer optimism, with those who felt well-informed being generally less concerned for the future.

The Great Plague of 1665 was the first time the citizens of England had suffered such pestilence since the dreadful years of the Black Death in the 14th century. It took them by surprise in much the same way as coronavirus shocked a modern world where such events were seen as things of the past. The Black Death wiped out almost 45 per cent of England’s population in the mid-1300s, and in doing so, also obliterated the feudal system, laying the foundation for a modern nation. Similarly, the Great Plague, followed the next year by the Great Fire of London, allowed the city to transform into a progressive capital. From calamity can come hope.

In his journal of the plague year, Daniel Defoe echoes this conviction with a grimly comic observation that there may yet be cause for hopefulness:

“This is a world of corpses strewn in the streets and pits, yet in the deadcart itself a drunken piper wakes up to cry, ‘But I an’t dead tho’ am I?’”

The 2020 Leaders’ Summit focused on the theme, ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All by Empowering People, Safeguarding the Planet, and Shaping New Frontiers.’

The ‘G20 Riyadh Summit’ convened virtually from 21-22 November. The Saudi G20 Presidency focused on issues including structural inequalities and debt repayments at a time when resources are needed to address the pandemic and ensure sustainable development.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G20 Leaders commit to leading the world in shaping a “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-COVID-19 era,” and emphasize the importance of “coordinated global action, solidarity and multilateral cooperation” to overcome current challenges and realize opportunities for all by “empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.” The Declaration focuses on four areas:

rising to the challenge together to address the pandemic, including through implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI;

building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, including points on health, trade and investment, and other financial topics;

ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities, including points related to sustainable development, access to opportunities, employment, women’s empowerment, education, tourism, and migration and forced displacement; and

ensuring a sustainable future, through work on environment, energy and climate, agriculture, and water.

A G20 press release notes that the G20 DSSI will provide the poorest and most vulnerable countries with “urgent and immediate liquidity relief from official bilateral creditors.” The Initiative provides USD 14 billion in 2020 to tackle the pandemic and its economic and social impacts. In addition, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working to provide US 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries between April and December 2020, as part of a broader USD 230 billion package for low-income and emerging countries. According to the release, G20 countries have also provided USD 21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, and over USD 1 trillion to support the global economy.

On building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, leaders addressed, inter alia:

the importance of tackling health and global pandemic preparedness, prevention, detection and response and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases based on a One Health approach;

trade and investment, including endorsing the G20 Actions to Support World Trade and Investment on the Future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recognizing the contribution of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO in allowing an additional opportunity to discuss and reaffirm the objectives and principles of the multilateral trading system (MTS) and to demonstrate ongoing political support for WTO reform. Leaders further recognize the need to increase the sustainability and resilience of supply chains to foster the integration of developing and least developed countries (LDCs) into the trading system and to promote inclusive economic growth, including through increased participation of micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in international trade and investment;

transportation and travel, including ensuring that global transportation routes and supply chains remain open, safe and secure;

international finance architecture, including a commitment to continue the process of International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform and an invitation to the IMF to prepare an analysis of external financing needs in low-income developing countries in future years, outlining sustainable options;

financial sector issues, such as a commitment to the Financial Stability Board’s principles underpinning national and international responses to COVID-19 and a work plan to improve the resilience of the non-bank financial sector;

digital economy, recognizing that universal, affordable, and secure connectivity is a key enabler for the digital economy and a catalyst for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and innovation;

international taxation; and

anti-corruption, including welcoming the first G20 Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting and endorsing the G20 Call to Action on Corruption and COVID-19.

On ensuring a sustainable future, leaders committed to safeguarding the planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all, including through conserving the marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Leaders launched the Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to conserve coral reefs and the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. They reaffirmed commitment to reduce marine plastic litter and to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Leaders further recognized the importance of expediting universal access to affordable and reliable energy for all, and endorsed the Circular Carib Economy Platform.

Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities.

Addressing the Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres outlined three key areas where G20 leadership is key to building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future:

halting the further spread of the pandemic;

mobilizing the resources to build forward better; and

aligning recovery efforts with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.

He said we have a “moral obligation” to ensure that the trillions of dollars “we are borrowing from future generations” for COVID‑19 recovery “does not leave them burdened by a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

In an address, WTO Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff identified three challenges facing WTO members: using trade to boost the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; facilitating trade in essential medical products needed to treat the pandemic; and reforming institutions that govern global trade, including restoring the WTO’s deliberative and negotiating functions and providing binding dispute settlement.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all countries at the United Nations, provide a set of objectives and targets that can serve as a blueprint to “build back better” after the pandemic.

This week, a report card is being released on Australia’s progress toward achieving these goals. It also highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on our ability to meet our SDG targets by 2030.

The report shows Australia is performing well in health and education, but failing in climate, environment and areas linked to social inequality.

The good news is that trust in government has risen significantly since the pandemic began, no doubt reflecting in part Australia’s relatively good response to the crisis.

Australians are proud of what we have been able to achieve, and this trust and optimism will be needed as we try to tackle some of the stubborn challenges highlighted in the report.

Why targets are critical

In adopting the SDGs, all countries (including Australia) recognised the need to take a long-term and integrated approach to national planning informed by data and evidence.

Central to this approach is the setting of economic, social and environmental targets for 2030, which help to provide clear signposts for where we want to go.

Targets are critical. They set the priorities and level of ambition, encourage a shift from short to long-term thinking, provide investment certainty, and mobilise people to collaborate to solve problems.

They also enable a clear picture of where we are on track or off track, and the scale and pace of change needed.

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, Australia still lacks national targets for many of the specific goals, and this is undermining our ability to plan effectively for our future.

The report card makes three important contributions:

1) It proposes an initial set of 2030 targets for Australia across economic, social and environmental indicators.

2) It assesses Australia’s progress towards these targets over the past two decades, highlighting where we are falling behind and where accelerated action is needed.

3) It evaluates the effects of COVID-19 on Australia’s capacity to achieve the SDGs.

Where Australia is falling behind

Our key findings in this week’s report show where Australia needs to focus its energies to meet our SDGs.

Social challenges

Australians are living longer, but are more obese and, since the pandemic, drinking more alcohol.

Domestic violence has increased during COVID-19.

Homicide rates have halved since 2000, yet the prison population has increased by 32% since 2006, with Indigenous Australians vastly over-represented.

Women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, experiencing more psychological distress and a greater chance of job disruption.

Environmental challenges

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have declined only marginally since 2000, and little progress has been made since 2013. Australia is not on track to meet a 2030 emissions target consistent with the Paris Agreement objective to keep global warming to well below 2°C.

Australia’s per-capita material footprint is one of the highest in the world – more than 70% above the OECD average – and rising.

Hard coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef has declined, and the number of species now threatened has increased since 2000.

Economic challenges

Women, young people and those without high school qualifications are more likely to have had their employment disrupted by COVID-19.

Australia’s relatively low levels of government debt will help in the COVID-19 recovery, yet household debt is well above the OECD average.

Wealth inequality is getting worse, with the share of household net worth of the bottom 40% of the population declining by 30% since 2004.

Since 2012, middle-class wages and incomes have stalled.

COVID-19 has stymied trade, foreign investment and skilled migration, prompting the need for new drivers of growth.

An opportunity for major policy changes

This report comes at a pivotal moment. All countries are facing a series of complex and related crises – a global health emergency, climate change, growing inequality, unemployment and biodiversity decline.

COVID-19 has reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, but emissions are now returning to pre-COVID-19 levels.

And increased public deficits and debt may constrain governments’ abilities to address social and environmental challenges in the coming decade.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has given governments the chance to undertake much more significant interventions than previously thought possible.

Australia has a huge opportunity to design a recovery strategy that strengthens our resilience to future shocks, addresses many of the challenges of sustainable development that we have not properly dealt with, and ensures the country’s long-term, sustainable prosperity.

Soledad Leal Campos, Senior Policy Advisor, IISD, moderated the session.

Noting the “long history” of the trade and environment debate, Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Executive Director, IISD Europe, noted that today’s consumers are increasingly interested in the environmental impact of their purchasing choices. She said the environmental and economic challenges of our time demand policy responses whose impacts extend “beyond the border,” requiring a closer look at trade policy and disciplines. Bernasconi-Osterwalder called for an open, creative, solutions-oriented, and inclusive discussion on environmental and trade policy issues, including implications for developing countries.

Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and Chair of the WTO’s Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), welcomed the discussion as “critical and timely,” and stressed the value of a strong contribution from civil society. He noted that stakeholder events “can plant the seed of constructive communication and new approaches to complex trade and environment issues.”

Blackman noted WTO members’ more active participation in the CTE’s discussions, which have become more substantive in recent years. Among the topics raised by some WTO members at the CTE, he highlighted the circular economy and role of trade policy to overcome obstacles in value chains, and the removal of environmentally harmful distortions, including fossil fuel subsidies.

Development remains the overarching objective of developing and least developed countries, and trade is a means to achieve that.

Peter Wooders, Senior Director, Energy, IISD, reported on key takeaways from the sustainability pillar of Geneva Trade Week, including the need for greater international cooperation across all levels. He highlighted an IISD-organized high-level plenary as an example of the wide scope of what sustainability encompasses, with speakers hailing from the fields of biodiversity, public health, agriculture and trade, labor, fisheries and environment, and climate change.

Rashid Kaukab, Executive Director, CUTS International, Geneva, said that looking ahead, considering context issues and ensuring harmony across the various parts of the global governance architecture will be essential. “Development remains the overarching objective of developing and least developed countries, and trade is a means to achieve that,” he noted.

Kaukab said the understanding of the term “sustainable development” can vary significantly across stakeholders, and called for a “thoughtful, calibrated, and inclusive approach.” Among “win-win” scenarios for growth, development, environment, and trade, he mentioned disciplining harmful fisheries subsidies, reaching a deal that reforms domestic agricultural support, revisiting the relationship between biodiversity frameworks and intellectual property rules, and addressing trade in plastic waste.

Isabel Jarrett, Manager, Pew Charitable Trusts’ Program on Reducing Harmful Fisheries Subsidies, noted that WTO members have two political mandates to reach a deal this year: the 2020 deadline included in SDG target 14.6 and the decision from the WTO’s Buenos Aires Ministerial Conference in 2017 to conclude an accord before the next ministerial gathering.

She said while “we have more data on the damage we are wreaking on our oceans and the need to act,” subsidies for boat construction or fuel can lower the cost of fishing and incentivize more fishing than what our marine resources can bear. Jarrett highlighted a policy statement signed by 174 civil society organizations from around the world supporting a deal in 2020, known by the hashtag #StopFundingOverfishing.

Carolyn Deere Birkbeck, Senior Researcher, Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Governance Centre, called for a “new narrative on trade and environment” that is both responsive to immediate crises and forward-looking. She said this agenda must address developing countries’ challenges and priorities, especially given that COVID-19 has complicated efforts towards achieving the SDGs and ensuring a just transition.

Deere Birkbeck stressed the need to align trade, environment, and the SDGs at the national level, including when considering the impact of trade policy abroad. At the international level, she said the WTO can play a greater role by promoting dialogue, information sharing, and capacity building.

Her portfolio features a variety of homes in a number of master-planned communities throughout California, and she’s been a member of the SDG team for two decades.

For the last two years she’s focused on Mariner’s Cove, a 7.5-acre master-planned community in Vallejo. Construction of the 175 single-family homes and two parks will begin next year.

“Re-establishing and expanding Vallejo’s connection to the waterfront was a major objective of the project,” she said. “There’s going to be even more public access, park space and amenities for everyone to enjoy. We worked closely with Gates Associates on how our housing designs integrated with their landscape and urban plan, with more accessibility to the waterfront through paseos and trails. Through the project’s view corridors you can see sailboats and the waterfront from several vantage points.”

Mastro holds extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of home design, project entitlements and construction documentation. Her methodical approach ensures her work gets delivered on-time and within the set budget. She’s an advisor to SDG’s project teams, providing guidance and direction to all of the firm’s project managers. Her diligent project management skills allow for trusted and enduring relationships with every client she serves.

She earned her degree in architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and began her career as an intern with SDG Architects in 2000. Now she serves as a principal for the company, overseeing a plethora of projects related to residential design and development. Mastro also mentors up-and-coming designers through Professional Women in Building, a part of the Building Industry Association.

In this interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Mastro talks about her favorite projects, how she stays organized and what she enjoys most about her work.

Q: What are some of your favorite projects you’ve worked on?

A: I’ve designed a variety of housing types in Northern California, including a big new waterfront project in Vallejo for Callahan Development. It’s called Mariner’s Cove and features 175 single-family townhouses and a pair of parks on 7.5 acres near the waterfront. The homes take advantage of their location close to the waterfront and the greenspace corridors. Homes next to paseos have direct access for taking walks or going to the ferry. The homes have garage access via alleyways so you have a really pleasing front-door entry off of paseos and pedestrian oriented streets. We’ve also stepped-back the homes so that they don’t feel tall and imposing next to pedestrian areas.The floor plan layouts, the detailing inside and out, the materials, everything has been designed for modern tastes and needs while also reflecting Vallejo’s neighborhoods and styles. We think Mariners Cove will fit in well and provide much needed housing and recreation space for the community.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?

Details Jennifer Mastro, principal, SDG Architects. Mastro started with the firm as an intern in 2000 and became a principal in 2015. Her portfolio includes homes at the Wilder Ranch community in Orinda and SummerHill Homes development in Mountain View. Most recently she's worked on designs for Mariner's Cove, a 7.5-acre waterfront community of 175 homes in Vallejo which will begin construction next year. Located east of Mt. Diablo in Brentwood, SDG Architects' portfolio includes residential, mixed-use, hospitality and commercial projects. The firm prides itself on sustainable, LEED-certified designs and has more than two decades of experience in the fields of master planning, community development and urban design. See More Collapse

A: We do a lot of homes for developers throughout California. One of our recent projects was Wilder Ranch in Orinda where we designed custom homes for that project. I also helped with the design of three separate projects for SummerHill Homes in Mountain View. These projects are all a learning experience. When we can work with the city and the builders collaboratively we can achieve a high level of design. It can be a little frustrating to get through the process with each city because it’s a learning experience. I’ve found projects turn out nicely when they require a high level of design from our builders.

Q: What’s one of your favorite parts of your job?

A: I enjoy working with different builders, taking a project through entitlement and getting to know each city and what they’re looking for in terms of architectural articulation. I myself enjoy the day-to-day aspects such as entitlements, which is the process where a design goes through the planning department. I’m also very fond of laying the floor plan out. You think a lot about how the home will be used and design it so that it is most beneficial to its owner.

Q: How do you stay organized?

A: I work to keep good notes, and remembering what each city and client might want as their standard keeps me organized. Notes, either handwritten or on the computer, play a major role in staying on task. We’re working on developing more tech-based solutions to stay organized. We have a database with our contacts and project specs, and the technology side makes the information available to everyone, which is especially helpful when you’re not working on-site.

Q: Are there any trends are you noticing about contemporary architecture?

A: I see us thinking more about the way people are living. There’s a big shift towards homes having offices or tech centers or smaller rooms that can be closed off. This is because people are working more from home or have kids who are doing remote learning. That seems to be the design trend of the moment. We have redone floor plans for a lot of our builders, so this might be more of a permanent thing. The most important thing is to listen to the client and learn what they’re trying to achieve.","Energetic, stylish and thoughtful, Jennifer Mastro proves on a daily basis why she’s an integral member of SDG Architects.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

Photo by: Jason Florio / SHF

“Let’s get on with it.” That’s the message Dominic O’Neill, executive director of the newly launched Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, has for the sector on World Toilet Day.

“We know what needs to happen and we have a lot of good examples, but we now need to take it to scale and to bring about this much-needed change,” he said, adding that with progress on access to safely managed sanitation “well off-track” and “significantly overdue,” a change in collective behavior and commitment from all is vital.

Around the world, more than 4 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines, and 3 billion don’t have a basic hand-washing facility with water and soap at home.

“SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene Fund

To help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week. Working with donors and other partners, it aims to enhance the international response to the sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health crisis by providing grants to low-income countries for community-based solutions.

O’Neill said now is the time for a different type of approach.

“Not just because of COVID-19, but this is a very significant moment where the whole world is talking about the need for good basic hygiene in a way that we couldn’t have dreamed of before and they have a different level of understanding.”

How to campaign for WASH during an election With multiple elections on the calendar for 2020, WASH professionals discuss how to make clean water access and improved sanitation a priority for politicians.

Speaking to Devex, O’Neill explained why progress has been waning on Sustainable Development Goal 6.2 on sanitation and hygiene and the gaps this new fund can help to plug.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

What is the status of progress around SDG 6, and how does its progress impact other SDGs?

We know that in particular, SDG target 6.2 is well off track. On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it. Presently, we see nothing that is changing business as usual in a way that will make the difference. Goodwill and effort alone will not get us to our collective goal. Our feeling is that something isn’t working in the current approach and we want to change that.

This isn’t just about hitting that SDG on safely managed sanitation. We know the outcomes of having better sanitation and hygiene are much broader including the impact on girls’ education, gender equality, reducing sexual and gender-based violence, and on critical health indicators.

One of the other outcomes that we want to really focus on is the economic impact, not only the negative impact of people getting ill from preventable diseases and not being able to go to work but the economic potential and opportunity within the sanitation economy.

Speaking at the launch of the new Sanitation and Hygiene Fund on Nov. 17, Executive Director Dominic O’Neill said, “We know that money, well utilized, has the ability to drive positive and lasting change.” Photo by: SHF

If sanitation plays such an obviously central role in development, why are we not making adequate progress?

The sector is often poorly understood and lacks a champion. We’re hoping to turn over some typical thinking about sanitation because this isn’t just about the health indicators. This is a matter of basic human rights. This is about the dignity and ability to carry out normal bodily functions in a safe, hygienic, and dignified way so we need to raise awareness. We’ve done a lot of work over the last few years looking at the human rights element, and that’s a very important part of the approach for us.

This is an SDG target, but it’s also a very basic human right. Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better, in terms of the national and local benefit from a health perspective, from an education perspective, a gender perspective, and also from an economic perspective.

The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund launched two days ago. What is it, and what are its aims?

We’re evolving out of an organization that’s existed for 30 years: the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, which has been very successful and for the last 10 years has run a global sanitation fund, piloting a lot of equality-based approaches. About a year ago, there was a strategic review, and it was decided that there were two issues around why we weren’t seeing the change in the indicators and why we weren’t having the desired impact. The sector needs to be able to go to scale, and the current approach risks us going through pilot after pilot and project after project.

So this is the basis of our business model: we will raise funds, then provide grants to country governments, who will also co-finance. They’re using domestic resources, but we also hope to crowd in other potential investors, non-traditional donors, and countries that may not normally participate in this type of fund. We’re looking, for example, at Gulf donors, philanthropic funding, impact investment, social investors, and the like.

Through our financing, we will encourage and incentivize governments to present a nationally costed plan for sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual health. [This is] a result of multistakeholder dialogue, and therefore country-owned, implemented, and monitored, which means it’s their plan, it’s based on their priorities, it aligns with their funding priorities, and with their own systems. We’re not doing projects, we’re basically inserting sanitation and hygiene into their routine development and investment planning and catalyzing it with external and funds from different sources.

There have been so many good examples of solutions, however, we’re just not seeing that long-term sustainability and the sustained impact over time. That’s because too many approaches have either been projectized as short-term interventions or there isn’t a local buy-in so once that activity stops, it doesn’t continue and behaviors aren’t changed, and facilities fall into disrepair.

“Because the case we’ve made hasn’t perhaps been so compelling, finance also hasn’t flowed to the scale that is needed to make a significant impact. We need to start explaining this issue better.” —

How is COVID-19 affecting the work of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund?

Definitely, it’s given this issue a major push. As you can imagine, the world is focused on finding a vaccine. However, people [are realizing] a vaccine is not a straightforward issue and that not everybody can afford, or has access to, a mask or can do social distancing. So, you’re left with a very basic and important behavior, which is your ability to frequently wash your hands.

Kevin Rudd's guide to making the case for WASH financing The former Australian prime minister and high-level chair of Sanitation and Water for All sends a message to finance ministers ahead of SWA's upcoming meetings for WASH.

We’re yet to see the definitive entry points. We think we have a good proposition which can improve the facilities in both health centers and in education, and at the household level. We are exploring funding options to secure further support to be able to turn our plans into reality.

As the executive director of the Sanitation and Hygiene Fund, why did you take on this job?

My career started in environmental health. In 1996, I took a voluntary service overseas placement in Namibia working on sanitation and health education in a district health team, and afterwards, I joined the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development as their environmental health adviser in 2002. I then went off in different aspects of my career including heading up DFID country offices in Yemen, Sierra Leone, and Nepal and I was on the board of the African Development Bank for three years representing the U.K. government. This role brings me to where my early passion and career started.","On the current trajectory, it will be 2070 before we achieve it.” — Dominic O’Neill, executive director, Sanitation and Hygiene FundTo help tackle this, The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund was launched earlier this week.

According to Invest India CEO & MD Deepak Bagla, India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs globally and the 'SDG Investor Map for India' will be an instrumental stride in India's development trajectory.

Shoko Noda, UNDP India Resident Representative said that the SDG Investor Map comes at a critical time for India, as the financing gap for the SDGs in India has only widened further with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

SDG Investor Map: Key highlights

•Among the identified 18 investment opportunities areas (IOAs), 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen strong private equity and venture capital activity.

•The areas have companies that have been successful in unlocking scale and demonstrate profitability.

•The remaining 8 IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have received attention from early-stage investors.

•Besides the IOAs, the map also identified 8 white space that have the potential to grow into IOAs within 5-6 years. The areas have seen considerable investor interest.

•The white spaces would, however, require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

•Almost 50 percent of the shortlisted investment opportunities areas have historical investments that have yielded IRRs over 20 percent.

•Besides this, 84 percent of the areas have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).

Significance The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in the investment opportunities areas and SDG enabling sectors, closing the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Investing in the Sustainable Development Goals will also be crucial for ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhance India’s resilience to future threats.

Benefits

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability would boost the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology that will be of the essence to India, as it combats the challenges of a post-COVID economy.

Around 83 percent of the identified investment opportunities areas address job creation and industrialization needs, while 70 percent focus on inclusive business models and 50 percent on leveraging digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

Other Details

•The SDG Investor Map lays out ways to bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for 6 SDG-enabling sectors including Healthcare, Education, Financial Services, Sustainable Environment, Agriculture & Allied Activities and Renewable Energy & Alternatives.

•The ways are found by mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest.

•These sectors and the IOAs were selected after a detailed analytical process that included extensive consultations with major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

Generation SDG activates civic engagement through the creation of youth-led volunteer projects that advance Canada’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Youth Ambassadors receive a $500 grant, training and mentorship to support them in their projects.

The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said.

It is thus critical to ensure that these pathways are sustainable, resilient and equitable.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SDG financing gap has widened by an estimated USD 400 billion in developing countries, adding to the pre-COVID shortfall of USD 2-2.5 trillion per annum, it said.

Whilst the government continues to show strong support for the SDGs and a sustainable recovery, mobilizing this kind of capital and supporting the on-ground innovation needed to meet the SDG targets by 2030, requires the collective efforts of the public and private sector transition from short-term recovery to long-term sustainability, said the release.

The 6 SDG-enabling sectors include education, healthcare, agriculture & allied activities, financial services, renewable energy & alternatives and sustainable environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks.

These IOAs are in six critical SDG (sustainable development goals) enabling sectors that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development, the UNDP, which works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities through the sustainable development of nations, said in a release.
This initiative is an instrumental stride in India''s development trajectory, and I believe it couldn''t have come at a better time.
We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India,"" Invest India MD & CEO Deepak Bagla said.
The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said."

SDG County council recently voted to support more funding for a project that will have a new, 200-foot tower constructed to bolster two-way radio communications for transportation staff.

Trevor Baker, operations manager, transportation and planning services, in a key information report to council said the bad news is, required repairs to the existing tower in the Newington area, including the tower and anchors would be cost-prohibitive — especially considering it’s not safe anymore for workers to service it by climbing it, that each time fixes would be needed for the antenna, a costly crane needs to be on site.

The good news is, much of the $231,000 total for the project is already accounted for — $106,000 from the existing reserve, and $30,000 budgeted in 2020 for upgrades that has gone unspent.

That leaves $95,000, a sum that council said it will include in the 2021 budget and will of course be reviewed at a later date.","Article contentTall tower, full power.

“I always wanted to be a police officer,” he said. “The diversity of the province at that time, and even still today, means you have a wide variety of places to go, and things to do, when you get into policing – and that was the draw for me. I’ll never forget the fine people I worked with, and served, over my career.”

Mulhearn fondly recalled one of these individuals — Joe Dupuis, a coach officer who helped him get started in the world of policing back in 1987.

“From day one I was very fortunate to have him,” he said. “He started me off in a really good direction. His job was to take young officers and teach them about policing. But he was more than that. He got me involved in the community and meeting people.”","SDG OPP Insp.

The SDGIF will be used to provide mentorship grants and debt financing to women and youths in business, social enterprises and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Fulfilling the promise of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires multi-sectoral approaches that bring together expertise from a range of perspectives. Harnessing comparative advantages and working within the context of respective mandates can collectively make significant progress towards realising the vision of the SDGs. UNDP Namibia, in partnership with SBN, MIT and EIF, will initiate three SDGIF calls for proposals during the respective earmarked windows to provide competitive matching grant awards, as well as mentoring, capacity building and entrepreneurship development training to MSMEs. The grants are aimed at MSMEs operating in any of the targeted sectors of agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, renewable energy, information technology, and with a product or service on the market. By creating a two-tier structure, stakeholders are attempting to ensure that promising MSMEs can access capital through private financing and are supported, while those that show promise are also given an opportunity.

In Tier One, successful MSMEs will receive a one-off limited duration grant, usually covering up to 50% of project costs (or up to N$650 000 as appropriate) with the remainder to be matched by own contribution or loan from a financial institution.

In Tier Two for Vulnerable MSMEs, successful applicants will receive a one-off, limited duration grant, usually covering up to 90% of project costs (or up to N$50 000 as appropriate) with the remaining 10% to be matched by own-in kind contribution.

At the launch, Minister of Industrialisation and Trade Lucia Iipumbu reiterated that ""The MIT's Growth at Home strategy implores us that we look locally at how we can support our economy. To attain the noble objectives of our Growth at Home implies the need to ensure that all strategic levers to support and sustain enterprise development are fully embraced. The establishment of the SDG Impact Facility platform with our technical partner UNDP Namibia is, therefore, based on this premise.""

The minister further stated the business case for supporting initiatives with a direct link to the SDGs is strong and offers a compelling growth strategy for the private sector, as it opens new opportunities, enormous efficiency gains; drives innovation, and enhances reputations.

Also, at the launch, Alka Bhatia, UNDP Resident Representative for Namibia said: ""The concept to building back better and growing our own sustainable future will require a collective effort to not only address immediate challenges but ensuring that the pre-existing inequalities are also tackled with as much vigour as we did with the pandemic. This period has reminded us of the importance of having robust and strong systems that are able to withstand shocks across our different sectors.""

Delivering the closing remarks, CEO of Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia Benedict Libanda stated that: ""This partnership provides an excellent opportunity to scale up financing for sustainable development in Namibia. The Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia is honoured to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility as one of the four major institutional stakeholders. Getting financing right is critical to meet the SDGs and our Vision 2030. Domestic finance and international development cooperation nevertheless remain central for the achievement of the SDGs. In every country, domestic public finance, in particular, has been the largest and most important source of finance for sustainable development. Private sector presents a huge opportunity to accelerate the attainment of the SDGs. However, unlocking private investment has been a major challenge despite the fact that there is enough capital on the domestic market.""","The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade (MIT) and their partners - the Environmental Investment Fund (EIF) and Standard Bank Namibia (SBN), launched the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF) on Monday, 2 November 2020.

332,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-index-finds-no-european-country-on-track-green-deal-brings-potential/,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Index Finds No European Country on Track, Green Deal Brings Potential","The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) launched the 2020 edition of the Europe Sustainable Development Report (ESDR). The ESDR 2020 provides an updated SDG Index and Dashboards for European countries, reports on spillover effects on other countries, and makes recommendations for strengthening SDG implementation and the European Green Deal.

The ESDR 2020 is the second report on the SDG progress of the EU, its member states, and other European countries. The report is part of a broader series of Sustainable Development Reports tracking the performances of countries and municipalities around the world on the SDGs. The 2020 ESDR examines six policy levers and tools for implementing SDG transformations in the EU:

A New European Industrial and Innovation Strategy for the SDGs; An investment plan and financing strategy aligned with the SDGs; Coherent national and EU SDG policies; Coordinated Green Deal and SDG Diplomacy; Regulations on business standards and reporting; and SDG monitoring and reporting framework.

The report finds that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, “no European country was on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.” The region faces the greatest challenges on sustainable agriculture and diets (SDG 2), climate (SDG 13), biodiversity (15), and in addressing inequalities in living standards across its countries and regions (SDGs 1 and 10). The authors report that unsustainable diets, high and rising obesity rates, and unsustainable agriculture and farming practices are contributing to the EU and partner countries “performing especially poorly” on SDG 2.

The Nordic countries again performed the best on the SDG Index. Finland placed the highest, with a score of 81.10. Other countries in the top five are: Sweden (81.02), Denmark (80.05), Austria (77.35), and Norway (77.03). Even these countries face challenges on several SDGs. Finland, for instance, received red scores (classified as “major challenges remain”) on SDG 2, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13. Sweden scored red on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15.

The report features a leave no one behind score that tracks four dimensions of inequality: poverty, services, gender, and income. Countries with a higher score have fewer population groups that are being left behind. Norway (87.03), Finland (86.69), and Iceland (84.23) placed the highest. Greece (57.82), Bulgaria (47.97), and Romania (47.74) ranked the lowest.

On COVID-19, the report observes that suppressing the virus remains an urgent priority for the EU. The EU has recorded more cases and deaths from COVID-19 than the Asia-Pacific region. The authors underscore the need to strengthen the EU’s preparedness, coordination, and resilience for pandemics in order to achieve SDG target 3.d on preparedness for global health security issues, and to prepare for climate-related and other risks. The report further recommends using the SDGs as a framework to build back better and investing in green infrastructure, digitization, and responsible consumption and production, combined with efforts and investments to boost education and skills throughout Europe and coordinated efforts to reform tax systems, particularly digital taxes.

The report highlights the potential of the Next Generation EU-COVID-19 recovery package and the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2021-2027) to put Europe on a path towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery. SDSN Executive Director Guido Schmidt-Traub called on the EU to “provide global leadership on the goals.” He said the EU has the tools in place to achieve the SDGs internally, but they “must be more clearly organized around the six transformations.” In addition the EU must be prepared to “promote SDG and Green Deal diplomacy ahead of the climate and biodiversity COPs in 2021.”

The report includes the 2020 International Spillover report, which shows how unsustainable supply chains and trade-related spillovers from the EU have “serious environmental, social and economic consequences for the rest of the world.” For example, unsustainable supply chains lead to deforestation and increased biodiversity threats, hindering global progress on SDGs 13 and 15. EU imports of clothing, textile, and leather products are linked with 37 fatal workplace accidents and 21,000 non-fatal accidents per year. The report recommends that the EU address negative international spillovers by reducing trade in waste, enacting coherent trade and external policies, strengthening tax cooperation and transparency, and applying EU standards to exports.

The German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, and the European Network of Political Foundations provided support for the report. SDSN and IEEP produced the report in collaboration with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), SDSN Germany, and national and regional SDSN networks in Europe.

For the UN’s 75th, a concerted effort focused on asking a million members of the public for help in steering its next 25 years. Governments also spent several months, during a pandemic, negotiating a political declaration with 12 commitments for re-energizing multilateralism, and they have issued a request for a set of recommendations from the UN Secretary-General on ensuring the UN rises to the challenges of current and future generations.

The timeframe set for the UN’s self-reflection – looking to the world in 2045 – is longer than the usual timeframes of international road maps and agreements. We have International Days (so many that some days of the year contain more than one “Day” within them). We have International Years; 2020 is the international year of the nurse and midwife (thank you, nurses and midwives) and the international year of plant health (thank you plants, too). We are also accustomed to titling ten-year periods by broad goals that need worldwide attention and effort. We are in the midst of international decades on biodiversity, people of African descent, sustainable energy, nutrition, poverty eradication, water, peace, and several more.

Setting plans for longer than a decade is a display of ambition but also reflects the scale of the problem. The eight Millennium Development Goals had a 15-year timeframe (2000-2015). The 17 global goals devised to succeed and broaden the MDGs also look 15 years ahead, to what will hopefully be a more sustainable world.

But it is a singular initiative that looks 25 years into the future and sketches its contours by the dreams of the children and youth who will fill and govern that world, and decide how it is left for their own grandchildren. The UN75 process has not shied away from the scale of the problem. This policy brief reviews the milestones since early 2019, who said what along the way, and what might come next.

Timeline of UN75 Actions and Milestones

February 2019: Governments begin negotiating the details of the anniversary commemoration through consultations led by the permanent representatives of Iceland and Singapore.

April 2019: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appoints Fabrizio Hochschild as Special Adviser on Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary.

June 2019: Governments reach agreement (A/RES/73/299) on the theme of the anniversary meeting, date, format, and outcome, and note the importance of engaging civil society and youth in all commemoration activities. They decide to convene a youth plenary as part of the occasion. In this guest article for the SDG Knowledge Hub, Fergus Watt explains the points of contention regarding modalities.

October 2019: The UN announces a public consultation process to help determine how the UN should improve and assess “the future people want, and the UN we need.” Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild says that instead, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”

January 2020: The UN launches the “global conversation” with a one-minute survey. Over the next eight months the outreach process will comprise 1,000 dialogues in 80 countries, with over one million people in all 193 Member States of the UN, scientifically sampled surveys in 50 countries conducted by two independent companies, the first-ever AI analysis of social and traditional media, and university and think-tank research.

February 2020: The permanent representatives of Qatar and Sweden serve as co-facilitators for the political declaration and begin consultations. One speaker at an early meeting says the UN “has enough documents” and it is time to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlight the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.” Initial discussions also note the importance of engaging women, girls, and all youth. But one says that “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She calls for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

March 2020: The UN75 youth plenary is postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will eventually be rescheduled for early September 2020 and take place virtually. Intergovernmental consultations on the political declaration also shift to virtual formats.

May 2020: Civil society networks hold the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need via virtual formats. Participants adopt a plan for action and priority recommendations for the UN and Member States, including to establish a Member-State-mandated, post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance. Signatories see such a mechanism as ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions.

July 2020: Consensus is reached on a political declaration to be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the 75th commemoration. The 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is less fortunate: the ministerial declaration that was under negotiation for several months through remote means could not be finalized. But statements made during the meeting send a clear message that multilateralism is a priority for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stress that the only way out of the pandemic-induced crisis is through global solidarity.

Among the actions proposed for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, as reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, are:

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

using broader measures of vulnerability;

reform of international financial institutions;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

9 September 2020: The UN holds a UN75 Youth Plenary. One speaker says “people my age are unafraid to make change happen even when the world gives them little opportunity to do so.” Hochschild offers a preview of results from the global conversation, noting that 90% of young people surveyed – more than any other age group – believe global cooperation is vital. He observes, “this does not surprise me at all: young people are deeply multilateral.”

16 September 2020: The UN Economists Network launches a report with advice on steering five current megatrends toward positive outcomes. The authors stress that achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking,” but if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time” in a sustainable, equitable direction.

18 September 2020: A letter signed by 49 leaders calls on governments to undertake institutional retooling of the UN. In a press release, signatory Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, points to “hard months and years ahead,” and says multilateralism represents the “only path that can deliver a green, sustainable and equitable recovery” from the pandemic.

21 September 2020: The UN75 office releases interim findings of the global conversation. The Special Adviser reports that they reveal “remarkable unity among respondents of all ages, regions, and social groups.” This guest article by Fabrizio Hochschild underlines that regarding the world in 25 years, respondents’ overwhelming concern relates to the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment, and this is the top concern even amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents also find international cooperation to be even more urgent due to the pandemic, and believe that more lives would be saved with better cooperation. Finally, people are looking for a UN that better reflects the stakeholders of the 21st century, that innovates more, and that is more diverse, more transparent, more accountable, and more effective.

21 September: The UN General Assembly holds a high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary. World leaders adopt the declaration agreed in July (UN/75/1), which recognizes multilateralism as necessary for a more equal, resilient, and sustainable world, and implementation of the 2030 Agenda as necessary for survival.

October 2020: Meetings following the anniversary event intensify the focus on local-led action (ICLEI/Daring Cities Forum and UCLG gathering of mayors), with UCLG Secretary General Emilia Saiz emphasizing in a guest article, “Local and regional governments are saying it loud and clear. We need to change the game and we are the game changers.” Other events around the world amplify the message that youth are central to a multilateralism that works.

Beginning the Next 25 Years

Writing before the anniversary meeting, the SDG Knowledge Hub editors observed that after a year full of discussions on multilateralism, the international community should be prepared to shape their ideas into “a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.” If, as governments said during the HLPF in July 2020, the only way out of today’s crisis is through global solidarity, then the international community must make time for action along the lines highlighted at meetings over the past year. If multilateralism is to “survive the pandemic,” on top of all of the other challenges it faces, governments and other actors must find ways to use it in humanity’s time of greatest need. This begins with showing solidarity with others. Cooperating to provide COVID-19 vaccines is a key place to start.

On 15 December 2020, UN Member States will gather in the UNGA Hall to begin discussing the follow-up to the UN75 declaration. They will hear Secretary-General Guterres’ vision for reinvigorating multilateralism and revitalizing the UN. He is also expected to provide a glimpse of the process by which he will develop recommendations, responding to governments’ request in the September declaration.

The public consultation continues until the end of 2020. The final UN75 report will be published in early 2021, and will inform the UN Secretary-General’s response to the political declaration.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has said the interests of individual Member States have repeatedly prevented the international order from functioning as it was intended, forcing the UN to “lag behind its ideals.” This is a moment in history when saving oneself begins with helping others – but this will not be the last such moment. As the end of 2020 is finally near, governments that can afford to do so should prepare to help others in more and deeper ways than they have done before in order to save multilateralism and themselves.

Preceded by the South Asia People’s Forum on SDGs, the Forum reviewed the status of SDG achievements and the actions taken by the South Asian governments towards resilient and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including Bhutan and Pakistan, that will present their second Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in 2021.

Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, advocated greater action on strengthened social protection and financing economic recovery through innovative financing strategies, accelerating digital transformation and greening recovery through the use of clean technology. She also reiterated the commitment of ESCAP in continuing to work closely with member States and other partners in the region.

H.E. Mr. Mohamed Aslam, Minister of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure, the Maldives, summarised the devastation caused by the pandemic on the Maldives economy, including loss of jobs of over 22,000 people. He called upon the South Asian countries to join hands and foster sustainable recovery to achieve the SDGs through meaningful partnerships and collaboration in addressing the challenges faced by countries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

SAARC Secretary-General H.E. Mr. Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, further highlighted cooperation initiatives such as the SAARC Emergency Fund to curb the pandemic's impact and urged member states to put SDGs at the center of all policy making and recovery planning. He also complimented ESCAP for its work on COVID-19 and for establishing the portal of the South Asia Network (SANS) on SDGs.

H.E. Mr. Tenzin Lekphell, Secretary-General of BIMSTEC, emphasized the need for aligning plans with the 2030 Agenda and urged member states in South Asia to work together to address the impact of the pandemic and achieve the SDGs.

The Forum serves as a subregional preparatory process for the 8th Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (APFSD) to be held in March 2021, on the theme of ""Accelerating action and delivery of the 2030 Agenda in Asia and the Pacific."" Inputs from the Forum will also feed into the HLPF to be held in July 2021. The forum was followed by a special event on Disaster and Climate Resilience in South Asia with the participation of environment ministers of five South Asian countries.

The reports find it will not be possible to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) by 2030 without significant increases in committed investment and improvements in investment disbursement delays.

SEforALL partnered with the Climate Policy Initiative to publish the report titled, ‘Understanding the Landscape 2020,’ which tracks finance for electricity and clean cooking committed in 2018 to 20 “high impact countries” (HICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, home to over 80% of the world’s population without energy access. The fourth edition of this annual report finds that 789 million people lack access to electricity, and 2.8 billion people lack access to clean cooking. In 2018, only one-third of the annual USD 41 billion investment required to achieve universal residential electrification and less than 1% of the annual USD 4.5 billion required to achieve universal clean cooking access by 2030 were tracked in the HICs. Additionally, the report notes, investments are not flowing to the countries with the greatest need, nor are energy access investments channeled to the right energy solutions. Investment in fossil fuel-generated electricity increased in 2018, with fossil fuels accounting for the largest portion of electricity finance commitments to HICs for the first time in six years. Overall, the energy access investment portfolio continued to be dominated by a small number of large projects, and capital providers and private sector investments remained elusive in the clean cooking sector. The report concludes with recommendations for policies, regulatory frameworks, institutions, instruments, and business models to accelerate efforts.

SEforALL’s second report titled, ‘Missing the Mark 2020,’ identifies the gaps between commitments and disbursements of development finance for energy, as tracked in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System database between 2013-2018. The report finds that although disbursements for energy in HICs have increased at a faster pace than overall development finance disbursements, energy finance disbursements lagged significantly behind commitments of USD 52 billion. Furthermore, aggregate disbursements during the period reviewed of USD 32 billion were insufficient to cover even one year of the annual investment of USD 45 billion necessary to achieve SDG 7 energy access targets. While delays in disbursement have declined since 2002, the report finds delays remained substantial due to cumbersome administrative processes, a lack of capacity among donors and implementing entities, and design flaws that hindered project execution. The report provides recommendations for donors, development finance institutions, and national policymakers to accelerate disbursements and improve the efficacy of energy projects in HICs.

The authors find that the VNR process is an “important engine” for countries to accelerate SDG progress, especially if strong follow-up processes are in place.

The report titled, ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews – a snapshot of trends in SDG reporting,’ notes that countries conducting review processes were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with various impacts. Holding VNR virtually broadened participation in some ways, but limited it in others due to varying digital access for different stakeholders. The pandemic also disrupted statistical activities, which may have affected the evidence base of some countries’ VNRs.

In other findings about national reporting:

SDG institutional structures and mechanisms have matured and advanced in several countries.

Countries that report for the first time can now benefit from the body of experience that has been built up globally since 2016.

Reporting typically increases from one reporting period to the next, with more content provided in the second or third reports. While some second or third reports highlight aspects of SDG implementation that were improved or lessons learned, the authors suggest that “greater continuity between the reports can enable ‘cyclical consideration’ and a structured analysis of progress.”

More individual stakeholder groups are reporting on SDG progress, and more countries are engaging stakeholders in VNR-related processes, i.e. the whole-of-society approach. However, many governments still engage stakeholders in “silos” and would benefit from multi-stakeholder (integrated) engagement. The best way for the VNR process to incorporate stakeholder input – e.g. spotlight/shadow reports, private sector reports, voluntary local reviews – is “still open to debate,” the authors write.

Progress on SDG localization is advancing, as some countries reported making headway in mainstreaming the SDGs at local level. However, further investment is needed to establish local SDG monitoring frameworks, identify existing and new local indicators, and facilitate local data collection.

Gaps in data and the lack of data availability are still considerable barriers. The report stresses that COVID-19 makes it all the more important to overcome these barriers in order to understand, manage, and mitigate the pandemic’s multiple impacts. As an example, the availability of disaggregated data is compromising compliance with the principle of LNOB, the authors argue.

The 2020 VNRs indicate that progress has been limited in supplementing and broadening official statistics, and the report notes the need to apply alternative data and raise international support for statistical capacity building.

At a virtual event to launch the report on 30 November 2020, officials and experts shared views on positive trends and areas where national governments can improve their SDG reporting. One suggested that going forward, countries provide more analytical depth when comparing their first and second reports and identifying lessons learned. The quality of the activities reported also should be analyzed, rather than only recounting activities that took place. Finally, in the 2021 VNRs, countries should reflect on their efforts to “build back better” from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants also discussed ways for countries to translate the 17 SDGs to their national priorities, and the value of using surveys to focus on people’s priorities. Mapping and modelling tools were also highlighted, including doughnut economics, the Millennium Institute’s Integrated SDGs (iSDGs) model, and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) rapid integrated assessment (RIA) tool.

On 21 September 2020, the UN held a meeting of world leaders to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN’s founding. They adopted a declaration that had been negotiated in the months leading up to the meeting (UN/75/1), in which they call for the UN Secretary-General to report back within the 75th session (2020-2021) with recommendations for advancing the vision expressed in the declaration, and responding to current and future challenges.

UNGA President Volkan Bozkir will convene the informal plenary meeting in person on 15 December 2020, in order to begin discussing the follow-up to the UN75 declaration. Bozkir has provided several questions on which delegations’ statements should focus, including on:

how Member States can help reinvigorate multilateralism and global governance in order to meet current and future challenges in an effective and sustainable way,

how existing tools can be adapted to current and future challenges, and

how stakeholders can be involved, including youth and civil society.

In the September 2020 declaration, Member States recognized that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics. They noted that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agreed that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

The declaration contained 12 commitments related to: leaving no one behind; protecting our planet; promoting peace and prevent conflicts; placing women and girls at the center; building trust; improving digital cooperation; upgrading the UN; ensuring sustainable financing; boosting partnerships; listening to and working with youth; and being prepared.

The brief warns that while the world has enough money to fund sustainable development, there is a financing gap and a persistent digital divide to achieve the SDGs.

The brief, authored by Elena Kosolapova, argues that “technology, finance, and capacity building, together with inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, and enabling environments” can help address climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, poverty, and hunger, among other challenges. It acknowledges that without transferring technological and financial resources to developing countries, the world cannot achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The brief traces the history of sustainable development finance since the UN Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and outlines the current global regulatory landscape for financing sustainable development and climate action, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the Paris Agreement.

According to the brief, “financing remains a major bottleneck”— a challenge exacerbated by “slow growth, high debt, growing trade restrictions, increasing environmental shocks, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” It argues the world could bridge the financing gap to achieve the SDGs, estimated at between USD 2.5 and USD 3 trillion per year, if about 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) went to sustainable development. However, “‘substantial backsliding in key action areas’ has been observed,” the brief warns, including a drop in official development assistance (ODA) of 4.3% in 2018, and a decrease in ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) of 2.2% in real terms. The brief notes that “developed countries’ pledge of raising USD 100 billion per year in climate finance has also proven difficult to achieve.”

The brief outlines “persistent gaps” between developed and developing countries’ access to and use of existing technologies, and points to “a persistent digital divide.” Recognizing technologies’ potential to “promote sustainable development and leave no one behind,” the brief cautions about possible risks that could compromise achievement of the SDGs, such as exacerbated inequalities and job loss, and recommends any tradeoffs be addressed.

Improved alignment between development cooperation and climate action, the brief argues, “can help ensure development financing activities do not undermine sustainable development,” which, it says, can be achieved though leadership, renewed commitment, political will, and global partnership.

The brief was published as part of the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series, which assesses “the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing on climate action, sustainable energy, wildlife trade, and biodiversity, among other issues.

The sectors covered by the EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels to achieve the EU’s 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of at least 40% from 1990 levels.

The Commission Decision of 16 November 2020 considers the following aspects in the determination for the cap for 2021:

A 0.46% increase of the linear reduction factor from 1.74 % to 2.2 %, which determines the amount by which the cap will decrease each year;

The implications of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, including that from 1 January 2021, the EU ETS Directive covers the emissions from electricity generation in Northern Ireland, while the emissions from the UK are no longer accounted for;

The latest scientific data concerning the global warming potential (GWP) of GHGs; and

The exclusion from the EU ETS of small installations by Croatia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain.

According to an EU press release, the cap for 2021 does not include the quantity of allowances to be issued in respect of aircraft operators, which is “the result of a bottom-up approach starting from free allocation to aviation.”

Following the appointment of the European Energy Exchange as the EU ETS common auction platform from 2021, the EU expects to publish the 2021 auction calendars in December 2020. The auctions of phase 4 will start “from the first scheduled auction date in 2021” at the end of January or early February 2021.

According to the release, from 2021 onwards:

Phase 3 and phase 4 allowances “will continue to exist in parallel”;

Phase 4 allowances are not eligible to cover phase 3 emissions of compliance entities;

Aviation allowances can be surrendered to meet the compliance obligations of aviation operators as well as stationary installations; and

International credits, including certified emission reduction (CER) units that are generated from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities under the Kyoto Protocol, can no longer be used in phase 4.

340,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/investing-in-disability-inclusion-is-our-shared-responsibility/,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Investing in Disability Inclusion Is Our Shared Responsibility,"By Olga Algayerova

Globally, people living with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and face higher rates of violence and abuse, particularly women and girls. This is unacceptable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for action to address barriers to full socio-economic participation even clearer. We must join forces for a disability-inclusive future, harnessing multilateral engagement at UNECE and beyond.

An estimated one billion people worldwide live with disabilities. In the European Union, one person in seven among the working age population reports a difficulty with a basic activity – such as walking, seeing or hearing, lifting or carrying, sitting or standing, and remembering and concentrating. Less than one out of two people with a basic activity difficulty are employed, compared to 67% for those with no such difficulty. Many people with disabilities also face challenges to fully access education and participate in community life.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, health and socioeconomic impacts are disproportionately felt by people with disabilities, and overrepresented among the most at-risk groups, especially older populations. Up to September 2020, nearly nine of ten COVID-19 related deaths reported in the UNECE region were among adults aged 65 years and older. This was a key focus of our recent multi-stakeholder discussions and new policy guidance, mobilizing the best expertise from across the region to support more age-inclusive emergency planning and response. We must all scale up efforts as part of a broader push for disability inclusion across all areas.

Civil society engagement led to electric cars being required emit an audible signal at low speeds, reducing dangers for blind and visually-impaired persons.

This is the urgent call made in the UN Secretary-General’s policy brief on a disability-inclusive COVID-19 response. It outlines practical steps countries can take to ensure that people with disabilities are fully accounted for in response and socioeconomic recovery packages, charting a course for an inclusive, human rights-based approach in consultation with persons with disabilities. I urge all governments of our region to adopt such an approach, in line with their commitments under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

On this year’s International Day of Persons with Disabilities, marked on 3 December, let us commit to action for a disability-inclusive, accessible and sustainable post-COVID-19 world. Unless we factor in disability inclusion across all policy areas and in all sectors, we lose sight of the 2030 Agenda’s fundamental vision for a future that “leaves no one behind.”

Leveraging its areas of expertise, I am proud that UNECE is making significant contributions to the development of norms and standards that can make a real difference for disability inclusion. For example, civil society engagement through the World Blind Union brought the issue of potentially dangerous “silent” electric vehicles to the attention of UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. This led to the adoption in 2016 of a binding UN regulation establishing requirements for electric cars to emit an audible signal at low speeds, reducing dangers for blind and visually-impaired persons and other vulnerable road users. A further UN regulation covering the construction of buses and coaches lays down the technical requirements to ensure accessibility for people with reduced mobility, including wheelchair users. These norms already benefit millions of people in countries all around the world, and I encourage their even wider application.

Stepping up for inclusiveness means systematically addressing the barriers faced by people with disabilities in our everyday environments. Recognizing inaccessible housing as a critical issue, the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, endorsed by UNECE, encourages the implementation of universal design principles to increase the usability of homes for all, irrespective of disability status, age, or gender. Addressing another key issue, the Protocol on Water and Health is supporting 12 countries in the pan-European to collect data and evaluate barriers faced by persons with disabilities in accessing water and sanitation services, and to put in place measures to address gaps. And to come back to the question of population ageing, which is particularly critical in the UNECE region, our Road Maps for Mainstreaming Ageing are helping Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova to improve accessibility of transport, housing, health care, and other areas. UNECE’s statistical recommendations further support countries to consider disability as a key domain in ageing-related statistics and to identify indicators on which national statistical offices should collect data.

These are just a few examples to illustrate the strong engagement of countries and stakeholders in our region for disability inclusion, and how their cooperation at UNECE is helping to turn commitment into action. These efforts are contributing to the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, launched in 2019, which sets out to transform the United Nations System into an accessible and inclusive environment where people with disabilities can engage without any obstacles. As we look to the future of multilateralism as the UN turns 75, strengthening inclusion must be a central priority in all of our work.

UNECE is also making a concerted effort to factor disability inclusion into its meeting planning and working methods. In partnership with our hosts at UN Geneva, this provides great opportunities for common approaches to strengthen both physical accessibility and digital inclusiveness. In our multilateral engagement, maximizing inclusiveness is crucial – both to harness the perspectives, skills, and creativity of all stakeholders to help us address shared challenges, and to ensure that decisions affecting our common future reflect everyone’s needs.

Ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities also informs cross-cutting cooperation through the regional UN system, including for the ICPD follow-up process to review member States’ progress across a range of population and development issues, and the Issue-Based Coalition on Social Protection. It is also a key dimension of the vibrant civil society engagement in the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UNECE Region, notably through the European Disability Forum (EDF). For our 2019 and 2020 editions of the Regional Forum (held respectively as in-person and hybrid/virtual events), we also made every effort to follow the EDF guide for accessible meetings for all.

In the midst of today’s global crisis and as we look to the great challenges ahead, we have no choice but to work together. We need common solutions that meet the needs of all members of society, and we need broad and effective engagement from different actors. I urge all governments of our region and all stakeholders to join UNECE and the wider UN system in investing in disability inclusion.

This decision provides “financial certainty for a new year that will still be marked by the uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported.

The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was postponed from October 2020 until 2021 due to the pandemic. In addition to the adoption of a much anticipated post-2020 global biodiversity framework, this meeting would have also adopted the budget that would continue to fund the Secretariat after 31 December 2020, among other decisions. In order to keep the lights on, so to speak, delegations undertook a virtual decision making process in November for:

The second extraordinary meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties (ExCOP 2);

The first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CP ExCOP/MOP 1); and

The first extraordinary meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) (NP ExCOP/MOP 1).

The draft budget was agreed via silence procedure on 27 November 2020. The interim budget for 2021 consists of “old” and “new” monies. The old monies involve the extension of the validity of funds allocated in the 2019-2020 budget associated with the costs of the meetings of the COP and its subsidiary bodies that were postponed due to the pandemic. The new monies include the approval, on an exceptional basis, a core 2021 programme budget.

When COP 15 convenes in 2021, parties will have an ambitious agenda: to “do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change in 2015,” in the words of UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir. As the ENB reports, “all of the 2010-2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been missed, making it even more important to ramp up collective ambition and willingness to do better in defining and implementing goals and targets for the next decade.”

The ENB notes that regardless of whether negotiations must continue taking place virtually, or in-person meetings are able to resume, a legitimate and effective post-2020 framework will require equitable representation by parties, organizations, and other stakeholders.

343,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/better-care-updates-on-sdg-goal-3-in-the-dominican-republic/,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Better Care: Updates on SDG 3 in the Dominican Republic,"SEATTLE, Washington — The Dominican Republic has made moderate improvements toward U.N. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which aims for good health and wellbeing in a population. In spite of this headway, the country still has major obstacles to overcome – including high rates of traffic deaths, adolescent fertility and child mortality – before it can consider SDG 3 accomplished.

Traffic Deaths

Frequent traffic deaths pose one problem impeding the Dominican Republic’s public health agenda. In fact, the Dominican Republic has the highest rate of traffic deaths per person in the Americas. The rate of traffic deaths in the small Caribbean country was 29.3 per 100,000 people in 2013. By 2016, it increased to 34.6 per 100,000. That same year, average rates in Europe totaled only 9.3 per 100,000 people.

Part of the issue stems from the local popularity of two and three-wheeled vehicles, whose riders comprise approximately 46.6% of traffic deaths in the Latin Caribbean. Two-wheeled vehicles are the preferred transportation in the region because of their heightened maneuverability and fuel efficiency. In response to this high frequency of traffic deaths, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is directing monitoring efforts and making tailored recommendations in line with its Plan of Action on Road Safety. These include recommendations for infrastructure maintenance, tighter traffic legislation and public awareness campaigns directed at underreporting.

Adolescent Fertility

The rate of adolescent fertility in the Dominican Republic has slightly decreased in recent years, but it still remains high. From 2017 to 2018, it decreased from 94.3 to 93 births per 1,000 people in girls aged 15 to 19. As with traffic deaths per person, the Dominican Republic experiences the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the Latin Caribbean, the region with the second-highest rate in the world (after sub-Saharan Africa).

Early pregnancy falls under SDG 3 in part because it poses a health risk to both mother and child. According to the NGO Girls Not Brides, pregnancy and birth-related issues cause 70,000 annual deaths worldwide among adolescent girls. Fortunately, the prevalence of skilled health workers in the Dominican Republic keeps this figure low domestically. In 2015, 99.6% of births on the island had trained medical personnel on hand, and infants who received at least two WHO-recommended vaccines had a 94% survival rate.

Child Mortality

In 2018, the national mortality rate among children under the age of five was 28.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. This marks an improvement over 2014, where the reported rate was 35 deaths per 1,000 live births. However, this improvement is undermined by increases in the maternal mortality rate, which escalated from 90 to 104.4 deaths per 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2017. This is seven times higher than that of the United States. The leading cause of maternal mortality in the Dominican Republic is internal hemorrhaging.

Pablo Wagner, hospital director at Los Mina Hospital in Santo Domingo, blames the high mortality rate on poor infrastructure. Hospitals like his deliver births for free under the Dominican Republic’s public healthcare option. Given the extent of domestic poverty, however, they are crowded by mothers who cannot afford private treatment. In numbers, Los Minos is equipped to handle 1,500 to 2,000 births per year. Instead, it handles between 12,000 and 13,000 births annually. Many of these patients have received little to no maternal education or prenatal care and are therefore unable to distinguish internal hemorrhaging from other pains, bypassing the window in which doctors can save them.

While the Dominican Republic is improving on its goal to bring good health and wellness to its citizens, the new administration – which took over in August 2020 – still has significant hurdles to overcome, particularly in infrastructure and public health awareness.

Among these was a proposed ministerial decision for extending some of the support measures LDCs receive for several years after they graduate from LDC status – especially given that some of these countries are expected to undergo that transition in the coming years.

The 16-18 December meeting of the General Council also saw a proposal aimed at supporting the establishment and growth of “cotton by-product industries” in LDCs. Examples of cotton by-products include cotton seed and hulls, with uses ranging from cooking oils to paper production. The proposal was submitted by Burkina Faso, on behalf of the Cotton-4 (C-4) countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali) and Côte d’Ivoire.

Also on the General Council’s agenda were reports on the implementation of decisions from the past three ministerial conferences, including some that involve LDC issues. These were part of a much larger agenda, which tackled issues ranging from trade and public health to the future of a long-standing moratorium on duties on electronic transmissions.

Twelve-year Extension?

The WTO agreements feature a series of provisions that set out “special and differential treatment” (S&DT) for developing and least developed country members. The approach to S&DT can vary depending on the agreement, ranging from different limits for certain types of trade-distorting subsidies to transition periods for implementing some of the WTO’s rules.

Some of the S&DT measures apply only to LDCs, which is a status based on the UN classification. Others are available to any WTO member that designates itself as a developing country. This is itself a controversial issue given that some large advanced economies, especially the US, have argued that it is vital for WTO rules and negotiations to differentiate among developing countries of varying economic heft and circumstance, while many developing countries of varying sizes have warned that development challenges manifest themselves in myriad ways and complexities and must be acknowledged.

What happens after an LDC “graduates” from that status, however, is less clear. Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, presented a communication and a related draft Ministerial Conference decision that, if adopted, would extend “support measures” available to LDCs under the WTO agreements for an additional 12-year period after graduation.

Under the draft decision, support measures are defined as “all special and differential treatment measures and exemptions available to a least developed country under existing and future WTO Agreements, Understandings, Ministerial, General Council and other relevant decisions,” as well as technical assistance, capacity building, and other measures under the WTO system meant for LDCs.

The proponents say ensuring a “smooth transition” is vital, noting that under the UN system there are provisions to support this transition. They also note there is only one mechanism at the WTO – the Enhanced Integrated Framework – that is designed to help in such transitions when it comes to the trading system.

“After leaving the category, graduating countries would normally lose access to all trade-related support measures and flexibilities granted to them, unless they request a waiver which must be approved by the whole membership,” the LDC Group’s communication notes.

The communication also warns that this creates particular challenges for LDCs on the cusp of graduation, citing as examples “their economic vulnerabilities and their limited negotiating capacity,” and noting that losing these support measures amid the devastation wrought by COVID-19 has meant that “several LDCs have been reluctant to graduate.” The Group notes that 12 LDCs are in the pipeline for graduation over the coming four years, with more expected.

While no decision was taken during the General Council meeting, according to trade sources, it drew support from China and India, while others were consulting internally. The EU, for its part, referred to existing procedures that graduating LDCs could use under the WTO system, including the use of waivers, while asking for a clarification on why the 12-year period was chosen and why such support measures should be kept in place for all countries graduating from LDC status.

US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea also raised questions about the 12-year period, asking how this would relate to the existing option available under the UN Committee for Development Policy for LDCs to delay graduation for a maximum of nine years. Another option, he said, would be for LDCs to push for that nine-year period to be extended within the UN context.

Notably, Vanuatu graduated from LDC status in early December. The Pacific island nation is a relatively recent member of the global trade club, having acceded in August 2012.

LDCs at the WTO

There are long-standing concerns over the myriad challenges that LDCs face in engaging in international trade, which have been the subject of several negotiating efforts.

For example, the difficulties that LDCs face in acceding to the WTO, a years-long process that involves negotiating with the entire membership and undertaking significant domestic reforms, prompted the adoption in 2002 of dedicated LDC Accession Guidelines. These non-binding guidelines were later updated in 2012 to include benchmarks in goods and services market access, among other features.

The move to develop revised guidelines was in response to concerns that LDCs face a significant negotiating disadvantage in accession talks, though some trade analysts have warned that the benchmarks could have limited benefits and may limit vital policy space. While 30 LDCs joined the WTO at its inception in January 1995, only six (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Liberia, Nepal, and Yemen) have acceded since, in addition to Vanuatu.

At the Geneva, Bali, and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively, WTO members endorsed decisions on select “LDC issues,” extracted from a wider suite of issues being negotiated under the WTO’s Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) in Special Session.

Among the decisions that have been adopted over the years is a decision granting preferential access to services and services suppliers from LDCs, which has been the subject of multiple decisions and follow-up work in Geneva. While over 50 WTO members have notified preferences under the waiver, trade officials and experts say more work needs to be done to ensure the waiver is being used fully, especially given the impact it could have for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Another decision, adopted in 2015, with mixed results, relates to preferential rules of origin for LDCs, specifically for imports from LDCs that are not already subject to trade preference schemes. A “Monitoring Mechanism” was adopted in 2013 to review the implementation of S&DT, in response to written submissions, though it has not since been used.

Meanwhile, the decision for developed countries, as well as those developing countries “in a position to do so,” to provide LDCs with access to their markets without subjecting their products to duties and quotas, dates back to 2005. A subsequent decision to advance progress in this area was adopted in 2013, and SDG target 17.12 calls for the “timely implementation” of this decision and related prior ones, along with making reference to the decision on preferential rules of origin.

As 2020 draws to a close, it is worth noting that there is another SDG target that refers specifically to LDCs and their challenges in the trading system. Target 17.11 calls for “significantly [increasing] the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of global exports by 2020.”

Data from the SDG Trade Monitor, a joint effort by the WTO, the International Trade Centre (ITC), and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), suggest that this target will go unfulfilled for both goods and services exports. The fact that this has gone largely unremarked by the international community is profoundly worrisome, as is the fact that many of the long-standing difficulties that LDCs face across multiple dimensions of trade and trade policy remain unresolved.

The purchase of the new plow will create a surplus unit which, pending staff’s detailed salt-management review, is expected to be sold via auction. As in previous years, local municipal staff will be provided with the opportunity to test drive the surplus plow should there be interest. Deadline extended Citing concerns over storm sewers, county administration requested the deadline for tenders for the Morrisburg roundabout and streetscape project be extended to Dec. 22. The request was approved by the SDG council. In its report, administration outlined that it had concerns regarding how the layout and location of the storm sewer could create conflict between some of the pipes and maintenance hole elements of the not yet built roundabout. “Staff, in conjunction with the design consultant, determined that the issue could not be quickly resolved without the need for further design investigations,” reads the report. It’s expected that construction of the project should begin in spring 2021.

As mentioned in the book ""Summa de Arithmetica"", by the ""father of accounting and bookkeeping"" Luca Pacioli, in 1494, it is a simple calculation in which the rule number is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years required for doubling. Using this rule for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it can be shown that if per capita GDP grows at 1 percent per year, then it will take roughly 70 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today. On the other hand, if per capita GDP grows at 3 percent per year, it will take only a little more than 23 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today.

Thus, even small differences in the growth rate of the economy over long periods of time may lead to dramatically different standards of living for the people of a country. So, what are the characteristics of an economy that make it grow faster than others? What policies can the government take to accelerate the pace of economic growth? Regarding such questions, Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas remarked, ""The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.""

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 acknowledges the importance of economic growth. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has brought in sudden and drastic disruptions that have ravaged the world economy and will most likely produce the greatest rise in global unemployment since World War II. For Bangladesh, the economic fallout from Covid-19 will be multidimensional in nature and massive in magnitude. For example, as of October 2020, real GDP growth for Bangladesh in 2020 has been estimated to be 1.6 percent by the World Bank and 3.8 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Earlier in April, the World Bank had forecasted that on a disaggregated level, real growth in Bangladesh economy in 2020 would be 3.5 percent for the agriculture sector, 2 percent for the industry sector and 3.5 percent for the services sector. At this rate, the agriculture sector would create 0.10 million more jobs, whereas the industry and services sectors would create 0.21 million and 0.9 million less jobs respectively, compared to 2018-19, assuming that employment-to-GDP elasticity would remain equal to that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the level of employment would be equal to that in 2016-17. This suggests that the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 may reduce employment in services and industry sectors, but create jobs in the agriculture sector, which would reverse decades of gradual structural transformation and stall the development of the economy.

Such dismal predictions seem to reflect the ground reality since, as of June 2020, at least 50,000 low-income individuals left Dhaka and returned to their village homes after losing their jobs due to the pandemic.

SDG 8 also asserts the need for decent jobs. Unfortunately, despite the rapid economic growth, Bangladesh has struggled to provide productive employment and decent jobs for its young labour force. In 2017, the youth unemployment rate was as high as 10.6 percent, whereas the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Regrettably, the unemployment rate among the youth who had completed tertiary-level education was 13.4 percent. This implies that the education system in Bangladesh is being unable to endow young people with market-relevant skills. In 2018, the share of the youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) was 26.2 percent in Bangladesh compared to the global average of 21.2 percent. These issues are particularly disconcerting because the country is now at the juncture where it may be able to reap the demographic dividends if it can gainfully employ its enormous young population.

The International Labour Organization has estimated that the fall in working hours in South Asia due to Covid-19 in the first two quarters of 2020 would be equivalent to 161 million full-time 40-hour-per-week jobs. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling has estimated that almost 140 million people in five South Asian countries and 12.37 million in Bangladesh may lose their jobs due to the pandemic. A survey by the Asian Development Bank has shown that the number of online job postings in Bangladesh in April 2020 was only 13 percent of the number of online job postings in April 2019. As of April 2020, 71 percent of urban slum-dwellers and 55 percent of the rural poor had no jobs due to Covid-19.

In the book ""Youth Employment in Bangladesh: Creating Opportunities—Reaping Dividends"", which I co-authored, we put forward a few suggestions for achieving SDG 8 in Bangladesh that are more relevant now in the context of Covid-19. These include: i) creating a database of youth NEET; ii) linking youth with employers; iii) revolutionising the education system so that it can build analytical competence and instil critical thinking skills in students; iv) increasing availability of technology and internet, particularly in the rural areas; v) reforming technical and vocational training to address the current need of industries; vi) ensuring equal employment opportunities for all without discrimination, prejudice or nepotism; vii) improving access to information at national, regional, and local levels; viii) promoting self-employment through entrepreneurship; ix) providing career counselling for the youth from an early stage; x) fostering an enabling environment for female youth; xi) training informal workers; and xii) seeking employment opportunities abroad.

They said a comprehensive database on flood-hit people should be made for their transplant and effective rehabilitation with intent to attain SDGs within 2030.

The observations were made the virtual dialogue styled 'Relief Support and Agricultural Incentives in Response to COVID-19 and Flood: The Effectiveness of Public Service Delivery'.

The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and Oxfam Bangladesh in partnership with Manab Mukti Sangstha and Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh co-hosted the event.

The experts said the amount of relief and incentives should be fixed following the actual number of affected people rather than the total population of a district.

The dialogue was part of the 'Enhancing the participation of community-based organisations and civil society organisations in democratic governance in Bangladesh' project being implemented by CPD and Oxfam.

Supported by the European Union, the project aims to contribute to the implementation of SDGs by the government in numerous areas.

Monday's programme was mainly based on relief distribution and Covid-19 responses of government organisations in Sirajganj district. It revealed shortages of relief materials and government incentives for flood-affected people compared to the demand in Sirajganj during flooding.

The CPD conducted their research in two sub-districts of Sirajganj, including Sirajganj Sadar and Chauhali.

CPD distinguished fellow Prof Mustafizur Rahman and senior research fellow Towfiqul Islam Khan moderated the programme.

Lawmakers from Sirajganj Prof Dr Md Habibe Millat and Tanvir Shakil Joy, among others, also spoke.

CPD senior research associate Muntaseer Kamal presented a keynote during the webinar.

He said 51 per cent of land and 95 per cent of villages of the district were inundated between the July-August period in the outgoing year.

During the 2017-18 floods, the keynoter said, 1.0 per cent of Aman crops was lost in Sirajganj which might increase notably in the 2020 floods for longevity.

He highlighted government initiatives for flooding and Covid-19 responses, including food assistance, cash assistance of Tk 2,500 and free agri inputs for marooned farmers.

According to the paper, the local administration and government representatives made their best efforts in distributing relief, but the allocation was lower than the actual demand.

There is a general lack of awareness among the local people of the government's hotline services.

The beneficiary selection process was not always participatory due to reasons like a lack of promotion of such initiatives, said the paper. Government data shows 0.3 million and 0.31 million families in Sirajganj got rice assistance and cash assistance respectively, it added.

But field reports found many of the affected families were yet to get help.

A list of 75,000 people was sent to the centre seeking the government's humanitarian assistance of Tk 2500 as a part of its new corona response.

But 65 per cent of them got aid, disclosed the paper. A lack of authentic database of disaster-hit people has been hampering such programmes, it cited.

Mr Joy recognised the need for further focusing on employment generation for vulnerable people rather than depending solely on relief measures. Dr Millat said parliamentarians should be involved more actively in the relief distribution process.

Prof Rahman suggested that telecommunication in char areas like Sirajganj be improved by providing government incentives to telecoms companies to broaden their network facilities.

The CPD suggested making a comprehensive database of flood and corona-hit people for transplant and dynamic relief and incentive distribution which are unavoidable to achieve SDGs.

Oxfam Bangladesh head of economic inclusion and justice Mohammad Soeb Iftekhar made an introductory speech while Manab Mukti executive director Md Habibullah Bahar gave a vote of thanks.

In 2020 alone, the first intersection recorded two nighttime collisions. Previous collisions were attributed to weather conditions as well as driver error, according to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).

We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Both intersections — located at County Road 1 and Gilmour Road in South Dundas, as well as County Road 19 and County Road 27 in South Glengarry — have seen several collisions over the past few years. SDG staff members presented two intersection safety reviews to council on Monday.

SDG council was presented with various ways in which two intersections deemed dangerous by administration could be made safer.

For the County Road 1 and Gilmour Road intersection, administration recommended no changes to the posted speed limit.

“We do request OPP support to increase enforcement in that area and to review other engineering speed control measures,” said Michael Jan, manager of infrastructure. “We also recommend the installation of a single light fixture, as well as the ongoing maintenance of vegetation located near the intersection.”

Another recommendation included the installation of a stop bar as well as optical speed bars on Gilmour Road, as well as relocating the stop ahead sign on that same road.

Another recommendation for council to consider was the purchase and removal a residence located at the northeast corner of the intersection. This was shot down by a few councillors, who deemed it to be too expensive of a purchase.

As for the intersection in South Glengarry, no change in the posted speed limit was also recommended there.

“Speeding is not deemed to be a major concern on County Road 19 near the intersection to County Road 27,” said Benjamin de Haan, director of transportation and planning. “We also don’t believe that an overhead flashing beacon is warranted in this case.”

That’s despite a recent request by South Glengarry council that SDG install a warning device system at the problematic intersection.

de Haan did recommend however that a streetlight be installed in order to illuminate the intersection, as well as the continued monitoring of traffic volumes on County Road 27.

“We also recommend that the intersection ahead sign in both directions be relocated, as well as the stop ahead sign on County Road 27, in accordance with the Ontario Traffic Manual,” he said. “In addition to recommendations, staff also suggests investigating the use of emotionally intelligent signage at the intersection.”

Robeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The fund would be benchmark unaware and applied Robeco’s proprietary SDG assessment framework which screen companies that contribute positively to the SDGs.

The SDGs were a set of 17 goals and 169 targets for government, business and society with the aim to reduce inequality, eradicate poverty and protect the environment.

The fund would be an actively-managed global credit strategy that could invest in opportunities across different segments in the credit market, ranging from investment grade to emerging markets credits to high yield.

Stephen Dennis, head of Robeco Australia, said the launch of the fund in the local market provided investors the opportunity to tap into Robeco’s global expertise in credit investing, and market-leading approach to sustainable investing.

“Local wholesale and institutional investors are increasingly responding to the sustainability demands of their clients and members, and the ability to access the SDG credit income fund is a development that will be welcomed by them,” Dennis said.

September 2020 marked the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the SDGs and Robeco urged the global investment community to do more as part of the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Sustainable investing is not going away; in fact, it’s only going to continue to evolve and attract further investor demand,” Dennis said.

“Investors are in a unique position to direct capital to companies that provide solutions to sustainability challenges.

“Robeco’s focus on this area over a long period of time means we’ve been able to refine our processes, and continue to offer investors products that not only generate market-leading returns, but also contribute on a practical level to the objectives of the UN SDGs.”","Select rating Give it 1/5 Give it 2/5 Give it 3/5 Give it 4/5 Give it 5/5 Cancel ratingRobeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The requested amount, coupled with funds the network hopes to receive from neighbouring municipalities such as Prescott-Russell and the City of Cornwall, as well as members, sponsors and stakeholders, would be enough for the EOAFN to have a $150,000 annual core funding.

EOAFN executive director Tom Manley asked council on Monday to consider a three-year partnership with the organization. The partnership would entail SDG providing the network with a proposed $25,000 a year.

The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAFN) is hoping a partnership can be struck with the United Counties of SDG.

“For example, currently (the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs) offers a current program which requires 50 per cent matching funding and without core funding, an organization like EOAM cannot apply for those grants.”

Having core annual funding, Manley said, would allow the EOAFN to have core staff, essential services, networking activities, and training for operators.

“This would make sure that the operators see value in the services and are prepared to pay membership fees to contribute to that core funding,” he said. “It becomes a catch-22 situation — ‘show me the value and I will pay the membership fee,’ but we can’t show you the values without having the core funding.”

According to Manley, some of the value the EOAFN could offer operators include asset mapping, online marketing, promotional activities and regional distribution. This would also lead to the organization of more special events such as farm tours, and local food festivals.

Several councillors were weary of allocating the requested sum, stressing they would rather see a business plan beforehand.

“Personally, I’d rather see a business plan associated with a request of this nature,” said Coun. Carma Williams. “I know you’ve been around for a while — is there any such thing in existence?”

According to Manley, such a plan does exists and can be found on the organization’s website.

“There are so much work to do and so many different aspects of agri-tourism,” said Williams. “It’s very complex and the temptation — from my perspective anyway — is trying to be everything to everybody and meanwhile being nothing to anyone. It can happen.

“I think it’s important to really focus efforts so that actual concrete things can happen. I have more questions with regards with ensuring that the things would actually be accomplished here.”

In order to address Williams’ concerns, Manley told council he would invite SDG to appoint one of its members to serve on the EOAFN’s board.

The decision by SDG council on whether to allocate the funding request is set to be taken during 2021 budget deliberations, set to begin in February.

As all countries embark on a decade of action until 2030 to achieve the SDGs, the website aims to bridge Egypt’s local success stories with global and local audiences to provide ready-made roadmaps and blueprints for all countries to follow.

It showcases Egypt’s development through a multilateral lens; illustrating how the Ministry of International Cooperation works to apply the principles of economic diplomacy and foster inclusive partnerships to push Egypt’s development forward in partnership with governments, international development partners, the private sector and civil society.

To measure Egypt’s progress in achieving sustainable development, the website uses various interactive approaches to make it easier for audiences to digest.

First, through an interactive map of Egypt, the website allows the user to track the progress and projects being implemented for each SDG goal; exploring each SDG individually to see the number of projects and partners involved to achieve the targets of the goal.

Second, for each sector, examples of concrete projects through data-driven stories are provided as well; illustrating how Egypt is moving along global trends and development priorities for the next decade in key sectors such as agriculture, transport, energy, health, SMEs and gender equality.

Food security has gained increased significance today, particularly due to the increasing global challenges of delivering sufficient food to populations. In the ‘The Future Breadbasket’ page, the website looks at how Egypt is looking beyond just feeding communities, but also empowering communities and strengthening agriculture value chains into “smart farming” to achieve a circular economy.

In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $100m in agriculture, irrigation, and national supply through the AFD, EBRD, USAID, OPEC Fund for International Development, and bilateral cooperation with Germany.

As transportation is a prerequisite for Egypt’s social and economic development, the ‘Redefining Safe and Better Transportation’ page demonstrates how Egypt is promoting sustainable transport to improve people’s productivity by connecting them to jobs, schools and healthcare, and delivering goods and service to rural and urban communities.

In 2020, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured $1.794bn in development financing in support of the transportation sector, with development partners that include the EIB, AFD, EBRD, China, and Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED).

Inclusive green growth has also become increasingly pertinent. In the ‘Think Green, Act Green’ page, Egypt’s strategy to reinvigorate green growth is reflected in several national strategies and success projects, particularly the Benban solar park. In Egypt, there are 34 projects within the Ministry of International Cooperation’s portfolio answering to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy with a total of $5.95bn, thus making up for 23.2% of the ODA; the highest ODA financing.

According to the annual report by the Ministry of International Cooperation in 2020, the ministry secured development financing agreements worth $9.8bn during the year; $6.7bn for financing sovereign projects, and $3.1bn in support of the private sector.","On the sidelines of the release of the 2020 annual report titled, ‘International Partnerships for Sustainable Development’, Ministry of International Cooperation launched an interactive website to visualise Egypt’s SDG-aligned development story.

“What I’m asking you today is for permission to go ahead and start a process to look at engaging somebody who is qualified and has experience in this area, knows how to navigate their way around education, school boards and where to get the data,” said Simpson. “The big element of this project I see is working with whoever we’re going to hire and scoping what we’re looking for.”

The creation of the document is key in supporting one of the priorities set in the county’s strategic plan adopted by council in November 2019 — educating children in their communities.

During its Monday meeting, SDG council gave chief administrative officer (CAO) Tim Simpson the green light to develop an advocacy document to promote rural education within SDG.

“Then we would form a group to work with this person in order to develop a document,” said Simpson. “I would certainly hope that it would be in place in the spring or early summer. That would give us time to actually use it going forward.

“This is something we’ve been talking about for years now.”

Several councillors, such as Coun. Jamie MacDonald, gave their support to the initiative

“I think this the best idea for us to move forward, having somebody that is not politically involved but that will bring everyone together,” he said. “It’s not a lot of money for the impact it has on our townships.”

“I think that it will bring all the pieces together,” said Coun. Kirsten Gardner. “It’s nice to have the non-political view on this. Hopefully we will be able to get a consultant that not only knows about education, but also funding formulas that the government uses. I think this is the way and hopefully we will find someone good.”

Although Coun. Allan Armstrong voiced his support for the creation of the document, he did tell council he favored hiring a consultant who did not have any ties to local school boards. This, he argued, would be counterintuitive.

“It would be nice to try to consider someone who is not a former educator or former sitting member of one of the school boards,” he said. “With no disrespect to any of them, but that does skirt the fine line of the possibility of repetition in another coat. As we all spend a lot of time in certain locations you do become sort of familiar and forget the fact that we are looking for a bit of innovation here because we’ve all indicated here we’re not necessarily happy with the education system that we have.

“The same old, same old isn’t quite going to work.”

The funding comes from the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF), a multi-stakeholder financial and capacity building platform, that bridges entrepreneurship, social innovation, and blended capital to create sustainable economic and social returns.

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative.

Counties Council supported the move at its December 21st meeting.

The move follows a contentious meeting in November when it appeared that not all areas of the county were working together on a rural education plan.

“I think the best way forward for us and develop an advocacy document that we can really use to promote rural education,” CAO Tim Simpson said adding that it wasn’t just for the region but at provincial conferences and with government officials. “I think this is the way to go.”

Simpson said the goal was to engage a consultant that had experience in education and knows how to navigate around the education system, school boards and get data to assist in creating a plan.

If approved, he said that he would be seeking input from councillors, staff, and public to create a terms of reference for the education consultant and then undergo the Request For Proposal process.

Once selected, a working group would be formed to work with the consultant on a plan with the hopes of completing it by Summer 2021.

Simpson did not say what the composition of a working group would look like or if there would be public input in creating the plan.

He said the timing to undergo this planning process was right.

“Everyone is consumed with COVID-19 right now so it is a good time to do this,” Simpson said. “Hopefully it will dove-tail nicely with getting a real professional document so we can go forward and say ‘look, you’ve told us rural education is important, here’s a way forward in our region that we think you should talk to us about.’”

Counties councillors were supportive of hiring a consultant.

“I think it will bring all the pieces together and it’s nice to have the non-political view on this,” said Councillor Kirsten Gardner (South Dundas). “Hopefully we will be able to get a consultant that not only knows about education but also funding formulas that the government uses. I think this is the way and hopefully we’ll find someone good.”

Councillor Jamie MacDonald (North Glengarry) said that he thought this was the best idea going forward and that having someone who is not politically involved will “bring everybody in together” on a plan.

Councillor Al Armstrong (North Dundas) said he would like to see a consultant who does not necessarily come just from an educator or school board background.

“With no disrespect to any of them, but that does sort of skirt the fine line of repetition in a different coat,” he said. “As we all spend a certain amount of time in certain vocations, you do become a bit familiar and forget the fact that we’re looking for a bit of innovation.”

He added that during the County’s strategic planning process, many councillors voiced their concerns about rural education in SDG Counties.

“We’ve all indicated we’re not really happy with the education system that we have,” Armstrong said. “One of our main priorities was to change the approach to how we get our youth prepared for life so the same-old, same-old is not going to work.

Councillors unanimously supported the action request and Counties CAO Tim Simpson said that the consultant would be a item for the draft 2021 budget.

362,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-soul,"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Soul’: Going Beyond (and Before) ‘Inside Out’,"Pixar head Pete Docter is back with another increasingly rare throwback to Pixar’s glory days, this time a fanciful exploration of the foundations of personhood and what makes life worth living.

Pete Docter’s Soul is Pixar’s third straight original feature, following Coco and Onward, that is explicitly about death, finality and, in some way, what lies beyond.

The convergence of these three films brings to a head a striking preoccupation with death that began, perhaps, in Toy Story 2, with Woody’s parental anxieties about wearing out (“Toys don’t last forever”) and being literally left on a shelf — a phrase that idiomatically evokes the anxieties of elderly parents of being cast aside and neglected by their grown children. (Underscoring the point is the nightmare image of an apathetic Andy discarding broken Woody, dropping him onto a heap of playing cards that are all the ace of spades, beneath which is a waiting trash can full of broken toy parts sucking him down into oblivion.)

Even more overtly, the incinerator scene in Toy Story 3, with the toys taking one another’s hands, was a wordlessly eloquent expression of solidarity in the face of the inevitable.

Death as a plot point or a part of life is simply a part of storytelling, and it has been part of U.S. feature animation since the days of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi.

Death as a thematic concern — recurring or sustained existential angst in the face of mortality or the permanence of separation from loved ones — is something different, and it has become particularly characteristic of Pixar.

The death of Nemo’s mother, Coral, in the prologue of Finding Nemo is basically a plot point, an inciting incident behind Marlin’s helicopter-parent anxieties. The death of Carl Fredrickson’s wife, Ellie, in the prologue of Up is different. Up is essentially about grief in various forms, both healthy and morbid; about preparing for death.

In a more low-key way, Cars 3 was about growing older and passing the torch to a younger generation — pointedly, a more diverse generation. Then came Coco, Pixar’s first film with a nonwhite cultural setting; and, now, comes Soul, Pixar’s 23rd feature, the studio’s first feature with a Black protagonist and a predominantly Black cast.

It’s the best and worst day in the life of Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), a middle-aged musician teaching middle school to pay the bills while trying to make it as a jazz pianist. In his excitement over getting the gig of his dreams — playing onstage with acclaimed jazz saxophonist Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett) — he takes a careless step and winds up on the path to the Great Beyond.

(Although Joe’s accident occurs less than 10 minutes into the film, it’s the kind of thing I prefer to avoid mentioning if I can — heck, I reviewed Up without mentioning the word “balloons” — but for this review I can’t indulge my most spoiler-averse sensibilities, so caveat lector.)

Joe’s soul — a luminescent, blobbish figure with Joe’s distinguishing fedora and glasses — finds itself on a conveyor belt in an inky blackness, moving toward a vast white glow. (It’s an image overtly reminiscent of the escalator to heaven in the 1946 British classic A Matter of Life and Death.)

As souls approach the shining frontier, they float up off the conveyor belt, losing their visual distinctives and vanishing with a brief buzzing sound that (I hate to say it, but I must) made me think of a bug zapper.

Visually, the image of shining souls drawn to an immense light is far more suggestive of some transcendent higher reality than the eschatology of Coco, in which the skeletal dead, once they are finally forgotten on earth, are wracked with tremors and fade into dust. And it’s significant that where Coco speaks alarmingly of “the final death,” Soul speaks of “the Great Beyond.” Still, that zapping sound nearly ruins it.

Other souls seem content or even excited to go into the light. Joe, though, is obviously anxious not to move on just when he feels the life he wants is finally beginning. In his efforts to go against the flow, he somehow winds up in a third realm, neither Earth nor the Great Beyond, but the Great Before — also known as the “You Seminar” — where preexistent souls are prepared for life on Earth.

Here, Joe finds himself saddled with mentoring a jaded preincarnate soul (voiced by Tina Fey) known simply as “22,” who, despite being mentored by the best — and I mean the best — has never found her “spark” or special passion forming the final component of one’s personality and has no desire to live on Earth.

And here, rather than in some final judgment on the threshold of the Great Beyond, a stunned Joe is confronted with the sum total of a life that he himself can only judge as meaningless.

The director of Inside Out, Up and Monsters, Inc., as well as chief creative officer at Pixar, Docter is the only surviving member of Pixar’s original brain trust who has yet to disappoint creatively. (Lasseter’s biggest creative fail is Cars 2. Andrew Stanton and Brad Bird both stumbled with mediocre live-action sci-fi efforts — respectively, John Carter of Mars and Tomorrowland — before running back to Pixar for lesser sequels to their biggest hits, i.e., Finding Dory and Incredibles 2.)

While it doesn’t quite pack the emotional wallop of Inside Out, Soul is cut from the same creative cloth. Visionary, stylistically inventive, grand in scope and ambition, it’s a true event film in everything except, alas, its small-screen debut on Disney+.

A decade ago, “a Pixar event film” would have been a redundancy, like “an action-packed Jackie Chan movie.” Today, alas, it’s is very nearly synonymous with “a Pixar movie directed by Pete Docter.”

Perhaps that’s giving short shrift to Coco (from Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich), a film with a visual grandeur and world-building panache not unlike Soul.

But Coco — in addition to gutting its ostensible Mexican Catholic milieu with its “final death” business and scrupulously omitting any reference to prayer in connection with Day of the Dead commemoration of loved ones — relied too heavily on two of the most exhausted tropes in family films of the last decade: Junior Knows Best and The Secret Villain.

You could almost say there’s an echo of Junior Knows Best in Soul, if that term can apply to a middle-aged man still facing the disapproval of his mother (Phylicia Rashad), who runs a tailor shop, over his dreams of succeeding in the music world rather than pursuing a safe career with a pension as a music teacher.

But Soul subverts the tropes as much as it relies on them.

Like many Pixar films, it’s an odd-couple road movie and a race against time as Joe has mere hours to resolve his increasingly complicated situation vis-à-vis his corporeal status and his relationship to 22 in order to make his all-important gig with Dorothea Williams. It’s also a Ratatouille-esque tale of pursuing one’s true artistic passion against all odds — except that, ultimately, it’s not, and this is what derails the tropishness of the film’s other tropes.

An important scene takes place, fittingly, at the local barbershop, where Joe has an illuminating exchange of sorts with a bushy-bearded, massively built barber named Dez, whom Joe describes as “born to cut hair.”

The conversation reveals unexpected sides of all participants, in the process hinting that Joe may have almost as much to learn about life as 22. Soul is the most persuasive statement of an idea that Pixar has been noodling since Monsters University: the idea that a life that doesn’t go the way you dreamed can still be worth living.

Even more boldly than Inside Out — which brought us into a metaphorical visualization of a child’s inner world, including a formally inventive excursion into abstract thinking — Soul presses Pixar animation to the limit in imagining a world of metaphor beyond corporeality.

Drawing inspiration from the overtly flat, linear animation style of 1960s Disney shorts — not unlike Fantasia 2000’s Rhapsody in Blue sequence and Pixar’s own “Day & Night” short — Soul whips up a friendly world overseen by cheery, ontologically ambiguous counselors who are all called “Jerry” (voices include Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade and Wes Studi) whose look is part Picasso and part UPA short.

There’s also a bureaucratic, bean-counting (or soul-counting) antagonist — not quite a Jerry but a Terry, voiced by Maori actress Rachel House in a variation on her role in Taika Waititi’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople — who might also remind viewers a bit of Roz in Docter’s Monsters Inc., but without the surprise reveal.

The use of line, geometry, color and black and white in these sequences is formally groundbreaking in a way Pixar hasn’t been in years.

Oddly, like Coco, Soul kept reminding me of a Pixar classic that is not about life and death: Ratatouille. Among points of contact here are colorful visual abstractions of nonvisual sense experiences (much better here than in Ratatouille) and the slapstick of one mind attempting to remote-control another person’s body (very funny in both).

I was also reminded of Up as Soul takes us to a fourth realm: the “zone,” the realm “between the physical and the spiritual,” where creativity takes you when you’re “in the zone.” Those “in the zone” float above a perilous sea of dark sand in which they may become ensnared, becoming “lost souls” mired in obsession. Somewhere among those “lost souls,” surely, Up’s Charles Muntz wandered for decades. (And, perhaps, Syndrome as well, since we see the devastating potential of thoughtless or callous words from one we look up to as a mentor.)

Soul has the sharpest Pixar screenplay in years, with a screwball vibe and consistently witty use of cutaway gags. So much of it works at such a high level.

What keeps it from achieving greatness?

Partly, I think, it’s the same tendency for schematization and rationalization that Docter brought to the inner world of Inside Out, where a child has exactly five emotions, five core memories and five islands of personality; where Riley’s subconscious fears are rational things like Grandma’s vacuum and Jangles the Clown, etc.

Souls in the You Seminar each get a little badge with so many slots, and personality traits are assigned like stickers. Then there’s one special slot for your “spark,” your special passion. No one gets to Earth without a spark, and, apparently, no one gets more than one. This is too neat, especially given the movie’s big idea.

We see how personalities are formed, but where do souls come from in the first place? Soul takes us to the very frontier of the Great Beyond, but can’t manage even a whisper of real spirituality or religious curiosity.

In a heartfelt conversation with his mother, Joe mentions church as the one context in which she appreciated his music. I appreciate that the Black church, which, like the barbershop, is an important landmark in Black culture and community, is at least referenced. And I appreciate that Joe, finding himself in a world beyond corporality, wonders aloud whether he is in heaven or “h-e-double-hockey-sticks.”

Yet is there no moment in Joe’s story where it would make sense for him to offer a prayer, a whispered plea, to God or the universe or whatever power is behind the Jerries?

Then there’s Joe’s early judgment that his life was meaningless, and the lack of closure at the end, which on one level I get is the point, but on another level … well, look.

Joe’s onetime student Curly (Questlove), who gets him his dream gig, tells him that Joe’s class was the only reason he went to school. Later, Joe plays a role, sort of, helping another gifted student on the brink of quitting decide that she really does care about music.

I’m not saying I wanted Joe to have an epiphany that he’s a middle-school teacher after all. But I wanted him to come full circle at least in realizing that, like Dez the barber, he hasn’t been wasting his life teaching middle school.

Caveat Spectator: Treatment of death with brief peril and mildly unsettling images; mild rude humor; fantasy depiction of spiritual realities, including preexistence of souls. Kids and up.","Then came Coco, Pixar’s first film with a nonwhite cultural setting; and, now, comes Soul, Pixar’s 23rd feature, the studio’s first feature with a Black protagonist and a predominantly Black cast.

364,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-wonder-woman-1984,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Wonder Woman 1984’,"Gal Gadot is back starring in the sequel to the 2017 movie currently in theatres just in time for Christmas.

Wonder Woman 1984 is bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don’t have the nerve to be.

In its fairytale tone, 1980s setting, and moral earnestness, it reminded me of Superman II, and in other ways it reminded me of Batman Returns. Nobody involved got the memo that comic-book movies in the shared-universe era of Marvel and DC films must be grounded in irony or cynicism or both.

Indeed, WW84—the only title seen onscreen—barely acknowledges that it’s meant to be part of a shared universe.

Remember that WWI-era photograph of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor that Bruce Wayne dug up in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and sent to Diana Prince by way of connecting with a mystery super-woman who might be needed again? (If you don’t remember? “WW84 is agreeably diverting” might be all you need to know.)

That bit of detective work kind of suggests that Diana (Gal Gadot) has been keeping a low profile for the past century, right? I’m not going to say that WW84 entirely forgets that, but I’m not saying it’s real concerned about it either.

After a prologue flashback to Diana’s native Themyscira — in which eager young Diana (played again by Lilly Aspell, now 13) learns a hard lesson from her aunt, Robin Wright’s stern General Antiope, about taking shortcuts and cheating truth — we catch up with Diana, nearly 70 years after her WWI exploits, working at the Smithsonian in antiquities and doing occasional superheroics. (Without quite staying out of the news, she presumably doesn’t leave a lot of photo or video evidence for Bruce Wayne to overlook.)

It’s a good thing, I guess, that Wonder Woman isn’t much more than a rumor or an urban legend, because Diana Prince isn’t much of a secret identity. Glamorous, confident, physically capable, Diana makes no effort to hide behind a façade of Clark Kent timorousness or Don Diego foppish decadence. She doesn’t even wear Lynda Carter glasses like she did in 1918.

It’s not hard to see why vulnerable, accident-prone Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), a new hire whose areas of expertise include gems, is so taken with Diana that, when the notion of having a wish granted is brought up, her first thought is to be — what else? — like Diana.

What do you wish for when you are Diana? Obviously, someone to share it all with. And not just someone, but Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who died heroically at the end of Wonder Woman.

The granting of wishes is also very much on the mind of a self-promoting would-be oil magnate and wealth guru named Maxwell Lord (The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal), whose TV ads blend Norman Vincent Peale-esque positive thinking and Kevin Trudeau-ish pyramid-scheme hucksterism. He’s part Gordon Gekko, part Gene Hackman Lex Luthor.

WW84 gracefully dovetails these characters’ comic-book destinies and desires, along with a DC Comics MacGuffin called the Dreamstone (which may put viewers in mind of Marvel’s Infinity Stones, though as with most DC/Marvel convergences DC got there first), into an elegantly simple plot that gives us two classic Wonder Woman villains — along with a global crisis of nearly Infinity War proportions.

Like the big comic-book movies of the 20th century — particularly the Tim Burton Batman films — the villains are more interesting than the hero.

Wiig brings pathos and sweetness to the improbably named Barbara Minerva, who is both awed by Diana and also can’t help resenting her perfection a bit. Then Barbara’s life turns a corner, and her pleasure at being noticed by men and flirted with by the likes of Max Lord is palpable.

As she and Diana find themselves on equal footing, the awe falls away and the resentment comes to the fore. At the same time, Barbara finds her empathy (for example, her solicitude for a homeless man for whom she regularly buys food) slipping away.

As Max, Pascal is simultaneously larger than life and smaller than he seems; you can feel him willing himself to be the titan of wealth and power he presents himself as, but hasn’t quite managed to become.

If some viewers are reminded at times of another self-promoting, womanizing figure of that era whose success has allegedly been less than represented, it’s worth noting that WW84 humanizes Max, whose deepest motivation is to make his young son Alistair (Lucian Perez) proud of him.

Ultimately, WW84 is as goodhearted toward all as its heroine, which is both its strength and its weakness.

Gadot’s Wonder Woman remains, like Christopher Reeve’s Superman, an attractively aspirational hero, a vanishing rarity in contemporary comic-book cinema. Yet there was a tension and pathos to the character of Superman, who as Clark Kent was as invisible to Lois Lane as Barbara was to men before turning that corner.

The pathos of Superman was also connected to the loss of the alien homeworld he never knew and the instigating death of his foster father, Jonathan Kent, whose salt-of-the-earth Kansas values inform Superman’s Boy-Scout character.

Wonder Woman, as appealing as she is, has none of that. It’s true that she lost Antiope to a German bullet in 1918, but Themyscira is still very much there and her mother Hippolyta is still queen.

There’s no real secret-identity duality to struggle with, and Diana’s one emotional attachment in a man’s world, to Steve Trevor, is complicated only by the fact that he’s dead. Until, you know, he isn’t? And then emotional complications do arise, and Diana finds herself facing a moral dilemma like the one Barbara faces.

Steve aside, Diana’s emotional isolation and uncomplicated perfection threatens to make her boring, a bit like Marvel’s Thor circa The Dark World — a much less perfect character, to be sure, but also a bit like Superman without the tragedy and pathos.

In the last half-hour of its 2½-hour run time, WW84 bogs down with overextended, overwrought conflict and a rushed attempt to do justice to Barbara’s ultimate transformation into Wonder Woman’s most iconic villain — a move that should have been deferred to another movie.

Add Cheetah to a long list of perennial comic-book antagonists, from Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy (Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom) to the Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan versions of the Joker, who became “one and done” villains of the week on the big screen.

I still enjoyed WW84, partly for the appealing leads and partly for the morally earnest fairytale storytelling. I wish comic-book movies tried more to be like this, and less like Avengers: Infinity War or Thor: Ragnarok or Justice League.

Caveat Spectator: Action violence; brief sensuality and implied nonmarital sex; brief bad language, including an instance of profanity. Teens and up.","Wonder Woman 1984 is bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don’t have the nerve to be.
And not just someone, but Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who died heroically at the end of Wonder Woman.

It’s wasn’t quite Christmas, but SDG received quite the generous gift on Dec. 21 — an 84-acre forest, courtesy of Dr. John Macaulay.

The news of the donation was made to council through a formal letter of intent sent from Macaulay. In it, the man wrote he has owned and managed the parcel of land — located off of Robertson Road in Martintown — for about 50 years.

After my death, it is likely that the land would be deforested and the remarkable biological diversity of the land would be lost.”

The donation would be made through the Canada Ecological Gifts Program and as such, the county would have very little financial obligation relative to the value of the donation.

Article content An architectural and engineering design looking into the feasibility of accommodating new office space within the Warden’s House will cost up to $50,000. In its report asking to proceed with the work, administration said the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the need for additional office space. Although council approved the request from administration to move to the design phase, several members had harsh words for the aging building — some of them categorizing it as a money pit. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG council weary of investing in Warden's House Back to video EVB Engineering was initially retained in order to provide a structural review of the building. It determined that the Warden’s House does not meet the Ontario Building Code’s strength requirement for office space. According to rough estimates by EVB Engineering, upgrading the building for office space use could end up costing upwards of $400,000 — $300,000 in upgrades and $100,000 to create a corridor link between the current office space and the Warden’s House.

Article content The Warden’s House sits adjacent and attached to the former jail, part of the SDG administration building at Water and Pitt streets in Cornwall. SDG has spent money renovating and restoring the building’s exterior over the past several years, which is now brown-brick construction. The work done in the past however, did not address the improvements needed to use it as office space. “I don’t disagree with the thinking of using this office space, but my read of the documents leads me to believe that it could end up being scary,” said Coun. Steven Byvelds. “There are some preliminary numbers in the report that point to $450,000 and that’s just the big ball park numbers. But when you start peeling layers on these old buildings, it can become a challenge. “I guess the risk for the county is that we spend this $50,000 and it’s through funding, but then we might get less funding for the remaining $400,000.” “I don’t disagree with that stance,” answered Michael Jan, manager of infrastructure. “The Warden’s House could have designated substances that could be very costly to remove. This funding would give us a design that we could potentially shelve, at no cost to ourselves, for a future fit up when we deem the time is right.” County treasurer Rebecca Russell told council SDG could have access to $100,000 through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP). This stream of funding was established in order to build or renovate health and safety-related projects in long-term care, education, and municipalities to address critical local infrastructure needs.

Article content “That $100,000 can be used for capital projects in relation to COVID,” said Russell. “Our intention is to apply for that funding.” Russell also said SDG had also recently received $353,000 through the second phase of the Safe Restart Agreement which, although can’t be used for capital, can be used in order to cover operating deficits. “I think we need a turnkey price on this before we make a decision,” said Coun. Jim Wert. “In the farm world, sometimes we talk about holes that have no bottoms. I would hate for us to go too far down the road on that.” Byvelds compared investing in the building as putting lipstick on a pig. “Now we know that that building is severely deficient in a lot of areas,” he said. “You could end up with a study that tells you that you need to shut that building down until you rehabilitate it and then what are you going to do? “Sometimes you’re better off knocking it down and building something new later on.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

In normal times, the two schools would have been honoured during a yearly awards celebration evening hosted in May. Due to COVID-19 however, the award was presented in person to officials of both schools.

“We cannot thank our students, our staff and our communities enough for the support they provided,” UCDSB acting superintendent of schools Marsha McNair said during the school board’s Nov. 25 meeting. “Both of these schools have had their names on the plaque a number of times.

Good performance was recorded for all 17 goals, he said today at the virtual launch of the “SDG Indicators, Malaysia, 2019” report — the second report of the country’s SDG indicators published by the Department of Statistics Malaysia.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals based on five focus areas, namely people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The goals are measured according to 247 indicators set at the global level in 2019.

On indicator assessment, Mustapa said for Malaysia, 128 indicators or 52 percent were available while 73 indicators or 29 percent needed to be developed.

“A total of 13 percent or 31 indicators are not available while 15 indicators or six percent are not relevant to Malaysia,” he said.

Mustapa said the national SDG progress status was also measured based on the performance of 108 statistical indicators.

Among aspects that showed positive progress was under the people focus area, with the overall incidence of poverty improving to 5.6 percent (405,441 households) in 2019 from 7.6 percent (525,743 households) in 2016, he said.

Meanwhile, the prosperity focus area showed the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at constant prices grew 3.9 percent in 2019 compared with 3.6 percent in 2018.

“In line with the growth in the digital economy especially in the new normal following Covid-19, the percentage of individuals using the Internet has risen 3.0 percentage points to 84.2 percent in 2019 from 81.2 percent in the preceding year.

“For the Internet usage in the cities and rural areas, they increased 2.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively,” he said.

He added that all elements comprising the five focus areas would be continued in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) after having been incorporated into the country’s developmental policies such as the 11th Malaysia Plan and Shared Prosperity Vision 2030

“In fact, a new approach will be taken under 12MP to deal with poverty through a targeted programme based on local needs across all races.

“This is because the poverty issues differ according to demographics and current situations. The way to handle it must suit the local conditions,” he explained.

According to him, the SDG implementation requires commitment from all quarters to continue the people development agenda.

“Hence the role played by the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia on SDG (APPGM-SDG) is very critical to assist in achieving the Agenda 2030 goals.

“The group, which was established following the Dewan Rakyat approval on Oct 19, 2019, comprises 10 Members of Parliament including me,” he said.

Mustapa said APPGM-SDG was involved in SDG at the Parliamentary level by conducting local issue mapping activities and recommending solution ideas.

In the first phase, the group made field visits to 10 parliamentary constituencies in four states.

Next year, he said, APPGM-SDG would do the same programme in 20 parliamentary areas, especially in states that were not visited in 2020.

“The implementation of SDG goals is a continuation from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended in 2015.
