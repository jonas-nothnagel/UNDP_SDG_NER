For example, forests are critical for climate change mitigation and for sustaining global biodiversity; they provide timber and non-timber forest products as well as pollination services that are critical for sustaining agricultural production. Forests can be directly or indirectly linked to each of the SDGs and the future of the world’s forests is critical for sustainable development at all scales, from global to local.

Little attention, however, has yet focused on how efforts towards achieving the SDGs will impact forests and forest-related livelihoods, and how these impacts may, in turn, enhance or undermine the contributions of forests to climate and development. Understanding the potential impacts of SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development as well as the related trade-offs and synergies is crucial for the efforts undertaken to reach these goals. It is especially important for reducing potential negative impacts and to leverage opportunities to create synergies that will ultimately determine whether comprehensive progress towards the SDGs will be made.

The book Sustainable Development Goals: Their Impacts on Forests and People by IUFRO WFSE (International Union of Forest Research Organizations’ special project World Forest, Society and Environment) provides a comprehensive assessment of potential and anticipated impacts of efforts towards attaining the different SDGs on forests and forest-related livelihoods and development. The development of this book involved 120 scientists and experts from 60 different universities and research and development organizations as well as 38 scientists who acted as peer reviewers of the 17 SDG chapters.

This book discusses the conditions that influence how SDGs are implemented and prioritized, and provides a systematic, multidisciplinary global assessment of interlinkages among the SDGs and their targets, increasing understanding of potential synergies and unavoidable trade-offs between goals from the point of view of forests and people.

The SDGs include partially conflicting visions for forests and people, making it necessary to consider trade-offs and to set priorities. National circumstances and development priorities influence how the SDGs are prioritized and how they are included in national strategies and policies. Measures taken to implement the SDGs vary according to economic prosperity, political stability, social cohesion, level of technological development and policy, institutional and social frameworks as well as geographic features and the natural resource base. The extent and condition of forest resources and the role of forests in industrial development and for livelihoods largely determine the relative importance given to forests in relation to other land uses. Social and cultural perspectives also play a key role, as do the values and interests of different actors in society, and their representation and voice pertaining to forest related decision making. These conditions greatly influence how synergies can be leveraged and unavoidable trade-offs mitigated.

There is large potential for synergies among the SDGs and their targets and the implementation of several SDGs can be beneficial for both forests and people. For example, SDG 13 (Climate action) should lead to more sustainable forest management and conservation as well as forest restoration. Improved resource efficiency, sustainable production and new technologies under SDG 12 (Sustainable production and consumption) and increased agricultural productivity for reaching food security (SDG 2) can also reduce pressures on forests. The interlinkage between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and forests relates to water availability and water quality. Generally forests have a positive impact on water quality. This favors maintaining forest cover and increasing cover in protected or degraded catchments. A focus on water efficiency, however, may restrict the establishment of new forest plantations in semi-arid areas.

For sustaining and enhancing forests’ contributions to achieving SDGs, it is also important to focus attention on participatory governance, the regulatory framework, the accountability and transparency of institutions, access to markets and finances, education and enhancing social capital. These issues have been found to contribute to an enabling environment for inclusive forest management and conservation with associated livelihood benefits. All these issues are also included in the SDGs and advancing towards them will support sustainable forest-related development and livelihoods.

On the other hand, efforts to advance towards some SDGs can affect land use directly and are thus expected to directly impact forests and pose serious threats to forests and the people living in or near them. For example, SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) may encourage infrastructure development and other activities which lead to forest loss. The expansion of agricultural crops for food or energy (SDG 2 Food security and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy) is also likely to compete with forests in many locations.

It is crucially important that the potential trade-offs implicit in the SDGs with respect to forests and other land uses are recognized, understood and made transparent to societies, and that the forest–people interconnectedness is fully accounted for in societal and policy decisions. This must include thinking across different scales and generations. When the implementation of SDGs and targets may have negative outcomes on forests and people alternative options that contribute to social development and forest conservation should be developed, or measures should be taken to reduce negative outcomes, for example by limiting infrastructure development to protect valuable biodiversity, other environmental values and indigenous people’s way of life.

In view of the diversity of forest-related societal needs, viewpoints, cultural values and interests different groups should have access to the SDG-related decision-making and implementation processes at all levels and these processes should be perceived by everyone as transparent, fair and effective. It is vitally important that all the relevant stakeholders, especially women, indigenous peoples and marginalized groups, are involved in the design and implementation of the SDGs.

Capturing the potential of forests and trees for sustainable development requires that they are integrated in efforts and measures undertaken to reach the SDGs and specific targets. In this process harnessing opportunities for beneficial synergies and mitigating trade-offs among the SDGs and their targets is of utmost importance. The implementation of the SDGs and associated goals and targets will also require continuous learning and adaptation of implementation strategies and approaches, but possibly also targets, taking into consideration observed outcomes.

By 2060, the global building floor area is expected to double. Emerging and developing economies in warm and tropical climates will experience the biggest increase.

Already today, the construction and operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sector consumes over a third of global final energy. Energy demand from the building sector is expected to grow by another 50% by 2050. Space cooling is a key driver of this demand – energy needs for space cooling are expected to triple.

Buildings cause greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both when they are built, and over their long lifetime of 30 to 80 years. Our modern way of constructing is mostly based on concrete, using standard blueprints regardless of the climate. This leads to high energy bills for those who can afford it, and economic and health risks for those who cannot.

Future-proofing Buildings Can Drive SDGs 1, 7, 11

Energy-efficient buildings are not rocket science. Improvements in the building’s outer structure and appliances can achieve substantial energy savings compared to standard buildings. Measures to future-proof buildings can range from “low-tech,” such as painting roofs in light colors and ensuring natural shade, to digital solutions for building design and management. Additional macro-economic benefits include energy security, job creation and health. And from a business perspective future proofed buildings have a lower lifetime cost and higher asset values.

Climate action in buildings and construction is among the most cost-effective measures. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that realizing the potential of sustainable buildings will save USD 1.1 trillion by 2050.

Nevertheless, this transition requires a shift in investment. USD 4.5 trillion are invested into real estate every year. To channel this investment towards energy efficiency, we need to influence it from two directions: ambitious policy and regulation serving as a “stick,” and financing as a “carrot.”

The Programme for Energy Efficiency in Buildings (PEEB), a French-German initiative, works with its first five partner countries – Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Vietnam – to transform the building sector. PEEB combines financing energy efficiency in large-scale projects with technical assistance through policy advice. PEEB mobilizes innovative financing solutions for large building projects. For example, in Morocco PEEB supports the government in mobilising EUR 20 million in climate financing for a residential housing programme. A green loan programme for young families is in the making in Vietnam. The programme also works with partners to make policies and standards more ambitious and effective, through better enforcement of existing green building codes or setting standards for sectors like hotels or hospitals.

All of these advancements are helping to achieve 2030 Agenda targets on energy, housing and poverty.

Climate Action in the Building Sector is Gaining Momentum

Another international agreement – the Paris Agreement on climate change – also hangs in the balance; its goals will not be achieved without a climate focus for buildings in the new decade. A rapid decarbonization needs to happen in the building sector, driven by international and national actors.

In 2019, action on buildings took center stage. Led by the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), buildings featured prominently at the climate change conference COP25 in Madrid, with topics ranging from zero carbon buildings to circular economy approaches in the buildings sector. The Global Status Report on Buildings and Construction confirmed the urgent need for action in the building sector. At the Climate Action Summit convened by the United Nations in September 2019, the Net Zero Carbon initiative was launched to leverage the leadership of governments, industry and civil society to commit to ambitious targets and mobilize funding. The Cool Coalition and SEforALL’s Cooling for All initiative have incorporated buildings as a key element of their strategies.

As we head into 2020, buildings are high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has named moving towards zero carbon buildings as one of its four top priorities for tackling climate change. The report by the UK government on energy transitions features buildings as a key sector. The lead-up to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 26) in 2020 has an unprecedented opportunity to raise the ambition of all actors to make our buildings future-proof and wake this sleeping giant.

The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).

The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.

According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.

The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.

However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.

The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:

equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;

ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;

update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;

strengthen regional cooperation; and

promote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.

The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities.

His announcements included the co-facilitators he has appointed for several processes: preparations for the Biodiversity Summit, preparations for the Second Ocean Conference, preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary, and the intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

In a significant improvement over the inaugural version, 68 indicators have been directly borrowed from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework (NIF) while another 20 are modified versions of NIF indicators and 12 have been developed by NITI Aayog in consultation with Union ministries. This alignment of indicators will pave the way for better coordination among government agencies for tracking India’s performance on SDGs.

Another noteworthy improvement is the broader coverage of goals, targets and indicators. While in the first edition, Goals 12, 13 and 14 were not included, only Goal 17 has been left out of the second round for ranking sub-national governments due to the absence of any relevant indicators in the NIF. Additionally, while SDGII 2018 covered 39 targets and 62 indicators, SDGII 2019 spans 54 targets and 100 indicators.

Scores improve

So, how are we faring in our quest for achieving the SDGs? Overall, India’s score has improved from 57 to 60, with notable progress on SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9 and 11. While, a decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio has contributed to our improved performance in the area of ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, ramping up toilet coverage under Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan has raised the country’s score on ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’.

The commendable performance on Goal 7 is due to expanded access to clean cooking fuel and the government’s massive electrification drive. Similarly, on Goal 9, the progress can be attributed largely to a significant improvement in rural road connectivity and increased mobile phone penetration. Our performance on Goal 11 has been boosted by better access to housing through the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana as well as more widespread adoption of door-to-door waste collection and processing.

While this progress is heartening, there are certain indicators where focussed attention is required. For instance, India’s tuberculosis notification rate is still high, thus limiting our overall progress on Goal 3. Further, there are some SDGs on which the whole country needs to step up its performance considerably, namely those pertaining to poverty, hunger, gender and climate action.

Limitations exist

While SDGII 2019 is a much-improved version, an exercise of this nature is not without its limitations, especially because of the gaps in data availability. In subsequent versions of the Index continued efforts need to be made to include indicators that capture the full extent of the SDGs. For instance, if the target is to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, we need to go beyond measuring spousal violence and sexual crimes against children. Similarly, SDG 3 must capture at least one indicator that reflects the country’s progress on tackling non-communicable diseases.

Crucially, concerted efforts need to be made to generate data disaggregated by gender, age and socio-economic status to truly get a sense of how we are faring in terms of fulfilling the overarching SDG mantra of ‘leaving no one behind’.

Finally, future SDG Index reports could perhaps go a step further by including good practices that enable high-performing States/UTs to make progress on each of the goals, thus providing useful lessons for those lagging behind.

India is the only country to publicly rank its sub-national governments on SDGs. While the exercise needs strengthening in terms of scope and quality on an ongoing basis, it is a valuable effort that needs to be persisted with as it helps to bring the SDG agenda into the limelight at the national level as well facilitates its localisation at the level of States and UTs.

The QSP – a funding mechanism under the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) – concluded its operations in December 2019.

In 2006, the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) established the QSP to help countries produce and use chemicals in ways that minimize adverse impacts on the environment and human health through projects in a range of sectors, including agriculture, environment, health, industry and labor. The Programme reports that its project helped raise awareness and build institutional capacity for the sound management of chemicals at the national level, as well as advance mainstreaming and multi-sectoral approaches.

During its tenure, the Programme enabled the implementation of 184 projects in 108 countries, including 54 least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS). It mobilized a total of USD 47.9 million through its Trust Fund.

QSP projects addressed: chemicals accident preparedness and poison centers; implementation of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions and the Minamata Convention on Mercury; collection and systems for sharing, including pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs) and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS); pesticides and agriculture; national chemicals profiles; and mainstreaming development plans and processes.

Among its country-specific initiatives, in Sri Lanka the QSP helped national experts, academics and 600 employees from the rubber, textile and tourism industries manage chemicals through training manuals, sector guidelines and an online course. The project titled ‘Empowering Sri Lanka’s vital industries to manage chemicals the SMART way‘ strengthened the capacity of institutions and universities and enhanced efficiency and environmental performance of local industries.

In Lesotho, the QSP helped improve food security through the proper use of herbicides and pesticides, including through training sessions on safe use for more than 200 farmers, district staff, traders, environment officers and machinery operators, among others.

Other projects addressed:

Protecting human health and the environment from mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Cambodia and the Philippines;

Strengthening national capacities for the sound management of priority carcinogenic chemicals in Bhutan;

Building capacities and raising awareness on integrated non-chemical control of mosquitoes in Albania;

Capacity building for strengthening the management of heavy metals in Barbados;

Strengthening capacities in Burkina Faso for national SAICM implementation and the promotion of synergies among the BRS Conventions; and

Developing an integrated national programme for the sound management of chemicals and supporting capacity building on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) in Benin.

SAICM is a global multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder, voluntary policy framework aimed at minimizing significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. A new overarching approach for SAICM and the sound management of chemicals and waste beyond 2020 is currently under negotiation through an intersessional process that is expected to conclude at ICCM5.

The framework “builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020” and aims to bring about a “transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled.”

The ‘Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’ requested at its first meeting that a zero draft text of the global biodiversity framework be provided six weeks prior to its second meeting, which will be held 24-28 February in Kunming, China.

Speaking on the zero draft, the Open Working Group Co-chairs, Basile Van Havre and Francis Ogwal, pointed out that they, “tried to create a framework for all, one that sets the stage for an inspirational, ambitious, realistic, and achievable framework.”

The proposed framework, published on 13 January, comprises background information, an introduction, and a draft recommendation for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting. These are followed by two annexes the contain, respectively, the initial draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the consideration of the Working Group, and elements of a draft recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifteenth meeting. The document is complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework and a glossary of terms.

The framework presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and each of these goals has an associated outcome for 2030. The five goals address net loss and ecosystem resilience; reductions in the percentage of species threatened with extinction; the maintenance and enhancement of genetic diversity; the benefits of nature to people; and increasing the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five goals. The 20 targets are presented under the categories of reducing threats to biodiversity; meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming.

The draft includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. It considers elements of guidance on goals, SMART targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss and for achieving transformational change.

At an informal briefing on 19 December 2019, Mohammed recalled that the September 2019 high-level week had “provided a wake-up call” that efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda are not reaching the needed scale to bring about the “deep transformative change” required. The Decade of Action is an opportunity to course-correct, she said, noting that it is a priority for the Secretary-General, with “special amplification around climate action and gender equality.”

Mohammed highlighted three specific needs for the Decade of Action, noting that the plans follow consultations “across the system and with stakeholders from civil society, business, the arts, academia and beyond.” The first need is to rethink the narrative about the connection between the SDGs and the issues that young people care about, and to pursue the right communication strategies. These include harnessing the power of the media, community leaders and local influencers, strengthening engagement with national parliaments, business and local governments, and developing new relationships.

The second area for action during the Decade is to raise ambition. Among the ways to do this, Mohammed highlighted:

Strengthen nationally determined contributions on climate change action (NDCs) at the 2020 session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26) in Glasgow, UK;

Demonstrate commitment and increased ambition in the context of international meetings in 2020 on gender equality, biodiversity, the ocean and sustainable transport;

Review national development plans and financing frameworks to ensure the needed magnitude of change; and

Translate existing SDG engagement by businesses, cities, and the finance community into clear and measurable action.

Mohammed also noted the upcoming reviews of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), saying the reviews could yield a “new wave of voluntary national reviews” (VNRs). A new approach to the VNRs, she indicated, could showcase the milestones governments will pursue between now and 2030.

Finally, the Deputy Secretary-General underlined the need for solutions that deliver concrete results for those most in need, in particular solutions that catalyze progress on multiple SDGs at the same time. She said the Decade of Action will prioritize such solutions. Some examples are: improving renewable energy-related battery technology; increasing access to finance for climate-vulnerable countries; removing fossil fuel subsidies; and creating a new consensus on sustainable food. Mohammed said the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) will provide inspiration for these solutions through its “entry points” for transformative change. The Decade of Action also will build on the UN Secretary-General’s Strategy on Financing the 2030 Agenda, she said.

On the SDG moment, Mohammed reminded participants that the political declaration of the SDG Summit calls for an SDG moment to take place annually during the high-level week of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), each September until 2030. She said the Moment will highlight successes and identify where more action is needed. It is expected to:

Provide a snapshot of what is and is not working, where more action is needed, how to do so. This component will draw on data, analytics, innovation and technology.

Showcase the best SDG solutions that have been adopted by governments and other stakeholders.

Keep SDGs at top of political agenda, to complement the engagement and analysis conducted by the annual sessions of the HLPF.

The first SDG moment will take place in September 2020, either in conjunction with the high-level meeting to mark the UN’s 75th anniversary, on 21 September, or on the opening day of the UNGA’s general debate for the 75th session, on 22 September.

The Global Compact on Refugees was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 2018.

More than 3,000 representatives of governments, the UN system, civil society and the private sector as well as 70 refugees participated in the Forum, which convened from 17-18 December 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was organized by the governments of Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan and Turkey, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was co-hosted by the government of Switzerland.

Delivering opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recalled that during his experiences as the High Commissioner for Refugees he saw “a fundamental human trait: the will to kindness” and the impulse to help a person in trauma. He said he also learned that generosity is not always proportional to wealth, and “the world owes all countries and communities that welcome large numbers of refugees a debt of gratitude” as well as the shouldering of that responsibility. He said the UN will advocate for including refugees in regional frameworks and national development plans and reviews, as well as in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.

The Forum reported the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced, including through employment, legal support and education.

UNHCR Filippo Grandi linked the Forum to the SDGs’ goal of leaving no one behind. He said refugee situations only become crises through short-term thinking, failing to work together across sectors, and neglecting the communities where refugees arrive.

The Forum had six areas of focus: burden and responsibility sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; solutions; and protection capacity. Each area was supported by a coalition of co-sponsors who formed alliances of support and advocacy, and identified opportunities for making pledges and contributions. More than 30 “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” consultations took place at the country and regional levels to identify possible pledges and contributions.

The Forum’s official summary reports that around 770 pledges and contributions were submitted during the event by a broad range of actors, including governments, humanitarian actors, private sector entities, educational institutions and international organizations. This composition of supporters represents “a considerable increase” in the level of engagement of many states and organizations in the Global Compact’s implementation. Per the summary, more than 350 pledges relate to improving laws and policies, such as pledges to:

continue to receive and admit refugees;

adopt “out of camp” policies and strengthen asylum systems;

allow refugees and asylum seekers to work and access financial services; and

include refugees in countries’ national development planning and national systems for education and health.

The summary also notes a commitment “to further and deeper engagement” by development actors and multilateral development banks, expressed through a range of financing and policy instruments, with almost 250 pledges containing “some form of financial component.” An initial analysis presented in the Forum’s summary indicates: USD 2.2 billion pledged by the World Bank Group, through a dedicated funding and financing window for refugees and host communities, in addition to a separate window of USD 2.5 billion aimed at supporting private sector investment in creating jobs in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence; USD 1 billion committed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); and over USD 2 billion in financial commitments by “a broad range of States and other stakeholders.”

The Global Refugee Forum also registered more than 200 pledges and contributions from the private sector, representing “the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced.” These commitments include more than USD 250 million in funding, the direct employment of more than 15,000 refugees, a joint legal community pledge with NGOs to provide more than 125,000 hours of pro bono legal services per year, and other pledges related to education and training, women’s economic empowerment, connectivity, business development services and innovative financing.

By the Forum’s summary, more than 130 pledges were made towards expanding access to education for refugees, focusing on supporting the inclusion of refugees in national systems.

The good practices, pledges and contributions announced during the Forum are featured on a digital platform launched at the Forum. The Platform will continue to collect and share good practices.

The first Global Refugee Forum also featured the launch of Support Platforms to reinforce three regional refugee responses, namely the MIRPS in Central America and Mexico, the Nairobi Process facilitated by The Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the East and Horn of Africa, and the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. The Support Platforms are situation-specific arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing provided for in the Global Compact on Refugees. Their purpose is to galvanize political commitment, mobilize assistance, facilitate coherent humanitarian and development responses, and support comprehensive policy initiatives.

Other launches at the Forum included the Asylum Capacity Support Group and the Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network, which seek to make the best use of, build upon and expand existing knowledge and expertise on refugee protection, in support of the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees. The UN Development Programme presented its SDG Impact Accelerator (SDGIA), launched with the Government of Turkey, which aims to accelerate entrepreneurs for market-creating innovations that tackle the challenges of refugee populations and host communities in Turkey. Subsequently, SDGIA’s solutions and best practices could be replicated and applied to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

The Forum was preceded by a day of special events dedicated to the refugee cause. It was supported by a social media campaign that emphasized that #EveryoneCounts.

UNHCR has developed a mechanism to track the implementation of pledges and contributions, and the next Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2023. A mid-term review meeting in 2021 also will serve as a tool to assess progress and maintain momentum for implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees.","The first-ever Global Refugee Forum – an opportunity to “rally behind the aspirations of the SDGs of leaving no one behind” – generated hundreds of pledges and contributions towards implementing the Global Compact on Refugees.

10,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iaeg-proposes-36-major-changes-to-sdg-indicator-framework/,"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IAEG Proposes 36 Major Changes to SDG Indicator Framework,"The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted. Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

11,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/2020s-buzzword-is-nature/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: 2020's Buzzword is Nature,"The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending. Relatable, universal, and cross-cutting, Nature will be a dominant and uniting theme for many of the milestone events leading up to the adoption of a new, post-2020 framework for biodiversity in October.

With half of humanity living in urban areas, where biodiversity often comes in the forms of roaches, rats, monkeys, and mosquitoes, any push to save the planet needs a concept everyone can embrace. The messaging this year will be broad and it will be accessible. From slum to skyscraper, Nature is all around. Air to breathe, fresh water and food. A stunning sunset. A vicious storm. Nature envelopes us, and for better or worse, it ‘leaves no one behind.’ Communications will encourage the reconnection of people to Nature, like for instance the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ (IPBES) emphasis on ‘Nature’s Contributions to People.’

Going into 2020, data show that we won’t achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Aichi Targets by their deadline in December. Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May. Last year, the IPBES Global Assessment of the State of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service report, which will serve as the scientific basis of the post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations, informed that approximately a million species are a risk of extinction and that nature continues to decline due to human activities. The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.

Perhaps a wider and softer net – one woven by Mother Nature herself – can help. Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies. This has long been a CBD priority, with the Convention dedicating its 2018 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors – recognizing that these sectors depend on nature’s contributions. Without a doubt, the plight of biodiversity must be universally understood and addressed, if humanity is to solve the ecological crisis. As the 2019 World Economic Forum, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund are saying, it’s time for a “New Deal for Nature.”

Further, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation has demanded an end to siloed development approaches and encouraged a focus on the linkages between the environmental, economic and social aspects of development. No more is biodiversity to be considered in a vacuum – not if it is to be truly integrated into the universally agreed, global development platform. Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework. Nature’s systems, of which biodiversity is a critical component, sustain life on Earth and offer a touchstone for the achievement of all the Goals. Nature is cross-cutting.

The theme for biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity.

When the CBD does convene its COP in October to adopt the post-2020 biodiversity framework, it will do so under the theme of ‘Ecological Civilizations: Building a Shared Future for all Life on Earth.’ Note that the theme for the biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity. Instead it links people (civilizations) to nature (ecology). Ecology is the branch of biology dealing with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. By its theme, the CBD COP won’t just be talking about conserving biodiversity for biodiversity’s sake. It will be talking about the core of humanity – our civilizations – and their relationship to the natural world all around. It is an approach that strikes an additional nail into the coffin of siloed approaches to conservation.

The other major biodiversity-related COP in 2020, that of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in February, will also have ecology at the heart of its theme. For its part, the CMS will present the concept of ‘Ecological Connectivity,’ which it defines as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.” With a concept that links the migration of species to the sustenance of all life on Earth, the CMS is calling for both an Ecological Connectivity stand-alone target as well as integration of the concept into other relevant targets of the new biodiversity framework.’ Will the bigger pictures sync? Can our “ecological civilizations” be “ecologically connected”?

In addition to ecology, nature-based solutions are also likely to feature in the big biodiversity-related and climate meetings this year. These approaches, which offer a linked way to incorporate biodiversity considerations into multidimensional development problems, rose to global attention in 2019. They were stressed in parallel to the Climate Action Summit, especially with regard to forests, as well as at the UN Convention on Desertification COP (UNCCD COP 14) and the High-level Panel on Oceans, during Climate Week. Nature-based solutions have been framed as a way to address multiple priorities at once – for instance mangroves offer protection from climate-related disasters like storm surges, while fostering the biodiversity that supports fisheries (food and employment) and sequestering carbon.

In announcing the theme of the next World Environment Day, which will take place in June 2020 and focus on biodiversity, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, “2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action.” It is likely that nature-based solutions will also receive attention at the forthcoming meetings of the World Conservation Congress, the second UN Ocean Conference, and the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

As a final point of reference for the 2020 word of the year, when world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they will have an opportunity to participate in a ‘Nature Summit.’ The meeting will offer one more step towards achieving the CBD’s long-term (2050) Vision of ‘Living in Harmony with Nature.’

We are all touched by her hand, and for the Biodiversity Super Year, we will see that our hope lies in Nature.","The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending.

Vineet J Mehra

While India is already making rapid strides in the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to engage our nation’s youth in enabling us to meet our sustainable development goals. Sustainability has become one of the most definitive buzzwords of the 21st century and for good reason too — the modern world is currently grappling with the effects of uninhibited patterns of production and consumption. Simply put, even our population is exploding and technology advancing in leaps and bounds, our quality of life is rapidly declining.

India, which stands at the cusp of a new era of development, is at an interesting juncture with regards to its take on sustainability. While our country’s per-capita emissions are amongst the lowest in the world, we are also the third-largest generator of emissions. Further, despite being the third-largest economy in the world, we are also home to the largest number of people living below the international poverty line. Our sheer size and the rapid pace of our growth are the two biggest challenges with regards to our approach to sustainability.

A conscious aspirant

India has taken on a leading role as an aspiring change-maker in tackling climate change and in framing developmental schemes that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals — these goals were adopted in September 2015 and encompass social, environmental and social dimensions of development, including ending all forms of poverty. To this end, efforts have been made to involve all stakeholders – from the public and private sectors — in framing effective policies, implementation strategies and best practices. For instance, in February 2018, a national workshop on capacity development was held with the intent of localising the sustainable development goals. In August 2018, a government and business partnership conclave aimed to sensitise private businesses and industries about sustainable development goals, and to analyse their programme strategies in accordance with these

goals. The NITI Aayog – a policy think-tank by the Government of India focused on sustainable development goals — released the SDG India Index — Baseline Report 2018 in December 2018, to track the progress made by all the states and union territories on the interventions and schemes initiated by the central government.

Up the ante

India is one of the least wasteful economies. The country has been as a key player in shaping the Paris Agreement and has adopted various energy-efficiency measures. Sustainability is also an integral part of Indian culture, its philosophy and its values. Rural communities, which comprise roughly 70 per cent of the country’s population as of 2011, continue to live a simple and frugal lifestyle. As per Greendex, an international report on sustainable living

that measures the way consumers are responding to environmental concerns in their housing, transport, food and goods choices, India occupies a top spot among 18 contenders, which also include China and the US.

India has had one of the most successful campaigns on shunning off single-use plastic and amplifying Swachh Bharat. This has helped in creating awareness from the primary school level, with kids questioning their parents for their right to cleanliness. We need to make more conscious effort to create more sustainable jobs, and embark for children to live their right to a happy childhood. We need to focus on economic sustainability to make all aware that

any form of slavery, trafficking and organ trafficking, bonded labour and sexual slavery though large businesses in volumes of trade but are desperate reasons for lack of sustainable job creation and economic development at a block level of India or Bharat.

However, as the economy continues to develop and grow further, there is a marked shift in socio-economic trends. The country still faces tremendous environmental concerns, especially when it comes to developing sustainable communities. India’s booming population, which is often cited as its most valuable resource, can present considerable challenges of scale in terms of policy implementation, as a July 2019 report released by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The report finds that India has a “long way to go” to achieve its target of public health spending. The country’s primary health infrastructure was also found to be inadequate and there exists a severe dearth of data to track the progress made on achieving the sustainable development goals for health by 2030.

Agents of change

Sustainability, especially in the national context, cannot be targeted in silos and calls for a collaborative, community-based effort. As per estimates, India is likely to have a GDP of USD 4 trillion and a population of 1.5 billion by 2030. This will lead to a corresponding increase in demand for critical resources such as coal and oil, as well as an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Considering that 80 per cent of India of 2030 is yet to be built, we have been presented with a unique opportunity to pursue development while managing our emissions growth, enhancing energy security and creating world-scale clean-technology industries.

As one of the youngest countries in the world — 42 per cent of India’s population is composed of people aged between 15-35 years; in the next 30 years, this figure will reach 55 per cent — our youth must be empowered to create business solutions that are not detrimental to the environment and aligned with government initiatives such as Skill India and Make In India. There also exists an urgent need to create a business environment that emphasises on sustainability as a key driver of innovation. Upskilling of an ever informed workforce is not a necessity but a compulsion. As a growing democracy with a complex and diverse society, we must be focused on creating a cohort that becomes a vibrant, constructive force that can address social issues and create a more just, equitable and

peaceful world. The youth of our nation are no longer passive recipients of services; they must be shaped into agents of change who have the energy, passion and creativity to make a deeper impact on society.

We need to question ourselves and all 193 countries that have signed to deliver the SDG’s to each one of us living with freedom or aspiring to live with freedom and fear on planet earth. We need to hold each of these countries audited for their efforts leading up to 2030.","Vineet J MehraWhile India is already making rapid strides in the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to engage our nation’s youth in enabling us to meet our sustainable development goals.
For instance, in February 2018, a national workshop on capacity development was held with the intent of localising the sustainable development goals.
In August 2018, a government and business partnership conclave aimed to sensitise private businesses and industries about sustainable development goals, and to analyse their programme strategies in accordance with thesegoals.
The report finds that India has a “long way to go” to achieve its target of public health spending.
The country’s primary health infrastructure was also found to be inadequate and there exists a severe dearth of data to track the progress made on achieving the sustainable development goals for health by 2030."

According to a press release by the WEF, “for the first time in the survey’s 10-year outlook, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood are all environmental.” The Global Risks Report informs the WEF’s multi-stakeholder initiatives throughout the year.

The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.

The report frames the global economy as facing increased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.

The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.

The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.

Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.

The World Economic Forum will convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

In a ranking of states released last week by Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog and the United Nations, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially in poverty alleviation and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh sank to the bottom of the list.According to the SDG India Index 2019, India’s composite score improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20 with successes in water and sanitation, power and industry. Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.Kerala retained the top slot while Bihar came out as the worst performer. Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100, where it fully achieves its SDGs. Himachal Pradesh ranked next with 69 due its clean water and sanitation efforts, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among the union territories (UTs), Chandigarh topped at 68 due to its focus on clean water and sanitation and providing quality education.Tamil Nadu also topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.As per the SDG India Index 2019, the composite score for each state/UT is computed by aggregating their performance across the goals, and then by taking the arithmetic mean of individual goal scores. A score of 100 implies that the State/ UT has achieved targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that the particular State/UT is at the bottom of the table. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim have shown maximum improvement, as per the report for second year released by NITI Aayog on Monday. This first such report was released in 2018.The year 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by 193 countries at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The Index has been developed by NITI Aayog in coordination with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute.In 2018 index, only three states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, were placed in the category of front runners – with a score in the range of 65-99. In 2019, five more States joined this league – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Sikkim and Goa, taking the total tally to eight.With regard to poverty reduction, states which have done well include Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim. On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. It is designed to function as a tool for focused policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, and moving towards development action pegged to globally recognizable metrics. The Index also supplements NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts to encourage evidence-based policymaking by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and sharing best practices.The 2019 Index is more robust than the first edition on account of wider coverage of goals, targets, and indicators. It spans 16 out of 17 SDGs with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels. Further, the Index highlights the need for improvements in data collection, reporting and methodology. Partnerships for disaggregating data and developing capacity for real-time monitoring and measuring incremental progress are also being explored.","Kerala’s top rank is attributed to its rapid improvements in health facilities, gender equality and quality education.

The deficit of Sudan’s 2020 budget will be SDG 150 billion ($3.3 billion*), Minister of Finance Ibrahim El Badawi reported on Friday during an interview with Omdurman Radio.

El Badawi also asserted that the expenditures of the former regime in 2017 and 2018 exceeded the state budget by SDG 144 billion ($3.2 billion).

This amount is now a debt owed to the Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS). El Badawi explained that the government and the CBoS agreed that the Ministry of Finance will pay off SDG 25 billion ($0.5 billion) per annum over the next six years.

The total debt is currently SDG 70 billion ($1.5 billion). The 2020 budget has a SDG 80 billion ($1.8 billion) deficit, which is 3.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.

El Badawi said that the entire deficit could be covered if the price of petrol is gradually raised between March and July or August this year, and if the subsidy on diesel is gradually reduced from August onwards for a full year. In that case there will no need to borrow funds from the CBoS, according to El Badawi.

A decision about the subsidies will be taken after a dialogue with the society, the Minister said.

In total, the government will spend SDG 252 billion ($5.6 billion) on subsidies in 2020, which is 36 per cent of the total budget. In 2019, the subsidies amounted to SDG 188 billion ($4.2 billion).

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

Article content This article has been edited to correct the spelling and job title for Cornwall Community Hospital’s vice-president of community programs Christine Penney. Out of the four pillars that make up the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being plan, mental health was given top billing in recognition of its importance in building a healthy and safe community. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Improving mental health for a safer & happier Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Back to video There has been a dramatic shift in thinking about mental health issues over the past several years. There is much more awareness and acceptance that seeking help is normal, where once people feared they would be labelled as crazy. With that normalization, there has been a big push to increase and improve mental health services, a trend the new community well-being plan wants to capitalize on. The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation.

Hospital CEO Jeanette Despatie noted much of what is proposed in the community safety and well-being plan is being implemented by different groups across the region, but these efforts cannot keep up with the demand for mental health services. “There is a need for additional resources to meet the demand. For instance, there is a real need for more psychiatrists, but we know the need to recruit more is not going away any time soon. So it is our responsibility to figure out different ways that we can help deliver services to fill those needs,” said Despatie. Training and education This has been the goal of mental health advocates for many years, and there has been an enormous amount of success in achieving it. But the plan calls for initiatives such as programs for mental health in the farming community, helping communities become dementia friendly, and workshops to help people identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Christine Penney, the hospital’s vice-president of community programs, pointed out the Canadian Mental Health Association is currently doing this in schools.

Article content “We also work with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit around prevention and education, while our mandate is providing treatment,” said Penny. Free counselling The community safety and well-being plan calls for more counselling services that do not cost to the individual. But Despatie argued it would be good to try to expand counselling services, even if they are not completely free, in order to deal with the problem of wait times. “I know the plan is focusing on the free services, but expanding the offerings through our programs would be great, because right now the demand is greatly outstripping the capacity to meet people’s needs in a timely fashion,” she said. Increase availability and access The plan proposes this could be done in several ways, such as having more evening hours so people can seek help after work or school, mobile services for rural communities, and the use of technology for telemedicine. Many of these initiatives already exist in some form or another, organizations including the hospital offer mobile services , and more and more clinics are expanding their evening hours. “There’s always room for increasing evening hours, but it still comes back to the need for more resouces,” said Penney. Penney also noted the hospital is about to embark on a new pilot project using the Zoom teleconferencing platform, which they believe will be particularly popular with youth and rural residents who need to speak with a counsellor.

Article content More support groups There are plenty of support groups for mental health issues such as alcohol and substance abuse, but the community safety and well-being plan wants to see more aimed at problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, postpartum depression, and youth. It also advocates for mentorship programs and programs to teach coping skills. Fortunately, a new post-partum depression clinic has just opened in Cornwall at the Cotton Mills, under the guidance of a local doctor. “They’re just about to get their first group going,” said Penney. Support for caregivers People who take care of their loved ones with mental illnesses are often the unsung heroes of the health-care system. But taking care of someone 24-7 is exhausting, and the plan calls for more support to help make thing easier. Just a few months ago, the hospital opened its new caregiver centre at its facility. “We have peer support from other caregivers, and we put a special emphasis on addiction and mental health because we know those caregivers have a specific set of stressors. So the idea is you can come in between noon and 4 p.m. and talk to someone who will give you emotional support, there is also plenty of resources on things like navigating the system,” said Penney. Prevention and intervention The focus of these programs would be to help people learn life skills, stress management and healthy childhood development. For instance, the plan calls for the creation of wellness groups to help people develop hobbies, self-worth and confidence. It also proposes workshops to teach healthy habits such as cooking exercise, gardening, work/life balance, and so on.

Article content One existing program that might serve as a model is the infant mental health program the hospital has been collaborating on. “A lot times people say ‘infant mental health? What the heck are you talking about?’ What you are actually doing is working with the family, the mother in particular,” explained Penney. “When you identify a high-risk situation – mom may have an addiction or the attachment is occurring as you might expect – we immediately work with our pediatrics unit, the health unit, and children’s aid to put together a comprehensive program for those moms-at-risk.” A community hub One idea that is promoted in all four pillars of the plan is a proposal for a single location where a wide range of social and medical services could be accessed under one roof. In the mental health care space, the hospital’s mental health Services department already fits the bill. But there is also a youth hub located on Pitt Street, which offers recreation for teens as well as access to employment services, a nurse practioner, addiction and mental health treatment. Enhance awareness

Another suggestion contained within the other three pillars is to take steps to make knowing what services are available and how to find them easier. When it comes to mental illness treatment, the hospital has both a phone line to call, as well as two employees who serve as system navigators – one for adults and one for youth. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/alan_s_hale

Article content “I would love for SDG to have the same status as Prince Edward County (PEC),” she said. “We know the people will spend money and will travel for food experiences. Well, we have all that is needed here, to be every bit as glamorous and successful as PEC.” Clement went on to outline what she believed is a solid foundation to develop agri-tourism in the region. “We have competent cities and towns,” she said. “We have an experienced agricultural sector here. We have local entrepreneurs that are fierce and creative. This is a perfect recipe for agri-tourism.” The mayor concluded by promoting the city’s tourism development fund. The said fund exists in order to support entrepreneurs wanting to create an event, festival, project or even collaboration that would attract tourism to Cornwall. “The province has allowed us to set up a fund by collecting revenues through tourists that come here,” Clement said. “This sits in a fund and people apply to that fund. We want to make sure that the people understand that that fund is to support anything that is going to bring tourism to Cornwall, that result will nights stays and accommodations. “If it’s going to somehow benefit the City of Cornwall, then we want to hear about it.” Akwesasne’s District Chief Edward Roundpoint praised for his part the partnerships created between the region’s neighbouring communities.

It’s about bringing us all together. We will build on each other. Co-operation is the best thing that we can offer.” The mood in the Upper Canada Cider Company was best echoed by how Clement concluded her speech.

23,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/oecd-introduces-checklist-for-sub-national-action-on-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,OECD Introduces Checklist for Sub-National Action on SDG Implementation,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released a synthesis report and a localized indicator framework to help cities and regions improve their SDG strategies, plans and implementation. The report argues that, beyond the compliance agenda, cities and regions should leverage the full potential of SDGs as a policy tool to improve people’s lives in a shared responsibility across levels of government.

The experiences of nine pilot cities and regions show the SDGs’ potential to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

Released during the Tenth World Urban Forum (WUF), on 10 February 2020, the report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs: Synthesis Report,’ highlights the key role of subnational governments in achieving the SDGs and demonstrates the importance of the SDGs for cities and regions. The report argues that many OECD countries are increasingly seizing the potential of the SDGs as a framework to improve multi-level governance, and in particular vertical coordination. For instance, Germany and Japan are promoting the “localisation” of the SDGs from the central government level by supporting cities and regions in their local SDGs strategies, both financially and in terms of capacity building. The report also documents – from the experience and evidence of nine pilot cities and regions – the potential that the SDGs offer to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

The report introduces a ‘Checklist for Public Action’ to help policymakers implement a territorial approach to the SDGs. The checklist presents action-oriented recommendations across five categories: planning, policies and strategies; multi-level governance; financing and budgeting; data and information; and engagement.

On planning, policies, and strategies, the checklist recommends defining and shaping local and regional development visions, strategies and plans and reorienting existing ones using the SDGs as a guiding framework; using the SDGs to manage tradeoffs and promote synergies among sectoral policies and across levels of government and link social, economic and environmental dimensions at the Goal or target level; using the SDGs to address concrete local challenges that require holistic approaches, such as access to green spaces, territorial inequalities or service delivery; and identifying place-based priorities through a participatory, multi-stakeholder process that considers the indivisibility and interconnectedness of the SDGs.

On engagement, the checklist suggests: using the SDGs as a vehicle to enhance accountability and transparency through engaging all territorial stakeholders in the policymaking process, including co-designing and co-implementing visions and strategies in a bottom-up, participatory way; engaging stakeholders using a combination of tools, such as providing networking opportunities, de-risking investments in SDG solutions through grants or loans; and using the SDGs as a tool for “public service motivation” by linking staff’s daily work with SDG achievement. Selected examples illustrate how cities and regions have implemented these recommendations.

The OECD Localised Indicator Framework for the SDGs measures the distance towards the SDGs for 601 regions and 649 cities, using 135 indicators across the 17 SDGs. At least 80% of regions from OECD countries have not achieved the suggested end values for 2030 in any of the 17 Goals. The average distance of OECD regions to the SDGs in 2030 ranges from 25% to 60%, showing that cities and regions in OECD countries are “far from achieving the SDGs.” Cities and regions are lagging behind the most on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action), and are performing the best on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Cities and regions can use the tool to compare their performance with other cities and regions in their country and identify peers in other countries. The tool aims to promote peer-learning and policy dialogues across cities and regions, increase government accountability on the SDGs, and raise awareness on the SDGs among society as a whole. An overview of Tataouine, Tunisia, for example shows that the city is 50% of the way towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), below the OECD average of 69%, and 48% percent of the way towards reaching SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), below the OECD average of 73%. The tool identifies Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand as a comparable city or region. The tool identifies Kinki, Japan, and Oslo and Akershus, Norway, as peer regions for New York, US.

OECD’s Programme on a Territorial Approach to the SDGs produced the report and indicator framework. The Programme plans to publish nine additional pilot-specific reports. Each report will offer in-depth analysis, tailored policy recommendations and action plans to champion a territorial approach to the SDGs.

OECD will launch a second phase of the Programme, which will work to implement recommendations and to support new cities, regions and countries in their efforts to localize the SDGs.

The declaration was named for the COP’s host city in India.

In addition to the Declaration’s call, a High-Level Segment also contributed outcomes for integration in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which is expected to be adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference, in October, in Kunming, China. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Acting Executive Secretary, informed COP 13 participants that the post-2020 biodiversity framework will be simple and transformative, but unlikely to include targets other than those already in the Aichi Targets.

Towards this end, the High-Level Segment discussed priorities for migratory species conservation in the framework, with speakers highlighting that this was the first CMS COP since the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) sounded the alarm that a million species, including many migratory species, might be lost in the coming decade. Ministers and other high-level participants emphasized the need to mainstream biodiversity across all sectors, including through nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches. They also called for including migratory species considerations in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions on climate change.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices.

In addition to issuing the Gandhinagar Declaration, CMS Parties added ten new species to the Convention’s Appendices. Seven were added to Appendix I, which comprises migratory species that are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range. The seven species added to Appendix I included the Asian elephant, jaguar, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, little bustard, antipodean albatross and the oceanic white-tip shark.

The Urial sheep, smooth hammerhead shark, and the tope shark were listed for protection under Appendix II, which covers migratory species that have an unfavorable conservation status and that require international cooperation for their conservation and management. In addition, new and extended Concerted Actions with targeted conservation plans were approved for 14 species.

The Earth Negotiation Bulletin report from COP13 also indicates that Parties also agreed on the following measures benefiting migratory species:

integrate biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy;

strengthen initiatives to combat the illegal killing, taking, and trade of migratory birds;

mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species;

deepen the understanding of the importance of animal culture and social complexity for the conservation of endangered species; and

investigate possible trade in CMS Appendix I species and the implications for their conservation status.

CMS COP13 and the associated meetings of the Standing Committee met from 15-22 February 2020. It brought together 2,550 people, including 263 delegates representing 82 parties, 11 delegates from five non-party countries, 50 representatives from UN agencies, 70 representatives of international non-governmental organizations, 127 representatives of national non-governmental organizations, and over 100 members of both national and international media.

In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) informed governments that a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.

Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:

Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

As low-lying coastal country and, like Marshall Islands, a small island developing State (SIDS), Suriname and its population face vulnerability as economic activities are concentrated in the coastal zone. Therefore, Suriname’s NDC includes adaptation elements, including its 2019 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as part of its climate strategy.

Among its conditional and unconditional mitigation contributions, Suriname’s NDC presents a package of policies and measures with sectoral sub-targets, including enhanced contributions from four of the country’s six emitting sectors: forests, electricity, agriculture, and transport, which together cover an estimated 70% of emissions.

In its NDC submission, Suriname emphasizes its efforts to protect its natural resource and forests serving the global community as a biodiversity hotspot and a carbon sink. As a high forest cover and low deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname commits to maintaining 93% forest cover.

Forty-one countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

Taking into account Suriname’s domestic circumstances and capabilities, the maintenance of the carbon stock and the sectoral emission reductions are undertaken on the basis of equity, conditional on the availability of finance, and in the context of sustainable development, according to the NDC document.

Norway submitted its updated NDC on 7 February 2020, with a target to achieve economy-wide emission reductions of “at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels” for the time frame 2021-2030. The target covers all sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs). This is an ambition enhancement from the country’s original NDC, in which Norway intended a 40% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Norway seeks to fulfill the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

In the event Norway’s enhanced NDC should go beyond the target set in the EU’s updated NDC, Norway intends to use voluntary cooperation under Paris Agreement Article 6 to fulfill the part that goes beyond what is fulfilled through the climate cooperation with the EU. Norway notes that the EU’s current climate framework “does not open for the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs) from outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA), emphasizing that final accounting towards its NDC target may depend on any further arrangements in Norway’s cooperation with the EU and Iceland.

Norway further informs that it will have specific legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering emissions from all sectors and all GHGs. About half of Norwegian GHG emissions are covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which regulates emissions from industrial plants, power plants, the petroleum industry, and commercial aviation within the EEA. Not covered by the EU ETS are emissions from industry, petroleum, and the transport, agriculture, buildings, and waste management sectors. These are regulated under the Effort Sharing Regulations, which set binding national targets. Norway’s national target is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS-sectors by 40% in 2030 compared to 2005. The target can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by the use of flexible mechanisms within the EU framework. With regard to the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation, Norway’s commitment is to ensure that emissions do not exceed removals in this sector.

Norway considers the NDC “fair and ambitious” as it is in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 and onwards that correspond to keeping global warming in line with the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement: limiting the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2°C,” and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, above preindustrial levels. Norway references the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Panel’s special report revealing pathways towards limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

Since the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in 2016, a number of world leaders, including during the 2019 UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit, said they would submit new or updated NDCs by the first quarter of 2020. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), with partners, issued a supporting guidance for this process of developing new or updated NDCs, which it generally treats as “NDC enhancement.” According to the World Resources Institute (WRI) 2020 NDC tracker, 41 countries undertook to “update,” and 68 countries indicated they would “enhance” their NDCs.

29,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/irp-report-proposes-governance-framework-for-extractives/,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IRP Report Proposes Governance Framework for Extractives,"The UN Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel (IRP) has called for the development of a ‘Sustainable Development License to Operate’ (SDLO), in its report on the governance of extractive industries. Governments have increased efforts to decouple their economies from resource use, but the demand for extractive resources is projected to continue to grow, especially in emerging economies.

As a basis for the proposed SDLO framework, the report titled, ‘Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing Extractive Industries Towards Sustainable Development,’ maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives that focus on delivering the SDGs. The authors lament, however, that the existing frameworks do not operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

Noting that extractive industries can cause extensive and lasting damage, the report critiques the current paradigm of “social license to operate” (SLO), which it notes arose as a response to business risk. The SLO paradigm aims to accommodate community demands to the minimum extent necessary to avoid public opposition and social conflict, and associated reputational damage, the authors write.

To move beyond SLO and consolidate existing instruments, the report sets out consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the SDGs and other international policy commitments. It identifies eight SDGs in which the extractive sector, if well-managed, can play a positive role: Goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Effective mineral resource governance incorporates human rights, responsible business practices, greater engagement of home countries, and economic decoupling.

UNEP emphasizes that the minerals and metals industry can promote social cohesion, inclusiveness and economic progress among low-income countries and vulnerable populations, but guidance is needed. The report elaborates that the SDLO model advocates for fairer deals, equal share of benefits among stakeholders and holistic consideration of regulations that are not inclusive on their own.

The proposed SDLO framework addresses large-scale mining and investigates artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), in which some marginalized groups in certain geographies partake, though often without oversight by policymakers. The framework does so in part by extending responsibility to ensure implementation is shared by both “host” and “home” countries, and by expanding the scope to a broader swath of the extractive value chain. However, the authors caution that the SDLO is not a substitute for laws and regulations, and that extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water.

Prerequisites of an effective mineral resource governance framework, the report notes, include decoupling economic growth from environmental and social impacts, protecting human rights, establishing responsible business practices, and ensuring greater engagement of home countries. With respect to national and sub-national governance, the report recommends that countries establish three public institutions: an environment directorate, a mining directorate and a geological survey to regulate the mines and metals industries. The report also articulates the role and responsibility of host governments, which includes devising responsible concession agreements, mainstreaming environmental assessment, domesticating natural capital accounting, ensuring transparency and channeling extractive rents into public investment.

Internationally, the report advocates for the creation of an International Minerals Agency to improve coordination mechanisms, or at least settling on an international agreement to share data on economic geology, mineral demand and the industry’s impacts. It suggests that this agreement could be negotiated through existing for a such as the UN Environment Assembly, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, and wider ongoing UN processes focused on reviewing progress towards the SDGs.

The UN event to mark the Day focused on linkages between inclusive quality education, lifelong learning and SDG implementation, with speakers calling for multilateral action to ensure everyone has access to quality education.

The UN General Assembly’s high-level dialogue convened at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 24 January 2020, on the theme, ‘Aligning Inclusive Quality Education Policies with SDGs.’ The meeting recognized numerous challenges facing education and achievement of SDG 4 (quality education), including 258 million children and young people out of school, and 60% of children and adolescents unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in literacy and mathematics. Participants observed that refugees, migrants and people with disabilities face additional challenges in accessing education. Participants also expressed concern about education quality, observing that education and training are not preparing students for the future world of work.

UNESCO has called on all governments to integrate education for climate action in national education policy and planning.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande outlined education challenges in his address, including a decline in education quality and standards, a widening knowledge gap between students in technically advanced countries and students in developing countries, and a crisis of learning in conflict zones. He called for today’s education to “bridge the yawning gap” between learning opportunities and modern employment needs for specialized skills, noting that school curricula need to anticipate and respond to workplace needs. Despite these challenges, Muhammad-Bande highlighted forward-looking education policies in some countries that are contributing to achieving SDG 4 targets. He urged Member States and other partners to consider establishing education networks to exchange information and ideas.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said, “education has the power to shape the world.” She recognized the power of education to empower women and give them opportunities to make choices. She said quality education can help change perceptions and behavior, including on unsustainable practices and climate change, and can promote mutual understanding and respect, helping to combat misperceptions, prejudice and violent extremism. She stressed that education is critical to achieve the SDGs, and called for stepping up efforts and building partnerships to ensure quality education becomes a reality. She called for transforming the way the world thinks of education, including to ensure education tackles hate speech and facilitates an inclusive digital transformation. Mohammed said education should also include ecological issues, noting that the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has called on all governments to integrate education for climate action in national education policy and planning.

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay warned that there is a global learning crisis, which she said is also a crisis for prosperity, the planet, peace and people. She emphasized “education is the best investment for the future” and highlighted UNESCO’s role in making education “an instrument of inclusion and…of empowerment.” Azoulay called on everyone to take action for education.

UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Mona Juul highlighted the role of education in escaping poverty and transforming communities. She said education paves the way towards productive, sustainable and resilient societies in which everyone can reach their full potential.

The report also provides evidence for links between WASH and another 14 conditions, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that are not yet quantified.

The report serves as an update and builds on the WHO’s previous analysis of environmental disease burdens and interventions. The agency’s (2016) findings showed that, globally, “1.9 million deaths and 123 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) could have been prevented with adequate WASH. The WASH-attributable disease burden amounted to 3.3% of global deaths and 4.6% of global DALYs.” Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest disease burden from inadequate WASH.

The publication highlights the relationship between improper disposal of excreta, lack of hand washing facilities, and pathogens in drinking water on the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections. It describes how standing and wastewater are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which serve as additional disease vectors.

For the following diseases – diarrhoeal diseases; respiratory infections; soil-transmitted helminthiasis; malaria; trachoma; schistosomiasis; lymphatic filariasis; onchocerciasis; dengue; Japanese encephalitis; protein-energy malnutrition; drowning; arsenicosis ; fluorosis ; legionellosis; leptospirosis; hepatitis A and hepatitis E; methaemoglobinaemia; cyanobacterial toxins; lead poisoning; scabies; spinal injury; poliomyelitis; and adverse neonatal conditions and maternal outcomes – the report gives a detailed account of links to inadequate WASH. Where possible, it also describes interventions and gives economic evaluations.

The report draws particular attention to the impacts of inadequate WASH on young children, noting that, “among children under 5 years, WASH-attributable deaths represent 13% of deaths and 12% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs),” an outcome that could be prevented with existing prevention strategies and interventions. These interventions would include implementation of: water safety planning; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe recreational water environments; guidelines for drinking-water quality; guidelines for safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater; and sanitation safety planning to prevent exposure to excreta along the sanitation chain.

The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

The anniversary will be commemorated with a high-level event at UN headquarters in New York, US, on 21 September 2020.

The co-facilitators for the consultations are Anne-Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of Sweden, and Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar. Addressing delegations at the start of the meeting on 21 February 2020, Eneström noted divergent views on some of the topics to be addressed, and said the co-facilitators will “hold the pen” in drafting the resolution, using input from delegations. Al-Thani said the co-facilitators will speak with all interested parties and stakeholders.

This organization has enough documents; it is time to deliver on our commitments.

On the tone and function of the document, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the resolution must resonate with citizens around the world. Eneström said the declaration should: be written in the voice of the heads of state and government that will assemble in September; contain a focused political message; be understandable and inspire action from all stakeholders; speak to youth and others while also being phrased “at a high level,” and give a sense of achievement while inspiring accelerated action.

Governments then offered their views. A few suggested including sections on the UN’s three pillars – development, peace and security, and human rights – as well as references to strengthening, reforming and modernizing the UN. Many said the declaration should reinforce urgency and commitment related to the 2030 Agenda and the Decade of Action. The discussion indicated broad support for reaffirming the principles of multilateralism and the value of a rules-based international system founded on the UN Charter and international law. The “functional nature” of multilateral cooperation should be highlighted, said one government, in order to address the many issues that transcend national borders.

Member States responded to the food-for-thought paper provided by the co-facilitators before the meeting, which suggested that the declaration address five areas: acknowledging achievements; looking ahead; responding to major global challenges; delivering on commitments; and building consensus and mobilizing for change.

On acknowledging achievements, one delegation said the paradigm of the UN has been changed to put the 2030 Agenda at the heart of its work. Governments also highlighted that the UN has: contributed to a strong body of international law, which should be universalized; provided a common covenant on preserving the rights of future generations; prevented further world wars; improved living standards; and achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

On looking ahead, delegations called for genuine reflection on strengthening global governance and multilateralism, for aligning the UN’s intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and for transforming the UN’s values into people’s lived experiences. One government said a better balance must be reached between the peace and security dimension and the development dimension of the UN’s work, noting that all available energy and resources seem to be activated for peace and security issues, but when it comes to development, “everything is just voluntary.”

Some delegations highlighted the importance of the sovereign equality of states, with one saying that “in reality, not all States are created equal, but large or small, all have an equal right to be heard here at the UN, and all have rights and obligations.” Others emphasized the communications role of the UN, noting the need for “a UN that listens to people and can communicate more clearly.” One highlighted the SDGs as a communications asset.

On responding to global challenges, some echoed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ assessment of challenges and threats set out in January 2020. He had identified as “four horsemen” that endanger progress: geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology. Building on these ideas, governments said the world needs a stronger UN than ever before, and highlighted: non-traditional security threats; inequalities within countries; artificial intelligence; xenophobia, hate speech, and migrant rights violations; climate change and pollution, the importance of a successful UNFCCC COP 26 to address the “increasingly existential” threat of the climate and environment crisis, and the need for the UN to mobilize means to address both mitigation and adaptation;

On ways for the UN to better deliver on its purposes and principles, one delegate said that “turning 75 usually means retirement,” but for the UN it must be a time of rejuvenation and reform. Speakers stressed that the UN must modernize in order to not lose confidence of people, and it must adapt to the challenges of the 21st century to remain the primary forum for multilateral cooperation.

Governments highlighted the need for reforms to the UNGA, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN’s peacebuilding architecture. They emphasized in particular the need for the Security Council to become more representative, but also for reforms to limit the use of the veto, such as in situations of mass atrocities.

Delivering on specific commitments and frameworks from the UN was also a priority for many speakers, with one saying that “this organization has enough documents”; the most important priority now is to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlighted the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.”

On building consensus and mobilizing for change, the co-facilitators had asked for input on how the Decade of Action can advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind, as well as how the UN can maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors, and how it can strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth? Many highlighted the importance of engaging women, girls and all youth, with one noting that events in 2020 make it a particularly important year for women and girls. One delegation said developing countries need funding, especially from the private sector, to pursue the Decade of Action and empower women and youth. Another said “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She called for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

On the challenges of reaching agreement on the declaration, delegates suggested that the process “focus on what unites us and avoid what divides us,” noting that this declaration cannot resolve all unfinished business from the last 75 years. Instead it should highlight areas of convergence, so the declaration and the anniversary commemoration can unite rather than polarize the membership.

Going forward, the co-facilitators will prepare an elements paper for the declaration. They plan to convene a meeting to discuss the elements in early April 2020. They said the UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary, Fabrizio Hochschild, will be invited to that meeting to provide updates on preparations for the anniversary and the related global consultation process.

The commemoration event will take place on 21 September 2020, at UN headquarters in New York, US. [IISD Sources]","UN Member States held their first informal consultations on a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN.

Each year starts with the possibility of a new beginning, but often still carries the baggage of the previous year. As 2020 begins, the international community faces deadlines to replace old frameworks and rules with new ones, and to conclude negotiations on new treaties and agreements.

It is timely to take stock of global environmental governance as the world enters a new year and a new decade. In our new report, ‘The State of Global Environmental Governance 2019,’ the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team reflects on the successes, shortcomings and overall trends of 2019. We also look ahead, with optimism 2020 will regain the momentum recently lost.

In 2019, scientists were truth-tellers. Over the course of the year, international scientific bodies produced a range of reports on climate change, biodiversity, and the environment as a whole. Each report contains dire warnings for the future of the planet due to the impact of climate change on food production, of pollution on human health, and land incursions on species extinctions. Given historic inaction, nearly every system on the planet is in danger.

Yet, despite the thousands of pages of scientific evidence, intergovernmental political processes remain deadlocked on so many issues. Policy makers could not mount the type of response commensurate with the science.

Climate change governance had a particularly difficult year, limping to the end of the decade after the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The demands for climate ambition are loud, and angry. Millions of children and youth, feeling their futures have been stolen, participated in climate strikes every Friday throughout the year. Hearing their calls, 67 countries pledged greater climate ambition at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September, but these countries represent only a small fraction of global emissions. As the year came to a close, governments at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP 25) failed to issue a clear call for ambition and could not agree on rules for the market mechanism necessary to complete the Paris Agreement rulebook. The Paris Agreement officially begins in 2020 amid major questions about its ability to catalyze climate ambition and prevent global warming above 2°C.

There were a few bright spots during the year as some policymakers acted on the scientific truths. The first multilateral action to reduce global plastic waste, which amounts to millions of tons each year, was taken under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Certain Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In May, parties to the Basel Convention agreed to include mixed, unrecyclable, and contaminated plastic waste exports into the control regime that requires the consent of importing countries before waste exports can proceed. The fourth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly sent a strong signal that production and consumption of single-use plastics should be reduced or phased out, and the plastics industry has been put on notice. In fact, over the course of the year more than 30 countries around the world, nearly half of which are in Africa, put in place bans on single-use plastic bags.

As we outline in a chapter on linkages, 2019 was also notable for increasing recognition of the need for a more interconnected form of governance. More and more, actors drew linkages among environmental and sustainable development processes, especially biodiversity and climate change, land and climate change, oceans and climate change, human health and the environment, and economics, trade and climate change. The increased understanding about the impacts of degrading ecosystems and a warming climate on local and global economies alike, has led to a number of multinational companies and financial institutions announcing new climate-friendly policies and investments.

Of course, the links among the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are many and complementary. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report was released in time for the SDG Summit in September. The report outlined progress in some critical areas, including declines in extreme poverty and the under-5 mortality rate, increases in access to electricity, and greater efforts to respond to urbanization, waste, and illegal fishing. Nonetheless, many areas need urgent collective attention, including climate change, ocean acidification, land degradation, hunger, education and gender equality. The report also stressed that the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is jeopardized as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts, and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

It is abundantly clear the world needs an urgent, ambitious response to unleash a social and economic transformation. But, in 2019, world leaders appeared detached from the crisis at hand, reading statements that were largely devoid of meaningful pledges. This reaction was in stark contrast to the verdict of the people who rose in protest during the Summit and throughout the year: leaders are failing to address the environmental and development emergency the world faces.

This year, we face a busy international agenda as well as waning political will, rising nationalism, and faltering support for multilateralism. 2020 is expected to conclude negotiations and establish new tools to address biodiversity, marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and a post-2020 strategic approach to international chemicals management. We are already in the fifth year of SDG implementation, and to succeed by their 2030 completion date, governments still need to increase their ambition under the Paris Agreement.

Positive, forward-looking outcomes are essential, but not guaranteed.

Opening speakers set the tone for the Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 8-13 February 2020. Falah Mohammad Al Ahbabi, Chairman of Abu Dhabi’s Department of Municipalities and Transport, pointed to mass migration and technological progress as two trends demanding a “renewed understanding of locality,” which includes safety, inclusiveness and social cohesion. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said via video that urbanization continues to feature high rates of inequality, and called for all stakeholders, including local governments, to partner with the UN to tackle the climate emergency.

The UN-Habitat Executive Director called for turning urbanization into a net positive contributor to life on Earth.

Ashraf Ghani, President of Afghanistan, said that organizational cultures in “communities of knowledge” constitute a significant constraint, suggesting that several international organizations are “still reflections of a different world.” Fiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama emphasized the need to make urban living synonymous with sustainability. UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif noted that “SDG 11 is where all of the SDGs come together,” and called for turning urbanization into a net positive contributor to life on Earth.

More than 18,000 participants registered for the Forum, which began with five Assembly meetings of the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) constituency groups that provided input to the Habitat III process, namely women, youth, grassroots, and the World Assembly for Local and Regional Government.

Among the initiatives launched and discussed during WUF10 were UN-Habitat’s launch of the ‘SDG Project Assessment Tool: an innovative tool for inclusive, sustainable and effective urban projects,’ as well as ‘RISE UP: resilient settlements for the urban poor,’ which seeks to mobilize and coordinate large-scale investments in climate change adaptation and resilience for the urban poor. Penny Abeywardena, Mayor’s Office of International Affairs, New York City, US, issued a call for local and regional governments to sign the Voluntary Local Review Declaration, noting that 20 new cities had already done so at WUF10.

Examples from countries and local communities discussed during WUF10 included the following:

a program in the Municipality of Mogadishu, Somalia, aimed at introducing the country’s youth to its pre-conflict history;

the use of sport as a critical space for “meeting and resocialization,” with the city of Medellín, Colombia reporting that it has succeeded in decreasing drug trafficking and use by engaging communities in sports;

Senegal’s experience in using industrial taxes to subsidize housing programmes and creating dedicated housing funds;

Jordan’s model of distributing land and houses at affordable prices;

the work of the Bear Clan Patrol Inc., in Winnipeg, Canada, which draws on traditional clan roles to support safety and cultural restoration for indigenous communities in the city; and

examples of involvement from youth in many countries, including a presentation by Martin Lucas Sortland Eick, Norwegian youth delegate, regarding his efforts to see youth “take true ownership” of SDG implementation in his country.

At the close of WUF10, delegates adopted the Abu Dhabi Declared Actions, the main outcome document of the meeting. The document presents participants’ perspectives on the relationship between culture, innovation, and urban development. In the Declared Actions, participants highlight that: culture is fundamental to identity and heritage, and is an integral part of the solution to the challenges of urbanization; cities are the incubators of social, economic, environmental, political and cultural progress; linking data, innovation and advances in science and technology with policy is critical for implementing the 2015 New Urban Agenda (NUA) and achieving the SDGs; and further action and commitments by actors at the local, national and global levels are welcomed in support of the NUA and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among the pledges included in the Abu Dhabi Declared Actions document are several organizations’ commitment to making cities resilient by 2030 and Fiji’s commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In closing remarks, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande commended WUF10 for marking one of the first events of the UN Decade of Action. He described culture and innovation as key for promoting socially cohesive, peaceful and resilient societies, noting that culture plays a critical role in fostering human rights and peaceful coexistence. He described the NUA as one of the most important blueprints to achieving sustainable cities, and called for innovation to become more climate resilient and better prepared for disaster recovery and risk reduction.

36,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/un-sustainable-development-goals-good-governance-sdg-mena-news-17612/,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Fair Observer,The Importance of Good Governance,"To the extent that people know anything about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they reasonably assume that they have something to do with the economy (development), and with the environment (sustainability). They’re only partly right. The bigger challenge, especially for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, is governance.

The 17 SDGs were adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, with a target date of 2030. That leaves 10 years to achieve, amongst others: no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, affordable and clean energy and climate action. These are major challenges for all governments, not just MENA.

Yet the most challenging of the goals may be the one that hardly gets talked about: SDG 16. It calls for governments to “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

It’s Complicated

All the SDGs are accompanied by specific targets. The ones for SDG 16 include: promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all; substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels; ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels; and ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

This is a familiar list of ingredients of “good governance” as it has been defined by major international agencies like the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development over the last 20 years. But they are more than a list: They are mutually reinforcing. It’s hard to achieve one without the others.

Take eradicating bribery and corruption. How could that be achieved if the courts are in the back pockets of political and business leaders? Corruption cannot be truly addressed without the rule of law. But real rule of law needs accountability and transparency, which means public access to information and protection of fundamental freedoms.

I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. You can review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for further information.

It gets more complicated. The target of “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels” is a target less about governments than about civil society and non-governmental institutions. SDG 16 is not just about the institutions of government — it is about the relationship of government to society as well.

It gets more complicated still. In addition to accountability, transparency and participation, SDG 16 also has a target of “effective” institutions at all levels. It is not clear what that means in the context of SDG 16, but it must have something to do with the results and targets for the other SDGs. For example, SDG 4, on quality education and its target of (to take just one) “equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university,” would require both massive investments and well-designed institutions.

Achieving most of the other SDGs will also depend on effective government institutions. For example, decent work and economic growth (SDG 8); innovation, industry and infrastructure (SDG 9); and climate action (SDG 13).

The SDGs, in short, are goals that can only be achieved through good and effective governance. SDG 16 makes that explicit, but it is embedded in most the other SDGs and their targets. This challenge of good governance is not just about warm and fuzzy slogans; it is about institutional design, about government capacity and about government-society relations.

Mixed Results

What progress has been made, and what are the pathways to success by 2030? For the MENA region, given the variety of situations and the intensity of conflict in many countries, the results are mixed. The “Sustainable Development Report 2019,” published by the UN-affiliated Sustainable Development Solutions Network, notes that “Conflicts in some countries lead to poor and declining performance on most of the SDGs and in particular on SDG 2 (No Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).”

While access to clean water, sanitation and clean energy is generally high, the report calls for more efforts to deal with high levels of perceived corruption. It is cold comfort that Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa fare even worse on most SGDs in general, and SDG 16 especially.

The path forward on governance, for all countries and not just MENA, is not to try to do everything all at once. The year 2030 is only a decade away. If we think of the SDGs as 17 rail cars, what are the engines that will pull them into the station on time?

First, education. The results of a good educational system are educated citizens, who will in turn contribute to economic growth and to civil society development. Second, anti-corruption and rule of law. The lessons of recent uprisings and protests around the world are clear: Nothing ignites public outrage more than the injustice that comes with the rot of corruption. Third, build capacity in public institutions through training and high standards of competence and merit. The 2030 Agenda is only a decade away. Achieving SDG 16 is the key to success. We need to start now.

In December 2019 and January 2020, we saw this in discussions and reports on adaptation finance. They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows. Discussions also focused on the need for current business models to adapt to increasing climate risks and transform production processes to halt nature loss.

Practitioners expressed mixed feelings about the level of progress made. On the one hand, they saw missed opportunities such as to determine how cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement on climate change should advance. On the other, they noted steady achievements in the work of scientific bodies. In January, lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II (WG II) continued to advance work on the Group’s contribution to the sixth Assessment Report (AR6), focusing on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, due for release in October 2021.

Seen in the light of adaptation funding activities, identified impacts and needs, these recent discussions suggest that climate change adaptation requires a rethinking of production, redistribution and equity. This Policy Brief focuses on these and other recent developments that inform climate adaptation finance.

UNFCCC Reflects on Its Integration of Adaptation, Prepares for 2023 Global Stocktake

The Adaptation Committee, established in 2010 under the UNFCCC, issued a report reflecting on the evolution of adaptation in the climate regime and outlining its work towards the first global stocktake (GST) under the Paris Agreement scheduled in 2023. Titled, ‘25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC,’ the report was released at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid in December 2019. Citing findings from the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report draws attention to increasingly more urgent adaptation needs.

The report notes that rising adaptation costs are likely to range from USD 140 billion to 300 billion per annum by 2030, and could rise to between USD 280 billion and 500 billion per annum by 2050. The Committee highlights the specific roles of the Convention’s Financial Mechanism and Technology Mechanism to support adaptation. Reporting on its own activities, the Committee informs of its partnerships with international, regional and national stakeholders and its efforts on engaging the private sector. A strategy for private sector engagement was also discussed at the 57th meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council in December.

Looking forward, the Adaptation Committee notes that the seventh review of the GEF, the oldest operating entity of the Financial Mechanism, will be initiated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC will also start key negotiations on the post-2025 finance goal. Over the course of 2020, developed countries are expected to make submissions on finance beyond 2020 and on the alignment of global finance with the Paris goals.

The Committee further outlines its work towards the 2023 global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assessment of collective progress towards achieving its long-term goals. The global stocktake will conduct a review of overall progress made towards achieving the global goal on adaptation and the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation action and support. Inputs for the stocktake will include reports from the “network of institutions” established to enhance adaptation actions.

COP 25 Agrees of Arrangements for Adaptation Fund Going Forward, But Further Work Remains

The Adaption Fund approved a record USD 188 million in new projects in 2019, and reached the milestone of 100 concrete adaptation projects financed in vulnerable developing countries. The Fund fosters country ownership and enables direct access to adaptation finance for applicants from accredited national implementing entities from developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. It provides new learning opportunities, such as e-learning programmes to enhance access to climate finance, and new grants that foster adaptation practices on the ground and scale up effective projects.

Given its important role and the benefits it creates for an increasing number of countries in need of adaptation finance, the Fund welcomed two decisions taken during the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December, on decreasing risks of interruptions in the Fund’s work. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted:

amendments to the Fund’s arrangements with the World Bank to provide services as its interim trustee, to now be an open-ended arrangement; and

a decision that there will be no end date attached to its memorandum of understanding with the GEF Council on the GEF hosting the Fund’s secretariat.

However, the fact that COP 25 failed to conclude negotiations on the modalities of cooperative approaches under Paris Agreement Article 6 left some open questions.

In line with previous decisions, the Fund has served the Paris Agreement since January 2019. It will no longer serve the Kyoto Protocol once the share of proceeds becomes available under the sustainable development mechanism of Agreement Article 6.4, though it will continue to receive the share of proceeds, if available, from activities under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.

The failure to conclude negotiations at COP 25 leaves unclear precisely how much of the share of proceeds under Agreement Article 6.4 sustainable development mechanism will become available for the Adaptation Fund. There seems to be consensus on a minimum share of 2% but possible increases are still under discussion. Parties further disagreed, among others, on whether a share of proceeds would also come from both market-based approaches, namely transactions under the mechanism, as well as from the trading of Article 6.2 “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes” (ITMOs). Many countries called for equal treatment of rules for both approaches, for a number of reasons. In the context of adaptation finance, developing countries highlighted the value of predictable funding. As reported by some analysts, many of the countries likely to be on the buying end, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Norway, are concerned about higher costs of their carbon offsets.

COP 25 also did not result in any decision on whether the membership representation of developing and developed countries on the Adaptation Fund Board should change, given its role in serving the Paris Agreement.

Tracking Adaptation Finance

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has set out to tackle significant data and reporting challenges to capturing global adaptation finance flows. Adaptation investment, the Initiative finds, is difficult to track due to challenges associated with context dependency, the uncertain causality of investments made, a lack of impact metrics, and confidentiality and reporting requirements.

For this reason, CPI’s report titled, ‘ Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019,’ does not track any private sector adaptation finance. The Initiative underlines that almost all adaptation finance covered in the report was funded by public actors and that the tracking of public domestic adaptation finance remains limited. Nevertheless, that report finds that adaptation finance gained momentum in 2017-2018, increasing 35% to an annual average of USD 30 billion from 2015-2016, although adaptation still accounts for just 5% of tracked climate finance based on available data.

In its subsequent December report titled, ‘Tracking Adaptation Finance: Advancing Methods to Capture Finance Flows in the Landscape,’ CPI briefs on potential methods to fill data gaps for the tracking of adaptation finance flows, and proposes methods to measure progress.

The proposed framework, the authors suggest, can serve to identify information that should be tracked and reported by local governments and companies. The aim is to improve the understanding, and, ultimately, delivery, of adaptation finance. CPI finds that:

Investment flows that are specific to adaptation and resilience must be understood in the context of the total investment that receives a resilience benefit from the incremental adaptation investment;

Adaptation- and resilience-focused flows should be measured against total investment by sector to understand progress made to achieve resilience against a benchmark; and

Technical approaches, such as keyword searches and investment matching against national adaptation goals and geographic climate risk, can help identify adaptation flows in datasets that do not label them as such.

World Economic Forum Recognizes Climate and “Nature-based” Risks

The World Economic Forum (WEF), which convened for its 50th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland from 21-24 January 2020, issued its annual Global Risks Report 2020. Based on its Global Risks Perception Survey results, the Forum concurs with findings from other fora that climate change is the stand-out long-term risk the world faces. It stresses that the near-term consequences of climate change amount to a “planetary emergency” with catastrophic, wide-ranging and intersecting implications. The WEF report also ranks biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as one of the top five threats humanity will face in the next ten years.

As a traditionally business-centric gathering, the WEF finds that USD 44 trillion of economic value generation is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services. Illustrating how nature loss impacts businesses’ operations, supply chains and markets, the Forum urges the business community to adapt to several nature-based risks and implications. These risks, explained in another WEF report titled, ‘Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,’ can be assessed using climate risk categories as defined in the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Under its ‘Nature Action Agenda’ stakeholder platform, the Forum has identified areas where strategic transformation of current business models and production processes can contribute the most to halting and reversing nature loss, and ways to finance this transformation.

Climate Change Adaptation Requires Rethinking of Production, Redistribution and Equity

Reflecting on these discussions, one cannot ignore the diversity of stakeholder groups engaged in addressing climate change impacts and their growing need of global adaptation finance. That need is estimated at USD 180 billion annually from 2020-2030 and USD 50 billion annually from many developing countries to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. While the UNFCCC and its constituent bodies prepare for upcoming procedural tasks, and the IPCC is advancing work towards AR6 publication, others talk about business opportunities and revenues. Few can envision the estimated sums in question. Half of the world’s biggest companies say “climate adaptation solutions could result in USD 236 billion in increased revenue.” Some suggest that “in the food and land-use sector alone, the climate challenge provides an annual business opportunity of USD 4.5 trillion a year by 2030.” At the same time, those that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, including African farmers and island nations, speak of securing their livelihoods and coping with the negative impacts of climate change while lacking the means to adapt.

One of the notions underpinning these contrasting discussions is equity, with its different meanings and undertones. In an effort to to answer the basic economic questions of production and distribution, which all societies grapple with, we could think of what products are going to be made and by what means. How are the claims on production and incomes divided among resource contributors? How is production divided between private and public purposes? And more pertinently perhaps, given the limited ecological capacity within which the established global economy has to function, how is production divided between the present and the future?","They reviewed the evolution of adaptation in the global climate regime, and looked at significant data challenges in capturing adaptation finance flows.

To promote a shift towards circularity, the initiative calls on all tourism companies and destinations to take concrete actions to tackle plastic pollution and increase plastics recycling.

The Global Tourism Plastics initiative aims to reduce plastic pollution from the tourism sector through a set of actionable commitments by 2025. The Initiative will work to eliminate unnecessary or problematic plastic packaging and support the shift from single-use plastic towards reusable alternatives or models by 2025. The Initiative will also engage the value chain to promote 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable and commit to collaborate and invest in increasing the recycling and composting rate for plastics.

The Initiative is an activity of the One Planet Network’s Sustainable Tourism Programme, a multi-stakeholder partnership to implement SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). The Initiative acts as the interface between the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and the tourism sector. The New Plastics Economy Global Manager, Gerald Naber, said the initiative will unite the tourism sector behind a “vision for a world in which plastic never becomes waste or pollution.” He emphasized that concerted action can help eliminate unneeded plastics and drive innovation to ensure that needed plastics “can be safely and easily circulated—keeping them in the economy and out of the environment.”

UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili welcomed the Initiative as an opportunity for tourism companies and destinations “to step forward and lead the global effort addressing plastic pollution.” He encouraged Initiative participants to set quantifiable targets and help accelerate the tourism sector’s transformation towards more integrated solutions and circular business models.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to alleviate social, economic, and environmental problems by the year 2030, but progress has been slower than necessary and scattershot in impact. Certain SDGs tend to attract awareness and action from companies if they are closely related to their business objectives, but others (#1 No Poverty, for example, or #14 Life Below Water) seem relegated to specialist intervention. The goals themselves are nonbinding, absent government adoption and mandates, and there are only a handful of standards for the management and/or reporting of SDG performance.

Most of the world’s stock exchanges support the SDGs. Industry advocacy and support takes many forms, including participation in the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative and the UN Global Compact. Some exchanges have also integrated the work of the SDGs into the sustainability tools and support that they provide to listed companies, leveraging events, white papers, and webinars to demonstrate the market value and business impact of the SDGs.

“Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation.”

Yet a relatively small number of companies are publicly reporting progress against the SDGs, which implies that the 2030 target is in serious jeopardy. Notable exceptions from the Nasdaq-listed roster include Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, and Starbucks – each reporting steady progress and specific metrics – but most large companies are notably absent from the conversation. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), fundamental building blocks of job creation and international development, seem to be particularly silent. The most recent Sustainable Development Goals Report (UN, 2018) cites certain factors for this, including a lack of expertise and resources, especially in developing economies.

Given this seeming gap between advocacy and performance, we wanted to examine the level of SDG awareness, action, and efficacy within the global exchange community. WFE provided CFI.co an understanding of SDGs-related industry practices based on a WFE survey.

Under Chief Executive Nandini Sukumar, the WFE created a set of Sustainability Principles that (among other things) formalizes industry commitment to the UN SDGs by accelerating development of sustainable finance and promoting awareness in the capital market. Ms. Sukumar, citing the WFE Annual Sustainability Survey, says, “73% of the exchanges with sustainability initiatives have some form of SDG-specific initiatives. These initiatives include education programs on SDGs for issuers, disclosure guidance and offering SDG-related products in their markets.” Certain SDGs (#5 Gender Equality, #8 Decent Work Conditions, and #13 Climate Action) are the most engaged among WFE members.

Survey Results

We sent questions to the Sustainability Working Group — a subset of WFE members that are especially committed to sustainable business integration — and received responses for more than half of them. Participating exchanges included B3 (Brazil), Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, Borsa Istanbul, Bourse de Casablanca, Dubai Financial Market, the Egyptian Exchange, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange Group, National Stock Exchange of India, Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Two members elected to remain anonymous, and Nasdaq itself has contributed to the industry data in this article.

We found that awareness and valuation of the SDGs is nearly universal, yet actionable progress is not being measured. The SDGs are vital to capital market function, particularly for listed firms and their respective supply chains. Without reaching for the Goals, one responding exchange said, “Neither the capital markets nor the real economy will be able to survive in the coming decades.”

80% claim that the SDGs are well understood in their market

87% believe that the SDGs are a fundamental part of the sustainable economy

More exchanges (54%) do not measure SDG progress than do (46%)

Wanting to press further, we asked this question: How does your exchange engage, inform, or otherwise communicate with issuers and other stakeholders about the UN SDGs? The disparate range of answers may help to explain the gap between industry awareness and industry action, as there is no global standard for measurement – but it’s also clear that the responding exchanges are proactive.

“The SDGs are recommended as a global reporting framework for listed companies in LSEG ESG reporting guidance,” according to the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). “FTSE Russell — the global, multi-asset index provider part of LSEG — develops investment tools that incorporate alignment with the SDGs in the index design.”

Taiwan Stock Exchange cited strong information disclosure, corporate governance, stewardship responsibility, sustainable product development, and market capacity building as evidence of their commitment to SDG progress. Other exchanges cited index development as a key driver. Other exchanges were more candid about market inhibitors. Further support from stakeholders including issuers is needed to allow exchanges to move forward more aggressively.

Other Industry Initiatives

The UN and exchange leaders had previously identified the SDGs that most pertain to the industry and the various ways that capital markets can help deliver on the Goals. Per this guidance, the SDGs that receive special emphasis from Nasdaq and others include:

#5 Gender Equality. Ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic, and public life.

#12 Responsible Consumption and Production. Encouraging companies, especially large and trans-national companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.

#13 Climate Action. Improving education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

#17 Partnerships for the Goals. Enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of sustainable development goals in all countries, particularly developing countries.

An influential joint report from the UN SSE and the WFE (How Exchanges Can Embed Sustainability Within their Operations: A Blueprint to Advance Action, 2019) makes one point clear: “The imperative of sustainability as embodied in the SDGs demands deep transformative change from both business and public policy.

The XIV Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean took place in Santiago, Chile from 27-31 January 2020, ahead of the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), and its Beijing Platform for Action. This year’s CSW session will conduct a review of progress towards the action platform.

The Regional Conference served to review progress towards the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, adopted in 2016 at the XIII Regional Conference, and identify barriers to progress.

Without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.

During the Conference, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) launched a regional progress report that identifies hurdles to achieving gender equality in the region. The Regional Progress Report on the Montevideo Strategy, the first of its kind, recognizes successes towards achieving gender equality in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region to date. It also finds that as LAC governments prepare for Beijing+25, challenges include 1) the sheer magnitude of gender inequalities in the region and the limited State capacities available to address the issue; 2) lack of disaggregated data to analyze the issue; 3) the fact that gender inequalities manifest themselves at international, regional, national and subnational levels, and coordination is needed to renew and implement public policy across governance levels; and 4) the need to increase the budgets allotted to gender equality policies.

The Conference concluded with countries’ approval of the Santiago Commitment. The Commitment’s 48 points outline the means by which countries will accelerate implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. It welcomes the Regional Progress Report and reaffirms the commitments made in Beijing in 1995. The Commitment encourages countries to foster and promote public polices on various dimensions of gender equality including education, representation, labor participation, to measure the multiplier effects of boosting the care economy and strengthen the production of gender statistics at the national level, and to voluntarily report on progress.

At the Regional Conference’s closing session, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena said it is time to “put an end to patriarchy as a societal model.” Isabel Plá, Chile’s Minister of Women’s Affairs and Gender Equity, emphasized that “without closing the social, economic and political gaps that still affect women, we will not be able to cross the threshold of sustainable development.” The next session of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean is planned to be held in Argentina, in 2022.

Other regions have also affirmed commitments ahead of Beijing+25. UN Member States in the Asia-Pacific and Arab Regions committed to accelerate and intensify actions toward gender equality, at meetings organized in November 2019 by UN Women and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP), as well as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), which resulted in respective declarations on progress.

In Europe, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) held a review meeting from 29-30 October 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland, co-hosted with the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia. In Africa, a regional review took place from 27 October to 1 November 2019, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UN Women and the African Union Commission (AUC).

41,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/making-finance-flows-consistent-with-the-paris-agreement/,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Making Finance Flows Consistent with the Paris Agreement,"Recent discussions and reports assessing the effectiveness of climate finance flows to meet an increasing global need reveal a growing momentum for aligning such flows with the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change. In this context, the Policy Brief also discusses the European Investment Bank’s (EIB) decision to end funding fossil fuel energy projects.

EIB Ends Funding of Fossil Fuel Energy Projects

In November 2019, the EIB Board adopted a decision to end financing for fossil fuel energy projects by the end of 2021. In its energy lending policy, aimed at supporting the energy transformation, the Bank further laid out its climate action and environmental sustainability strategy and focus on support for clean energy and security.

Specifically, the policy change means that the Bank will phase out support to:

the production of oil and natural gas;

traditional gas infrastructure;

power generation technologies resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above 250 gCO2 per kWh of electricity generated; and

large-scale heat production infrastructure based on unabated oil, natural gas, coal or peat.

The Bank will potentially continue to approve gas infrastructure projects already formally under appraisal until the end of 2021, noting that switching from oil or coal to natural gas may reduce GHG emissions in the short term.

The EIB explains that it will support clean energy and security directly by: reinforcing electricity networks; reducing energy demand through energy efficiency projects or through low-carbon power generation; and deploying demand response or storage at scale. According to the policy, five principles will govern future EIB engagement in the energy sector:

Prioritizing energy efficiency with a view to supporting the new EU target under the EU Energy Efficiency Directive; Enabling energy decarbonization through increased support for low- or zero-carbon technology, aiming to meet a 32% renewable energy share throughout the EU by 2030; Increasing financing for decentralized energy production, innovative energy storage and e-mobility; Ensuring grid investment for new, intermittent energy sources like wind and solar as well as strengthening cross-border interconnections; and Increasing the impact of investment to support energy transformation outside the EU.

Furthermore, the EIB Group stated that it expects its financing to unlock EUR 1 trillion of climate action and environmental sustainable investment in the decade to 2030. The Bank will gradually increase the share of its financing dedicated to climate action and environmental sustainability to reach 50% of its operations in 2025.

Outside the EU, the Bank foresees to support energy access with the development of energy systems that are low-carbon, efficient and reliable. The Bank’s energy lending volume represents only a small fraction of the required investment outside the EU. Looking to finance projects that reinforce countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the Bank will support projects in sub-Saharan Africa, and energy transformation in other regions, in particular Asia and Latin America.

Aiming to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

Collectively, the EIB and the EU and its member States are the largest providers of public climate finance globally to developing countries, accounting for EUR 21.7 billion in 2018, including EUR 2.65 billion from the European Commission and EUR 2.97 billion from the EIB. The European Commission highlights this collective commitment, which kept increasing over the past five years, in the Fourth Biennial Report from the EU to the UNFCCC.

Like the EU, most developed country Parties have also submitted their biennial reports, as requested, by January 2020. These reports inform of Annex I Parties’: quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets; progress made towards their achievement, including information on mitigation actions and their effects, the estimates of emission reductions and removals, and the use of units from market-based mechanisms and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities; GHG emission trends and projections; and the provision of financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing country Parties.

This information is relevant for the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal as well as adaptation and finance objectives, which are expressed in general terms in the Agreement’s provision articulating its purpose. On finance, Parties agreed to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” (Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c)).The EU’s BR4 stands out in this regard as it reports on EU’s implementation of this provision.

The European Commission explains its commitment to mainstream climate change mitigation and adaptation into all major EU spending programmes, with reference to the EIB’s Energy Lending Policy and the 2020 EU budget. With total commitments set at EUR 168.7 billion, the budget was endorsed in November 2019. To meet the goal of dedicating at least 20% of EU expenditure to climate protection in the period 2014-2020, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU agreed to increase the focus on climate-related actions in several areas. These include research and development, transport and energy infrastructure and the EU’s external action. Additional funds of EUR 590 million were allocated to the EU’s LIFE programme, the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and climate action, with a budget of EUR 3.4 billion for the 2014-2020 funding period. The European Commission also informs of its pledge to report on the “at least 25%” earmarking for the next financial framework 2021-2027.

The EU’s aim to make finance flows consistent with its climate commitments involves:

revenue spending from auctioning of EU ETS allowances;

diverting subsidies under the Renewable Energy Directive for transport sector from biofuel feedstocks with high indirect land use change emissions risks;

developing metrics and monitoring methodologies to track progress concerning finance flows; and

mobilizing the private sector through sustainable finance initiative and climate-related financial disclosure requirements.

Tracking Progress on the Paris Agreement’s Long-term Finance Goal

The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) is preparing the 2020 biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows. For this purpose, the Committee has called for submissions on evidence, including a list of needed information and data, with regard to:

methodological issues relating to measuring, reporting, and verifying climate finance flows;

data on climate-related finance flows;

assessment of the effectiveness of climate finance flows, including drivers, impact results, meeting needs, and access; and

information relevant to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c).

A call for improving understanding of finance flows was also heard during discussions at the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference in December 2019. Parties’ views, however, diverged on establishing a common definition of climate finance and on commencing work on the new collective post-2025 finance goal prior to the scheduled negotiations, to commence at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020.

At its 21st meeting in October 2019, the SCF addressed the determination of the needs of developing country Parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement, which Parties had mandated the SCF to report on every four years, beginning in 2020. Prior to the meeting, the UNFCCC overhauled its Climate Finance Data Portal, which captures information, graphics and figures for a better understanding of climate finance flows, and informs of activities funded in developing countries to implement climate action, particularly financial flows that have been channeled, mobilized and leveraged by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It also presents information on Adaptation Fund project data related to entities, projects and programmes approved by the Adaptation Fund Board.

Defining Ways to Make Finance Flows Consistent with Paris Agreement

According to the findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), momentum for aligning climate finance flows with the Paris Agreement is growing. Which multilateral development banks (MDBs) will follow in the EIB’s footsteps and take measures in support of the energy transformation? In its report titled, ‘Aligning Development Co-operation and Climate Action: The Only Way Forward,’ the OECD stressed that, in the case of “development finance,” support for energy efficiency and renewables has increased since the Paris Agreement, but continues to be undermined by financing for new fossil fuel-based energy. That means multilateral providers overall, which accounted for 77% of funding of fossil fuel activities in 2016 and 2017, need to change.

The complexity of “climate finance” is illustrated by data gaps, and heated negotiations characterized by diverging views on: what constitutes “new and additional” climate funding; whether climate finance should be excluded from being counted as official development assistance (ODA); and using private sector investments to meet climate finance needs.

Nevertheless, though drafted in general terms, the Paris Agreement provision on “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” reflects a certain degree of agreement among Parties. As the wording suggests, such efforts may entail whatever lies within state power, for example regulations, green fiscal policies, and providing public sustainable development aid to cause finance to flow in the direction of carbon neutrality. Yet given the time pressure to achieve the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, some have pointed to a growing realization that while necessary, globally, public finance alone may not be sufficient. While welcome, announcements such as by the EIB to double its share of sustainable financing to 50% are not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, making palpable the need for private sector investments at scale.

Private sector stakeholders, in turn, are certainly aware of their own climate change risks, including the issue of stranded assets, as noted in recent news. Companies are beginning to change their business models, expecting future revenues from demand for low-emission products and services. How this will influence climate finance flows, however, remains to be seen. Governments will have to identify their role in transforming economies and determine how to enable a shift in economic activities. In affluent societies, this may warrant considerations of basing these activities not only on the principle of “eco-efficiency,” which focuses on increasing output per unit of input, but also “eco-sufficiency,” which requires a reduction in the consumption of energy and natural resources and in the generation of waste and emissions in absolute terms.","This Policy Brief casts these developments against Parties’ goal of “making finance flows consistent” with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The MCO and regional reviews are part of the repositioning process for the UN development system.

Mohammed is providing a series of briefings as well as written updates ahead of the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities for Development segment (OAS), which will convene in May 2020.

In the briefing at UN Headquarters on 29 January 2020, Mohammed said the regions have been “the ‘forgotten level,’ largely left untouched in previous reform efforts.” But regional assets are critical to achieve the 2030 Agenda because of the cross-border nature of today’s greatest challenges, including climate, trade, health and conflict, she said.

Mohammed reported on progress that has “significantly raised the bar” for the regional level, including:

Establishing inter-agency teams in each region, with a focus on “unpacking the five broad transformative areas” outlined in the Secretary-General’s 2019 report to ECOSOC;

Detailing the architecture of proposed regional collaboration platforms (RCPs);

Establishing a knowledge hub in each region, with the Arab region’s ‘Manara’ being the most advanced; and

Enhancing transparency at the regional level.

Mohammed said that beginning in 2021, ECOSOC will receive aggregated information on regional collaboration, a type of reporting that “does not currently exist and addresses a major gap in accountability.”

On data and statistics, regional ‘SDG Gateways’ are being established for pooling SDG data for consistent analysis and action. The first SDG Gateways will launch in March 2020 in three regions: Arab States, the Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

In late February 2020, discussions will begin with each region on their specific initiatives. The review will be finalized by late March, she said, and she will discuss work plans and transitions in her visits to each region during its upcoming SDG Forum (Regional Forum for Sustainable Development).

On the MCO review, Mohammed explained that these are offices that cover mostly small islands, which to date have had limited attention to each country’s specificities. After visiting 15 countries in 2019, the Secretariat presented recommendations for improving the UN development system’s support in MCO settings. Subsequently, an inter-agency working group and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) facilitated more specific consultations on putting each proposal into practice.

Mohammed said UN development system entities have made specific commitments including increased financing, data systems, physical presences, technical capacities, and policy advice. In addition, coordination capacities have been provided with greater resources. As a result of this process, seven countries that are serviced by the Caribbean MCO but do not have an office in country will now have a coordination office; and a road map has been created to establish a North Pacific office.

She said OHRLLS continues to hold dialogues with all countries concerned to address remaining questions on substance and process. Resident Coordinators are ensuring that “national counterparts are fully in the loop” and “there will be no implementation before the ECOSOC has the opportunity to consider all proposals” at the OAS session.

The OAS will convene from 19-21 May 2020, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The segment will review four years of implementation of the UNGA guidance contained in the 2016 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of UN system operational activities for development (QCPR), as well as progress in the repositioning of the UN development system as mandated in UNGA resolution 72/279.

The UNGA will conduct its next QCPR in late 2020. The UN Secretary-General’s report to the ECOSOC operational activities segment is also the main Secretariat input to the UNGA for its QCPR deliberations. ECOSOC’s webpage on the QCPR notes that the 2020 QCPR is “expected to build on the outcomes of the 2019 SDG Summit, thus placing an unprecedented focus on supporting Member States in accelerating progress towards the SDGs.” In addition, it notes that the UNGA will discuss the QCPR “on the heels” of the high-level event commemorating the UN’s 75th anniversary, which could position it to “give new impetus and high-level political guidance to the UN development system repositioning and its efforts to work in an effective and impactful way across peace, development, humanitarian affairs and human rights.” [UN Deputy Secretary-General’s remarks] [ECOSOC website on OAS]","UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed informed UN Member States of steps taken to strengthen the UN development system’s regional level, and its multi-country offices (MCOs) in the Caribbean and Pacific, among other updates.

As the library remains unrestricted for all to provide any relevant services, including reading, access to information and research, it is termed a 'University for Public'. Library is basically a living apparatus which preserves all the information of the past for the use of the present generation and that creates link between the past and present generation for the utilisation of information for its future generation.

The United Nations (UN) held a meeting in New York at the end of September 2019 for adoption of the 2030 Agenda with a total of 169 targets spanning economic, environmental and social development. The global body outlined a plan for all countries to actively work for making the world better for peoples, without anyone left behind.

Libraries are essential platforms for achieving such objectives. Over the last few years, International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has been actively involved in formulation of the UN 2030 Agenda, promoting inclusion of access to information, safeguarding of cultural heritage, disaster risk reduction through climate literacy, universal literacy and access to ICT (information and communications) in the system. IFLA is the leading international body representing the interests of people who rely on libraries and information professionals.

Access to information was recognised as a priority in SDG 16 (target 16.10): ensuring public access to information and safeguarding fundamental freedoms in compliance with national legislation and international agreements.

Culture (target 11.4), climate literacy (SDG-13) and ICT (targets 5b, 9c, 17.8) have also been included in the SDGs. And, universal literacy is recognised in the vision for the UN 2030 Agenda.

Libraries all over the world are reliable organisations with access to information that is necessary to drive economic opportunity and community development. In many places, a library is the only place where people have access to information that will help better education, develop new skills, find jobs, build businesses, make informed farming and health decisions, or gain insights into environmental issues.

The UN SDGs are now common goals and each country will be responsible for developing and implementing national policies to achieve them, and it is expected that it will track and report its own progress towards each goal.

HOW TO GET INVOLVED: In Bangladesh, libraries now need to demonstrate that they can accelerate change across the whole range of 2030 Agenda. Everyone within and beyond the library community can help foster the role of libraries as development supporters.

IFLA suggests that it is now vital to negotiate with government decision-makers to ensure awareness of the role of libraries as development engines, and to ensure that libraries obtain the funding needed to continue this work. Increasing visibility inside and beyond the library community by arranging events, use of the social media, websites for updating library technology and services, forums, and mailing the users are useful to demonstrate contribution of libraries to helping the country's growth.

Library associations and members should be involved in advocacy work at national and regional levels to ensure reliable public access to information through library services and programmes.

SDG FRAMEWORK: Very recently, as part of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, some 20 library members, along with other guests, gathered at the Australian Library Association (ALIA) House in Canberra to discuss goals for Australian libraries. They developed 17 SDG goals and 169 SDG targets and are divided into three sections: Priorities for Australian library services, contribution to society and Global citizenship through the prism of the people who attended the roundtable. In every section there are multiple subsections which reflect targets, explanation, role of actors to achieve the targets, indicators, measures taken by leading institutions and timeframe to achieve the goals.

Australian copyright legislation supports open access; equitable access; culture and heritage; literacy and lifelong learning.

It is unfortunate that the library associations in Bangladesh are not yet members of IFLA. It's time to be actively engaged with libraries and library associations internationally.

The fund is accepting contributions from a range of partners to meet its $50 million target size, with the Nordic Development Fund, Climate Investment Funds, and the Government of Australia providing capital for the project’s preparation.



Operations are expected to begin in Q2 2020 with investment in early stage startups focused on addressing ESG issues such as climate change and the empowerment of women. ADB Ventures has a 17-year fund life, which means it can invest long-term capital into the projects selected.



Mike Barrow, director general for private sector operations, ADB, says: “This region is brimming with technology solutions to conserve energy, reduce waste, fight climate change, and deliver public services effectively.



“Our vision is for ADB Ventures to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to achieve the SDGs by 2030.”

Impact technology solutions refer to specially designed technologies which are fundamentally aimed at making a positive impact toward ESG factors.

Barrow continues: “ADB Ventures will help bring these solutions to market by leveraging our extensive operational networks and filling the risk capital gap facing innovative early-stage companies in developing Asia and the Pacific, particularly smaller and frontier markets.”

ADB differentiates itself from a typical VC fund by going beyond the sourcing and provision of capital. ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 (the facility’s anchor trust fund) is augmented by a $12 million technical assistance program that will be deployed to the startups over three years. The program is two-pronged, with the ADB Ventures SEED grant program promoting expansion into emerging markets and the validation and de-risking of technology pilots.

The second leg of the assistance program, ADB Venture Lab provides a suite of innovation programs and will generate technology pilot opportunities to the anchor fund’s portfolio companies.



The announcement echoes a recent wave of banks and other large institutions making significant pledges to allocate resources toward sustainable ventures and re-align their portfolios to meet self-imposed carbon neutral commitments.



Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, BlackRock and JP Morgan are just a handful of industry leaders working toward these goals, some of which are also deploying impact investing funds to support environmentally focused fintechs.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), has established the ADB Ventures platform to feed investment and support to Asian startups which are developing solutions aimed at achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Organized by NITI Aayog in partnership with the North Eastern Council, Govt. of Assam, and Tata Trust, the conclave is supported by UNDP and RIS.

The inaugural session of the conclave started with an address from Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, followed by welcome remarks from Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister, Finance, Transformation & Development, Education & Health, Government of Assam. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog set the context for the Conclave, followed by Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

The three-day event, from 24 to 26 February, hinged on the premise of ‘Partnership, Cooperation and Development of North East States’, will see representation from the highest offices of all the State Governments of the north east, Central ministries, civil society organizations, academia, international development organizations and think tanks active in the north eastern region.

“India, especially the northeast region, offers unique challenges & opportunities. The solutions need interventions that bring disruptive change and, thus, fostering a tech-embedded development trajectory is of paramount importance,” said NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.

Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, focused on the need for mainstreaming the northeastern region in the national development agenda and identification of state specific and region specific priorities as key to SDG localisation.

“Several north eastern states rank on the top of NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index and the region is India’s bridge to South East Asia, and this presents immense opportunity for trade & commerce,” said Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

Chief Ministers of North Eastern states also addressed the inaugural session of the SDG Conclave. “In the coming days, we will partner will NITI Aayog for strengthening our resolve for SDGs. We have identified 145 state indicators linked to the CM dashboard, which has been monitoring the State’s progress for the last 2 years,” said Pema Khandu, CM of Arunachal Pradesh.

“With the financial help from the Central Government, as well as monitoring the progress made by north eastern states of India, I believe the SDGs can certainly be achieved,” said Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga.

“Through SDG Conclave 2020, we now have a regional space to learn from each other and from the rest of India. Sustainability is important for Himalayan states like Sikkim and how we harness our natural resources,” said Prem Singh Tamang, CM of Sikkim.

Chief Minister of Tripura, Biplab Kumar Deb, presented a goal wise analysis of Tripura’s progress towards achieving the ambitious Agenda 2030 by linking existing schemes and programmes.

“Guwahati will play a crucial role as it is India’s gateway to Southeast Asia. Together, with NITI Aayog’s support, we will continue our journey in ensuring the prosperity of the region and its people,” put forth Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam.

In his keynote address, Union Minister of State (MoS), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jitendra Singh, said, “When India becomes a $5 trillion economy, the north east will be an essential component”.

Another key highlight was the release of reports on challenges, prospects, and SDG best practices. The four reports released were: Compendium of State Indicator Frameworks of 8 North Eastern States; North East and SDGs by RIS and Tata Trusts; Stories of Change by Tata Trusts; and Best Practices Portfolio on North East by UNDP.

Crysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

Benjamin de Haan, SDG director of transportation and planning services told council on Feb. 18 that he was very satisfied with the tenders that had been received for the project.

“Here it is finally, after all this time we’re here awarding the project for the Crysler Bridge,” he said. We’re very happy with the price. This is a full rehabilitation of the bridge and it is on budget.”

The project will see the county spend $1,533,000 on the rehabilitation, plus the harmonized sales tax. Tenders for the project had initially been issued last year, but every one of them had been over budget. This resulted in SDG staff modifying the project, cutting down on its cost.

“Last year’s low bid was $1.9 million and our budget was of $1.2 million,” said de Haan. “So we obviously made adjustments to the tender, as you can see. Some of those changes include extending the construction schedule.”","Article contentCrysler residents shouldn’t be surprised to see rehabilitation work undertaken on their bridge in the coming months.

47,https://taarifa.rw/beyond-policy-and-public-investment-the-sdg-imperative-for-business/,"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Taarifa Rwanda,Beyond policy And Public Investment: The SDG Imperative For Business,"The immediate implication of a chasm which public information management in Nigeria has successfully created between the government and the people is that the country now has two major debating groups.

The first group is made up of those who adversely criticize whatever President Muhammadu Buhari does or fails to do, while the second group consists of those who see no wrong whatsoever in the activities of Buhari’s government.

The two groups have something in common which is that most Nigerians do not understand either of them.

Perhaps because both groups are unaware of this situation, they have continued to seize every opportunity to eloquently disagree with one another on every subject so as to convince us that they have good points either way.

So, when Edo state governor Godwin Obaseki last week painted a frightening picture but which looks like a true story of the precarious Nigerian economy, the resultant huge war of words between the pro and anti-Buhari crusaders especially the non-state actors could not have surprised any analyst who has followed street debates in the country.

As if to sensitize people on the state of the nation’s economy, Obaseki had raised an alarm that our finances have gone so low that last month,government had to print more money for states to share to meet their obligations.

This was unacceptable to some people who decided to react to the allegation. First, was an unsigned statement that government was unaware of any printing of money as alleged. One comedian immediately tweeted that “the man didn’t say you were aware, he said you printed.

”The second reaction described the governor’s alarm as a lie while the third educated us on the correct terminology for what happened – lending, not printing. Painfully, what should be of concern to us has been buried by the controversy.

The fact that what was shared was a form of loan seems to establish that there was not enough to share. Whether the extra that was borrowed was printed or conjured by a magician cannot controvert the fact that Nigeria is hugely broke.

If such truth must be told to put our status in correct perspective, then Obaseki’s alarm can hardly be wished away especially if his entire statement and not just theexcerpt on printing is read in full.

Indeed, there are vital parts of the statement that have been ignored. For the benefit of those who may not have read Obaseki’s statement, here is a crucial aspect that ought not to be downplayedor discountenanced.

According to the governor, “everywhere else, governments rely on the people to produce taxes and that is what they use to run the local government, state and the federation.

But with the way we run Nigeria, the country can go to sleep. At the end of the month, we just go to Abuja, collect money and we come back to spend.

We are in trouble, huge financial trouble. The current price of crude oil is only a mirage. The major oil companies who are the ones producing are no longer investing much in oil.

Shell is pulling out of Nigeria and Chevron is now one of the world’s largest investors in alternative fuel, so in another year or so, where will we find this money that we go to share in Abuja?”

This quotation is no doubt a veritable wake-up call for us all to rise to the occasion and change our spending habit.

This is more so when the governor also clearly stated that it would be unfair for Nigerians to expect one man – Buhari, to be left alone to face the enormous problems.

In other words, the governor’s statement created no room for claims and counter claims amongst politicians or supporters.

It is also important to make the point that this is not the first time some of us are getting confused about the internal sources of Nigeria’s colossal loans.

Last month, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) announced that his corporation could no longer bear the huge subsidy payments of over N120 billion monthly subsidy for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS).

The NNPC according to Kyari has been absorbing the cost differential between the actual and selling cost of the product by recording it in its financial books.

Not many understood the statement. From which of its books does NNPC get such huge sums every month?

If NNPC had been paying all its funds into the Federation Account as legally expected what magic does the Corporation employ to accommodate massive subsidy payments; is it by merely writing the amounts in its books?

Indeed, during the peak of the Covid 19 pandemic, there were certain expenses which Nigeria was too broke to accommodate and which both the NNPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), graciously accepted to co-settle.

Do these two bodies have their own supply of funds? Answers to a question such as this may illuminate the state of Nigeria’s finances Is Nigeria really in financial trouble, if so, to what extent?

The latest answer to this question was given a few days ago by Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed who said “the nation’s debt profile was still within sustainable limit.”

The statement was quite comforting on its face value but the situation on ground appears to counter it because if we still have capacity to borrow more, why not go ahead and resolve the numerous issues waiting to be settled?

From basic economics we can imagine that our current inflation rate reflects a decline in the purchasing power of our naira which is itself not available to many. Only last week, the National Bureau of Statistics released her consumer price index (CPI) for March 2021.

In the report,inflation was said to have risen to 18% in March representing 0.82% when compared to 17% recorded in February.

Similarly, food inflation rose by 5.0% to 23% in March from 22 percent in February. The report is worth worrying about especially as the scarce funds available are swallowed by personnel costs across the nation. How do we develop?

The body language of the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele at the press conference where he was requested to react to Obaseki’s comment, showed he was visibly upset that his sacrifices do not appear appreciated.

Of course no responsible CBN can watch her nation in trouble without intervening. Again, no one doubts that our CBN has never been this stressed in history.

Governor Emefiele must take solace in the fact that he has been able to withstand the vagaries of the economic weather of Nigeria in the last couple of troublesome years.

To say that Nigeria is super broke is not an indictment but telling the truth about our situation for general enlightenment.

One of the advantages of educating people on the true status of our economy is that it can have an effect on the increasing demands by different striking Nigerian workers on all kinds of expectations.

What displeases Nigerians is not the disclosure of the true state of their nation’s economy but the transparent inequity where at this critical stage, some people still enjoy wardrobe, newspaper or other forms of annoying comfort while others are dying.

For the first time in eight years, the Cornwall Collegiate Golden Raiders are senior girls volleyball champs in SDG.

The Golden Raiders won the tri-county AA title on their home court on Tuesday, defeating the visiting St. Joseph’s Panthers in an exciting championship match that required four sets.

The Golden Raiders, coached by Ian Wilson, took the first set 25-12, but the Panthers would rally and get even with a 25-21 win in the second game. Cornwall Collegiate went back out in front with a 25-15 decision in the third set. The fourth set was tight, 22-21, but the Golden Raiders were able to get on a run and pull away to a 25-22 victory.

“We traded points back and forth before we were able to pull away (down the stretch),” Wilson said.

It was somewhat of an unlikely local conclusion for the Golden Raiders, who had to overcome a considerable amount of adversity this winter.

“Our season started with three girls on the injured list, with sprained ankles, dislocated knees and wisdom teeth surgery,” Wilson said.

But, when everyone was available, the Golden Raiders were a force, charging to an 8-2 regular season record.

Their next challenge will be on Wednesday, playing at the eastern Ontario championships in Pembroke. The winner of the tournament will move on to the OFSAA provincials to be played early in March.","Article contentFor the first time in eight years, the Cornwall Collegiate Golden Raiders are senior girls volleyball champs in SDG.

It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

The report describes growing investor appetite to benchmark companies against each other in terms of their SDG performance.

The report titled, ‘Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Emerging Trends and Analysis of the SDG Impact of Companies in the S&P 500,’ underscores that the SDGs have become a popular means of communicating a company’s sustainability efforts, and that SDG-aligned language in reporting can attract capital. The S&P 500 is an index measuring the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.

Trucost maps four recent surveys of corporate SDG reporting, conducted by: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) & DNV GL; GlobeScan – SustainAbility; Oxfam; and KPMG. These studies find that many companies report on SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13 (climate action).

However, these Goals do not completely align with companies’ “SDG risk.” The Trucost authors define “SDG risk” as the risk that a company may be directly or indirectly causing a negative impact on the Goal in question, or the risk that a company is dependent on a practice or activity that is in conflict with that Goal. The evaluation of companies’ SDG exposure captures a baseline level of risk related to private sector activities in particular industries and countries.

Trucost modelled the risk exposure of companies listed in the S&P 500 using 45 metrics based on the SDGs’ 169 targets. The resulting analysis shows that key risks for these companies lie in issues relating to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Three of the four surveys find that SDG 15 is one of the least prioritized by businesses. The only area of alignment between reporting and risk is in SDG 13, as companies are increasingly disclosing data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as their climate change risks and strategies.

In mapping SDG risk for the metals and mining, technology and media, and real estate sectors, as well as the S&P 500 as a whole, the report delineates within each of these sectors the SDG exposure of operations versus first-tier suppliers.

The report suggests that businesses can prioritize action and contribute to the 2030 Agenda through the sale of SDG-aligned products and services, including recycled steel, renewable energy, green building, and natural and organic cosmetics.

52,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/asia-pacific-off-track-20-of-sdg-indicators-predicted-to-be-worse-in-2030/,"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Asia-Pacific Off Track: 20% of SDG Indicators Predicted to be Worse in 2030,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has released its annual SDG progress report, finding that the region’s performance is “poor” on most measurable environmental targets. The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

Our relationship with forests is a prime example.

Forests are among the most biodiverse of Earth’s ecosystems. They sequester carbon and help to mitigate against climate change. They protect watersheds and help to control soil erosion. And yet, around 11% of carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation and forest degradation, which is second only to the energy sector.

The 21st of March was the International Day of Forests, and it convened under the theme of forests and biodiversity. This is fitting in 2020, the beginning of a critical decade for the planet. There will be landmark moments early in the decade, including the anticipated adoption of a new post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

The United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) is a Centre of global excellence in biodiversity. Over the past 10 years, we have been closely involved with REDD+, an initiative under the climate change convention (UNFCCC) that aims to support developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to promote the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of forests. Working closely with the UN-REDD Programme, we help countries to plan for and access results-based payments for these actions.

In work led by UNEP-WCMC, the UN-REDD Programme has supported over 20 developing countries to analyze where REDD+ actions could result in multiple benefits beyond carbon. Through spatial analyses carried out in close collaboration with national partners, countries have been empowered to identify areas that have potential for forest conservation, restoration and sustainable management, and can also help secure a range of additional important benefits for people and planet.

These analyses have shown how sustainable forest practices across the planet can contribute to a wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals.

One such example is Costa Rica. The National REDD+ Secretariat, together with FONAFIFO (the country’s National Forestry Financing Fund) and the UN-REDD Programme used spatial analyses to explore where REDD+ actions could help secure benefits beyond carbon, such as enhanced water regulation to support communities vulnerable to water stress, the potential for socio-economic improvements from forest-dependent livelihoods, and from ecotourism.

The work emphasized areas of overlap between the National REDD+ Strategy and spatial priorities for Costa Rica’s other objectives, such as national development, restoration and biodiversity conservation. Considering these benefits when planning and implementing REDD+ will help progress towards SDGs 1 (No Poverty); 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation); 13 (Climate Action); and 15 (Life on Land), among others.

More recently, this work also featured in the development of Costa Rica’s Gender Action Plan (contributing to SDG 5 on Gender Equality). Spatial layers showing the proportion of women by district contributed additional insight and helped to highlight districts where women could act as conservation agents, support efforts to reduce forest fires, and undertake reforestation activities.

Another example is Côte d’Ivoire, where we collaborated with the country’s REDD+ Permanent Executive Secretariat and the Swiss Scientific Research Centre to develop a forest restoration opportunities map. This combined potential benefits, such as carbon density, soil erosion risk and species richness, with obstacles to forest restoration, such as infrastructure development and high human land use. The resulting map shows areas with higher potential and lower obstacles, and thus where forest restoration could be most effective and have the most positive impacts. This could include contributing to SDGs such as SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land).

This type of analysis can identify where agroforestry actions are feasible to guide implementation of Côte d’Ivoire’s National REDD+ Strategy, promoting the use of agroforestry to strengthen agricultural systems’ resilience to climate change, and to diversify incomes for farmers. There is also an opportunity to align REDD+ and private sector cocoa initiatives, with the potential to create more incentives for smallholder farmers and contribute to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), among others.

Meanwhile in Viet Nam, lessons from the National REDD+ Programme are informing the development of a deforestation-free jurisdiction in the Central Highlands. This region is at the forefront of efforts to conserve natural forests and other biodiversity, while sustaining production of high-value crops like coffee. Both nationally and locally, partners are seeking to promote sustainable land management and pilot a deforestation-free approach in the region in support of SDGs 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

These individual examples give us just a snapshot of how retaining, restoring and sustainably managing our forests can help achieve a wide variety of SDGs and bring a range of benefits for people and for nature. As this year’s International Day of Forests slogan put it, our forests are too precious to lose.

Landsvirkjun has signed an agreement with US and UK institutional investors to issue USD 80 million senior unsecured notes in the US Private Placement (“USPP”) market. The issue reiterates Landsvirkjun’s focus on sustainability-linked financing, linking the pricing of the notes to the company’s carbon sequestration targets, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 13 on climate action.

The offering was very well received, with an order book which was multiple times oversubscribed. The attractiveness of this funding opportunity was enhanced by the ability of the US and UK investors to provide short-dated notes in a favourable rate environment. The notes have a 3-year maturity and carry a fixed interest rate of 2.51%, with semi-annual payments. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

The issuance demonstrates Landsvirkjun’s continued commitment and focus on sustainable development and follows the execution of a USD 150 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2019 and the successful placing of a USD 200 million green bond in the USPP market in 2018.





First European SDG-linked USPP

Landsvirkjun is the first issuer in Europe of an SDG-linked USPP. The USPP is understood to be one of the first SDG-linked issuances in Europe overall and underscores Landsvirkjun’s innovation and leadership in this fast-moving space.

As part of the transaction, Landsvirkjun has committed to increase its carbon sequestration efforts to reach at least 32,538 tons of CO 2 eq. for 2020 (up by at least 2% from 31,900 tons CO 2 eq. for 2019). The USPP is directly tied to this commitment whereas the annual coupon will increase by 10 bps if Landsvirkjun fails to achieve this target. The target forms part of Landsvirkjun’s strategy to become carbon neutral by 2025.

Barclays acted as Sole Placement Agent in this transaction. Landsvirkjun’s legal advisors were Logos and Morrison & Foerster. The funders’ legal advisor was Greenberg Traurig.





Hörður Arnarson, CEO of Landsvirkjun:

“We are pleased with our second successful issuance in the USPP market and the support that we have received from our investor group. The private placement provides further diversification of funding sources and demonstrates our ability to access financing on attractive terms. As sustainability and the environment are core to our social responsibility initiatives, we are proud to have issued the first SDG-linked USPP in Europe, which further reinforces our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.”





Landsvirkjun

Landsvirkjun is owned by the Icelandic State. The company generates about 75% of all electricity used in Iceland from 100% renewable energy sources, hydro, geothermal and wind. The company operates eighteen power stations; fifteen hydropower stations and three geothermal power stations, as well as two wind turbines.

There is overwhelming evidence that the Asia-Pacific region needs to accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and substantially reverse current negative trends, especially those which are depleting and degrading its environmental resources, according to a new report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020 draws attention to the region’s poor performance on most of the measurable environmental targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example, the share of renewable energy has dropped to 16 per cent, one of the lowest rates globally. The region also emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas - a number which has doubled since 2000. 35 per cent of countries continue to lose their forests.

“Our analysis finds that the Asia-Pacific region has struggled the most with two Goals: advancing responsible consumption and production, and climate action. In fact, the region is not even moving in the right direction,” underscored United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.

“These findings sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies,” added Ms. Alisjahbana.

On a positive note, many countries are moving decisively and showing remarkable progress in improving the quality of education (Goal 4) and providing access to affordable and clean energy (Goal 7). The Report suggests that achieving these two Goals is well within reach. The region is also making good progress on targets related to economic growth. Real GDP per capita growth in the Asia-Pacific was more than double the world average in 2017, and at the same time, at least 18 countries in the region are experiencing less income inequality.

Yet, to grow more sustainably and equitably, the current economic progress of the region must be coupled with human well-being and a healthy environment. Progress has been far too slow in areas such as gender equality (Goal 5) and building sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). ESCAP warns that the region remains unlikely to meet any of the 17 SDGs by 2030 without concerted and extra efforts from all stakeholders.

Progress has also been uneven across the five Asia-Pacific subregions, most especially in reducing inequalities (Goal 10), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), and peace, justice and strong institutions (Goal 16). A positive example of collective progress across all five subregions however is on access to electricity, where steady improvement is noticeable, particularly in rural areas.

Data availability for the SDG indicators has substantially increased over the past few years in Asia and the Pacific, from 25 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent in 2020. But data is still lacking on over half of the SDG indicators, especially those Goals with slow progress. This, according to ESCAP, highlights the urgent need to strengthen the policy-data nexus in the region.

A flagship annual publication produced by ESCAP, in partnership with five other UN agencies, the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report uses the latest data for global SDG indicators to determine where additional effort is needed in the region and where momentum for future progress is building.

In some areas, work is shifting to alternative virtual formats, such as the UN’s Fifth Committee on administrative and budgetary matters.

By early March, a number of announcements regarding the postponement or cancellation of meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic had been made. The UN Commission on the Status of Women held a historically short meeting for its 64th session, convening for a half-day on 9 March 2020 to adopt a political declaration before suspending. The CSW usually brings together thousands of participants the world for a two-week session and hundreds of side events.

Also acting early to adjust major plans were the World Bank and IMF, which transitioned the annual Spring Meetings scheduled for mid-April to a virtual format. The World Bank announced that it would cancel or postpone “all major events and conferences until further notice,” including the cancellation of the 2020 Land and Poverty Conference scheduled for 16-20 March. In cancelling the 19th session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which was scheduled for April 2020, members of the Forum noted the “already precarious health situation that many indigenous peoples live in, and the imperative to avoid adverse impacts.”

On 10 March, the ECOSOC Youth Forum and a Youth Plenary in preparation for the UN’s 75th anniversary were postponed. On 11 March, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to postpone the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 4) on an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), with new dates to be determined (decision 74/543). IGC 4 had been scheduled to convene from 23 March to 3 April. UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also announced that two high-level events would not go forward: the High-level Interactive Panel on Anti-microbial Resistance, scheduled for 14 April 2020; and the High-level event to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, scheduled for 24 April 2020.

On 11 March, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) circulated a list of proposed changes to the Council’s meeting calendar, inviting Member States’ views. She subsequently announced instead, “we need to remain flexible.”

On 17 March, the UNGA President announced that in-person, formal meetings of the UNGA “should not be organized at this time.” He suggested that the UNGA adopt any essential decisions via silence procedure, and agreeing on a simple procedure for postponing meetings. By a separate letter, he said he had decided to cancel all in-person meetings of the UNGA’s mandated processes for the 74th session that are scheduled to be held up to 17 April 2020, stating that, “These processes will conduct their activities via alternative mechanisms.” On mandated UNGA events scheduled for after 17 April 2020, he said discussions are ongoing.

The UNGA President said officials are considering alternative ways to adopt key decisions (instead of in-person meetings), and that the UNGA’s Fifth Committee has “successfully started conducting informal meetings via the UN’s Video Conference Tool (VCT).” ECOSOC, too, is exploring virtual options and solutions, according to the President’s statement on 18 March.

Additional ECOSOC meetings and events have been postponed or cancelled, as follows:

The 19th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), 30 March-3 April: Postponed

2020 ECOSOC Partnership Forum, 3 April: Cancelled

2020 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum), 20-23 April: Postponed until after April 2020

SDG Investment Fair, 20-22 April: Cancelled

Other ECOSOC meetings that fall within the eight-week timeframe are:

The UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), 4-8 May; and

The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum), 12-13 May.

Later in May, the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) is scheduled for 14-15 May, and the ECOSOC segment on Operational Activities for Development (OAS) is planned to convene from 19-21 May.

Negotiations on outcome documents of upcoming meetings, such as the ministerial declaration of the HLPF/high-level segment of ECOSOC in July 2020, may not take place in person.

Four out of five of the UN regions have had to postpone their annual regional fora for sustainable development or switch to a virtual format. The exception is the UN Economic Commission for Africa, which convened the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) from 24-27 February 2020. These regional sessions comprise an important part of the preparations for the July session of the HLPF.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) has been organizing preparations for the fifth UN conference on the LDCs, which will convene in Qatar in 2021 (UNLDC-V). Regional review meetings to inform these preparations have been postponed both for Africa, in Malawi, and Asia-Pacific, in Bangladesh.

On climate change, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is not organizing in-person meetings until the end of April 2020 and official missions have been suspended. The regional climate weeks have been postponed, as has the 2020 NAP Expo among other planned meetings. The Adaptation Committee will meet virtually instead of its in-person meeting from 24-27 March.

On biodiversity, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced the postponement of a number of meetings, including the 24th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice of the CBD and the third Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation of the CBD. Both of these meetings are expected to feed into the preparations for the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is scheduled to take place in October 2020, in China and is expected to adopt a global biodiversity framework for the post-2020 period.

On chemicals and waste management, the fourth meeting of the intersessional process for Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 was postponed, having been scheduled to convene in Bucharest, Romania, from 23-27 March 2020. The meeting will feed into the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), which is scheduled to take place from 5-9 October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.

The Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm has announced that an upcoming meeting in Ottawa, Canada and an upcoming meeting in Rome, Italy have been suspended, while the first meeting of the small intersessional working group on the strategic framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention for 2012–2021, scheduled for 31 March to 2 April 2020, will take place online. Preparations are continuing for the 2020 COP meetings of each convention, and a final decision will be made five weeks before the scheduled dates. These meetings, all scheduled to convene in Geneva, are:

Meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention, 9 June 2020

Meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention, 10 June 2020

12th meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel Convention (OEWG-12), 22-25 June 2020

58,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/icao-identifies-six-eligible-carbon-offsetting-programmes-for-aviation-industry/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICAO Identifies Six Eligible Carbon-Offsetting Programmes for Aviation Industry,"Recent meetings organized under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency established in 1944 to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), addressed steps by ICAO to address the aviation industry’s negative environmental externalities.

At the ICAO Council meeting, which convened from 2-20 March 2020, in Montréal, Canada, the Council adopted a standard to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health, and took further decisions on implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA is a market-based mechanism adopted in 2016 to achieve ICAO’s goals of increasing fuel efficiency by 2% per year and carbon-neutral growth of civil aviation from 2020 onwards. The mechanism aims to cap aviation’s future emissions growth by obliging airlines to buy offsets, rather than reducing their aircraft emissions.

The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase. These six programmes are:

American Carbon Registry

China Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Voluntary Emission Reduction Program

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)

Climate Action Reserve

The Gold Standard

Verified Carbon Standard

The Council’s decision follows recommendations by the Technical Advisory Body (TAB), which it established and tasked with evaluating whether carbon-offsetting programs satisfy the eight CORSIA Emissions Unit Eligibility Criteria (EUCs). Public comments were also received, including from experts at Europe-based research institutes Öko-Institut, Perspectives, and Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), who published their analysis of 14 carbon-offsetting programs in October 2019.

In accordance with TAB’s recommendations on “eligibility timeframe” and “unit date eligibility,” the emissions units are issued to activities that commenced as of 1 January 2016, and in respect of emissions reductions occurring through 31 December 2020, subject to each programme’s scope of eligibility. The list of eligible emissions units will eventually be publicly available on the ICAO CORSIA website.

In its assessment and recommendation of programmes, TAB highlighted the following criteria:

Permanence: Carbon offset credits must represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or carbon sequestration that are permanent, whereby any given risk of reductions or removals being reversed require that either such credits are not eligible or measures are in place to monitor, mitigate, and compensate incidences of material leakage.

Additionality: Carbon offset programmes must generate units that represent emissions reductions, avoidance, or removals that are additional, including that they exceed any GHG reduction or removals required by law, regulation, or legally binding mandate.

Avoidance of double counting towards mitigation obligations: Measures must be in place to avoid double issuance, double use, and double claiming such as could occur by claims from both an airline and the host country of the emissions reduction activity.

Monitoring, reporting and verification: Emissions reduction is calculated in a conservative and transparent manner, verified by an accredited independent entity prior to issuance of offset credits, which should be based on accurate measurements and monitored on a regular basis.

Public disclosure of sustainable development: A programme should list the criteria used regarding alignment with the SDGs.

The selected programmes performed differently, and none perfectly against all EUCs, the TAB recommendations and expert submissions reveal. TAB underscores that various programmes “made substantial progress” towards addressing certain shortcomings, or have “indicated willingness to put in place measures to ensure consistency with the EUCs.” Still, experts proposed that programmes be approved only provisionally until they satisfy all EUCs, to avoid risks for CORSIA’s integrity. Experts also called on ICAO to provide further clarity on which global warming potential values the programmes should use when issuing CORSIA eligible offset credits.

The January 2020 report from TAB recommends that the Council request from most of the eligible carbon-offsetting programs further specified actions following its decision, with the exception of the CDM. This is because the future of registered CDM activities is still being negotiated in the context of the rules, modalities, procedures, and guidelines for Article 6 (cooperative approaches) of the Paris Agreement on climate change. International guidance on the transition of the CDM is needed since all participating Paris Agreement parties will have to correspondingly adjust their emission levels and targets upon transfer of mitigation outcomes to avoid double counting.

On using carbon offset credits under CORSIA, experts hope that Paris Agreement parties will provide clarity on:

How emission reductions not covered by Parties’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) should be treated;

What key elements are necessary for letters of attestation and authorization by host countries to confirm avoidance of double counting so the units can be used under CORSIA;

How additionality of activities can be proven; and

What actions should trigger corresponding adjustments to account for the use of offset credits under CORSIA.

The ICAO Council also improved its environmental standards to reduce civil aviation impacts on local air quality and human health. Environmental and health impact assessments of aircraft engine emissions rely on Particulate Matter (PM) characteristics such as number, size, and composition, but reported PM emissions data varied due to different sampling protocols and methodologies used. For emission certification purposes, measurement methodologies needed to be standardized. Engine manufacturers use certification of aircraft engines for non-volatile PM (nvPM) emissions.

At its March 2020 meeting, the ICAO Council adopted a “non-volatile PM (nvPM) mass and number Standard” for aircraft engines. The standard applies to engine designs of rated thrust greater than 26.7 Kilonewton and will govern both new and in-production engines from 2023 onwards. ICAO aims to ensure that only the most effective nvPM reduction technologies are employed in post-2023 aircraft engine designs.","The ICAO Council also decided on the carbon-offsetting programmes and emissions units eligible for CORSIA’s 2021-2023 pilot phase.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite implementation challenges, there is evidence of “significant progress” in several areas, including waste management.

The ‘Tuvalu Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026’ is the main national policy framework to guide the management of waste in the country with the vision of having “A Cleaner and Healthier Tuvalu for today and future generations.”

The Policy and Action Plan acknowledges that its development is a “timely response to the significant changes happening in the waste sector in the Pacific Region and globally.” These changes include an increase in waste generated on the islands that has come about due to a proliferation of consumption of “more wasteful imported products,” according to the Plan. Excess waste presents a significant challenge, considering the “extremely limited land mass” of atoll countries such as Tuvalu.

The Policy and Action Plan, endorsed by the Government of Tuvalu in 2016, consists of six goals:

Strengthened institutional systems to address gaps in waste management;

The stakeholders fully understand the merits of proper waste management and co-share the responsibility of managing waste;

Establish strong public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the delivery of waste services;

Delivered waste services follow best practice and are cost-effective;

Enhanced capacity of waste practitioners; and

Waste activity outcomes are reported and disseminated to relevant stakeholders.

The last goal of the Policy and Action Plan is achieved, in part, through the conduct of annual reviews of the implementation status of the Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan. Since 2016, two annual reviews have been conducted. The latest one was released in May 2019, and covers the period from January 2018 to March 2019.

The 2019 Annual Review reports that despite challenges to implementation of the Waste Policy and Action Plan, there is evidence of “significant progress” especially on goals two, three, and five due to the Department of Waste Management elevating these to the national level with the support of key stakeholders. The report also outlines progress on achieving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as: review existing waste-related legislation and merge into one Act; develop specific regulations to support strict enforcement of the new waste legislation; allocate reasonable budget for waste services; implement public awareness programmes involving communities and schools in all waste service areas in the Tuvaluan language; reduce occupational and public health and safety incidents by 50%; 100% coverage of collection in the main island and at least 80% coverage of collection in the outer islands; and exploration and participation in information exchange programmes with other countries within and outside the region.

Tuvalu is aiming to transform towards a circular economy as the country sees it as the only way to address the increasing amount of waste that ends up in landfills annually and to achieve SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols. To do so, Tuvalu is strengthening engagement with the private sector in order to explore opportunities to reduce the amount of disposable waste and to ensure that all recyclable waste is shipped overseas for proper treatment and processing.

Tuvalu is also actively engaged in the EU-funded Pacific Waste Management Programme (PacWastePlus), implemented by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), to further strengthen the country’s waste management. This project especially focuses on e-waste streams as a national waste priority, and provides technical assistance in Tuvalu’s transition towards a circular economy. The PacWastePlus programme, which is working with 14 Pacific countries and Timor-Leste, has a strong focus on improving data collection, information sharing, and education and awareness. The project also works with countries on developing and implementing policies and regulatory frameworks, implementing best practices to enhance private sector engagement and infrastructure development, and human capacity.

Yet the 2019 Annual Review recognizes that the enforcement of government waste management-related legislation, regulations, and policies is “generally weak,” which is related to a lack public awareness and education programmes carried out thus far. The report outlines emergent waste issues of importance for Tuvalu such as marine litter, healthcare waste, asbestos, and sewage and sludge. To mitigate these emergent issues, the Annual Review recommends the incorporation in the refined action plan 2017-2021 of measures, including:

Enforcement of law on illegal dumping along the coastline;

Regular monitoring of ships’ compliance with waste management standards;

Enforcement of law on littering;

Putting in place a proper healthcare waste management system;

Public awareness and education on asbestos features and their locations in Tuvalu;

Installation of a proper treatment system for sewage and sludge; and

Women groups taking the lead on addressing illegal dumping and littering problems.

Finally, the Annual Review cautions that, due to the nature of the policy goals, it will take time to realize some of the impacts, particularly those related to the need to change people’s attitudes to waste.

The report aims to inform the region’s progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.

Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones. In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework. She also provided an oral update to the report, noting that on indicator 3.8.1, the refinement has been changed to “coverage of essential health services,” meaning that the indicator “basically goes back to what it was before.”

She also highlighted that:

The IAEG proposes establishing a working group for measuring development support more broadly than through official development assistance (ODA) – “total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD)”. An additional indicator on TOSSD had been proposed during the comprehensive review process, but members differed over the methodology. The Group agreed to work further on this potential indicator for submission to the Commission in 2022, and to establish a working group to this end.

Data disaggregation is a main area of work for 2020, to ensure “no one is left behind,” and the IEAG aims to develop guidelines on tools and methodologies on data disaggregation and to help build national capacity; and

The Group has issued a report on interlinkages between the Goals and targets both statistically and through a policy and legislation lens, to support deeper analysis of the 2030 Agenda.

Member States, some of whom are IAEG members, made numerous remarks. Several welcomed the fact that the changes to the framework had been limited so as not to increase the overall burden on national statistical organizations, while increasing the quality of the framework. Some expressed support for specific changes, such as the addition of an indicator on civil justice (16.3.3), the additional of an indicator on total greenhouse gas emissions per year (indicator 13.2.2), and in a revision to indicator 15.9.1, the integration of biodiversity into national accounting under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.

Speakers expressed concern on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on employment in sustainable tourism.

On other changes, the speakers expressed concern, including on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on the proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs. China voiced concern about, among others, the addition of the GHG emissions indicator, noting that the global response to climate change should focus on equity and preserve each country’s equal right to development.

The United Arab Emirates suggested “cancelling” all indicators that remain in Tier 3, given the relatively short time left to implement them. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) lamented the lack of an indicator for older persons under SDG target 2.2. on malnutrition.

The African Group recommended reinforced collaboration and coordination with regional commissions. Others called for improved coordination between the custodian agencies for the indicators and national governments.

Revisiting the discussion on 6 March 2020 with the aim of approving the Commission’s report on the proposed changes (E/CN3/2020/L.3, draft decision 1), many delegations reiterated their concern about deleting indicator 8.9.2 on sustainable tourism employment.

The Director of the UN Statistics Division Stefan Schweinfest recalled that the comprehensive review process had been lengthy and “very complex” and had resulted in a “package deal.” This would make reconsidering the decision on one indicator a “dangerous path,” he said, urging delegations to accept the premise of a compromise. Speaking on the “painful” impacts of deleting 8.9.2, Suriname urged that the report reflect that “part of the Commission does not accept this…. Some countries are saying this is not okay.”

The report of the IAEG was adopted as orally revised, and it “agreed to and adopted the proposed major changes and minor refinements … while noting concerns regarding specific indicators, and recognized that the work on SDG indicators is work in progress.” The amended text also indicates that the IAEG is requested to continue its annual refinement, research and methodological work including on “policy issues such as sustainable tourism and climate change.”

Another oral revision to the report adds wording on “the importance of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for SDG monitoring.”

At the closing of the 51st session, Commission Chair Shigeru Kawasaki (Japan) expressed satisfaction that “the SDG indicator framework is advancing, although there is still some room for improvement … we are in a very promising situation.” [Meeting webcast, 3 March 2020] [Meeting webcast, 6 March 2020]","The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs.

The VNRs are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its 17 SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) each year in July.

The panel discussion took place on 10 March 2020, as part of the TAP-UNDP initiative to create a resource for stakeholders involved in post-VNR activities on SDG 16. The resource is expected to be published later in 2020.

Mechanisms established for a country’s VNR process should continue their work following the presentation.

Joern Geisselmann, Partners for Review (P4R), identified trends and country experiences following a VNR presentation. Among the lessons learned, he said VNRs should not only review past implementation, but also agree on next steps. Immediate action should be taken after the VNR as a follow-up step, such as reporting to parliament and/or the media. Geisselmann also suggested institutionalizing any mechanisms established for the VNR process, to continue their work following the presentation to the HLPF.

He reported that in some countries that have conducted VNRs, follow-up activities have included:

Georgia introduced an SDG architecture, including a multi-stakeholder SDG Council, thematic working groups and an Annual Forum to share and debate experiences related to SDG implementation;

Germany established an annual Sustainability Forum as a multi-stakeholder dialogue forum organized by the Chancellery;

Mexico involved the Ministry of Finance in a process to map all applicable budget lines and programs with SDG indicators; and

Mongolia conducted a systems analysis of drivers, bottlenecks and impacts, and developed short- and long-term actions to tackle air pollution.

Margarita Cano of SEGEPLAN, Guatemala’s State planning body (Secretaría de Planificación y Programación de la Presidencia), discussed her country’s efforts to mainstream and implement SDG 16 and the 2030 Agenda following its first VNR in 2017 and second in 2019. She reported that after the 2017 presentation, the government changed its approach from government-led to whole-of-society, engaging local governments, civil society organizations, the private sector and congress. This enabled the government to collect far more usable data than it had in 2017.

Following its 2019 VNR, the ministry incorporated the results of the review as it developed goals for the next four years.

Peter van Sluijs, Civil Society Platform for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (CSPPS), said the VNRs have been “seen as an end product” rather that a means to determine actions needed for further results. He observed that, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries, if a country does not fully utilize its consultative processes to develop its view of progress, the VNR is not being used as a management tool for steering the 2030 Agenda at the national level. He called for meaningful stakeholder inclusion and participation in the follow-up processes to the VNRs.

In February 2020, CSPPS released a publication titled, ‘Reporting for the Future,’ as a report of its Ready for Review project. The report includes an in-depth analysis of implementation and lessons learned that will inform the next stage of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in fragile and conflict-affected countries, and better support the countries that will present VNRs in 2020.

Ameyovi Alice Goza, Founder and President of the International Association of Women and Young Leaders (AIFJL) in Togo, highlighted the importance of engaging young people in post-VNR processes, stressing that youth groups continually achieve positive impacts on the ground. She called for capacity building for the efforts of youth organizations.

Fiona Dawe, UK Office of National Statistics (ONS), reported that since the UK’s VNR in 2019, the ONS is working to make the country’s SDG data more readily accessible to the its government and other interested stakeholders. She explained that the Open SDG National Reporting Platform is a free-to-reuse, open-source SDG reporting and monitoring solution, with completely customizable software. It was developed in collaboration with the US Government and the Center for Open Data for Enterprise. The UK is providing technical support to other countries’ national statistical offices as well as other stakeholders, to create their own platforms for SDG data. To date, approximately 13 countries have replicated the site for their own contexts or are working to do so.

Since 2016, 158 VNRs have been presented by 142 countries at the Forum. In 2020, the following 51 countries are preparing VNRs: first-time presenters – Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; second-time presenters – Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe; and third-time presenter Benin.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR: Bhutan, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Lao, Marshall Islands, Slovakia, Spain, Thailand.

The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.” It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.

The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.

Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.

The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds, inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.

To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:

achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;

“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; and

in the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.

The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.

64,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-imperative-of-ending-wildlife-crime/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Imperative of Ending Wildlife Crime,"Reports that the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated from illegally sourced wildlife, including pangolin, has given a new sense of urgency to ending wildlife crime. Wildlife crime is not new, yet, remarkably, there is no global legal agreement addressing it. This is despite the devastating impact it has on wildlife, local communities, national economies, security, public health and entire ecosystems, and its links to HIV Aids, Ebola, SARS, MERS and now COVID -19.

We are not talking about subsistence poaching, which is a separate and distinct issue to be resolved locally, but rather, large-scale criminal activity organized transnationally and fueled by corruption. A recent World Bank report estimates the value of illegally traded species at US$200 billion, when all wildlife, including fish and timber not listed under CITES are included.

Saving wildlife, and, as we now see, ourselves, means stopping an illegal commerce that shifts thousands of tonnes of contraband, worth billions of dollars and leaves death, destruction, and instability in its wake. Ending wildlife crime requires a new level of international cooperation that assures criminals feel the long arm of the law. The time for bold action is now.

No longer a tenable solution

Currently and by default, we have turned to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a trade-related conservation convention from the 1970’s, to serve as the de facto legal instrument for combating serious wildlife crimes. The problem is that CITES wasn’t designed to deal with wildlife crime. It was meant to regulate wildlife trade to avoid over-exploitation of threatened species.

While a critically important trade convention, it was never designed to fight crime. CITES has its limitations. It only applies to species listed in its appendices – that is 36,000 of the world’s eight million species – and to the cross-border movement of specimens. It doesn’t require illegal trade to be criminalized, nor does it apply to poaching. However, in the absence of any alternative, over the past decade, CITES has been leveraged to crank up the fight against illegal wildlife trade.

Even with its limitations, CITES has had some success in this regard. It led the creation of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in 2010[i], which was welcomed by CITES Parties in 2013[ii]. In parallel to the Consortium, the UN General Assembly passed a first-ever Resolution on Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2015, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) released the first-ever UN World Wildlife Crime Report in 2016. Over the years, CITES has seen the deeper engagement of police and customs agents, and action by key industry sectors, including finance, transport, and tourism.

Yet, a serious underlying problem remains, one for which we are now paying a heavy price. There is no international legal framework for cooperative global and national action to catch and punish serious wildlife criminals, nor is there an agreed definition of wildlife crime. This inhibits global enforcement efforts and jeopardizes the lives of park rangers, creates insecurity and undermines conservation schemes. It robs local communities of their resources and it elevates the risk of future disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

Transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

Given the scale and seriousness of wildlife crime and its grave implications for countries, their ecosystems and species, and for humanity overall, it can and must be dealt with by police, prosecutors and the judiciary – not by individuals such as conservationists or park rangers acting alone. We need an unequivocal political message, supported by the right legal framework, that organized, transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

We must move with the times

The time has come for a new global agreement on wildlife crime.

This agreement can be housed under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC), as has been done for other serious crimes such as human trafficking. Such an agreement should oblige countries to prohibit the import of any wildlife[iii], supported by criminal sanctions, unless the importer can prove it was legally obtained[iv].

This idea was put forward at the recent ‘End Wildlife Crime’ event at the House of Lords, which promoted a new agreement on wildlife crime that criminalizes the importation, distribution and consumption of illegally sourced wildlife. What is proposed is not unlike the approach taken in some countries, such as in the US under the Lacey Act, and what some countries have in place for certain timber imports.

Doing things differently requires us to take a fresh look at historic approaches to conservation and question their ongoing efficacy in a changing world. Making bold but necessary changes will prove difficult and stir up resistance. But the status quo won’t do; nor will incremental changes. It’s abundantly clear that we need to scale up the fight against the transnational, organized criminals who are stripping countries bare of their precious wildlife and creating havoc locally and globally. To stop them we need to get police and prosecutors hot on their trail.

Global responses to biodiversity loss must move with the times and if we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organized criminals, while opening up new opportunities for local communities in and around biodiverse-rich areas, then we will not only end wildlife crime but see wildlife, ecosystems and local communities thrive.

The brief calls for a concise final text, the mainstreaming of biodiversity across all relevant sectors, as well as the mobilization of States and other stakeholders to achieve the highest ambition possible.

The zero draft’s proposed framework , published on 13 January, presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five longer-term goals.

It describes a “potential trade-off between “ambition” and “realism” in the draft, noting a reduction in ambition from the Aichi Targets. For instance, the Aichi Targets called for the prevention of species extinction whereas the zero draft calls for a reduction in the number of threatened species. For habitat loss, the language is also less ambitious, reading, “no net loss” versus “habitat loss at least halved”. The brief emphasizes that with the credibility of international governance at stake, targets should be achievable.

With the credibility of international governance at stake, targets should be achievable.

Other thorny issues in the forthcoming negotiations, per the brief, will be the question of baselines as well as attributing improvement in ecosystems services to enhanced biodiversity conservation. On baselines, there is a risk of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) complicating negotiations. The brief gives the example of the IPBES baseline of 1970, which advantages developed countries that already transitioned through the major drivers of biodiversity loss and habitat conversion in years (if not centuries) prior to this date. Meanwhile developing countries’ drivers of loss and their related impacts on biodiversity are unfolding now. The brief argues that there are “numerous other ways to address fairness and equity issues in the framework” without risking the derailment of the negotiation process with CBDR. On the issue of ecosystem services, the brief gives the example of clean water, noting that improvements could come via pathways that do not improve the status of biodiversity or ecosystem services, and that such issues could be addressed with a “rewording and proposal of metrics, that would ensure that it is the services provided by ecosystems that are enhanced.”

The brief goes on to present small modifications to the language of the zero draft on areas key for upcoming discussions. It discusses habitat loss, pollution, and human-wildlife conflict. The publication also calls for “strengthening” synergies with related multilateral processes (in addition to the biodiversity-related conventions, the oceans conventions, the other Rio conventions, and other MEAs) and expanding tools and solutions to target all subsidies that negatively impact on biodiversity as well as to shift public and corporate incentives and policy.

The brief concludes by calling for biodiversity mainstreaming at every level, including through the mechanisms of the High-level Political Forum as a way to promote linkages across the achievement of all the SDGs. It also highlights the importance of improved transparency and responsibility for all national actors. [Publication: A good working basis in the making.

66,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/gcf-prepares-to-deliver-ambition-for-cop-26/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,GCF Prepares to Deliver Ambition for COP 26,"2020 marks an important year for climate finance and the beginning of a critical decade for climate ambition. Starting off its first meeting of the year, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board met from 10-12 March, in Geneva, Switzerland, to address pertinent agenda items. The Board considered an updated workplan for the next three years, the effectiveness of its committees, and recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the simplified approval process (SAP).

Board members agreed on measures to increase the GCF’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals, and also discussed budgetary issues such as progress on ‘stuck’ projects and what lessons can be learned from the pilot programme on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+. This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

Progress on the GCF’s Work Program 2020-2030

As was decided at the previous Board meeting, the Co-Chairs presented a draft of the updated workplan of the Board for 2020–2023, including a schedule for a list of items the Board will consider in 2020. The Board considered a draft decision to adopt the updated workplan, which built on previous discussions that were held at an informal meeting from 5-7 February 2020, in Monrovia, Liberia.

Board members requested prioritizing: by June 2020, the approval of key policies related to the investment framework, including the incremental and full cost methodology, the policy on ‘concessionality’ and the mapping on eligibility and selection criteria; and by 2021, the approval of guidelines on the Board decisions without a Board meeting.

In informal consultations, views diverged on: strategic objectives and allocations; shifting financial flows; project prioritization; diversifying instruments; accreditation prioritization; and efficient process management and delegation. The Board advanced convergence of views on diversifying instruments and accreditation prioritization, but concluded with the need to further discuss the workplan at its June session.

The Board also took note of actions to be undertaken in 2020 in response to the guidance received from parties during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) in 2019.

Working towards enhancing the effectiveness of committees

The status of the review of the effectiveness of committees was also highlighted as critical to be addressed as soon as possible under the GCF’s work plan. A previous report, which was distributed on a limited basis, suggested that there was scope to improve transparency by reviewing record keeping and reporting to the Board, and enhance effectiveness by reviewing structures of committees as well as the way committees operate and coordinate.

The Board took note of the ‘Final report of the review of the effectiveness of committees and groups established by the Board’ and of the ‘General Guidelines for Committees and Panels,’ and requested the Co-Chairs to consultant with members and Committees and present updated guidelines by its next June session.

Improving the GCF’s Simplified Approval Process

The Board also considered the review of the simplified approval process pilot scheme, which assesses the results achieved by the simplified approval process (SAP) to date, and includes recommendations for streamlining and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SAP. The review found the following:

The SAP is a valuable funding modality that can lead to expeditious approval of low-risk projects that can better address the urgent climate adaptation needs of GCF priority countries, such as the African States, the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small islands developing States (SIDS);

The SAP pipeline has grown by an average of 10.5% every month and represented 22% of all submission in the GCF pipeline, demonstrating a strong demand for SAP, especially from direct access entities (DAEs) which compose the majority of pipeline submissions; and

Despite the fact that SAP projects are small in terms of GCF finance and have low risks, the SAP is perceived similar to the regular proposal approval process even if they involve funding proposals that imply higher risks and require much larger amounts of GCF finance.

The review’s main recommendations include:

expand to activities that imply limited environmental and social risks;

speed up the approval cycle of such projects and programmes with ‘In between Board Meeting’ approvals;

introduce delegated authority to the Secretariat for the approval of SAP projects and programmes that imply minimal to no environmental and social risks;

use dedicated independent expert consultants in lieu of the independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP);

increase the Secretariat’s capacity for technical reviews of a larger number of SAP proposals using external technical reviewers;

strengthen technical support to DAEs with closer alignment to Project Preparation Facility and Readiness activities; and

keep expanding the knowledge products on SAP, which build the capacity of accredited entities and national designated authority in SAP project design/development.

Some members signaled their: opposition to delegating authority or functions of the ITAP to external consultants; concern over the unbalanced geographically distribution of projects in the SAP pipeline; and opposition to introducing any notion of “GCF priority countries.”

Observers called for ensuring that any ‘In between Board Meeting’ approval process allows for stakeholder input, and opposed the use of the SAP to facilitate private sector involvement as well as an opening up of the SAP for any projects outside of activities with minimal or no adverse environmental or social risks or impacts. The Board requested the Secretariat to further develop the SAP for Board consideration by its next meeting.

Increasing ITAP’s capacity for an expected doubling of project proposals

As ITAP is one of the areas identified in the SAP review in which efficiency could be increased both under the SAP and the regular GCF proposal approval process, the Board considered an option to enhance the ITAP by increasing its members to ensure that more projects will be brought before the Board for approval.

GCF Executive Director Yannick Glemarec clarified, among others, that the GCF’s key challenges include an increased need for project review, with an expected increase in the number of projects per year based on the level of replenishment. He said that 52 projects are currently undergoing review and noted that the GCF is on track to submit 21 projects to ITAP for the Board’s next meeting. He added that a larger number is expected for the Board’s subsequent meeting, in part to deliver on the ambition for UNFCCC COP 26.

During discussions, members raised procedural questions and advocated establishing a roster of experts. Observers stressed the importance to engage in more detail with in-country project relevant stakeholders and affected people. The Board decided to, inter alia:

re-appoint three members of the ITAP for a 1.5- year term;

increase the size of the ITAP from six to ten members by the end of 2020;

approve an additional administrative budget for the Board for the year 2020 in the amount of USD 338,800, to cover the additional four members of ITAP, the administrative support consultant, and the operationalization of the roster of experts; and

request the Secretariat, in consultation with the Investment Committee and the ITAP, to propose updates to the operational modalities of ITAP to accommodate the increased workload by the next Board meeting.

Status of the GCF’s financial resources

The GCF saw USD 10.3 billion in contributions during the fund’s initial resource mobilization which lasted from 2015-2018, and USD 9.8 billion for the GCF’s 2020-2023 replenishment, or first replenishment (GCF-1), with a combined total of USD 8.3 billion received so far. At its March meeting, the Board took note of the Status of GCF resources, pipelines and portfolio performance.

The GCF resource status shows that the total of GCF funding commitments amounts to USD 6.5 billion, which is composed of: USD 5.4 billion under approved projects; USD 0.3 billion under Readiness and Project Preparation Facilities; and, taking other factors into account, a remaining commitment authority of USD 1.8 billion. Noteworthy, USD 13.9 billion of co-financing mobilized, in addition to the 5.4 billion GCF financing, serve the approved projects and activities in 105 countries.

The largest portion of GCF Funding, amounting to USD 2.2 billion, is allocated to 37 countries in the African Region. This geographical distribution is followed by: USD 1.9 billion allocated to 34 countries in the Asia-Pacific region and USD 1.1 billion allocated to 27 countries from Latin and Caribbean Region. About USD 1.4 billion has been committed to 23 LDCs and USD 0.8 billion to SIDS.

The GCF portfolio of approved projects is expected to abate a total of 1.6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (GHG) in carbon dioxide equivalent and reach 348 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries, based on the estimations of accredited entities. Since November 2015, the Board approved 124 funding proposals, with 74 projects under implementation and 61 projects receiving funds. In total, the approved projects, including co-financing, amount to USD 20.6 billion.

By the start of the year the GCF Funding pipeline showed 79 public and private sector funding proposals, which request a total GCF funding of USD 3.4 billion to support projects and programmes totaling USD 11.8 billion, when taking co-financing into account.

During discussions, members raised concerns about projects that are not progressing over long periods of time, suggesting consideration to restructure such projects and implement early filters as remedy measures. The Secretariat informed that it was developing a stronger portfolio performance management system to identify early warning and project performance and reported that seven projects worth USD 500 million “were stuck for two years” but are now expected to move towards implementation by mid-2020.

Progress on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD+

Regarding Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the Board took note of the Secretariat’s analysis of the experience with, and the progress made towards, achieving the objectives of the pilot programme for REDD-plus results-based payments. Findings include:

a positive response from REDD+ countries, and that the numbers of countries submitting REDD+ results to the UNFCCC increased from three to 12 in the last two years;

procedures approved by the Board are fully functional, and that technical capacities were enhanced in ITAP with UNFCCC experts; and

the pilot is relevant to the REDD+ results-based payments finance landscape, given that the GCF has provided 30% out of the global volume of this finance and a large interest to continue and to explore options, including involving the private sector to leverage additional finance for the pilot programme.

So far four projects in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and Paraguay for USD 228.63 million have been approved, with six projects in the pipeline from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Nine more are expected by the end of the pilot programme, seven from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and three from the Asian region, while the funds are likely to be exhausted by 2021 and prior to the end of the pilot programme in 2022.

Recommendations from the analysis include, given the complexity of REDD+ elements, to further discuss and analyze alternatives for the continuation of the implementation of REDD+ results-based payments, including:

analyzing market and non-market contexts, the role of the private sector, complementarity with other multi- and bilateral funding arrangements, and technical and procedural matters; and

considering options such as to extend the pilot programme, a second pilot programme with some adjustments, a permanent funding window, and a grandparenting period.

Noting diverging views on REDD+ in general, some members highlighted that ensuring environmental integrity is a key issue to take into account when addressing the future for the pilot programme. Members also: voiced their reservations about considering a permanent funding window; supported consideration of the role of private actors; and cautioned against prejudging ongoing negotiations under Paris Agreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches). Raising concerns about the four funding proposals already adopted, Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples: called for revisions of the pilot programme; opposed the use of reference levels that lower ambition; raised questions about carbon storage permanence and verification of Indigenous Peoples and local communities; and stressed the need to avoid double counting.

Board approves USD 169.7 million in GCF funding for six projects and programmes

The GCF Board approved six funding proposals amounting to USD 169.7 million in GCF funding that will support projects and programmes with a total value of USD 618.7 million. The majority of the funding, or 74%, is allocated for adaptation projects, and 26% for mitigation projects. The expected impact potential is to abate a total of 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) of GHGs and reach 4.8 million (direct and indirect) beneficiaries. Specifically, the GCF approved finance to support four public-sector projects in the following countries:

Viet Nam, with a USD 30.2 million GCF grant for a USD 156.3 million adaptation project which aims to empower vulnerable smallholders by securing water provision, supporting farmers to adopt climate-resilient agriculture, and strengthening access to agro-climate information, credit and markets.

Zimbabwe, with a USD 26.6 million GCF grant for a USD 47.8million adaptation project which seeks to address climate impacts and build the resilience of smallholder farmers in three semi-arid agroecological regions of southern Zimbabwe.

Sri Lanka, with a USD 39.8 million GCF grant for a USD 49 million adaptation project which aims to strengthen the capacity of smallholder subsistence farmers to address climate-induced irrigation and drinking water shortages by improving the resilience of farm- and land-management practices, and by climate proofing ecosystems.

Cuba, with a USD 38.3 million GCF grant for a USD 119.9 million cross-cutting project which seeks to increase the climate resilience of agricultural production and ensure food security through improved ecosystem services from agroforestry, silvopastoral systems, reforestation and assisted natural forest regeneration in seven municipalities vulnerable to climate change.

The Board also approved two private sector funding proposals for climate action in the following countries:

Ecuador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, and Uganda are benefiting from GCF funding of USD 25 million in equity for a USD 200 million mitigation programme, titled ‘Arbaro Fund – Sustainable Forestry Fund.’ It will invest in sustainable plantation forestry projects with adaptation co-benefits to increase carbon sinks by producing wood in a sustainable manner and conserving natural forests, whilst contributing to reduction of illegal logging.

Haiti, with a USD 1.5 million GCF grant and a USD 8.4 million loan for a USD 45.7 million cross-cutting project. The project aims to: develop 22 community-scale solar plus battery storage micro-grids in communities where currently no grid power exists; provide affordable and reliable access to modern energy services in communities; and build capacity for microgrid deployment and operation.

The Board further:

took note of the explanation provided by the Secretariat and the Accreditation Panel regarding the accreditation of the applicant ‘National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development’; and

transferred to the Board for approval, without Board meeting and on a no objection basis, of the two applicants ‘Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation’ and ‘Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia’.

In addition, the GCF also considered a number of reports during its meeting, including on the activities of the Secretariat, Board committees and independent units, and by the Co-Chairs such as proposals on Board decisions without a Board meeting, and their proposal on the review of committees, panels and groups.

The GCF Board Meeting closed without a decision on the date and venue of its next meeting, but with the understanding that the previous decision on the date, from 23-25 June 2020, stands unless the Board revokes that decision.

Given the extraordinary circumstances regarding the COVID-19 virus outbreak, the Board considered: authorizing the Co-Chairs to determine whether to change the venue, or hold the meeting by way of video conference, teleconference or net meeting; and requesting the Co-Chairs to continue to monitor the developments and consult with the Board on a possible change in date and/or venue for its next meeting. Observing no consensus, the Co-Chairs proposed further in-between meeting consultations.","This update informs of these GCF discussions and on the six funding proposals the GCF Board approved.

The Summit explored how to attain SDG target 2.5, which calls on the international community to maintain the genetic diversity of both crops and livestock by 2020, and promote access and benefit sharing.

The Summit highlighted concerns that following decades of steady improvements to food security, the number of people living with hunger began to increase in 2015. More than 820 million people are currently undernourished, according to the 2019 UN report ‘State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World.’ The Summit underscored the role of genetic diversity in transforming food systems and sustainable agriculture, while also strengthening the resilience of ecosystems, reducing the vulnerability of rural populations to climate impacts, and contributing to climate change mitigation.

Emphasizing the interrelated nature of the SDGs, the Seed Summit issued a Call to Action that urges governments to step up efforts to maintain genetic diversity, “including through soundly managed seed and plant banks,” and encourages gene banks to make use of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing important seed collections.

The Call to Action also highlights the importance of prioritizing the sustainable use and conservation of agricultural biodiversity in agricultural policies, and ensuring equitable sharing of benefits arising from these resources. It further notes the need for governments, researchers, the private sector, and civil society to step up their efforts to promote climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in both agriculture and aquaculture, with a view to ensuring that small-scale food producers can maintain and increase their food production in a changing climate.

The UN Secretary-General will host the 2021 Summit on Food Systems, which will seek to catalyze large-scale public mobilization and actionable commitments to make food systems sustainable, climate adapted, and resilient.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is “the ultimate insurance policy for the world’s food supply.”

During the ceremony, Kent Nnadozie, Secretary of the FAO International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, described the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as “the ultimate insurance policy for the world’s food supply.” It contains the world’s largest global backup collection of seed samples from food and forage crops, representing over 6,000 plant species. The vault was established in 2008, four years after the entry into force of the Treaty, which put in place a legal framework ensuring that seeds in the vault remain the sovereign property of the depositors who seal the containers upon deposit, and are the only ones permitted to access them again.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is equipped to store up to 4.5 million seeds samples, and is designed to preserve the seeds, keeping them viable for regeneration for decades, or even centuries to come. The latest deposits by 35 gene banks from around the world brought the total number of seed samples stored to over 1.1 million. Among first-time depositors at the Seed Vault event were the Cherokee Nation (USA), the University of Haifa (Israel), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Morocco), the Julius Kühn Institute (Germany), the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, the Baekdudaegan National Arboretum (South Korea), Suceava Genebank ‘Mihai Cristea’ (Romania), and Kew Gardens (UK).

Presenting the report’s highlights at UN Headquarters on 10 March 2020, Taalas said that: 2019 was the second warmest year on record and ended with a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels; 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record; and CO2 levels had reached a new peak in January and February 2020.

The report highlights the physical indicators of climate change, such as increasing land and ocean heat, ocean acidification and deoxygenation, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice. It also addresses the impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security, and land and marine ecosystems. It includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, international experts, scientific institutions and UN agencies, and provides information for policymakers to consider in their decision-making processes.

In his presentation, Taalas said that a recent decadal forecast from the UK’s Met Office indicates a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years, and, over 10 years, temperature estimates range from 1.1 to 1.65°C, exceeding the lower limit of the Paris Agreement. Taalas said that while developed countries have been able to decouple economic growth from emissions growth, developing countries have not yet done so.

Taalas highlighted that smoke and pollutants from the Australian wildfires reverberated across the globe, causing an increase in CO2 emissions, and record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier with significant impacts on sea level rise. He warned of a growing water crisis in parts of Africa and in Southern Asia, many areas of which depend on glaciers as the main freshwater source.

Other examples of socioeconomic impacts highlighted in the report include a deteriorating food security situation in some countries in 2019 due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict, and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people in the Horn of Africa were estimated to be severely food insecure. In addition, unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 contributed to a locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, the worst in over 25 years.

The report also addresses high-impact events, including:

floods in Southern Asia, Iran, the US, which experienced US$20 billion in losses, and South America, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion;

drought, with Australia having its driest year on record;

heatwaves, with record-breaking temperatures in Australia and Europe;

tropical cyclones in the Bahamas and along the eastern coast of Africa, increasing food insecurity and displacement; and

increased wildfire activity in high-latitude areas, such as Siberia and Alaska and even in parts of the Arctic, where such events were previously rare.

Responding to questions regarding the impacts of the coronavirus on climate change, its short-term contribution to decreased emissions, and its potential to drain resources and political will from climate efforts, Guterres said he expects the impacts of and efforts related to coronavirus to be temporary and underscored the need to ensure that efforts to fight the virus do not distract from addressing climate change. Taalas added that while the virus is negatively impacting the economy in the short term, the economic consequences of non-action on climate change over the long term would be massive.

69,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/study-outlines-co-benefits-of-coordinated-unccd-cbd-action/,"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Study Outlines Co-Benefits of Coordinated UNCCD, CBD Action","A study by the Global Mechanism of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has examined how SDG target 15.3 on achieving a land degradation neutral world contributes to the strategic objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The study identifies several layers of convergence between the two Conventions.

Titled, ‘Land Degradation Neutrality for Biodiversity Conservation: How Healthy Land Safeguards Nature,’ the study highlights synergies linked to both Conventions’ focus on: halting the loss of natural ecosystems, especially forests; the sustainable management of land and natural capital; and protecting the livelihoods of the most affected and vulnerable communities through ensuring their fair access to natural resources, and their sustainable management. The discussion builds on lessons learned so far from implementing voluntary land degradation neutrality (LDN) targets that have been set by more than 120 countries, and the CBD National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs).

Underscoring that the bulk of the CBD’s 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be met, the report makes the case for joint, and scaled up action, by observing that land degradation and biodiversity loss are among the most pressing environmental challenges facing humanity. Citing data from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the report notes that land degradation has reduced the productivity of nearly one-quarter of the global land surface, impacted the well-being of about 3.2 billion people and costing approximately 10% of annual global gross domestic product in lost ecosystem services. The report also highlights links to the third Rio Convention — the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — notably an IPBES conclusion that one-third of the solution to the climate crisis can be found through restoration, conservation and other land management action.

The report draws on country case studies showcasing “LDN in action for biodiversity,” from Benin, Chile, Jamaica, Moldova, Namibia, and the Philippines, to explore how coordinated implementation can simultaneously address the drivers of land degradation and biodiversity loss, while protecting ecosystems, and supporting climate action.

The report identifies the ongoing negotiations for a post-2020 biodiversity framework, as well as the commencement of the 2021-2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, as important opportunities for achieving greater synergies in programme design, financing, and implementation of the Rio Conventions. It calls for the design and implementation of ‘LDN Transformative Projects and Programmes’ that, inter alia, contribute to multiple SDGs, involve all relevant stakeholders, consider gender issues, and reflect a balance between the different social, economic and environmental priorities and interests at stake.

The report concludes with a number recommendations addressed to various stakeholders at different levels, including:

In order to achieve ambitious global goals, parties to international agreements, including the UNCCD and the CBD, should develop their instruments, objectives, and programmes in ways that recognize and take advantage of their many co-benefits and synergies.

As the process of defining the post-2020 global biodiversity framework moves forward, country parties should recognize and harness the potential that LDN and area-based targets offer to address the priorities of both the CBD and the UNCCD in an effective, complementary and mutually supporting manner.

International organizations should strengthen the technical and capacity-building support provided to governments and other LDN stakeholders to help maintain the strong momentum created to date and optimize LDN’s contributions to biodiversity conservation goals.

Governments should continue to strengthen coordination among ministries and departments with areas of authority relevant to LDN and biodiversity to ensure that policies and strategies build on the synergies and savings available through integrated planning and prioritize prevention.

Financial support for governance and capacity building should be used to enhance the ability of countries to craft policies and programmes for LDN, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable use and other national priorities that have wide stakeholder support and promote integrated planning and action.

The study is one of the actions taken by the Global Mechanism (GM) of the UNCCD in response to an evaluation of the LDN Target Setting Programme in April 2019, which called for increased knowledge sharing on LDN target setting and implementation. The GM has undertaken a series of complementary studies on other thematic areas, including: forest and landscape restoration, poverty and inequality, food insecurity in mountain regions, and gender equality.

Further studies are under development focusing on how LDN targets contribute to the sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable agriculture and food security, water security, and land-use planning.

With the commitment towards compliance with the SDGs, there is a definite improvement in the data system to obtain the relevant estimates for indicators representing each of the goals. In the process of obtaining these estimates, two concerns arise: the levels of disaggregation and the reliability of the estimates conditioned by the rarity of the event or phenomenon.

In terms of an adverse indicator, like the maternal mortality rate,, the two concerns are equally relevant in the sense that with decline in this adversity, there is a compromise in its reliability. Further, its disaggregation obtains differentially reliable estimates ineligible for comparison.

A 2015 WHO study on the reduction of MMR by 75% from 1990 to 2015 in the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) suggested that, by 2013, MMR was reduced by 45%, from 380 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births – reflecting substantial progress but still falling far short of the global MDG goals. MMR reduction is a priority in the SDGs, with the broad objective to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.

Hence, it is questionable as to whether such estimates be obtained in brief periodicity (i.e. every three years) based on the same sample coverage and secondly should these estimates be compared across regions with differential reliability. The following discussion elaborates on this pressing concern to draw attention of policy makers.

The most recently released statistics on maternal mortality notes a decline of 8 units in the maternal mortality ratio in the gap of three years, which is a positive trend. The target level of SDGs for this indicator is 70 per one lakh live births by the year 2030, and this seems very much within the horizon given the declining exposure to reproduction on one hand and ever-increasing extent of institutional deliveries on the other. While this aggregate achievement seems realisable, the disturbing part of the story lies in the intra country disparities which are stark and revealing of the differential vulnerabilities across regions.

The national achievement makes a specific region 1.8 times more vulnerable vis-à-vis the other two regions 0.52 and 0.63 times-less vulnerable based on the MMR. These differences are alarming in the sense that they are not merely guided by the differential risk of reproduction alone as convergence in fertility decline across the country is a reality. Further, such a pattern could very well lead to compliance with the SDG target at the national level leaving behind some regions with such adversities. The race towards compliance with SDGs has always this limitation as one of the authors of this note observed in the initial years of SDG formulation as to whether target compliance will compromise on equities.

The three regional estimates of MMR put the southern region comprising five states at 72, a group of other six states of the north and western region at 90 against the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states with the inclusion of Assam at 175. Apart from these regional estimates, Assam leads the table with an MMR levels of 229 followed by Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar which have MMR estimates closer to 200. One would imagine that these are purely a derivative of differential exposure to reproduction but it is not the case given the decline in fertility levels across the EAG states.

There is apprehension as to such high levels of MMRs may not necessarily be associated with childbirth alone but miscarriages and non-clinical abortions as well. The levels of MMRs in EAG states are distinctly higher compared with other states except in Punjab. Another aspect of this comparison relates to the statistical reliability of these estimates. The high levels of MMR in EAG states do have the widest possible confidence intervals understandably owing to the rarity of this event. But the kind of decline that is celebrated should also take into account the wide confidence intervals as they might otherwise be a statistical construct and not a real decline at all. In that sense, the regional estimates are somewhat acceptable for comparison which presents a clear regional divide that needs focus and attention.

Another aspect of this phenomenon is to situate them in an age profile to identify age-specific vulnerabilities. Given that a larger share of fertility or childbirth related experience is below the age of 30 years, a risk evaluation indicates that almost two-thirds of maternal deaths are happening between ages 20-30 years of age. Hence, the common understanding that adolescent motherhood or high-risk age of maternity do not seem to intensify this problem. In addition, the fertility transition too places this age bracket to share a significant share of the childbirth experience. This suggests towards targeting the younger and primipara women to comply with institutional deliveries as well as the maternal care continuum to avoid such adversities.

Finally, caution needs to be exercised about certifying compliance of such targets overlooking the regional disparities as well as reliability of estimates given the rarity of the phenomenon itself. While monitoring this phenomenon is desirable, it is rather important to change focus from reducing levels to that of converging them.

The term is used to describe the selective reporting of companies’ impacts, sans failures, in regard to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

It appears to be an issue of omission and one-sided reporting, according to the Responsible Mining Foundation, an independent research organization that supports the proliferation of responsible mining, which found that many of the world’s largest mining companies have continuously failed to mention any negative impacts that might impede achievement of the SDGs, the organization said, in its recent RMI Report 2020.

The report is an “evidence-based assessment” of the economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) policies and practices of 38 large-scale mining companies, which means that its data helps paint a truly global picture — the firms operate in more than 780 mine sites, and together account for 28 percent of the world’s mining activity by value of production, according to RMI. The data was gathered throughout a one-year study, and approximately two months were spent reviewing and assessing various aspects of each company.

According to the International Labor Organization, mining remains one of the top three most hazardous sectors. RMF’s raison d’être is to support the principle that “minerals and metals mining should benefit the economies, improve the lives of peoples and respect the environments of producing countries, while allowing companies and their investors to make a fair and viable return.”

By the Numbers

Mapped to the SDGs and approximately 50 international initiatives, standards or guidelines related to responsible mining or corporate accountability, RMF’s methodology is thorough, to say the least.

RMF’s index is shaped by a specific analytical framework, comprised of six thematic areas: economic development, business conduct, lifecycle management, community well-being, working conditions and environmental responsibility. This is in addition to 76 individual indicators that were distributed among three measurement areas: commitment (follow-through on what they said they’d do), action (what they’ve done so far) and effectiveness (meaningful, measurable outcomes).

More specifically, each category includes an in-depth assessment into companies’ said “progress.” RMF explained, “Commitment indicators assess the extent to which companies have formalized their commitments on particular issues, assigned responsibilities and accountabilities for the implementation of these commitments, and provided resources and staffing to operationalize the commitments. Action indicators assess the extent to which companies have developed systematic approaches to address particular issues and disclose key aspects of their activities, and Effectiveness indicators assess the extent to which companies track, and report on, their performance in managing particular issues and demonstrate continuous improvement on these issues.”

The report also assesses 180 individual mine sites in 45 countries against 10 basic indicators of responsible mining, including local employment; local procurement; post-closure plans; community grievances; worker grievances; air quality; water quality; tailings management; and emergency preparedness.

A Red Flag

But for mining companies, “SDG-washing” is highlighting specific stats that give the impression of responsible mining, which “fails to present stakeholders with a true picture of the challenges the mining sector faces in its support of the SDGs,” according to RMF.

The disillusion surrounding the industry’s progress thus far in its quest for responsible mining has led to a “disconnect between company-wide policies and standards, versus actual on-the-ground actions at mine sites, where the impacts of mining are most evident,” RMF said, raising a huge red flag that encourages industry members to take a deeper look at companies’ claims versus reality.

Who’s Who

The list of mining companies in the report includes Anglo American; AngloGold Ashanti; Antofagasta; ArcelorMittal; Banpu; Barrick Gold Corp; BHP; Buenaventura; Bumi Resources; China Shenhua; Coal India;, Codelco; ERG; Evraz; Exxaro Resources; First Quantum Minerals; Fortescue; Freeport-McMoRan; Glencore; Gold Fields; Grupo México; Industrias Peñoles; MMG; Navoi MMC; Newcrest Mining; Newmont; NMDC; Nordgold; Orano; Peabody Energy; Polymetal; Rio Tinto; RUSAL; Sibanye-Stillwater; Teck; Vale; Vedanta Resources; and Zijin.

Hélène Piaget, chief executive officer of the Responsible Mining Foundation, said that the SDGs “provide a valuable societal framework for reporting and action on economic, social and environmental concerns, but an unbalanced emphasis on the ‘good’ that companies do may obscure the negative impacts, be they inherent or unintentional, that may impede the achievement of the SDG goals.”

Piaget added that a proactive approach toward the SDGs, in tandem with data transparency, can reap positive results for mining companies. “While the trust-deficit with society is recognized as the number-one risk for mining companies, the RMI Report 2020 acts as a prompt to the industry to eliminate the need to respond to multiple information requests. By proactively making EESG data available — starting at individual mine sites and in open data formats companies can help to build trust, limit risk, and show respect. In fact, more proactive data disclosure will reduce the demand for companies’ reporting.”

Great Expectations

Since the last RMI assessment in 2018, several large-scale mining companies have been “at the center of major controversies as mine tailings failures have claimed scores of lives, devastated whole communities and caused major environmental disasters,” RMF noted.

Afshin Mehrpouya, associate professor at HEC Paris and member of the Board of the RMF, said that “Such tragedies reflect very poorly on the sector as a whole and put into stark perspective companies’ claims of responsible mining. The industry must redouble its efforts to prove that it prioritizes broader ESG responsibilities over short-term considerations.”

And it can be done. Similar to the prior assessment, this year’s report noted that “mining can meet society’s expectations.” The RMF said “if one company were to achieve all the highest scores recorded” in each of the indicators, “it would reach more than 70 percent of the maximum achievable score.”

And similarly, the RMF said if one mine site “were to achieve all the highest scores seen for the asset-level indicators, it would score over 80 percent. All companies are encouraged to adopt more systematically the good practices already being demonstrated across the sector.”

Commitment Issues

Usually, good comes with the bad — and in the case of mining, it’s no different: The report noted a “modest overall improvement” by companies on many of the issues previously assessed in 2018. Albeit, “much of the improvement is due to companies making commitments, with markedly less evidence of progress in following up these commitments with concrete actions,” RMF said, adding that “the weakest results relate to companies’ efforts to track, review and act to improve the effectiveness of their actions on EESG issues.”

RMF explained, “So while commitments are a step in the right direction, the mining sector as a whole would benefit – both in terms of its performance and its trust-building with other stakeholders – from being able to demonstrate more consistent implementation of commitments across operational portfolios and across issues.”

The Bottom Line

And as it goes with most sustainability topics, transparency is critical — RMF said that not only was there little evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighboring communities, workers, governments and investors, the organization was hard-pressed to find evidence of companies engaging with local stakeholders on important issues, inclusive of local procurement, grievance mechanisms or air and water quality, all according to RMF.

Of the 180 individual mine sites assessed, only one site scores more than 50 percent — the other 145 sites scored less than 20 percent, and 45 sites scored zero on all 10 indicators, the report said.

All in all, it boils down to the bottom line: “None of the companies [showed] consistent performance across the mine sites they own or operate.”

By Ashok Pandey

THE NITI AAYOG released the second version of the SDG India Index and Dashboard on December 20, 2019. India, as a signatory to adoption of UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is under obligation

to streamline development policies for a time-bound (by 2030) achievement of human well-being. The 17 goals and 169 related targets weave around five pillars— People (first six goals), Prosperity (next five), Planet (following four goals), Peace (goal 16) and Partnership (goal 17). Achieving these requires government’s commitment, people’s participation, allocation of funds, intergovernmental cooperation, technology and innovation.

The SDG Index is the first attempt at the national level to assess where each state and UT stands on achieving SDGs. The SDG India Index 2.0 uses a hundred indicators covering 16 goals (barring goal 17 for want of sufficient inputs) and 54 targets. The Index has played a vital role in driving the SDG agenda in India. Budgetary allocation is an essential component of pushing the SDG agenda forward. Prominent themes in this year’s Budget include working for an aspirational India, ensuring economic development for all, fostering a caring society and ease of living. These also cover most SDG goals around People and Prosperity.

The finance minister gave a big push to wellness, water and sanitation by providing Rs 69,000 crore for the health sector. Of this, Rs 6,400 crore is for the PM Jan Arogya Yojana, extending its reach to 20,000 empanelled hospitals, and Rs 3.6 lakh crore approved for the Jal Jeevan Mission, of which Rs 11,500 crore will be available for 2020-21. Cities with a million plus population are mandated to achieve the objective this year. Also, Rs 3,000 crore additional will be available for skill development, and the National Skill Development Agency will give a special thrust to infrastructure-focused skill development— infrastructure projects will involve young engineers, management graduates and economists from universities.

Women-specific schemes, nutrition enhancement and financial support to uplift the conditions of young girls contribute significantly to achieve educational, health and financial targets under different SDG goals. There are conscious efforts and the intent to reduce fossil-fuel based power to meet the objectives under goal 13. An allocationof Rs 4,400 crore has gone to the 16 action points for agriculture, irrigation and rural development. Additional allowances will help propel fish production and export. Encouragement to growing algae, seaweed and cage culture will give a boost to the blue economy.

The finance minister’s statement to ensure corruption-free, policy-driven governance is a welcome step. Providing justice and building strong institutions will enhance the Index ranking undergoal 16. The government’s recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and new technologies to augment our efforts in achieving plan 2030 is also commendable. The SDG India Index noted that Tamil Naidu and Jammu & Kashmir performed the best amongst states and UTs, respectively, in alleviating poverty. This means better performance in achieving the targets under SDG goal 1— reducing extreme and multi-dimensional poverty, improving social protection and safety net, providing the necessary services and mitigating a multitude of natural disasters.

A similar indexing in achieving other targets is both instructive and encouraging. The SDG India Index, together with the budgetary mandate, should serve as a reminder that with intentional policy and

action on the ground, it is possible to achieve the goals of well-being. The interstate and inter-UT competitions and a mature and people-centric federal interdependence augur well for the country. The NITIAayog’s SDG India Index 2.0 will serve as a facilitative rubric to bring transparency, accountability and urgency for judicious utilisation of national resources.

With trade recognized as a “means of implementation” under Agenda 2030, policymakers need to ensure that measures affecting trade and markets take into consideration efforts to achieve SDG 2. Resolving the trade-offs between competing policy objectives requires meaningful analysis and discussion within the context of multilateral agreements, to take account of the measures that could contribute to achieving SDG 2.

The five specific targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aim for improvements related to a range of issues. The targets are: end hunger (2.1); end all forms of malnutrition (2.2); double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (2.3); ensure sustainable food production systems (2.4); and maintain genetic diversity (2.5).

This is ambitious, given the current situation.

According to the most recent estimates, 821.6 million, or one out of every 10 people in the world, are undernourished, and roughly 728 million people are estimated to be obese. And, there are 736 million people living in extreme poverty, with a majority engaged in the agri-food sector. At the same time, agricultural production systems face a number of environmental challenges related to soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and water use and pollution.

Trade and related policies play a significant role in this context, as governments often use such measures to address food security as well as agricultural development objectives. Policies that can affect trade and markets include border measures like tariffs, export restrictions and non-tariff measures, as well as “behind-the-border” domestic support such as input and output subsidies, market price support, public investments in infrastructure and R&D, and some forms of income support programmes.

The domestic and international impacts of each of these policies can differ depending on whether the country is a net exporter or importer, a small or big producer or consumer, and the way in which policies are designed and implemented.

In addition, impacts may differ in the short versus longer run.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.

ON COMPETING PRIORITIES

The use of export restrictions is an example of competing priorities of a border measure, in particular between short- and longer-run objectives within the domestic market, and between the policy objectives of two trading partners. Export restrictions are usually used to address domestic food security concerns related to rising food prices. Such measures often have the immediate effect of increasing food availability and lowering food prices in domestic markets, therefore contributing to the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. However, there might be negative implications for producer incomes (SDG target 2.3), which may be significantly reduced by lower food prices.

In the medium-to-long run, the initial effects of such a policy may be completely reversed as farmers respond to lower prices and policy uncertainty by decreasing cultivated areas. This can contribute to lower production and higher prices in the medium-to-long run, thus mitigating the initial positive implications of the measure for SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. Furthermore, the application of export restrictions can undermine the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2 in importing countries by lowering food availability on world markets and contributing to higher prices, particularly if measures are implemented simultaneously by many exporting countries.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.



Behind-the-border measures such as input subsidies and market price support measures also involve important choices between different policy objectives. They can have positive implications for the achievement of SDG target 2.3 as they can improve farmer incomes. However, in addition to their high fiscal cost and administrative burden, they can negatively affect the achievement of SDG target 2.4, in particular if they provide production incentives for products with high GHG emissions.

In addition, there might be consequences related to SDG target 2.3 at an international level as such measures may lower prices and undermine the opportunity for small-scale producers in the importing country to sell their products in international markets.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTILATERAL TRADE RULES

Some measures generally have positive implications for the achievement of SDG 2 targets. These include public investments in infrastructure like storage facilities that can improve farmer prices (affecting SDG target 2.3), rural roads that can connect producers to markets (affecting SDG target 2.3), and efficiencies in trade and logistics that can reduce food waste and bring farm products where they are needed (affecting SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2).

As these measures do not typically involve transfers to individual producers, they usually fall under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) green box category and are not subject to any limitation. Moreover, the first means of implementation target of SDG 2 (i.e. 2.A), commits countries to “increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks…”

For other measures that can have production and trade-distorting effects, not only are they subject to limits in the multilateral trading system, but SDG 2’s other two means of implementation targets focus on improving the functioning of agricultural markets. In particular, target 2.B commits countries to “correct and prevent distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect…”

While progress on indicator 2.B has been made with the WTO Nairobi Ministerial Decision, achieving SDG 2 and resolving the trade-offs requires that governments go beyond a narrow focus on the elimination of export subsidies. Instead, policymakers need to take a broader approach to indicators of progress that encompass a range of measures that affect trade and markets in the global food system.

COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR

Article content A regional state of emergency was declared on Thursday afternoon in response to COVID-19. In a press teleconference, it was announced the City of Cornwall, the United Counties of SDG, and the United Counties of Prescott-Russell were all making the declaration together, a unified front in the battle to prevent spreading of the virus. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. COVID-19 state of emergency declared for Cornwall, SDG, UCPR Back to video “We felt a regional approach to a declaration of emergency would be best,” Cornwall Mayor Bernadette Clement said. “It strengthens the (regional response), the importance of the message.” The message? Most have heard it but too many have not listened to it, mainly that those who are sick or are a returning traveller must isolate at home for 14 days. For those who are healthy, leaving the home should only occur when it’s an essential trip. And, people should keep two metres apart, buy only what they need at stores, wash their hands and help their neighbours. Speaking forcefully, Clement said “the time is now to flatten the curve,” and that community buy-in is “how we’re going to beat this thing. I’m calling on residents to do the right thing: stay home, stay connected, stay healthy.”

Article content Prescott-Russell Warden Pierre Leroux, in noting the measure gives municipal leaders extra powers during a crisis, said the redeployment of county resources such as personnel for emergency services was one example. Paramedic services is Prescott-Russell’s responsibility in that area, whereas the City of Cornwall administers the paramedic service within its borders and also within SDG. Leroux said the COVID-19 situation in the region “is still manageable,” but it is and will be more difficult because “we do have some ‘COVIDiots’ out there. . . we all need to get the message loud and clear.” Medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, started the teleconference by saying he’s been in close contact with municipal leaders for the last four to six weeks, and that now, that on March 26, “we felt it was a very important time to declare an emergency.” Why now? Because health experts, while acknowledging there are currently just four positive cases so far, expect the number to soon rise, and possibly quite dramatically. “We’re at the bottom of the curve, just starting to go up,” Roumeliotis said. Roumeliotis said that for the region overall, there are 300 tests still pending. He reiterated he believes there is community spread of the virus at this point, and that “our population is a vulnerable population,” because of demographics and a large number of elderly citizens, and a population with high incidence of chronic illnesses.

Article content More On This Topic Cornwall will push out funds to agencies ASAP EOHU to receive quarantine enforcement guidelines shortly Cornwall ready, and waiting, to declare a state of emergency SDG Warden Frank Prevost stressed the importance of following quarantine, self-isolation procedures, and that the declaration “gives us the opportunity to make decisions efficiently to protect the well-being of our residents.” In a question and answer session during the call, which was quite chaotic at times mainly because of ambient noise and some technical difficulties, Leroux said the declaration was both one that gives officials more power, but that it was also, and importantly, symbolic, in that “we want to make (the measures are) clear to all.” Clement expanded on earlier comments about the declaration, saying it “does give us more flexibility in how we direct resources to deal with the emergency. But the point of the regional approach is to send the strongest possible message to our residents that the time is now to slow down the spread of the virus.” The biggest concern for municipalities seems to be a flexibility to shuffle resources within their ranks. Clement explained the declaration allows staff members to be redeployed to wherever needs might be greatest moving forward, even for tasks that may not fall under that person’s collective agreement. Should the city’s own employees start to be impacted by COVID-19, that flexibility is needed to ensure the city can continue to operate. Roumeliotis was asked if a curfew could be invoked, limiting times during the day that people could be outside their homes. “It’s a last resort,” the doctor said, saying so far there’s been a “progressive approach” to having people stay at home, and that further limitations in the size of gatherings is what likely would come next. But, he said, all measures including a curfew are on the table, and that which course of action is taken “will depend completely on how the disease progresses and what toll it takes.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

She worked with Chris Munro at Life’s Little Pleasures to have other businesses participate. Munro threw a message out on Facebook notifying owners and Bergeron reached out to the Cornwall and Area Chamber of Commerce herself so it could help spawn the idea quickly. “What happens on the business side is I take in all of the proceeds and pay it out once a week,” said Bergeron. “I’m very transparent. I shared a spreadsheet with those businesses that have made sales already. I have mentioned to them that they will get paid out every Friday through electronic money transfer (EMT). If some don’t do it that way, we’ll do cheques. “We’re really working with them to make sure that we’re promoting this in getting the word out as quick as possible because there’s just such a small margin for businesses at this point, especially restaurants.” For a full list of participating restaurants visit www.cornwall-gift-certificates.ca/.

LONG SAULT — It was expected to be a thriller, and the championship game delivered.

The St. Joseph’s Panthers won the SDG boys’ high school hockey championship 3-1 over Char-Lan Tuesday in Long Sault, denying the Crusaders from Williamstown in their bid for a three-peat.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. A good Winter for the Panthers, taking the SDG boys' hockey crown Back to video

And it would be a house league player from South Stormont, Adam Winter, who was the Panthers’ hero in a wild third period, breaking a 1-1 tie with 1:51 to go in regulation time when at close range he took a pass from behind the net from captain Nolan Shane and calmly but quickly fired the puck into the open side.

“I shot along the ice – kept it simple,” said Winter, a Grade 12 student in his second year on the Panthers squad that has several AAA-calibre players and quite a few AA-level skaters.

Winter connected just after a St. Joseph’s power play ended, and just after the Crusaders almost went ahead when presented with a shorthanded breakaway chance. He tied up his opponent behind the goal and fell to the ice. Shane swooped in to get the puck, and by the time it was put out in front, Winter was back on his feet and off to the side of the goal.

“Nolan came back to the bench (afterwards) and said ‘I knew you would be there,'” Winter recounted.","Article contentLONG SAULT — It was expected to be a thriller, and the championship game delivered.

Article content Whelan last year was just in Grade 9 when the Panthers won the SDG crown for the second straight time. That led to another appearance at the Eastern Ontario (EOSSAA) championships, the Panthers coming oh-so-close to qualifying for the provincials but falling in a tight final against Bishop Smith from Pembroke. This time, the Panthers will head to EOSSAA next Tuesday (March 10) in Napanee. “I’m really looking forward to it,” said Whelan, who plays minor hockey at the midget AA level with the Lady Grads in Gloucester. “Hopefully we’ll have another good tournament.” Panthers coaches and administrators will have to do a little bit of stickhandling themselves that day, as the boys’ team also will travel to its EOSSAA event, being held in Renfrew. In the game against Tagwi, the Warriors kept things close early on, trailing just 2-1 late in the opening period. But, there was a disputed goal toward the end of the session, the Warriors making a pretty good case that the puck never crossed the line into the net, but it counted and the deficit became 3-1. Tagwi enjoyed some offensive pressure on a power play opportunity early in the middle session, but it would be the Panthers who scored, Kate Villeneuve with a shorthanded marker that made it 4-1. Villeneuve scored her second goal just over three minutes later, and she had two assists in the contest for a four-point effort. Olivia Mudde also scored for St. Joseph’s, and Macey Dionne had a pair of assists.

So, to have a relatively successful campaign required some ducks to align and a lot of patience and co-operation. Keith Dickson, the Panthers coach and league convener, in an email to teachers and coaches thanked them for the support. “It was tough at times working through the strike action,” he said, “but at the end of the day we got it all done, and the kids were the better because of it.” In Wednesday morning’s first semifinal, the Panthers skated against Char-Lan and defeated the Crusaders 6-0.

In 2016, Nigeria adopted GeneXpert as the first diagnostic tool for the disease. It currently has 399 installed throughout the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory.

Speaking at a press conference to mark the World Tuberculosis Day, in Abuja on Tuesday, the National Coordinator, National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program, Adebola Lawanson, said the move is to comprehensively strengthen the detection and ensure TB is completely eradicated in the country.

Every March 24, the World Tuberculosis Day is celebrated to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of TB, and to step up efforts to end the global TB epidemic.

The theme this year is “It is time”. The theme is a call for accelerated action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets to end TB epidemics by 2030.

Tuberculosis is an age-long infectious disease that affects the lungs, and one of the world’s top infectious killers, killing over 1.5 million people yearly.

Eradicating TB

Ms Lawanson said there is need to scale up the level of TB awareness among Nigerians.

“There is, therefore, the need to scale up the level of awareness of TB among Nigerians, as only about 30 per cent of Nigerians are aware of TB control and preventive methods.

WHO, in line with the SDGs, set a target of 2030, “to end the TB epidemic. In order to accelerate towards this goal, there have been a lot of controlled efforts that have been put in place.

“We have just 10 years towards the end of 2030, so a lot still needs to be done. And the slogan for this year is ‘check that cough, time no dey,” she said.

Efforts made so far

In his remarks, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said the automation of the GeneXpert machine was part of government’s effort to ensure universal health coverage.

He also said Nigeria is among the few countries to commence the use of child-friendly medicines for drug-resistant DR-TB after development.

Represented by the Director, Public Health, Eno Obong, he said, “In line with the END TB strategy, the Ministry of Health with the support of partners has made some strides in the fight against TB in Nigeria.

“We have adopted new rapid diagnostic tools as well as child-friendly medicines for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB).

“It is noteworthy that Nigeria is among the few countries in the world that immediately commenced use of child-friendly medicines for DR-TB after development,” he said.

He also said engagements with the private sector in the provision of GeneXpert and other TB services has yielded positive results, with the private sector having one of the best diagnostic centres in the country.

“The private sector is also contributing about 13 per cent of the TB cases notified in the country. We are also scaling up expansion of TB services in private facilities in oil 36 states and the FCT in line with our robust public-private mix DOTS (PPM-DOTS) plan,” he said.

The country representative of KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, Bertrand Odume, urged all stakeholders to continue with the campaign of ending tuberculosis beyond the world tuberculosis day.

“We stand here to identify with national programme for tuberculosis and to reiterate our commitment not to relent in the fight against the disease.

“We hope that with collaborative efforts of the federal ministry of health departments, partners, those that are affected, and civil society organizations, we will be able to join countries like India and Indonesia in closing the enormous gap in TB burden in Nigeria,” he said.","As efforts are intensified to ensure that Nigeria becomes Tuberculosis (TB) free by 2030, the Federal Government has revealed plans to scale-up the number of GeneXpert machines in the country.
The theme is a call for accelerated action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets to end TB epidemics by 2030.

84,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/in-updated-ndc-chile-aligns-climate-and-sustainable-development-agendas/,"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"In Updated NDC, Chile Aligns Climate and Sustainable Development Agendas","Chile has submitted its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, following submission of its first NDC in 2015. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

The Marshall Islands, Suriname, Norway, Japan and Singapore have also submitted updated NDCs.

The decision was taken due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic “makes holding an ambitious, inclusive” COP in November 2020 no longer possible. The annual climate change conference brings together over 20,000 representatives from government, international and non-governmental organizations, business, and media around the world.

Among the items expected to be on the agenda at COP 26 are issues that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference did not resolve in December 2019. These issues include guidance for Article 6 (market and non-market mechanisms), common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and report of the Consultative Group of Experts. The UNFCCC subsidiary bodies were expected to resume discussion on these issues during their meetings in June 2020 in Bonn, Germany; these meetings have been tentatively rescheduled for October 2020.

In the announcement regarding the postponement, COP 26 President-Designate and UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma emphasized that countries are currently “focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting COVID-19.” Sharma added that he would continue to work with partners to “deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis”.

COP 26 is still expected to take place in Glasgow, UK, hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy. Dates for the rescheduled conference “will be set out in due course following further discussion with parties,” per the UK’s announcement.

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

87,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-initiative-explores-innovative-use-and-reuse-of-wastewater/,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Initiative Explores Innovative Use and Reuse of Wastewater,"The World Bank has reported on findings from an initiative on innovative use and reuse of wastewater. The report calls for increased action to reclaim and utilize wastewater, underscoring the potential public health and environmental benefits of smarter wastewater management.

The report titled, ‘From Waste to Resources: Shifting Paradigms for Smarter Wastewater Interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean,’ reflects on the ‘Wastewater: From Waste to Resource’ initiative implemented in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. The report states that the challenges faced in the LAC region “are not unique” and best practices from the region can help promote a paradigm shift towards a circular economy.

The World Bank aims to expand the initiative into a global initiative that can provide solutions to implement circular economy principles in wastewater projects around the world. The World Bank stresses that safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are essential in preventing disease and protecting human health, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lessons learned from the LAC region’s experience suggest four key actions to achieve a paradigm shift in the wastewater sector.

First, the report recommends planning wastewater treatment within the river basin to maximize benefits, improve efficiency and resource allocation, and engage stakeholders.

Second, the report calls for moving from wastewater treatment plants towards water resource recovery facilities. The report argues countries need to “recognize the real value of wastewater and the potential resources that can be extracted from it”, including clean water, energy and nutrients.

Third, the report proposes implementing innovative financing and business models, including efficient subsidies.

Fourth, the report suggests implementing necessary policy, institutional and regulatory frameworks to facilitate a shift towards reuse and resource recovery and a circular economy.

Case studies in the report share best practices and highlight programs and projects that promote implementation of circular economy principles. Cases range from the potential for generating energy from anaerobic ponds in Bolivia to the generation and sale of biogas in Chile, which has generated an annual net profit of US$1 million for the wastewater treatment plant. A case from Egypt describes the role of public private partnerships in fostering wastewater reuse and increasing wastewater coverage. Cases from Peru and South Africa focus on wastewater reuse for industrial purposes: the wastewater plant in Cusco, Peru, saves USD230,000 annually by transporting biosolids for compost and avoiding landfill fees. These and other examples in the report showcase “what’s possible when governments at all levels apply circular economy principles to their wastewater challenges.”

The World Bank’s Water Global Practice Global Director, Jennifer Sara, stressed wastewater treatment for reuse “is part of the solution to water scarcity and pollution problems.” She emphasized that treated wastewater can be used to replace freshwater for industrial practices, irrigation or recreational purposes.

In presenting the report’s findings, Diego Juan Rodriguez, author of the report and a World Bank Senior Water Resources Management Specialist, said wastewater “should not be considered a ‘waste’ anymore, but a resource.” He highlighted the potential to transform sanitation from a costly service to one that is “self sustaining and adds value to the economy,” explaining such actions can also help countries bridge the funding gap to achieve the SDGs.","The World Bank has reported on findings from an initiative on innovative use and reuse of wastewater.

88,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/ffd-forum-highlights-calls-for-debt-standstill/,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,FfD Forum Highlights Calls for Debt Standstill,"The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) held its annual Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FfD Forum) to hear remarks from officials on financing sustainable development in the context of COVID-19. The outcome document of the 2020 Forum was negotiated among Member States through virtual means, and placed under consideration via silence procedure.

Opening the virtual FFD Forum on 23 April 2020, ECOSOC President Mona Juul drew immediate attention to the importance of debt relief. She welcomed:

the Group of 20 (G20) Finance Ministers’ Action Plan calling to suspend debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries,

a call by the heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,

actions by the Paris Club; and

the call by Pakistan’s Prime Minister for a Global Initiative for Debt Relief, proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt issue and financing for sustainable development.

Also on debt, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 are amplifying existing debt risks. He called for extending the G20’s proposed debt moratorium to all countries that request forbearance, including middle-income countries (MICs) that lose access to financial markets. He said more targeted debt relief also will be needed, and to address sovereign debt restructuring in a way that supports countries in achieving the SDGs.

UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also echoed the importance of debt relief, welcoming the initiatives from the G20, IMF, World Bank, and the Global Initiative for Debt Relief called for by Pakistan.

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Board Chair for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization – GAVI, explained that for many vulnerable countries, COVID-19 began as an economic crisis as global demand fell for their export products, including oil and industrial metal. Income from tourism and remittances also fell. “Then the pandemic arrived and the health crisis set in,” she said, and the necessary measures to save lives compounded the economic crisis. She said that in developing countries, 70% of workers are in the informal sector, and for them, lockdowns mean no work, no money, and no food for their families. This “perfect storm” can amount to a food crisis and lead to unrest. She highlighted the proposal for a two-year “debt standstill” as a short-term response, followed by efforts to revamp health systems and make them more resilient.

Another theme of the officials’ remarks was illicit financial flows (IFFs). Juul stressed the need to combat and prevent IFFs, as all sources of finance must be mobilized to address the virus and its social and economic consequences. Muhammad-Bande added that IFFs must be fought so countries can prevent inequalities from deepening.

Speakers also highlighted gender-related impacts of the pandemic crisis. Juul said women both carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, and are overrepresented among frontline health workers. Guterres said the pandemic has shown how economies are sustained by the invisible, unpaid labor of women, and “returning to our previous path is simply not an option.” He said women’s leadership is needed to help avoid catastrophic consequences of economic instability on women and girls.

In a keynote address, Narbada Gumbonzvanda, Board Chair, Action Aid International, outlined Action Aid’s call for a global people’s bailout of at least US$4.6 trillion. Pointing to inequality as “the mother of all pre-existing conditions,” she said we are on the brink of catastrophe because of “the yawning gaps we have tolerated in social and economic rights such as access to healthcare, clean water and rights to decent work.”

Gumbonzvanda reported that two thirds of low-income countries are spending more on debt service payments than on public health care. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only one in five people is covered by any kind of pension, social protection or safety net.

Jay Collins, Citigroup Vice Chairman for Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory, suggested using the COVID-19 crisis to strengthen resolve against climate change, and learn how to manage setbacks. He said the mobilization of trillions of US dollars in capital demonstrates that the world is capable of radical responses in the developed world, but in the developing world, the fight has just begun.

Collins acknowledged that COVID-19 has moved the SDG targets further from reach and made them even more ambitious. However, he identified “silver linings” in investors’ interest in social factors, reporting that: environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds are outperforming non-ESG benchmarks; risk models for investment are being reconsidered, giving additional weight to climate value-at-risk and other concepts; and ESG scores for companies are already falling for poor COVID-response behavior.

In a statement on the occasion of the Forum, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said the impacts of the pandemic will be felt across all SDGs and the seven action areas of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD. He said recovery actions must be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and AAAA to ensure that we recover in a more sustainable and resilient way, and the AAAA in particular can act as a roadmap to a more resilient economy in the post-COVID world.

The virtual informal meeting of the Forum served as its fifth annual session, since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on FfD in 2015. The outcome document was negotiated among Member States through virtual means in a process led by the Permanent Representatives of Barbados and Latvia, and was placed under silence procedure until 27 April 2020.

Juul said the text, once adopted, will represent the first universal agreement on UN policies to finance immediate response to COVID-19 and longer-term recovery.

As a result, many schools have also asked parents to ensure that learning continues at home and online learning is an obvious way to keep lessons going. However, only a few schools have well-established online learning systems while millions of parents and teachers looking for ways to help kids stay engaged over this extended period of at-home learning.

Two of Australia’s biggest tech companies, Canva and Atlassian, are looking for ways that they can help students learn remotely by bringing a bit of magic to their at-home experience and they are doing this through the 30-day “Sustainable Development Goal Challenge for Change project.”

The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”. They’re an urgent call for action by all countries – developed and developing – in a global partnership.

To help these students make a real difference whilst learning from home, Canva partnered with Atlassian to create this challenge-for-change initiative. They have drawn on the expertise of 30 specialists across businesses, nonprofits, and industry sectors to create specific tasks and share their insights on topics relating to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This 30-day challenge for change initiative not only allows students to learn new things, but also provides them with the opportunity to grapple with the world’s biggest problems and with the potential to make a difference to global issues such as poverty, climate change, and equality. The organizers are asking students to share their solutions on Twitter using the #changemakerchallenge.

It’s a fun, interactive way to engage with and learn from the experts in each area.

Fun Fact: You could even win a few prizes along the way, so it’s well worth getting involved in. You’ll be set challenges for which you must carefully consider your solutions before finding a way to best present and share them on Twitter.

The 30-day challenge has started today and today’s challenge is on “Ending poverty in all its forms” and is unpacked by the Head of Australia for UNHCR Naomi Steer.

There's a little more padding as well, but it's still fairly firm and supportive enough for the long days of EWS racing (remember racing?).



The SM Enduro isn't as shockingly light as some in this list, but the prices are a lot less stratospheric, too. A saddle is a wear item on an enduro bike, so maybe not spending a week's salary on one is a good idea. And to that end, it's got tough-feeling material around the back and sides of the saddle as well.



The flat portions of the rails are longer than others to help nail your seat position. This is a super nice detail for taller riders who often end up with slack effective seat-tube angles once their saddle height is correct. More adjustability is a big help for them.



The oil slick colorway available on the Comp model will be polarizing, but they all come in normal colors as well. Without the oil slick, it's a sleek-looking silhouette, and no surprise we'll be seeing it on a lot of enduro riders' bikes this year.","Ergon has been at the forefront of a lot of the current saddle thinking—raised areas at the back, flat overall profiles, etc., and the new (ish) SM Enduro adds ""overall shorter"" to the list.

Article content Despite 2020 not being halfway done, it already appears the year will be disastrous for several local fairs, many of them being cancelled over COVID-19 safety concerns. It was announced on April 15 the Maxville Fair had been cancelled. Every year, the Maxville Fair is the first to take place, setting the stage for other such fairs in Chesterville, South Mountain, Avonmore, Stormont and Williamstown. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Some SDG fairs already cancelled due to COVID-19 Back to video “I think this is the first time it’s been cancelled,” said Steve Rolland, president of the Maxville Fair’s board of directors. “It was a very hard decision to take. All the directors voted on it through email because we couldn’t get together.” During an interview with the Standard-Freeholder, Rolland said the difficult decision was made in order to protect local residents who take part in the fair. “We actually start planning the fair before April,” Rolland said. “That’s why we took the decision to cancel it this year. This whole pandemic doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Our fair is based on our community.

Article content “We didn’t want anyone getting sick.” Despite the cancellation of the 132 year-old fair, the president expressed hope for the future,. “We’re going to plan for 2021,” Rolland said. “We’re going to try and overcome this and try to make it better for next year. We’re not sure how this is going to affect next year’s fair, but hopefully the sponsors and everyone else understand.” The Avonmore Fair also recently announced its board of directors had taken the decision to cancel this year’s edition. This year’s fair would’ve taken place in July and would’ve marked the 160th anniversary of the event. “The decision to cancel our fair, like many fair boards are having to consider, was not an easy one,” read a statement on the fair’s website. “2020 marks our 160th year and we were excited to share it with you. Instead, we will celebrate it at our fair in 2021. We appreciate the hard work of our volunteers, as well as the support of our community and we are looking forward to the 2021 Avonmore Fair.” The president of the Williamstown Fair said its board had not yet made up his mind regarding the possible cancellation of the event. Williamstown is the longest-running fair in Ontario, spanning over 200 years. This year, it is slated to take place from Aug. 7-9. “While preparations have started, we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic situation at this time,” said president Mike Seguin. “We know that some people are wondering whether there will be a fair this summer. Although it is not business as usual, we believe that it is premature to make a decision on the fate of this year’s fair.

This includes the South Mountain Fair. The Mountain Township Agricultural Society, which organizes the latter, remained optimistic. The board had yet to cancel the event scheduled from Aug. 13-16, stating it was still evaluating all the factors that might impact holding the event. It also cited that it was awaiting further guidance from government and public health officials before making a decision. The Chesterville Fair, which is set to take place from Aug. 26-28, as well as the Stormont County Fair, to take place from Sept. 4-7, had also not issued any announcements as of Thursday. fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

For the pilot accelerator, it has selected 11 startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

The program, which has been moved online for the time due to the pandemic, which run for 5 months, beginning from April 21.

Due to the current corona crisis all physical elements (e.g. workshops, events) of the program have been transformed into a virtual version in order to support both the startups and the people behind them. All 11 finalists will now have access to a five-months accelerator program provided by Google for Startups. Google

Out of the 11 startups selected, mDoc, a Nigerian healthcare startup that uses technology to make health services more accessible to people is one.

Here is what mDoc does

mDoc provides 24 hours support to people in sub-Saharan Africa with chronic diseases. It does this by connecting people through a virtual network to healthcare service providers using its app.

Through its tech platform, mDoc has a secured centralized repository of users’ healthcare information and uses it to connect them to various practitioners such as nutritionists and coaches.

The experts, in turn, help users with their health goals. They also help people find quality in-person healthcare when needed.

mDoc’s geo-coded database of healthcare providers makes it easy for users to access quality health care from different parts of Africa using their health information which can be updated and monitored on mDoc’s app.

Why was mDoc selected?

Besides its laudable operations and using tech to deliver quality services, the health startup was selected because its services align with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined by the United Nations.

By tackling the problem of access to quality healthcare and support for people with chronic disease, mDoc is working to realize SDG number 3 in Africa.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3

As a part of the accelerator, mDoc will work with Google engineers. The startup will equally have access to mentoring from over 20 teams at Google, as well as outside experts and local mentors.

A lot of public spaces and walking trails are closed, but there are still opportunities in the region for people to get out and stretch their legs.

The Raisin Region Conservation Authority, as part of its response to COVID-19, closed the Gray’s Creek Marina, including access to docks and the boat launch until further notice, but the public can still enjoy its network of nature trails, at the conservation area and also at the Cooper Marsh Conservation Area and Charlottenburgh Park.

The RRCA is continuing to require visitors to practise physical distancing, avoid gathering in groups, and refrain from touching common surfaces.

A number of activities, of course, had to be cancelled, including the popular annual Raisin River Canoe Race the RRCA organizes.

But, some services have continued, including the spring seedling sale. The RRCA before Easter weekend noted there were still a limited number of white pine and white spruce seedlings available for order, and those who purchased tree seedlings will be contacted soon, with information on the pickup date, along with the precautionary measures in place to ensure staff and customer safety.","Walking trails accessible over much of the Cornwall/SDG regionArticle contentThe simple act of walking outdoors has gotten a bit tricky.

“We are preparing for an increase in call volume over the next few weeks to months,” Bill Lister told reporters Friday afternoon.

He also urged people to only call 911 for real emergencies like a heart attack or stroke. This is similar to the measures put in place during the 2018 municipal strike.

Lister says call volumes are actually down right now – about 28 to 41 calls per day since March 12 – partly because hospitals have stopped elective surgeries and doctors are not taking non-essential appointments, leading to fewer ambulance transport calls.

The long term average is about 49 calls per day.

Lister is projecting, at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, we could “see upwards of around 60 calls per day. That’s what we’re planning on, when we reach the peak in this pandemic,” he told Cornwall Newswatch.

Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services has 66 full-time and around 54 part-time paramedics. Lister says they are going to be hiring another 12-20 part-time paramedics in short order in anticipation of the projected uptick in calls.

As for the health of the paramedics on staff now, Lister says there are some showing flu-like symptoms. “We’ve have a few medics tested (for COVID-19) but we don’t have the results back yet. The medics that aren’t at work have mild symptoms like sore throat, runny rose, that type of thing. We have nobody severely ill that we’re able to attribute directly to COVID-19,” he told Newswatch.

As for how the public should handle calling 911, the chief says people should only call “when they really need one (an ambulance)”.

In addition to the symptoms of heart attack or stroke, Lister says you should call if it feels “like you ran a marathon just getting up off the couch.”

“We’re trying to save the resources for the sickest people,” he said.","SD&G – The head of Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services says they will be hiring more paramedics shortly to meet the anticipated demand of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article content Hospitals in SDG and Prescott-Russell have about a week to a 10 days’ worth of personal protective equipment before they run out. Eastern Ontario Health Unit medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis confirmed this Monday, saying unless the region received a massive supply of equipment within the next few days, local hospitals could be forced to decontaminate masks and reuse them.

Roumeliotis still could not give an exact number when asked how many ventilators were in the Prescott-Russell and SDG area, citing that he did not have enough time to look it up. “I don’t have those numbers,” he said. “I’ve just had so many things to do.” Fifth centre opens

Five testing centres are now up and running in the EOHU area — Casselman, Hawkesbury, Winchester, Cornwall and Rockland, which opened its doors on Monday. Roumeliotis outlined there was the potential to open one in Alexandria, if needed. In total, the SDG and Prescott-Russell areas have 44 confirmed cases, with three of them currently in intensive care unit (ICU) and two in a non-ICU setting. Of the five hospitalized cases for the area, three are housed in the Cornwall Community Hospital — with two of them being in ICU. “They are all in stable condition,” answered Roumeliotis when asked about them. “There were rumours that there was a death due to the virus in the area. At this point, we haven’t had any reports of death related to COVID. So far, we haven’t had any deaths.” More On This Topic Eastern Ontario Health Unit now at 42 local cases of COVID-19 EOHU now at 34 cases, including first youth Cornwall-SDG paramedics preparing for a surge of COVID-19 calls Data unveiled by the province on Monday outlined that of the 44 local cases, three have now been classified as resolved. Of those who tested positive, 22 are women and 24 are men. Only one case is reported as being under the age of 20. Three are in the 20s, eight in their 30s, four are in their 40s, 14 are in their 50s, 13 are in their 60s and two are in their 70s. One person’s age is labelled by the province as unknown.

Roumeliotis expressed once again that residents should not visit family members during the pandemic — especially during the upcoming Easter weekend. “Again, I urge everybody, please don’t get together with your families,” he said. “I know that for many it’s an important religious holiday, but it’s really important, particularly over the next week or two, that we stay at home, that we don’t gather and that we don’t go see grandma. “It’s well worth doing phone calls or getting together virtually to protect the most vulnerable in our community.” He also said the number of confirmed cases seems to have slowed down recently. “There’s a bit of a peak between March 14 and March 26,” said Roumeliotis. “We had about five to six new cases on a daily basis. Now it has sort of gone down. We’re looking at keeping that low and we’re going to be monitoring very closely.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine Resources: Ontario’s COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool

Article content This article was edited in order to correct the amount Geoff Clarke earned in 2018 – $160,059. Ontario’s 2019 Sunshine List was unveiled on March 27 and with it, information on most local top earners. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Roumeliotis leads 2019 Sunshine List for Cornwall/SDG Back to video Leading the pack at the City of Cornwall level is chief administrative officer (CAO) Maureen Adams, who made $219,383 in 2019. That compared to a wage of $205,968 in 2018. Cornwall’s general manager of planning, development and recreation Mark Boileau, was the second-highest local municipal earner, making $164,424, as opposed to $161,582 he made in 2018. The city’s general manager of corporate services, Geoff Clarke, earned $164,424 in 2019, as opposed to $160,059 in 2018. The fourth-highest earning administration employee for 2019 was Tracey Bailey, the city’s general manager of financial services and treasurer, who received $154,060, higher than her $142,559 wage in 2018. Cornwall’s manager of employee relations Bruce Donig, earned $138,721 in 2019, whereas he earned $134,156 in 2018. Part of his increase is due to when he accepted the position, with 2019 being the first full year he was working in employee relations.

Article content The 2019 list revealed some of Cornwall’s top earners, such as Adams, Clarke and Bailey, received an increase to their salaries that was higher than the 1.9 per cent provided to the employees represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees in 2019. Management wage increases are often tied to what the city’s unionized workers receive. According to Clarke, the management salary grid also echoes the one in union agreements. Which means, not just the annual cost-of-living bump, but also additional pay after a certain amount of time on the job. “We give everybody the same increase as the union had,” he told the Standard-Freeholder. “The increases you see are promotional grid steps. If I make $20 this year and my next step is $22, but it’s a 1.9 per cent increase, it’s $22 plus the 1.9 per cent increase. “What you see is somebody progressing through their pay band.” More On This Topic Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Cornwall/SDG 2018 Sunshine list The 2019 sunshine list also featured several members of the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the Cornwall Fire Services. Cornwall Police Chief Danny Aikman topped the list for first responders, earning $206,095 last year, as opposed to $183,346 in 2018. The 2019 year was his first full year as chief of police, the difference in earning reflecting his promotion. Another promoted officer, Deputy Chief Shawna Spowart, earned $173,226 in 2019, whereas she had made $151,872 in 2018.

Article content The Cornwall Fire Services highest paid employee for 2019 wasn’t the fire chief. Rather, it was Captain Rejean Quenneville, who earned $163,310, considerably more than his 2018 earnings — $109,381. “There has been promotions and some overtime,” said Fire Chief Pierre Voisine. Overall, 54 of the Cornwall Fire Service’s 64 employees earned enough to land on the Sunshine list, reflecting the current agreement and pay scales. Within the Cornwall Police Service, 70 of the service’s 89 sworn officers earned enough to hit the Sunshine list. Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service Chief Shawn Dulude earned $161,203 in 2019, a slight increase from his 2018 earnings, $157,972. He was followed by Cornwall Fire Services platoon chief, Jody Dewar, who earned $155,323, a significant increase from $125,008 earned in 2018. Voisine himself earned $146,535 last year, slightly more than last year, where the fire chief earned $144,006. Chief administrative officer Tim Simpson topped the list of SDG employees last year, earning $178,659, about $4,000 more than in 2018. Benjamin De Haan was the second-highest SDG earner, making $148,580 in 2019, as opposed to $144,999 he earned in 2018. Former South Glengarry CAO Bryan Brown earned $140,725, whereas South Dundas CAO Shannon Geraghty made $ 137,464.

Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Supplied

Article content A breakdown of information on local cases that many have been calling for since April 2 arrived Wednesday afternoon on the Eastern Ontario Health Unit website. Of 61 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, a multi-coloured map indicated 36 have been in Prescott-Russell, 15 in SDG and 10 in Cornwall, the numbers as of noon on Wednesday. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Most EOHU COVID-19 cases in Prescott-Russell, 25 in Cornwall/SDG Back to video That Prescott-Russell has the highest number does not come as a surprise to Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, the medical officer of health who in his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon said that county has 92,000 residents – more than twice the population of Cornwall, and about 28,000 more than in SDG – many living in close proximity to Ottawa, where COVID-19 has been very prevalent. “Many people who live in Prescott-Russell work in Ottawa,” the doctor said. The website presentation has several graphs and statistics, the EOHU saying it’s the most accurate information available from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS).

Article content Of the 61 cases, five people currently are hospitalized, with three in ICU. There’ve been 34 patients who’ve recovered. The latest release in the Ontario data indicated no increase in local positive cases between Monday and Tuesday, the number still at 61. Provincial data indicates three more cases are considered resolved, for a total of 45 in that category, although the total is different from the aforementioned EOHU data. Other information provided Wednesday by Roumeliotis included the two local cases involving health-care workers, who work in Ottawa. One was disclosed on March 22, a man in his 30s from Prescott-Russell who works at one of the campuses of the Ottawa Hospital. Nothing has been released about the other. Roumeliotis indicated there have not been any outbreaks at any long-term care facilities or retirement residences. More On This Topic Geographic COVID-19 case location information returning: EOHU EOHU data updated Monday indicates 60 COVID-19 cases Province and EOHU showing different, changing COVID-19 data Responding to a question as to whether he believes schools could be open later this spring, possibly in June, the doctor said “I’m not sure, it’s hard to say.” He said that with the province’s emergency measures extended into mid-May, and with it unknown as to whether it would be further extended, or what size of gatherings would be permitted, it would be “touch and go” as to whether kids would physically be back in school this spring.

Article content Roumeliotis said he expects there’ll be eventually a gradual progression in the loosening of social measures, including larger crowd sizes, but that “I don’t believe we’ll be in a state of normalcy before the late fall, and maybe not until the early winter.” Asked if there could be an emergency curfew put in place, as is the case in Akwesasne, Roumeliotis said it’s a possibility, if physical distancing and other measures weren’t being followed, and the number of COVID-19 cases began rising to the point it overwhelmed hospitals. “(A curfew is) on the table, it’s something we’ve discussed as our next step (aimed at) curtailing gatherings,” he said. “If we feel that measures need to be taken, they’ll be taken.” Roumeliotis said the number of tests done at assessment centres in the region is at just about the 800 mark. The breakdown is as follows: Hawkesbury 292; Cornwall 198; Casselman 165; Rockland 90; Winchester 51. The doctor said about half of the tests have results that are known, and that those still pending should have results come in “in the next day or so.” One graph on the EOHU website for cumulative total confirmed cases in the region, after having an upward curve for most of mid-March into early April, has levelled off over the last handful of days. Responding to whether he expects another surge, Roumeliotis said “it’s hard to say, (but) I hope not. I think what we are trying to do now is level it off. . . we’re having the odd case here, a case there, but it’s a manageable number. Our hospitals are indeed still coping.”

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

The event provided the opportunity for AOSIS members and others to highlight synergies between the disruption of COVID-19 and climate change, and the ways in which responses to the pandemic support more sustainable climate action and ambition in the lead up to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC and beyond.

The Placencia Ambition Forum convened virtually from 20-22 April 2020, and was hosted by the Government of Belize, which is currently serving as AOSIS Chair.

The Forum made the case for accelerating inclusive, green transitions, with COVID-19 magnifying the importance of the priorities of small island developing States (SIDS) for the global climate change agenda. For example, reduced use of transport and energy demand due to the pandemic show that change is possible.

Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that retreating on climate action in the face of the pandemic is not an option given that the social and economic devastation caused by climate disruption will be exponentially greater than the COVID-19 crisis. He emphasized the need to “build back better” from the pandemic and use the recovery from COVID-19 impacts to ensure a more sustainable and resilient future. He said he will continue to advocate for debt relief, including for middle-income countries (MICs), to enable SIDS to survive both the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change.

Others also reiterated their support for SIDS. For example, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) committed to work on innovative financial structuring to ensure that stimulus packages do not compound the debt burden faced by SIDS, and to improve access to finance, especially in response to the pandemic.



The Forum reiterated that the intersecting climate and COVID-19 crises require actions that simultaneously address both challenges, with stimulus packages and other COVID-19 responses that are aligned with climate targets and that enable transition to greener, cleaner, and more resilient societies. For example, expanding renewable energy capacity in SIDS and least developed countries (LDCs) is consistent with efforts to enhance the sustainable water and energy supply required for medical purposes.

The Forum resulted in a Declaration titled, ‘2020 – Our Year of Ambition,’ which calls for:

ambitious, detailed, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that will close the gap between where we are now and where we need to be to limit global warming to 1.5°C;

new financial commitments that deliver on support and reflect ambition, including deeper discussions at COP 26 on the long-term finance goal to provide certainty for more ambitious mid- to long-term climate actions; and

enhanced near-term action to protect the vulnerable, including short-term action and domestic reform within the context of building long-term resilience.

The Declaration also urges countries to follow through with COVID-19 recovery plans that incorporate policies and measures that help jump start NDC implementation and lead to enhanced ambition and action. It calls for a ‘Roadmap for Political Momentum’ towards COP 26, and welcomes the Group of 20 (G20) commitment to use the SDGs and other international commitments to guide recovery from COVID-19.

The Declaration explains that the health and climate crises both reveal vulnerabilities to systemic shocks and demand unprecedented transitions to “flatten their respective curves and drive an exponential shift in their trajectories.” The Declaration calls for 2020 to be “the year of ambition,” beginning with plans to change emission trajectories towards achieving 1.5°C.

The Forum fed into the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which recognized efforts of the Placencia Ambition Forum to maintain the momentum in addressing climate change despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

102,https://expertinvestoreurope.com/what-do-bad-sdg-impact-ratings-mean/,"Thu, 21 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Expert Investor,What do ‘bad’ SDG impact ratings mean?,"“It’s just a realistic status of where we are,” says Till Jung, managing director, global head of ESG products at ISS, when commenting on the low positive impact companies have on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services, recently rated a universe of more than 6,500 companies and revealed that only 3% of these delivered a significant positive impact on the SDGs.

The firm applies a holistic view in its rating and measures a company’s overall contribution to the SDGs. This is a company’s most distinct and material, positive and negative performance across its products and services, operations and controversies, which it then aggregates, explains Jung.

The tool seeks to help investors align their portfolios to the SDGs and report on them.

SDG leaders and laggards

A champion would stand out through “positive contributions to those SDGs on which, given its business model, it can have the greatest potential for positive impact, and at the same time have no negative impacts in the remaining SDGs”.

But while many would expect Tesla to score positively, the tool did not evaluate the firm as expected, Jung tells Expert Investor.

It has a significant positive impact on SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy; and SDG 13 – climate action, as it derives a large percentage of revenue from, for example, solar energy systems, electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, Jung explains.

However, it is also one of the lowest performing companies on SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth.

Tesla underperforms in the management of labour issues in the supply chain, as well as employee health and safety standards and failed to respect union rights in the US, ISS ESG’s analysis has shown.

“Tesla’s positive contribution to SDGs 7 and 13 is therefore netted out by its significant negative impact on SDG 8,” explains Jung.

Among the strongest overall performers rated with the tool is a French real estate company, Klépierre – which contributes to SDG 11 – sustainable cities and communities.

Approximately 99% of the firm’s standing assets by value have been certified with the green building standard BREEAM and the firm also manages potential negative externalities across the remaining SDGs, says Jung.

SDGs as investing tool

The importance of SDG investing is rising, according to Rachel Bass, senior manager, research at non-profit organisation Global Impact Investing Network (Giin).

“We are seeing more and more impact investors aligning their portfolios with the SDGs, with nearly three-quarters of respondents to the Giin’s 2020 State of Impact Measurement and Management Practice survey using the SDGs to guide their impact measurement and management practices, and over half setting their impact targets to the SDGs,” she tells Expert Investor.

The application of the SDGs in investments, however, is an evolving process.

Bass explains that the development goals “provide a useful framework for understanding impact in a broader global context, but they were originally drafted with governments as the intended audience, not investors”.

Piet Klop, senior advisor responsible investment at Dutch asset manager PGGM, adds: “We consider the SDGs as a useful lingua franca; they help to align our investments with overall goals, and help our communications with peers and pension fund participants.

“Most importantly, they support our thinking about real world outcomes of our investments and engagements.”

Data challenges

One of the challenges, Bass says, is to create useful ratings, which demands that impact is measured and sufficiently standardised to be comparable and specific enough (eg sector-specific) to be meaningful.

She highlights the importance of advancing the availability and rigour of aggregate and comparable impact performance data, which the Giin is currently working on.

Jung explains that ISS ESG uses publicly available information, such as from news, NGOs, public authorities and verifies this data by sharing it with companies to include their feedback in the overall assessment.

Investor preference

Given the limited amount of companies that, today, have a highly positive impact and no negative impact; investors have to make choices, Jung explains.

A strong SDG strategy results in a limited investment universe and less diversification.

“If you want to do a water fund – for example, let’s say an SDG 6 fund or product – do you in that case only care about a strong positive impact on water or do you also want to avoid any negative impact on other SDGs?”

A wider view and less impactful strategy – ie investing aligned with the SDGs and in companies with a limited positive impact – would, however, generate a solid investment universe, Jung says.

Until more companies have a highly positive impact on the SDGs, investors will be forced to make these sorts of choices.","It has a significant positive impact on SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy; and SDG 13 – climate action, as it derives a large percentage of revenue from, for example, solar energy systems, electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, Jung explains.
However, it is also one of the lowest performing companies on SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth.
“Tesla’s positive contribution to SDGs 7 and 13 is therefore netted out by its significant negative impact on SDG 8,” explains Jung.

103,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/how-clean-energy-can-power-a-covid-19-recovery/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: How Clean Energy Can Power a COVID-19 Recovery,"As the COVID-19 pandemic gains ground in the world’s poorest regions, it will hit the most vulnerable the hardest by adding an unprecedented health and economic crisis to existing poverty and climate crises. This multifaceted crisis will keep adding pressure to fragile communities. It calls for a comprehensive and collaborative response. And at the root of it is clean energy; essential to help countries prepare, respond, and recover from COVID-19 crisis.

Clean energy can provide affordable solutions that are in line with climate targets and can help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on people’s livelihoods and local economies.

On the frontline of the battle against COVID-19, energy for households and health centers is critical. Yet 840 million people don’t have electricity, 570 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa, where one in four clinics has no energy at all, and 28 percent don’t have consistent access.

Reliable power supply ensures that core systems for the management of health programmes can function effectively.

In regions where the electricity grid is unreliable or even non-existent, clean energy technologies provide solutions that can be deployed rapidly. With reliable energy, health centers can work around the clock, instead of relying on candles or phone flashlights.

Solar for Health

The Solar for Health programme, funded principally by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, UNDP and Innovation Norway, and ongoing in 11 countries since 2016, showcases a green model that improves health services while saving lives, the environment, and money.

UNDP and its partners seek to build on this expertise to support countries in scaling up clean energy investments for the electrification of health centers.

Clean energy can also address some of the health risks that might make people more vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Nearly half of the world relies on polluting fuels and inefficient stoves for cooking, at considerable health and environmental costs. Every year 3.8 million people die prematurely from illnesses linked to smoke from open fire or stoves. Promoting the use of clean fuels and energy efficient stoves can protect billions of people from breathing in harmful fumes at home every day.

Access to energy also makes social distancing policies viable by powering the technologies and devices that help people to stay in touch with each other, receive information, engage in online education, and work from home. It can also provide reliable access to clean water, a crucial element in times of COVID-19. It also ensures food security by enabling food cold chains, and powering water pumps.

Boost investment in clean energy

Clean energy can also fuel economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. Renewable energies are an engine for job creation. A record 11 million people worldwide were employed in the renewables sector in 2018 and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that this number could rise to 42 million jobs globally by 2050.

Clean energy also boosts local economies. Decentralized, off-grid energy systems can help small businesses thrive and offer potential for sources for additional income.

Clean energy is available, affordable, and reliable. But in many developing countries and economies, the potential for large scale renewable energy projects remains largely untapped. Investments in this area are still much lower than would be required to deliver clean energy’s full development and climate benefits.

Lifting barriers

Across the world, UNDP is working with governments to lift the barriers that impede these investments. By addressing the policy and financial risks associated to such investments in developing economies, UNDP aims to help government create an enabling environment for renewable energy. UNDP’s Africa Minigrid Programme and Solar for Health, being set up in over 11 countries, is set to expand across the continent.

As nations prepare for the COVID-19 aftermath, there is a tremendous opportunity for a global reset. Ambitious green stimulus plans will help countries restore their economies while deepening their energy transition. As oil prices drop to historical lows, we need to ensure the world stays on track with its climate targets. Now is a good time to reform fossil fuel subsidies and re-assess the options countries have to accelerate their clean energy transition to sustain a recovery that’s better for all.

make sustainable products the norm in the EU, including, for example, the restriction of single-use products and ensuring that products on the EU market are designed to last longer, are easier to reuse, repair, and recycle, and incorporate recycled material as much as possible;

empower consumers through access to reliable information about products at the point of sale, including on their life span;

focus on sectors that use the most resources and have the potential for high circularity, including electronics and information and communications technology (ICT), batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, and food; and

ensure less waste by transforming it into high-quality secondary resources and implementing actions to minimize EU waste exports and tackle illegal shipments.

Applying ambitious circular economy measures in Europe can increase the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) by an additional 0.5% by 2030, creating around 700,000 new jobs, according to a European Commission press release.

The Action Plan includes measures to mobilize private financing in support of the circular economy through EU financial instruments, such as InvestEU. It also proposes the launch of a global circular economy alliance to explore starting a discussion on a possible international agreement on natural resource management.

An Assessment of VLRs to Date,"There are only ten years left to deliver the 2030 Agenda. However, as speakers and reports prepared for the 2019 SDGs Summit clearly demonstrated, we are not progressing fast enough. To increase momentum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres inaugurated the ‘Decade of Action’ in January 2020. The Decade is built on three levels of action—global action, local action, and people action—to accelerate progress on the SDGs.

Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) could be an important vehicle to accelerate ‘local action’. Four VLRs were launched during the July 2018 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – by Kitakyushu, Shimokawa, and Toyama in Japan, and New York City in the US. These VLRs have ignited enthusiasm among other cities.

Building on these efforts to localize the SDGs and to further our contribution to the “Decade of Action,” the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) has released two complementary publications to highlight and support the work of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) in implementing the 2030 Agenda:

The “State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs” is a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020.

“The Shimokawa Method for Voluntary Local Review: A Blueprint for Localising the SDGs” is a method on how to conduct a VLR based on Shimokawa’s experience.

We understand the VLR as a process in which LRGs voluntarily review and follow-up implementation of the SDGs. This process becomes a vehicle for sharing experiences, challenges and lessons learnt, as well as to open avenues for new partnerships to address any current shortcomings LRGs might confront. It can also enable LRGs to engage communities in the process, thereby strengthening the accountability and inclusiveness of their policymaking.

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report analyzes the 16 VLRs that had been identified as of February 2020. Of these “first generation” VLRs, four were launched in 2018, ten in 2019, and two in 2020 (all are available at the VLR Lab, here). After summarizing the main characteristics of the 16 VLRs, this report focuses on two crucial aspects of conducting a local review: the level to which the VLR process engages with stakeholders, and the alignment of the VLR with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process. The report reviews the impressive number of commitments and actions that are already underway at the local level, details which are often missing in VNRs.

The comparative analysis of VLRs revealed that conducting a VLR can unlock meaningful opportunities for cities and regions. In particular, a VLR: 1) allows the local government to listen to the needs of its people and reflect them into local policymaking; 2) invites self-reflection; 3) provides for a process that is data-driven and can be used to plan for action to achieve the future we want; and 4) gives a local take on the global conversation on sustainable development. Altogether, these opportunities can lead to transformation. The report also found that the majority of the first generation of VLRs have focused chiefly on aligning the SDGs with local policies, but have not explicitly included a stakeholder engagement process, with notable exceptions being Shimokawa, Manheim, and New Taipei.

In the conclusion of the report, we emphasized the need to envision the next generation of VLRs. The next generation should maximize the meaningful opportunities provided by the VLR process, as identified in the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report, to capture all its benefits. We suggest that these opportunities will only be fully crystalized once the current approach is changed.

A key recommendation for maximizing these benefits is to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the VLR process, and to enable this engagement to be thorough and self-organised. In the case of Shimokawa, a community-led platform with staff from all bureaus of the town hall developed the new 2030 vision, fully embracing the SDGs. This vision then guided Shimokawa’s comprehensive plan (the highest level of planning), and contributed to fostering ownership of the town vision and plan. In addition, Shimokawa specifically tried to engage communities during the action-plan setting phase and helped establish an implementation platform that could mobilize different stakeholders for different community-led initiatives.

This planning process was built on “backcasting,” an approach that identifies a desirable outcome and then walks backwards to find measures to reach the final destination. The case of Shimokawa demonstrates that this approach enables a more robust, transformative policy process than through the use of forecasting, while also allowing for continuously revisiting the vision initially set if the circumstances change.

The report on the Shimokawa Method for VLRs builds on the mechanism used in the Shimokawa case, translating it into ten practical and straightforward steps, This report also incorporates findings from the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report and contains a guide for “VLR format” to which cities can refer as they construct their own VLRs.

The Next Generation of VLRs

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report presents an assessment of the currently available VLRs, while the Shimokawa Method report provides a handbook for implementing VLRs. These two documents seek to pave the way for improving the VLR process. While many internal areas of improvements related to VLRs can be addressed by using the Shimokawa method, more must be done. In particular, when looking to increase the global and national impact of VLRs, cities must strive to integrate their VLRs with their national VNR processes, so that a country can address territorial challenges and scale up successful local solutions.

The principles that underlie the 2030 Agenda resonate strongly with the ongoing global crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic is reminding humanity that society as a whole is as vulnerable as its most vulnerable people. It also brings into sharp focus the ramifications of inequality at many levels. These challenges cannot be suddenly alleviated during the crisis. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.” Recovery must go beyond “returning” and aim to “Build Back Better”, anchored in leaving no one and no place behind. VLRs can be instrumental to this end, building resilience and transforming our cities.

Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, AGN Chair and Vice-President of the Bureau of COP/CMP/CMA, states that the AGN stands in solidarity with countries affected by COVID-19, and stresses the importance for all nations to continue to build momentum for ambitious climate action.

Gahouma-Bekale highlights 2020 as “an important year for the completion of the rules of the Paris Agreement and the Communication of revised and updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as well as the start of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.” He laments the postponement due to COVID-19 of many events which are crucial to building political momentum before the sessions of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies and COP 26.

The AGN emphasizes the urgency for all nations to take ambitious collective climate action at COP 26. Highlighting African countries’ particular vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the Group notes scientists have warned that the world has reached a “tipping point.”

The AGN calls on developed countries to close the climate finance gap by the end of 2020 despite the postponement of the COP, in line with the commitment by developed countries to provide USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. However, the statement notes, a September 2019 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that developed countries provided only USD 71.2 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2017.

The number of people suffering hunger has increased, climate change is occurring faster than predicted, and inequality is increasing within and among countries, António Guterres says in his ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ 2020 report.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched four years ago to address the most pressing global needs for a sustainable future, including education and health improvements and reductions in social and economic inequalities.

“I think [food price rises are] probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before. It’s like having an emergency in every single country.” Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy, WFP

“The effects of the pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact have overwhelmed the health systems globally, caused businesses and factories to shut down and severely impacted the livelihoods of half of the global workforce,” he says in the report.

It comes on top of an existing slowing in progress towards many of the SDGs, and Guterres had launched a Decade of Action in September to turn things around.

The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The report has been released ahead of UN Economic and Social Council high-level meetings scheduled for July to provide a global, data-driven overview of the SDGs.

Women and girls

Last year’s report had already warned that there was “simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls”.

In the 2020 review, Guterres says “the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled”.

Only half of the world’s women who are married or ‘in-union’ make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, based on 2007-2018 data from 57 countries, the report says.

Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.

More than 260 million children were out of school in 2017 and 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in 2018.

As of 2019, less than half of primary and lower secondary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, computers, the internet and basic handwashing facilities, the report states.

Billions of people worldwide still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, including 2.2 billion people without safe drinking water.

And, the world is projected to miss the target to end poverty in all its forms as hunger increased for the fourth consecutive year and about 50 million children experienced acute undernutrition. Globally, 144 million children under five were still affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters of these children in Central and Southern Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.

Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

“The SDGs reflected the political will of the time,” she says. “Today, in the midst of this pandemic, I think it’s safe to say global political will is in short supply.”

Food crisis

Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in institutions and development at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), says he is sceptical of suggestions in the report that progress has been made on poverty, because the quality of data from national governments has become worse.

He says that wage protections and labour rights need to be made into political issues to ensure they stay on governments’ radars.

“COVID-19 is going to make questions of hunger much worse,” Sinha says. “People are talking about a global response in terms of a vaccine, I think we should pay attention to those who are talking about a global response to the coming food crisis.”

The SDG progress report comes after the United Nations predicted last week that the COVID-19 crisis could push 130 million more people into poverty in the next 10 years.

About 35 million people are expected to fall below the extreme poverty line this year as a result of the pandemic, with 56 per cent of them in Africa, the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2020 report predicted.

The global economy is forecast to lose a staggering US$8.5 trillion in production over the next two years due to the pandemic, the UN report says.

This is a “tremendous setback” for sustainable development, Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, told SciDev.Net.

“[The pandemic] is particularly affecting the more vulnerable groups … because these are the ones whose activities generally require some form of physical proximity to others.”

Remittances

Remittances from migrant workers in the global North could face a hit – in countries such as Haiti, South Sudan and Tonga, remittances constitute more than a third of gross domestic product.

“You have an abrupt cut of people’s livelihoods and incomes, and then you’ve got different kinds of cascading effects through the bigger food system,” says Sophia Murphy, senior specialist in agriculture, trade and investment at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

There are also fears about what the pandemic could mean for long-term food security, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) estimating that 130 million more people in low- and middle-income countries may be pushed into acute food insecurity this year.

Bumper crops in some regions are at risk of being wasted. India has been hit by COVID-19 at harvest time, with crops left unpicked and difficulties getting grain to market for sale before it spoils.

This comes after rising hunger in the three years to 2018 pushed undernourishment back to levels seen around 2010.

Evidence of price rises has already emerged. In Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo, the WFP notes a 10 per cent surge in the price of a typical local basket of food – comprising fish, pulses, peanut paste, cassava flour, oil and condiments – in the space of two weeks.

The organisation expects food price rises to occur more widely, as this is happening in countries such as Syria, where prices have more than doubled in the past year.

“I think it’s probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before,” says Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy at the WFP’s London office.

“It’s like having an emergency in every single country that you’re working in.”

Some countries are already reeling from other problems, such as the locust swarms in East Africa, leading to potentially “devastating” impacts, she adds.","The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

108,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-charts-businesses-path-through-covid-19-crisis/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ITC Charts Businesses’ Path Through COVID-19 Crisis,"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a 15-point action plan to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSMEs, the action plan notes, are “the driving force behind” many essential services in the pandemic. However, they are also particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of the crisis, especially in developing and transition economies. Beyond facing weaker consumer confidence and being overrepresented in the hardest-hit sectors such as retail trade, tourism, and personal and professional services, MSMEs have fewer assets, reduced access to credit, and a more challenging trade environment relative to large companies.

The plan for MSMEs is centered around five recommendations for businesses, five for business support organizations, and five for governments. An ITC news release featuring a consolidated set of recommendations reminds the reader in each of the three sections to both “prepare your immediate response to the crisis” and to “get ready for the ‘new normal’.”

Free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food.

The plan’s introduction highlights that the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates a decline in cross-border investment flows by up to 30-40% in 2020-2021. Accordingly, trade aspects feature prominently throughout the action plan, and are especially strong in the section for governments, though the plan emphasizes that governments, business support organizations, and small business alike should coordinate the immediate response in a collaborative manner. The plan calls on governments to implement support measures built around concessional financing, tax reductions and grants, employment incentives, and targeted interventions.

Resisting the allure of trade protectionism is paramount, the plan argues. It emphasizes that free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food. Thus, the plan also recommends that governments facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services, and streamline the movement of essential products by following best practices as outlined in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Actions include, inter alia: certificates for medical equipment and essential food items; enhanced border management coordination, for example between customs and sanitary authorities; special regimes for expedited clearance of certain goods; and accelerating clearance processes for trusted traders or authorized economic operators who respect health-related rules and regulations.

The plan also notes that governments can expand and facilitate access to trade finance for MSMEs, including those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The pandemic, the plan notes, has negatively impacted the availability of trade finance for small business due to higher liquidity costs and the perceived risk of short-term finance, leaving a void for governments to fill. The document notes that several economies have expanded short-term programmes that provide financial support to national exporters. Flagging that nearly all MSMEs rely on goods that have been sourced internationally, the plan stresses that now more than ever is the time “to conserve the links between small businesses and international markets.”

The plan underscores that trade documents and procedures can be digitalized in collaboration with the private sector, noting that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement encourages countries to introduce digital clearance processes. As noted above, such processes can simplify cross-border trade whilst limiting physical contact and in-person interactions. While the plan points to the private sector as having responsibility for digitalizing trade documents, it acknowledges that the onus is on governments to provide legal certainty that these documents will be recognized within their respective jurisdictions.

They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform

Maybe it’s time we agreed on another SDG – The 18th Goal: Managingor Handling Pandemics.

The SDGs or Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in September 2015 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform. Of course, they followed the somewhat unsuccessful MDGs or Millennium Development Goals that the member states had adopted earlier. These were eight goals expected to be realised by the year 2015 that were adopted at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.

It was,however, found by 2013 that progress towards the MDG goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. Experts and critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. The UN therefore, felt it appropriate to redesign the world’s goals for development and member states thus officially adopted the historic new agenda for development, entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” and now includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets.These 17 SDGs are comprehensive, and all-encompassing and embrace all aspects of development for the world including poverty, inequality and hunger; health and education; water and sanitation; energy and industry; decent work; infrastructure and urbanisation; climate change, peace and justice. They balance the economic, social and ecological dimensions of sustainable development, and place the fight against poverty and development on the same agenda for the first time. Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. In India, the NITIAayog is coordinating the SDGs progress and implementation. It has constructed the SDG India Index spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs and tracks progress across all States and UTs. It also measures their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India.

We are now in 2020. Five years since 2015 and the adoption of these SDGs and we find that at the international level, progress in some areas, such as on extreme poverty reduction, widespread immunization, decrease in child mortality rates and increase in people’s access to electricity, but slow going on many other programmes. Probably the global response has not been ambitious enough, leaving the most vulnerable people and countries to suffer the most.

And as we face the COVID 19 pandemic, there is danger that many societies may slip on the progress made so far. The most important thing that COVID 19 has taught us is global cooperation. Even the very competitive multi-national pharma companies are sharing their individual confidences and collaborating with other pharma companies and labs in trying to find a Vaccine. Today we need effective collaboration and shared communication among health experts, economists, scientists and policy makers. That is the only way we will manage to manageto contain this Corona Virus.

As Yuval Noah Harari, the famous Israeli historian and philosophersaid in a recent interview, we now need a collective leadership – ‘like a coalition of the willing’! He argues that even for promoting nationalism it’s better to protect your own when everybody is protected. Emergencies accelerate the momentum of history. We thus need global solidarity to take the right decisions now and that is why we need a new SDG 18!

Many people predict the future but hardly anyone listens. Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 2015 famously talked about preparing for pandemicsand today we have social media claiming that he did it to promote his work in vaccines! Cynics will always abound, but global governance must use the structures it has to take collective decisions. Because if you solve it in some countries but the poor countries remain affected, you may get unmanageable immigration and even conflict.

Some of the lessons from COVID will change our social behaviour for example online meetings and virtual education, but basic human nature and structures of governance will still be there. The earlier epidemics didn’t change these either whether they be SARS, Spanish Flu or AIDS. So, if the same structures of global governance remain then we must use these structures to address this pandemic and its aftermath.

It could be argued that the SDGs already have Goal 3: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’. However, it could also be argued that this is too narrow an agenda. This Pandemic is proving to be much more than just a health issue. Despite the life vs livelihood debate the fact remains that the global economy is in a downward tailspin. This debacle will impact not just health but the very basis of what we consider to be human. The response to it must therefore be multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral. Thus the need for a new development agenda – SDG 18: Managing Pandemics.

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles.

The top 12 nominated entrepreneurs will be able to pitch their products and solutions at the Summit, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021 during the Building Bridges Week and will get support to access strategic partners to scale up their venture.

According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.) to nominate from their own pipelines, up to 3 entrepreneurs which meet the eligibility criteria. Self nomination is not be accepted. The call will remain open till 15 July.

The call is for growth stage impact ventures for SDGs aimed at identifying and showcasing mature impact ventures in emerging countries with the catalytic potential to drive both large impact and yield sustainable profit.

The UNDP said 2020 the Call for Nominations only accepts Post Series A impact ventures providing products and services which reduce inequalities (with particular attention to gender inequalities) by providing solutions that empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to access to quality health, affordable and clean energy, and by reducing and recovering waste. Only ventures with headquarters, primary workforce and service provision or product market in developing countries can be eligible for the selection.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

In 2019, 76 third-parties submitted 119 proposals from 40 developing countries. Eighty-five percent of the nominated ventures had raised at least half a million dollars at the time of nomination, and closed their Series A. All 12 finalists were mid-sized, with an average of up to 50 employees, annual revenue of over US$3 million, and with a cumulative impact on more than 15 million lives through their products and services.

Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

In the first article in this series, it was noted that the SDGs can help us chart a path out of the current socioeconomic crisis and into a more resilient and regenerative future. At this point you may be thinking: Our company has already figured out our SDG approach. Well, before you get too comfortable, not all SDG responses are created equal.

The Future-Fit team has examined hundreds of sustainability reports over the past few years, and we’ve found that business responses to the SDGs typically follow one of three patterns: Defensive, Selective or Holistic.

Image credit: Future-Fit Foundation

Defending the status quo merely justifies ‘business as usual’

The first pattern is to defend the status quo — to tell a story about what the company is already doing on topics relating to the SDGs, rather than seeking out opportunities to change.

For example, a company which already has a target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions might claim it is aligned with SDG 13 – Climate Action. But most of today’s GHG targets fall far short of the rapid decarbonisation trajectory we need.

Or a company might say it is contributing to SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – merely because it is creating jobs. But what if those jobs pay less than a living wage, or if working conditions are so onerous that employee wellbeing suffers?

Emphasising storytelling over action merely justifies business as usual — which is what got us into this mess in the first place.

A defensive approach to the SDGs may appeal to CEOs who still believe in the primacy of shareholder value, whereby companies exist only to deliver financial returns. But defensive claims lack both ambition and authenticity, and only leave companies open to accusations of SDG-washing.

Any company taking a defensive route is unlikely to attract and retain great employees, loyal customers, and increasingly-concerned investors.

A selective response can be counterproductive

The second pattern is to consider just one or a few of the 17 SDGs.

This selective approach is akin to the notion of Creating Shared Value: focusing on areas where the company’s current business model already intersects with a societal need.

For example, a pharmaceutical company may choose to focus on SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being – by making medicines that help people to live productive lives. Such efforts may indeed make a genuine contribution to SDG 3 — if the medicines are affordable and accessible to those who need them most.

But is that enough? What if manufacturing the medicines uses huge amounts of fresh water, and the production takes place in a water-stressed area? For local communities in that region, the company may actually be undermining SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation.

And what if that same company can only bring its medicines to market profitably by relying on low-cost suppliers who aren’t paying their workers a living wage? In that case, the company’s success may actually be slowing down progress toward SDG 1 – No Poverty.

The reality, of course, is that today’s companies exist only as part of a complex value web that touches multiple, interlinked systems: markets, communities, ecosystems and so on.

In this sea of complexity, linear notions of cause and effect start to evaporate — and without careful consideration, any action in one area can lead to undesirable consequences elsewhere.

So, a selective approach to the SDGs can be counterproductive: Even the most well-meaning company might be inadvertently exacerbating one problem attempting to solve while another.

Are such trade-offs acceptable? Possibly, but how can we be sure if we do nothing to identify and measure them?

A holistic approach measures and mitigates trade-offs

That brings us to the third pattern: taking a holistic approach — one which considers all of a company’s SDG impacts, both positive and negative, across the company’s value web.

No business decision is ever free of trade-offs. But if we take a systems approach — by looking at all interactions between the company and its suppliers, its customers, other socioeconomic actors, and the environment — it is possible to identify otherwise unforeseen issues. Negative trade-offs across the company’s value web can then be anticipated and avoided — or at the very least mitigated.

This kind of systems approach to managing extra-financial performance is crucial, because positive and negative impacts almost never cancel each other out. Greenhouse gas emissions are an exception: a ton of CO2 emitted in Johannesburg may be ‘neutralised’ by a ton of CO2 drawn down from the atmosphere in Tokyo. But other kinds of impact — product waste, water stress, land use change, human rights violations — cannot typically be netted out, across time or location.

Gradual improvements in one area, and the expense of exacerbating problems elsewhere, aren’t going to bring the SDGs in reach. We must eliminate — and eventually reverse — all of the damage done to our natural systems and social fabric; and that means striving to maximise the good while working consciously, continuously and collectively to eliminate the bad. Such a holistic response is essential if we are to make the SDGs a reality.

We can think of this third option as striving to create not just shareholder value, or even shared value, but system value.

Take a minute to scan your last sustainability report’s CEO statement, and to peel back the glossy SDG infographics. Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is holistic? Are you committed to creating system value?

If the answer is yes, that’s fantastic — and I’d love to hear from you, because such examples are few and far between. And if you’re not so sure, maybe the Future-Fit Business Benchmark can help you get there. Take a look at our SDG Explorer, which explains what every company must strive to do, to be sure it in no way undermines our collective progress toward a resilient and regenerative future.","Can you say, hand on heart, that your company’s current SDG response really is creating system-wide value?

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

117,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/unlocking-natures-potential/,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Unlocking Nature’s Potential,"The world is facing multiple, interdependent global crises, where dislocation in one area can ripple through and impact many others. COVID-19 comes just as the public was beginning, slowly, to come to terms with the climate crisis and its far-reaching implications. The pandemic highlights how interconnected we are, and how impossible it is to disentangle the problems we all face in a globalized world. Holistic approaches to these problems are needed and they are needed fast. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), an umbrella term to describe a wide array of ecosystem-based actions that incorporate the natural environment to mitigate climate change and ensure ecosystem sustainability, has grown in prominence in recent years as potentially being such an approach.

Many companies are increasingly aware of the impact their unsustainable commodity production has on the environment and are recognizing that business cannot thrive in a world of environmental stress, poverty, and uncertainty. Some of those companies are starting to plan and implement preventive and restorative actions within their operations, with NbS providing a cost-effective tool to create a seemingly more responsible and sustainable forest-risk commodity value chain.

Detailed information on how companies are carrying out NbS within their operations, however, is still lagging. In a recent briefing, CDP analysed its 2019 Forests disclosure data on 543 companies that gathered information about the integration of NbS into their operations. We found that only 15% of companies reported having implemented any form of NbS, as well as a lack of consistency amongst those who did. The results spoke a clear message: we have a long way to go to encourage more widespread and ambitious implementation of NbS. As stated in the recent #TogetherWithNature statement, NbS must be considered a complementary approach to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, in addition to following a pathway of decarbonization, enacting comprehensive climate policies and enforcing proper accountability.

In the last year, NbS has become increasingly prominent in policy discussions on the environmental crisis. They featured heavily in the UN Climate Action Summit, particularly in the NbS Coalition co-led by China and New Zealand. At COP 25 in December, NbS were constituted a central theme in the high-level segments and the Santiago Call for Action on Forests. NbS are also set to take centre-stage in the negotiations of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. For the private sector, it pays to be transparent, as businesses that disclose and take leading action on climate change can better identify and measure their environmental risks and opportunities. Data from STOXX has shown that CDP’s ‘A List’ has outperformed its global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a 7-year period.

The private sector presents a largely untapped opportunity for the implementation of NbS, when implemented in accordance with the best available science-based targets and with appropriate safeguards. As the COVID-19 crisis recedes, policymakers should seize the political momentum for the 2021 – 2030 UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and recognize the role and participation of non-state actors in driving NbS, creating regulatory environments that are both institutionally and financially conducive for all stakeholders to take ambitious, measurable action. To start, they could:

1. Encourage corporate environmental disclosure

Disclosure is the bedrock of action. Corporate environmental disclosure needs to be more transparent and common, including for NbS. For this to occur, there needs to be improved regulatory frameworks to promote transparency in supply chains, fostering the integration of environmental protection assessments in business operations.

2. Mainstream NbS into legislation and regulatory frameworks for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development

Situating NbS as a cross-cutting policy tool within NDCs, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and the SDGs (especially SDGs 12, 13 and 15) would not only help with the implementation of projects but would promote more accurate measurement of their effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

3. Improve the criteria, metrics and measurement of NbS

Whilst NbS are present in the majority of NDCs submitted to date, most of these do not include quantifiable targets. In order to harness private sector potential on the implementation of NbS and be part of a coherent global response to climate and biodiversity, there must be adequate and science-backed targets outlining the direction of action.

International policy efforts have multiple windows of opportunity to introduce integrated solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, and human development. All these issues are underpinned by our relationship with nature. Policymakers and corporate actors must engage in mutually supportive, ambitious, and carefully implemented action, to ensure that the potential of nature to be an important part of the solution to the current crises is unlocked.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations. (Since our previous update on VNR countries, Zimbabwe no longer appears on the list of second-time presenters).

Tiwana highlights the persistence of “MDG mindsets” and an increase in censorship and surveillance. He also suggests five ways to build a better post-pandemic world.

What have you observed about the SDG community’s responses to the pandemic?

Significant attention is being focused on the negative impacts of COVID-19, especially on impoverished and excluded communities. Important issues such as debt relief and financing for development have come to the fore. For example, the IMF announced immediate debt service relief for 25 countries in April, and further efforts are underway.

Yet, across the board, “MDG mindsets” remain stubbornly prevalent. The MDGs were weak in their comprehension of development by focusing on a small sub-set of rights. They were also charity-oriented in their approach, and reinforced top-down aid in the Global South.

The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential. However, five years since the passage of the SDGs, the impulse in many quarters is still to scale up existing approaches. A lot of the emphasis remains on “soft” communications and feel-good actions, rather than to push for fundamental changes in how our societies and economies function to better realize rights.

What impacts do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda?

COVID-19 could be a turning point. I have guarded optimism that we could overcome the paucity of ambition that has held us back from making transformative shifts.

COVID-19 has exposed and accelerated existing problems in our societies. Inequality, exclusion, and lack of voice were already marring progress on the 2030 Agenda. With COVID-19, the worst impacts are being felt by the disadvantaged as hunger and deprivation abound. Violence against women and excluded minorities has spiked. All of this is undermining the commitment to leave no one behind. Recent protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world highlight the importance of people’s participation for overcoming structural inequities and getting States to discharge their responsibilities to ensure proper health care, education, and access to justice for those most at risk. Thus, a silver lining has been renewed purpose among activists and civil society organizations to demand radical shifts to ‘leave no one behind.’

However, a less constructive trend has emerged as well. As public safety has taken center stage, censorship and surveillance have ramped up along with official propaganda. Many governments have sought to control the narrative about their pandemic response by clamping down on civic freedoms. Even before COVID-19 struck, only three percent of the world’s population lived in countries where the fundamental civic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association were adequately protected, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, our participatory research platform that measures civic space around the world.

There are worrying signs that COVID-19 emergency restrictions could be used as a smokescreen for a broader crackdown on dissent. The negative legacy of COVID-19 could last as long as the wave of dubious security measures passed in the wake of 9/11. This would undermine accountability for the 2030 Agenda.

Have any new lessons emerged that can inform plans and strategies to “build back better”?

Our vulnerabilities stand exposed by COVID-19. However, as we begin this Decade of Accountability for the SDGs (a multi-stakeholder campaign to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development), we still have an opportunity to build better forward by creating greener and fairer societies. In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.

First, civic freedoms and democratic rights are essential as our leaders are making life-or-death choices that could define the fate of generations. Concerned citizens, the media, and civil society organizations must have access to credible information and be able to exercise fundamental civic freedoms, in order to shape decisions in people’s best interests and hold decision makers to account. In a positive example in Paraguay, the government has set up a website that allows the public to track COVID-19 expenditure and engage directly with public officials.

Second, now is the time to rethink how our economies are structured. This means avoiding harsh austerity policies or market fundamentalism that prioritizes the interests of big business in recovery. To make a dent in inequality we need radical shifts such as progressive taxation and reinforcing the state’s responsibility to directly provide quality essential services. State funding for military infrastructures and repressive state apparatuses should be repurposed towards social safety nets.

We also urge better protection of worker’s rights. Towards this end CIVICUS has put in place a social security protocol to ensure job security, and to protect the mental and physical well-being of our co-workers.

Third, the needs of the most excluded people should be placed front and center. Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first. Steps must be taken to safeguard the rights of women and the health and wellbeing of older people and children, and to prevent violence against them. Economic stimulus plans should target those who are most vulnerable. For example, Spain has taken steps to introduce a basic monthly income for about a million of the country’s most impoverished households. We encourage other countries to adopt a similar policy.

It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts. CIVICUS is urging funders to exercise flexibility and listen to their partners as they navigate disruptions in programme activities and planned convenings. We also call for a greater proportion of funds to be delivered to organizations directly serving people on the ground.

Fourth, international cooperation remains vital. Multilateral institutions need to be adequately resourced and supported by governments in the spirit of multilateralism. Responses to the pandemic must strengthen and uphold the autonomy of international institutions, not only the World Health Organization but also institutions that promote human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Like pandemics, major contemporary challenges such as conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation have spillover effects beyond their borders. Strong international institutions and cooperation are needed to realize initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire.

Fifth, now is an opportune time to ramp up action on climate change. The healing of nature seen in so many places should be nurtured. New ways of working introduced during the crisis that reduce carbon footprints should continue where possible. The Paris Agreement must receive new life to ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and rises in global temperature are kept to a minimum. Recovery plans are an opportunity to invest in employment that advances the transition to a green economy.

Human rights cut across many of your proposals, for example in the need for transparency, protecting workers and the most disadvantaged, and strengthening human rights institutions. Why are human rights so relevant during COVID-19?

Countries that appear to have done better are ones that have empathetic leaders who have been inclusive in their policy responses and have involved civil society in decision making. This is all part of a human rights approach. In April this year, over 650 civil society organizations from around the world co-signed a letter calling on world leaders to respect human dignity and rights in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We can’t turn the corner towards transformation after COVID-19 without a human rights approach.

The brief on ‘Achieving the SDGs through the COVID-19 response and recovery,’ released on 22 June 2020, reports that accelerating efforts to reach the SDGs will also better position countries to recover from COVID-19.

The SDGs can serve as preventive medicine against future shocks.

Moreover, progress on several SDGs that had been achieved before the pandemic can be seen mitigating its impacts. For example, the authors say, progress on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) has enabled more people to wash their hands regularly, an important strategy for containing the COVID-19 virus. Past progress on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and community) has reduced crowding and therefore virus exposure, and improved access to basic services. Past progress on SDG 3 has lessened pre-existing health conditions that can make COVID-19 cases more severe. Finally, progress on SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 9 (which includes internet access) have helped to mitigate the overall impacts of the pandemic.

Going forward, authors Shantanu Mukherjee and Astra Bonini suggest that the SDGs can serve as “preventive medicine against future shocks” as long as countries adopt more equitable and sustainable ways forward. These could include a just transition for workers to the green economy, elimination of fuel subsidies, and introduction of carbon taxes.

The brief also asserts that the world can move towards achieving the SDGs through “thoughtful and targeted” actions, including accelerating the universal provision of quality basic services, and protecting nature from further degradation.

DESA also issued a policy brief illuminating how forests can be “at the heart of a green recovery” from COVID-19. One aspect of this recovery is the role of healthy forests in reducing the risk of future pandemics, since habitat loss is associated with zoonotic infectious diseases. Forests also remove about one third of the world’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, thus helping to mitigate climate change, which is another driver of emerging zoonotic diseases and other epidemic diseases.

The forestry sector is labor-intensive, job training requirements are low, the work requires minimal planning and procurement, and social distancing is possible when doing forestry work. The brief identifies several countries that are utilizing forestry for job creation and including it in economic stimulus packages.

Forests serve as “safety nets for the rural poor,” providing food, income and nutritional diversity for about 20% of the global population, especially women, children, landless farmers, and other vulnerable segments of society. In addition, many indigenous peoples are coping with the pandemic by retreating deeper into forests for food, fuel and shelter, and to protect themselves from the risk of COVID-19 infection. It is also noted that reliance on firewood is likely to grow during the COVID-19 crisis, as supply chains of other energy sources get disrupted.

Finally, forests are needed to ensure availability of clean water for frequent handwashing. Three quarters of the planet’s accessible freshwater comes from forested watersheds. Forests also affect rainfall patterns, filter water, reduce soil erosion, and provide most of the drinking water for over one-third of the world’s largest cities.

Author Mita Sen highlights that a path to sustainable management of forests and trees has been charted in the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2030 with its Global Forest Goals, as well as in the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. As additions to these frameworks to support COVID-19 recovery, she suggests:

Post COVID-19 recovery programmes focused on forest-dependent people, indigenous peoples and local communities;

Investment in forestry-related jobs as part of COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages;

Strengthened national forest authorities and measures to combat illegal logging and illegal trade in wildlife; and

Timely and appropriately disaggregated official statistics on the status of forests, including on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress towards sustainable forest management.

The two policy briefs are part of a larger series being produced by DESA.

DESA plans to release the 2020 edition of the annual Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report on 7 July 2020.

A shared understanding could help ensure a meaningful contribution to the SDGs and hold companies accountable for the social and environmental behavior, the authors argue.

The policy brief released on 28 May 2020 titled, ‘How can investors move from greenwashing to SDG-enabling?,’ observes that companies must help build a sustainable world, which they need in order to preserve their long-term financial performance. However, investors may lack tools to measure activity and hold companies accountable. A common definition of Sustainable Development Investment (SDI) would establish norms and minimum thresholds to qualify as aligned with sustainable development. The authors note that the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance launched in October 2019 is working on a shared understanding of sustainable investing.

The time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.

A common definition would need to be followed by strengthened reporting requirements. Regulatory frameworks would “enable a proper assessment of corporate contribution to the SDGs, but also penalize unsustainable practices and discourage short-term thinking in capital markets.”

The brief notes that the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, prepared by over 60 international agencies from the UN system and beyond, recommended the adoption of global mandatory disclosures on climate-related financial risk like those promoted by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The authors also identify three challenges to sustainability reporting by companies. First, its voluntary nature: “the time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.” Second, the quality and absence of meaningful KPIs that connect to the SDGs; only 23% of multinational companies’ sustainability reports connect the SDGs to numerical performance indicators, and “without numbers, sustainability reporting quickly becomes a public relations exercise.” Third, the variety in type of information, which makes it hard to compare different companies’ data.

Finally, the brief notes that Canada has pioneered an approach in which companies receiving financial assistance for crises like the COVID-19 pandemic must commit to stricter reporting requirements on socioeconomic issues, as well as carbon reduction targets.

The brief is part of a series aimed at helping policy makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series has also addressed the impacts of the pandemic on youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, and indigenous peoples, and how it is affecting physical activity and wellbeing; and accountability at the national level and the relationships between States and people, among other topics.

The events allowed for an exchange of information while also demonstrating progress that is underway, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The June Momentum for Climate Change was conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The events took place during the time period that the annual meetings of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies would have convened as the Bonn Climate Change Conference, but they did not involve formal negotiations.

Over eight days from 1-10 June 2020, 17 open events and six additional events requiring registration, including meetings of the constituted bodies, took place. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary from the events indicates that several focused on the work of the constituted bodies, which are the bodies that focus on implementing various aspects of the Convention and the Paris Agreement on climate change. These technical bodies provided updates on their work and future plans. Formal meetings also took place, with the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement holding its first meeting and lead reviewers of biennial reports and national communications met to share experiences. Other events discussed ongoing and emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

During an opening session on the theme, ‘UN and the UNFCCC Vision for 2020 in the Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Opportunities for Sustainable Recovery,’ Selwin Hart, Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team, reported that the UN Secretary-General’s six climate-related actions to shape the recovery range from investing in green jobs and tying bailouts to the Paris Agreement’s goals, to ending fossil fuel subsidies, accounting for climate risks, and ensuring no one is left behind as we recover better, together. President-designate of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, Alok Sharma (UK), highlighted energy, transparency, nature-based solutions, adaptation, and finance as key COP 26 themes. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa emphasized that 2020 is still a critical year for countries to fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement, including by submitting enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by the end of the year.

During a closing segment, youth non-governmental organization (YOUNGO) representatives delivered messages highlighting the need for sustainable, low-emissions climate change conferences, calling for access to food, energy, education, jobs, and medicine for the most vulnerable, and supporting grassroots communities to decentralize decision making.

SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) noted that there had been more than 12,000 views of the 17 open events over the eight-day June Momentum event, and of the 136 panelists, 48% were female. With SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), she noted that several of the activities would advance the agenda, including on Action for Climate Empowerment and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture. They also noted events that emphasized the need for sustainable recovery, including by using NDCs as frameworks.

Titled, ‘The Evidence Base on Anticipatory Action,’ the report defines anticipatory action as a humanitarian disaster risk reduction (DRR) and preparedness practice by which support is delivered to vulnerable communities ahead of a forecast severe weather event or other shock. Programmes using the practice are increasing in quantity and scope, according to the report, and 30 partners committed to significantly increasing anticipatory action coverage at the September 2019 Climate Action Summit.

The report reviews existing evidence produced by anticipatory action partners, and concludes that while impacts are mainly positive, the evidence is often fragmented, incomplete in scope, and in need of methodological improvements. The report recommends that anticipatory action programme partners increase investments in monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems and develop a common analytical framework for anticipatory action programme assessment utilizing improved evaluation models.

The report finds that primary data on anticipatory action programme results are limited. It recommends that additional resources be devoted to establishing robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning systems to ensure that evidence of programme impact be produced at a high standard and can be used to improve the future design and delivery of anticipatory action.

Implementing agencies must agree on a common analytical framework to use in administering and assessing anticipatory action, according to the report. This will ensure coherence and methodological rigor of the future evidence base, and will be necessary in order to conduct cross-country, cross-hazard, and cross project comparisons.

The publication also emphasizes the importance of designing models which accurately and more transparently estimate the value of avoided losses. It recommends that evaluation methodologies extend beyond the calculations currently utilized, which employ return on investment and cost-benefit analysis, to also capture and emphasize the public goods and collective benefits associated with anticipatory action.

The report applauds current efforts by anticipatory action partners to improve monitoring, evaluation, and learning, including work towards developing best practice manuals and guidelines on monitoring and evaluation, as well as the establishment of a group to create a common analytical framework.

Based on the episode dates alone, none of these new cases should be related to the region entering Stage 2 on Friday.

The EOHU also noted two additional resolved cases, both in Prescott-Russell. That leaves 21 unresolved cases in Prescott-Russell, four in SDG, and five in Cornwall. Another bright spot is that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Foyer St- Viateur in Limoges was declared over on Saturday— it dated back to a staff member testing positive. An outbreak was declared for a second time at the Pinecrest long-term care facility in Plantagenet on Wednesday, after an asymptomatic staff member tested positive. All residents and staff members at the facility will be tested again.","Three new COVID-19 cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, one in Prescott-RussellArticle contentSaturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

Article content The 1st Battalion of the Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders celebrate its 80th anniversary Saturday. Tim Gault’s father, Ralph Gault, was a member of the 1st Battalion of the Highlanders, a Second World War veteran. He’s been associated with the group since 1929, when he signed on with a regiment when he was 13 years old. He served as a lieutenant and ended his career as a captain after many stints overseas.

SDG Highlanders mark battalion's 80th anniversary Back to video The 1st Battalion was formed with officers and men coming from four eastern Ontario Units – Headquarters Company from The Prince of Wales Rangers (Peterborough), A Company from The Princess of Wales’ Own Regiment (Kingston), B Company from The Brockville Rifles (Brockville), and C Company, D Company, and the Band from our Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders (Cornwall). The Highlanders were received orders to form the battalion and its start dates to June 20, 1940. The Glens became part of the 3rd Division’s 9th Brigade — the Highland Brigade — with The Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Highlanders, The Highland Light Infantry, and The North Nova Scotia Highlanders

Article content Gault attended and qualified as a sergeant signal instructor at the Royal Canadian Corp of Signals in Camp Borden. “He instructed and trained the SDG Highlanders signal platoon through the 1930s,” said Gault. “He was the RSM, which stands for regimental sergeant major, of the Cornwall Collegiate Institute, a cadet core in 1932 and later as a lieutenant, organized and instructed a school of cadets.” Gault Sr. was appointed to the 2nd Battalion of the Highlanders and then volunteered for active service and attended the officer’s training school, went on to instruct at two training centres before being posted to England in 1943. “In England, he attended two battle schools, and qualified at the anti-tank school in England,” said Gault. “He then instructed in anti-tank warfare. He went from the 2nd Battalion to the 1st Battalion, being the active force in Europe.” Gault was wounded just before the liberation of Boulogne. He became an active supporter of the 1st Battalion Association, helping organizing tours, arranging for memorial plaques, and planning reunions. The association recognized him as an honourary life member. “My father was wounded, hit by shrapnel by a German motor grenade, wounded in the right side of his head, forearm and leg,” said Gault. “He was evacuated to England.” He spent four months in the hospital, next four to five months on rehabilitation and training reinforcements – anti tank – and was then appointed chief instructor later on.

The UN office in Uganda is awaiting confirmation from the president to launch a youth innovative campaign for solutions to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals were adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.



They focus more on achieving a world free of poverty and hunger, one with good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, climate action, peace, justice and strong institutions.



The United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator Rosa Malango said that through the initiative, the UN will launch an innovative campaign of 1 million SDG solutions giving the youth a chance to showcase how they can solve the country's development challenges.



//Cue in; “with Honorable Okurut…



Cue out…the parliamentary committee.”//



Malango was speaking at the handover the second Voluntary National Review Report on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Uganda to the Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga by the Minister in Charge of General Duties in the Office of the Prime Minister, Mary Karooro Okurut.



The Voluntary National Review encourages countries to conduct self-assessment to identify challenges and map strategic interventions for the progress of the goals. The Report highlights the progress made in integrating and implementing SDGs in Uganda's development planning frameworks.



Malango says the submission of the Review report is a clear signal that Uganda embraces accountability to international frameworks. Uganda ranked 18 out of 52 African countries based on 97 indicators across all SDGs. The UN Resident Coordinator said that the country has an overall score of 54.8 per cent which is higher than the regional average of 52.7 per cent.



Minister Okurut, who is Cabinet’s focal person on SDGs, called for more support in Parliament, especially in the promotion and adoption of people-centred policies and legislation to ensure that no one is left behind.



The Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga praised Malango for having adamantly pushed the Prime Minister to ensure that Cabinet appointed a specific minister to oversee the implementation and achievement of SDG Targets. She pledged to ensure that the budget process and oversight focuses on achieving the development Agenda as outlined.

Addressing climate change is a crucial part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, yet countries have made little progress on this goal. In the years ahead, countries have to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can join us in taking action on this issue here

Dozens of developing nations across the globe have achieved the targets for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action — reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in climate resilience — while developed countries remain far behind, according to a recent report by the UN.

The Sustainable Development Report 2020 notes that 43 countries in Africa have achieved the targets for SDG 13, alongside more than a dozen other countries throughout Asia and Latin America. Moldova is the only country in Europe to have achieved SDG 13.

A color-coded map in the report shows where countries stand in terms of general progress on the goal based on several academic papers from the past few years, including from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Countries that have achieved the five targets of SDG 13 are in green, while those farthest behind are in red.

This map shows progress made towards SDG 13. Countries in green have achieved the SDG. Yellow indicates that challenges remain; orange that significant challenges remain; red that major challenges remain; grey that information is unavailable.

Of the top 10 greenhouse gas emitters in the world, which account for nearly 70% of global emissions, only India is in green. China, the largest emitter in the world, has improved on climate action in recent years, but faces challenges that currently make achieving the goal by 2030 unlikely, including an overreliance on coal, a relentless construction industry, and growing energy demands.

The US, the second largest emitter, has regressed on goal 13 in recent years and is nowhere near achieving the targets. In recent years, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, scrapped plans to improve the gas mileage of cars, unraveled a plan to increase the efficiency of power plants, and has made it easier for companies to drill for fossil fuels.

Countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Vietnam, and Pakistan have all reached the targets of goal 13. In the case of Ethiopia, the government is working to reduce agricultural emissions, promote forest growth, invest in renewable energy, and implement energy efficiency throughout industries.

What this means in terms of achieving the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, isn’t discussed at length in the report. The SDGs do not include concrete emissions reductions or temperature increase targets.

As a result, critics have argued that the SDGs fail to meaningfully address climate change and that even if they’re achieved, the global environment will continue to deteriorate and emissions will remain at catastrophic levels.

The Climate Action Tracker, which assesses how the emissions reductions of countries relate to a warming climate, found that only Morocco has developed a plan compatible with the Paris climate agreement. Only two countries — India and Ethiopia — have plans compatible with staying under a 2 degrees Celsius rise.

Because leading polluters have failed to take climate change seriously, the world is far from achieving SDG 13 by 2030, and will likely blow past the Paris climate agreement goal of keeping temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Unless dramatic interventions are made, then the world could pass the 1.5 degree Celsius mark in the next four years and temperatures could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, which would usher in apocalyptic consequences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in global emissions, but analysts forecast that emissions will bounce back in the years ahead because emissions had been steadily rising in recent years, despite record levels of investment in renewable energy.

The fact that renewable energy is booming around the world, yet emissions continue to rise, shows how growth-oriented economies undermine climate action.

For emissions to decline at levels required by the Paris agreement, countries would have to overhaul their entire economies. In the aftermath of the pandemic, countries have the opportunity to embark on green economic recoveries that scale down carbon-intensive and environmentally harmful industries like fossil fuel production.

Projects such as the Great Green Wall in Africa — which seeks to regenerate landscapes across the Sahel and create community-based economic development — are a powerful model for the years ahead.

This year marks 10 years to go until the 2030 target to end extreme poverty and achieve the targets set out under the SDGs.

130,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/covid-19-what-happens-when-summer-heatwaves-strike/,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: COVID-19: What Happens When Summer Heatwaves Strike?,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak started in the middle of winter in the Northern hemisphere, it has become clear that it is to stay with us throughout and beyond the summer. The past few summers were among the hottest ever recorded, and forecasts have similar predictions for 2020: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has put out a warning that this summer will likely see temperature extremes once again. With heatwaves becoming more extreme and lasting longer, they increasingly affect human health.

For example, in Germany alone, the heatwave of 2003 resulted in nearly 7,000 deaths and many heat-related illnesses such as heat strokes, dehydration, and cardiovascular diseases. Many of these have to be treated in hospitals and will therefore put an additional strain on the capacities of the healthcare system.

Heatwaves are particularly problematic for urban citizens because densely built-up urban areas are especially prone to the so-called “heat island effect.” This effect occurs because when buildings are close together, they heat up one another. This is why urban areas are often up to 3°C warmer than their rural surroundings. Additionally, temperatures hardly drop overnight anymore due to a lack of ventilation and thermal absorption of houses and surfaces. This leads to “tropical” nights when temperatures do not drop below 20°C, adding to the residents’ health stress.

When heatwaves strike, people in cities tend to flock to green open spaces like parks or to bodies of water because these have a cooling effect. However, this behavior leads to exactly the kind of overcrowding which is not compatible with physical distancing. In the past, many European cities took innovative precaution measures to allow people to cool down. They extended the opening hours of public pools or air-conditioned public spaces like town halls or shopping centers, for example. However this year, we will be facing a complete closure of these facilities or at least restricted hours of operation.

If the predictions are true and this summer proves to be extraordinarily hot, more people than ever before will be working from heated-up homes (most European countries do not have air conditioning in private residences) instead of air-conditioned office buildings. Their options to take weekend trips to the countryside will also be more limited than usual. Even taking a longer summer vacation to flee hot cities for a couple of weeks will be more difficult to realize.

Yet, if urban citizens are left without options to cool down, it will put an additional burden on healthcare systems as people suffer from heat-related symptoms. The heat will also take a toll on their mental health when, in addition to contact bans and restrictions, they have to deal with the discomfort caused by heat that they can hardly escape.

It is crucial to develop concrete ideas for how the urban population can safely navigate the summer.

Those cities that have already invested in large-scale green or blue infrastructure such as green open spaces and ponds will have an advantage. Such multifunctional spaces are not only cooler during heatwaves, but they also protect from natural hazard impacts like heavy rainfalls or flooding, which makes them a worthwhile investment beyond the pandemic. If they are designed in a grid with pocket parks and community gardens, the risk of overcrowded green areas and temporary closures decreases. We need to work out how to best utilize these existing spaces so that a large number of people can cool down safely.

While it may not be possible to build a park in time for a heatwave, it is not too late to create multifunctional spaces with mobile shading elements and some vegetation in crowded neighborhoods. Parking areas or empty lots, for example, have great potential for quick and highly effective conversion. Schoolyards could also be opened up for the public. In addition, we need space for cyclists and pedestrians where they can safely move around with enough distance between them. Many cities are addressing these challenges. Brussels, for example, has just introduced a new traffic concept for its inner city, and Munich has introduced pop-up trails.

There are also measures that individuals can take, which can be encouraged. Green roofs and walls contribute to cooling homes, for example. Now is the time to think about greening houses or retrofitting them, for instance by adding sunshades or vegetation to provide shade. Another measure is to enhance thermal insulation and ventilation systems of residential buildings.

Which measures work best where has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. People’s living arrangements are different and so are their challenges, which calls for different solutions. Those of us who live in small apartments without balconies or gardens and whose apartments heat up quickly will be more challenged than those living in large homes with big outdoor spaces. These kinds of social dimensions have to be taken into account.

At the same time, we have to keep in mind that while this pandemic is hopefully a temporary challenge, another more long-term pressing challenge, climate change, must not be neglected in our efforts. While houses and apartments can be cooled down with air conditioning units, experts consider them a form of “maladaptation.” Firstly, air conditioning units use a large amount of energy, which is harmful to the environment, and secondly, they give off heat to the surrounding area, which then gets even hotter.

The long-term goal for livable cities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) must be green-blue infrastructure, which not only benefits climate change adaptation and mitigation (SDG 13) but also gives us space for leisure and recreation, and ultimately contributes to human health and well-being (SDG 3). At the same time, it can contribute to multiple goals of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) as well as targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), including “build back better” as the guiding principle in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (Priority Area 4).

Finally, there are also some promising societal developments that we have seen with COVID-19. Over the past weeks, numerous community initiatives to support the elderly and other vulnerable groups have been initiated in many cities, including activities that bring together previously often unknown neighbors. Younger neighbors go shopping for older neighbors so that they do not expose themselves to the increased risks of contracting COVID-19, for example. Also in other crises, some societal groups tend to be more vulnerable than others. Less vulnerable groups supporting more vulnerable ones is a mechanism that has been proven highly successful in times of crisis, including during heatwaves, making it possible to spare the elderly from having to go to the supermarket on particularly hot days.

It is certain that COVID-19 will profoundly change how we experience summer, but it is not too late to prepare so that we can still enjoy the warmer temperatures.

Although all countries agreed to work towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, no country is on track. Recent assessments paint a bleak outlook: inequality is widening, hunger is on the rise, biodiversity is eroding at an alarming rate, climate change threatens all SDGs, and a pandemic is rampaging the world.

To accelerate impacts, the United Nations declared the 2020-2030 period a “Decade of Action”. All stakeholders are called on to contribute to the SDGs, but the private sector in particular was identified as being able to make a difference between complacency and action. The economic activities they undertake can advance, but also be detrimental to, the SDGs.

Defining interactions between economic activities and SDG targets

In societies, companies undertake numerous, highly heterogeneous types of economic activities. These activities sustain livelihoods and produce goods and services that help people attain a better life, but they also create negative externalities. Different types of economic activities thereby impact different SDGs. From the start of the SDG effort, the importance of ‘interaction-’, ‘linkages- or ‘nexus’-’ effects have been deemed vital for progress. Many research and knowledge-exchange efforts have been initiated: the Nexus community, SDG Interaction Knowledge Platform, LinkedSDG platform and the SDG Synergies approach. Most of these initiatives – as well as the related studies – concentrate on macro-economic or sector specific analyses. There is insufficient focus as well as evidence on how individual economic activities – as a proxy for corporate strategies – interact with the SDGs. This lack of evidence complicates the efforts of companies, governments, and investors to create smart SDG strategies that steer towards net positive impacts.

We have undertaken research to fill this gap. This research systematically reviews 876 articles, published between 2005 and 2019 and covering 420 economic activities (defined by the ISIC Rev. 4 classification), to synthesize the literature on the interface between individual economic activities and sustainable development impacts.

Moving forward

The research results identify the positive and negative interactions between individual and detailed economic activities and the topics defined by the SDGs’ underlying targets, as reported in the literature. At an overarching level, the findings reveal that economic activities bring ample opportunities for advancing SDGs. Most are sources of economic productivity (SDG 8) and drive industrialization (SDG 9) while many create and/or distribute goods and services that help people meet their basic needs (SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11). However, negative impacts are widespread, most prominently afflicting ecosystems (SDGs 14 and 15), driving climate change (SDG 13) and harming human health (SDG 3).

Yet these interactions vary widely across individual economic activities. Agriculture activities, for instance, feed the world, thereby having clear potential to help achieve SDG 2 (zero hunger). However, they also account for some 70% of water withdrawals globally which raises concerns for SDG 6 (water and sanitation), and the use of fertilizers and pesticides threatens SDGs 14 and 15 (life on land and below water).

As another example, electricity generation promotes SDG 9 (industrialization). But if electricity is generated through non-renewable sources, SDG 13 (climate action) is at risk, while SDG 3 (health and well-being) may be harmed due to air pollution. Estimates suggest that in China 15 million and in India 11 million years of life lost can be avoided by eliminating power generation emissions.

These findings can inform the creation of improved SDG strategies. Scientists and policy makers increasingly recognize that progress on the SDGs can be accelerated through a “nexus approach”. Recognizing that progress on one SDG can promote, but also be detrimental to, progress on another SDG, a nexus approach aims to manage the interactions between SDGs in order to advance multiple SDGs simultaneously and reduce the risk of trade-offs.

For example, eradicating hunger (SDG 2) improves health and well-being (SDG 3) and can help people escape poverty (SDG 1). Targeting these SDGs together, instead of treating them as isolated silos, brings opportunities for bigger impacts

The economic activities undertaken by organizations present a key lever for operationalizing this SDG-nexus. Economic activities drive positive and negative impacts on the SDGs, which are themselves entwined. Hence, there is an imperative to adopt a nexus approach to economic activities’ impacts on sustainable development, in order to promote the co-benefits of economic activities on SDGs and mitigate their trade-offs. The nexus approach not only deserves attention as part of policy agendas, but increasingly as an integral part of corporate strategies, for instance in the management of well-designed partnership portfolios.

The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

AstraZeneca, Deloitte and BP are among a cohort big-name businesses to have jointly unveiled £500,000 of grant funding for young innovators working on projects driving progress towards the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Coordinated through the One Young World platform, the funding will be complemented with mentorship sessions between the businesses and the entrepreneurs. It is hoped that, for every £1 invested through the scheme, £15 of social value will be delivered.

In order to receive funding, each project had to prove how it is driving progress towards one of the Global Goals, across the entire scope of its aims and targets. The initiative was open globally and has named winners from Asia, Africa, Canada, Central America and Latin America, as below:

The SDG 2: Zero Hunger prize was awarded to Canada-based Tailored, a startup producing plant-based, culturally relevant food products at price points accessible to families facing poverty. Reckitt Benckiser, the parent firm of brands including Air Wick, Nurofen and Lysoll, is supporting this category.

The SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing prize went to Colombia-based BIVE. BIVE’s BR13 initiative provides best-practice advice and leadership tools centred on issues such as non-communicable diseases, mental health and sexual health in a digital format. It is specifically tailored for young people living in rural areas without rapid access to quality, affordable healthcare. AstraZeneca is supporting this category and will also allocate funding to Create Purpose, a Mexican organisation promoting non-communicable disease prevention for orphans and other vulnerable children.

The SDG 4: Quality Education category winner is CAYSTI, a Cameroonian initiative boosting access to STEM and arts education in rural locations using tech-based solutions. Deloitte is the category sponsor.

The SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation prize was awarded to Ekogroup H2O+. This Colombian project is driving behaviour change around rainwater harvesting in the country’s urban areas and will receive support from Reckitt Benckiser.

The SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy funding has been awarded to Climatenza, an initiative accelerating the deployment of solar thermal technology across India’s business sphere. This category is sponsored by BP, which recently invested $200m in solar developer Lightsource.

The SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure category winner is Nepal-based fintech social enterprise Aeloi. Aeoli specialises in tracing climate impact finance and will receive support from Standard Chartered Bank.

The SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities prize went to Blend Edu, a startup working to promote diversity and inclusivity in Brazilian businesses through educational experience. The category sponsor here is Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).

The SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production winner, backed by Mondi Group,is Canadian biotech firm Genecis. Genecis takes low-value organic waste streams and turns them into materials which can be used to replace single-use plastics.

The SDG 13: Climate Action category was specifically open to entrants from the sustainable agriculture space, given that agriculture is a key driver of both emission and nature loss. The winner is Xillinat, a Mexican natural substitute for sugar and sweeteners which requires less land, water and pesticides to produce and is suitable for diabetics. Asahi will support Xillinat.

The SDG 14: Life Below Water funding is being provided by Credit Suisse to repurpose, an Indian social enterprise helping businesses achieve plastic neutrality. Credit Suisse is notably The World Bank’s partner on its sustainable water bond, and, in 2019, aligned its strategy with the SDGs.

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”. Previous backers of the initiative, which is called Lead2030 and has been running since 2018, include KPMG and Porter Novelli.

The announcement of this year’s prize winners comes shortly after UN Global Compact published the results of a survey conducted among representatives from the sustainability teams or C-suite of 615 businesses. Of the respondents, less than one-third said their sector is moving rapidly enough to deliver adequate progress against the SDGs which it should be framing as a priority and just 39% believe that the SDG-related targets set by their own business are ambitious enough.

UNGC argued that while many businesses may feel that social and economic fallout of the Covid-19 crisis will hamper their sustainable development progress, they must ultimately seize the moment to increase their ambition, given that the pandemic has highlighted social and environmental issues and could ultimately exacerbate them.

134,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/new-metrics/your-sdg-strategy-must-consider-more-than-your-financials,"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Your SDG Strategy Must Consider More Than Your Financials,"The Sustainable Development Goals serve as an urgent call to action for companies to pay as much attention to their extra-financial performance as to their financial performance.

In a previous article, we discussed how a defensive response to the SDGs achieves nothing; and a selective response risks causing negative trade-offs, which undermine any gains. Instead, a holistic response is required: Any company seeking to contribute positively to one or more SDGs must also strive to eliminate any negative contributions elsewhere, due to activities across its value web.

This begs the question: What do ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ really mean in this context? When it comes to financial performance, the answer is clear. A company may make a profit, or it may make a loss — and the transition between the two is called the financial break-even point. When a company breaks even, it is doing just enough to sustain its own existence. But what is the equivalent when it comes to the other two dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line?

The extra-financial break-even point for business

Understanding one’s impacts on people and planet in a holistic way demands a clear definition of the extra-financial break-even point for business. Any company reaching this point would be doing just enough to sustain the socioeconomic and natural systems upon which it — and humanity as a whole — depends. Going beyond this point would be the extra-financial equivalent of making a profit — for example, by increasing people’s wellbeing, reducing inequality or regenerating ecosystems.

The need for a well-defined extra-financial break-even point — and for a way to steer progress toward and beyond it — is what led us to create the Future-Fit Business Benchmark.

The Benchmark identifies 23 Break-Even Goals, which cover all critical business areas — from worker wellbeing and water use through to procurement practices and product performance. Together, these goals describe what every company must do to eliminate its own negative impacts — and to exert whatever influence it has (e.g. through its purchasing power) to reduce the negative impacts of others whose activities it depends upon.

The figure below considers extra-financial impacts across two dimensions — positive vs negative, and direct vs indirect. The Break-Even Goals sit within the bottom-left quadrant.

When a company makes any progress toward the Break-Even Goals, it is reducing its risk of inadvertently slowing down our collective progress toward an environmentally restorative, socially just and economically inclusive future.

But that’s only part of the puzzle. Long before it reaches all Break-Even Goals — which may take many years — a company may act to create positive impacts itself, or to improve the impacts of others. The Future-Fit Business Benchmark captures any such activity through 24 Positive Pursuits, which describe systemic outcomes which actually speed up our collective progress. These sit within the other three quadrants of the above figure.

Between them, the Future-Fit Break-Even Goals and Positive Pursuits characterize all of the ways a business can contribute — positively and negatively — to the SDGs.

An example of taking a holistic view: Climate action

Let’s look at a holistic response to SDG 13: Climate Action. Every company must strive to eliminate all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its operations; and to ensure that its products and services do not force its customers to emit GHGs, either. Such actions count as progress toward the Break-Even Goals.

But what if a company were also to actively help others (such as its suppliers or customers) to eliminate their own GHG emissions? Or what if it could find ways to physically drawdown GHGs from the atmosphere — in its operations or through its products — or support the efforts of others who have found ways to do so? Any such outcomes would be recognised via the Positive Pursuits.

This example serves to illustrate how the Future-Fit Business Benchmark frames extra-financial impacts in a holistic way — placing as much emphasis on surfacing new opportunities as on reducing existing risks. It can help your company formulate an SDG response which is as ambitious as it is authentic.

The Future-Fit Business Benchmark is a free-to-use public good that has been evolving since 2014 with in‑depth input from global companies, institutional investors and academic experts.

The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.

The SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), also published its third series of policy briefs on SDG 7 and its interlinkages with other SDGs in support of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

‘Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report,’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), monitors and assesses the world’s progress towards global targets for universal access to sustainable, affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It also identifies best practices, policies, measures, and scenarios to accelerate further progress and simultaneously pursue other SDGs.

On universal access (SDG target 7.1: “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services,” including access to electricity (indicator 7.1.1) and access to clean cooking solutions (indicator 7.1.2)), the report finds that over 1 billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, increasing the connected proportion of the population from 83% to 90%. However, 789 million people still do not have access to electricity, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 70% of this deficit. The report estimates that by 2030, 620 million people will lack electricity access, 85% of them in Africa. The report recommends that governments respond to the COVD-19 crisis by working with donors and investors to ensure that off-grid developers, utilities, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain active and that governments adopt a suite of safeguards to protect energy consumers.

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report. While the global proportion of the population with access increased by 200 million between 2010 and 2018, 2.7 billion people remained without access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of those without access increased from 750 million to 890 million. The report concludes that 2.3 billion people, 30% of the world’s population, will continue to lack clean cooking fuels by 2030. It recommends that governments utilize more comprehensive household surveys to support more effective evidence-based policy and investment decisions.

On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption. This increase was driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy in the power sector. The report finds that while adoption of renewable energy in the heating and transport sector lags behind its potential, it will be required to achieve SDG 7.2 by 2030.

On energy efficiency (SDG target 7.3: “By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”), the report states that in recent years, the rates of improvement in global primary energy intensity have fallen to 1.7%, although the average rate of improvement between 2010-2017 was 2.2%. To achieve the SDG 7.3 energy efficiency target of doubling the historic improvement rate, annual improvement will need to increase to an average of 3% per year between 2017-2030. The report recommends that countries make energy efficiency a policy and investment priority through minimum energy efficiency standards, market-based mechanisms, financial incentives, and other means.

On international public finance (SDG target 7.a: “By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology,” with indicator 7.a.1 focusing on international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy), the report finds that while total international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy doubled to USD 21.4 billion in 2017 over 2010 flows, only 12% reached least developed countries (LDCs), which are the furthest from achieving SDG 7 targets.

136,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/mangroves-a-unique-ally-in-the-climate-emergency/,"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Mangroves: A Unique Ally in the Climate Emergency,"Nearly 20 years have passed since the first time I stepped into a mangrove forest, yet the memory is still among my fondest memories. I was already captivated by mangrove ecology through my studies; but it was only when my boots first disappeared under the mud that I was truly hooked. I arrived at Ko Phra Thong in Thailand to take part in a survey of the mangroves on the island and I was so keen to get started that I didn’t even stop to change from shorts to long trousers, or to slap on some mosquito repellent. Well, they had a feast on my legs, leaving some very physical, itchy reminders of the experience, to add to the romantic charm of the soft green dappled light and salty breeze.

Mangrove forests are unique ecosystems, straddling the boundary between ocean and land. Their significant roles in securing a habitat for a wide range of unique species of fish, insects, mollusks and plants, and in providing direct and indirect livelihood benefits for coastal communities are all well studied. The COVID-19 outbreak and the related impacts on countries and communities put increasing visibility and recognition of the importance of the availability and sustainability of such food security and livelihoods benefits.

More recently, attention has turned to the importance of mangroves as sinks of greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide and methane – and hence their critical role in mitigating climate change. Moreover, intact and healthy mangroves act as a natural buffer, contributing to the reduction of impact forces and depth and velocity of natural hazards, thus contributing to coastal communities’ ability to adapt as the frequency and severity of such events increases as a result of climate change.

The prominence of mangroves in international dialogues and national efforts on ‘nature-based solutions’ is therefore becoming more evident, as we set out to harness the unique qualities of mangroves towards both the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.

Foremost among these efforts is the inclusion of mangroves in national REDD+ strategies, through which developing countries aim to incorporate the forest sector into their policies and approaches to tackling climate change, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Preparation of national REDD+ strategies involves the identification of specific policies and actions to address, and where possible to reverse, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and to increase forest cover. In so doing, several countries, including Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Myanmar, recognized the value of mangroves-based mitigation actions. Furthermore, at least 45 countries around the world specifically mentioned mangroves in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards fulfilling the global goals of the Paris Agreement.

When countries introduce practical, cost-effective and achievable policies and actions for the management and protection of forests, while providing sustainable development opportunities for local forest communities, the rate of forest loss can be reduced, as well as the net emissions of greenhouse gases from forest areas.

Countries that achieve emission reductions from deforestation and fulfill UNFCCC REDD+ Warsaw framework are eligible for results-based payments, for example through the Green Climate Fund RBP pilot programme, bilateral agreements with donors, or other mechanisms. In this regard, reduction of mangroves deforestation, as a high carbon-rich ecosystem, can be a strategic ally to achieve results of magnitude.

FAO, also through and with the flagship UN-REDD Programme (a collaborative effort between FAO, UNDP and UNEP), is working with countries to integrate mangroves into their REDD+ strategies and implement specific actions. Entry points include changes to practices in communities involved in shrimp farming or charcoal production, and support to governments in defining comprehensive packages of policies and measures for mangrove ecosystems and the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods. While planning their REDD+ activities, countries may want to carry out assessments and develop studies on the impacts and benefits of mangroves on the wider landscape and rural economy, so that the results could be presented to relevant line ministries, development partners and initiatives. They may also request support in developing specific emission factors and allometric equations for mangroves, and share these with other countries. This will allow for much more accurate estimations of the potential and actual contribution of mangrove-based actions, policies and measures to REDD+ strategy objectives.

Despite all the recognition mentioned so far, mangroves continue to be subject to pressures such as expansion of commercial agriculture and aquaculture. Their depletion is a cause of serious environmental and economic concern to many developing countries.

During the week of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, it is key to remember the importance of protecting, sustainably managing and restoring this key ecosystem, and the opportunities this represent for countries and local communities, as a key ally for food security, sustainable livelihood, and in the fight against climate change.

Keeping the world’s mangroves healthy will require a combination of integrated coastal management, inter-sectoral coordinated rural development policy, and the sharing of technical expertise and effective practices within and between countries. These efforts will be in vain unless they are combined with approaches to improve the livelihoods and capacities of the people whose actions most directly affect mangroves, such as rural farming and fishing communities.

The inclusion of mangroves management, conservation and restoration in REDD+ strategies and in NDCs represent opportunities to boost moving towards healthy and sustainable ecosystems. In addition, the upcoming UN Decade on ecosystem restoration represents another important vector for actions on the ground. Countries demonstrated interest in mangrove restoration, with approximate thirty countries mentioning mangroves in their restoration pledges as part of the Bonn Challenge.

The silence procedure was used to finalize the declaration.

On 7 July 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated a letter informing that consensus on the text of the declaration had been reached.

Following consultations on a draft that Co-facilitators Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden, shared on 5 June 2020, further revisions were introduced. The Co-facilitators shared the revised draft on 17 June.

Among other changes, in the preambular section, instead of “Through its Charter, which is the cornerstone of international law, [the UN] has determined that all nations – whether large or small – should be treated with sovereign equality and with respect to their territorial integrity, political independence, and the right to self-determination of peoples,” the text was revised to read “The Charter of the United Nations, which is the cornerstone of international law, has declared the principle of sovereign equality of all States, and the right to self-determination of peoples.” The paragraph was also amended to include an additional sentence: “[The UN] has determined that all States shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

Under the commitment to promote peace and prevent conflicts, instead of “Rules governing the use of force must be respected,” the text was revised to read “We reiterate the importance of abiding by the Charter, principles of international law, and relevant resolutions of the Security Council.” Instead of “Terrorism is among the most critical threats to international peace and security,” the commitment was revised to read “Terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism are serious threats to international peace and security.”

The commitment to upgrade the UN was revised to include an additional sentence: “We reiterate our call for reforms of three of the principle organs of the United Nations.”

In the concluding section, instead of “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common good of present and future generations,” the text was amended to read “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common good of present and future generations and to realize our shared vision for a common future.” After silence was broken on this sentence, Muhammad-Bande proposed to substitute the sentence with “We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common future of present and coming generations.”

On the commitment to protect our planet, “one Member State” expressed concern about the sentence “We need to immediately curb greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns in line with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda.” Following consultations, Muhammad-Bande proposed language incorporating “complementary factual information”: “We need to immediately curb greenhouse gas emissions and achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns in line with applicable State commitments to the Paris Agreement and in line with the 2030 Agenda.” Following this revision, the silence procedure concluded without objections.

In a statement, the UN Association – UK (UNA-UK) expressed concern about the new language referencing applicable State commitments under the Paris Agreement, warning that a focus on the State commitments element “gives the dangerous and erroneous impression that the Paris Agreement can be reduced to the self-defined commitments” of Member States.

Muhammad-Bande will transmit the final draft to the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – to prepare the text for adoption at the high-level meeting of the Assembly to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020.","UN Member States have arrived at consensus on the text of the declaration for the commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary (UN75).

The virtual launch of the Framework was co-chaired by Gilbert F. Houngbo, Chair of UN-Water and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. Over 600 participants logged into the launch event, which featured statements from the heads of UN agencies and stakeholders, and a closing statement from António Guterres, UN Secretary-General.

The Framework will seek to support accelerated country progress in five key areas of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): financing; data and information; capacity development; innovation; and governance. Speakers emphasized the value of UN efforts to deliver as one at the country level and interlinkages between action on SDG 6 and other SDGs.

Houngbo highlighted that the framework introduces an annual moment for stocktaking and sharing of best practices. He also called attention to the importance of World Water Day in 2023, when the midterm review of the implementation of the International Decade for Action “Water for Life” will take place. Several speakers noted that this event will be the first UN high-level conference on water since the 1970s.

Among the elements and objectives of the Framework that speakers highlighted were the following:

Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly, commended the Framework’s focus on strengthening multistakeholder participation;

Achim Steiner, Administrator, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted the value of linking to governance frameworks (SDG 16);

Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), stressed the importance of a multilateral approach, given that much of the world’s freshwater flows across international boundaries;

Qu Dongyu, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), stressed the need to address water scarcity;

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized that water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are essential for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic;

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), stressed the need for addressing WASH needs of slum dwellers and for ensuring that data can inform decision making and investment decisions;

Olga Algayerova, Executive Secretary, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), noted that the Water Convention provides a unique legal platform for addressing shared waters;

Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), discussed the links between efforts to address climate change adaptation and water related services and science; and

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), stressed the need to understand the hydrological cycle, the value of ecosystems, and how much water is embodied in our consumption patterns.

In his closing statement, Secretary-General Guterres stressed that the water and sanitation crisis demands a holistic approach, noted that it cuts across all of the pillars of UN, and said he was pleased to see the focus on action at the country level.

The launch took place on 9 July 2020, during a special event on the sidelines of the 2020 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). In addition to the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, the SDG 6 Action Space will provide a platform for national governments and other actors to record their initiatives to accelerate SDG implementation.

SDG target 17.11 is one of 21 targets with a “2020” deadline (Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ (LDCs) share of global exports by 2020). Likewise, SDG target 14.6 calls for, by 2020, prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, while those subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing are to be eliminated entirely. After nearly 20 years, World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations were closing in on concluding talks on this issue. The WTO Ministerial Conference was set to convene in June 2020, with many eyeing the event as an opportunity to address these and other pressing trade issues, some of which have languished for years.

Instead, the year 2020 will be recalled for very different reasons for the global trade regime. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, including international trade flows. News about trade policy during the last few months has, in many ways, provided a barometer on the unfolding, multi-pronged crisis. As borders closed to stem the human-to-human spread of the virus, implications for trade in essential medical supplies were quickly singled out as priorities for exceptions. The need for continued trade in essential supplies also brought the inequalities that the pandemic exposed into focus. Moreover, the need for collective action to ensure intellectual property rules (IPRs) do not create a hindrance to the crisis response has also been raised in the context of the World Health Organization, where the final COVID-19 resolution includes language referring to the use of previously agreed flexibilities in the WTO’s IPR rules. The growing number of export restrictions on agricultural goods has raised concerns over whether a repeat of past food price crises and a rise in global hunger levels and food insecurity may be on the horizon.

While there were acknowledgements that the extraordinary circumstances justified breaching global agreements or taking advantage of their existing flexibilities, there have also been calls to ensure that multilateral approaches resume as soon as possible, along with reminders that multilateralism will be essential to efforts to build back better.

Furthermore, leadership changes have added to the uncertainties that the pandemic has wrought, while also focusing attention on what is needed to emerge stronger from the pandemic. The May 2020 announcement by World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo of his surprise decision to step down launched a “politically charged” selection process for the next Director-General, despite having a full year remaining in his second term. His successor’s task will be to help the multilateral trading system respond to new economic realities caused by COVID-19.

COVID-19 Puts Development Gains at Risk

As projections of the extent of the damage caused by the global pandemic are revised downward, there are growing concerns about sustainable recovery and resilience of the global economic system to future crises.

Already back in April, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a new debt crisis, and recommended actions to build back better for sustainable development, including the elimination of trade barriers and restrictions that affect supply chains. In a Communiqué following its virtual meeting on 17 April, the World Bank Development Committee recognized the pandemic’s “exceptional negative shock” on the global economy and disruptions to trade, supply chains, and investment flows, warning about its potential to “erase development gains for many countries.”

The same month, the WTO forecast that world trade would fall by 13% to 32% in 2020, due to the disruptions to economic activity caused by the pandemic. A May 2020 report by the Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) found that COVID-19 had cut global trade values by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, projecting the decline to accelerate, with an expected 27% quarter-on-quarter decline.

The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2020 found that the coronavirus pandemic had caused a “steep drop” in investment flows, hitting developing countries the hardest. During an informal briefing among UN system leaders to discuss building on the UN’s operational framework for social and economic responses to the pandemic, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Mona Juul cited “incomprehensible setbacks to our hard-won development goals” due to COVID-19.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report warned that LDCs, land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, insufficient social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade. Among trade-related impacts in LDCs, a WTO information note highlighted a “significant decline in export earnings” among these countries since the outbreak of COVID-19, which may affect their graduation prospects.

Overcoming the Pandemic

As the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has suggested, the pace of post-COVID-19 recovery will depend on the length of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of policy responses. Over the past months, world leaders, UN agencies, and relevant stakeholders have engaged on various levels to address the crisis and chart the path towards global recovery.

Some of the actions, many of which were spearheaded by the WTO or groups of WTO Members, included:

The Ottawa Group, comprised of 13 WTO Members and devoted to developing options for reforming the organization, outlined six action areasto focus on in light of COVID-19: transparency and withdrawal of trade-restrictive measures; keeping open and predictable trade in agricultural and agrifood products; e-commerce; trade facilitation through the use of information technology and streamlined procedures; an initiative on medical supplies; and deepening engagement with stakeholders.

During the 1 July meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Services, many WTO Members highlighted the importance of sharing experiences, including on trade facilitating measures adopted to address the crisis and promote economic recovery.

The WTO and six multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint statementhighlighting measures taken to step up trade finance programmes to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The WTO’s ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020’ report featured market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies as the “special topic.”

The WTO’s 23rd biannual monitoring reporton trade measures, covering the period from mid-October 2019 to mid-May 2020, found that Group of 20 (G20) economies implemented 154 new trade or trade-related measures over the time period, of which 60% were linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several G20 ministerialsconvened in April, many of which were special meetings devoted to the pandemic. Ministers highlighted efforts to promote international trade cooperation while minimizing impacts of COVID-19 though “a coordinated global response.”

A UNCTAD reportoutlined ways to facilitate trade in areas related to process optimization, cost reduction, transparency and cooperation enhancement, and full use of technology to ensure cross-border trade continues while reducing face-to-face interaction.

Another UNCTAD reportdiscussed how South-South cooperation can help build solidarity to weather the interconnected economic and public health crises.

UNCTAD and the five UN regional commissions launched a projectto help governments and businesses keep transport networks and borders operational and facilitate the flow of goods and services, while minimizing the spread of COVID-19.

The International Trade Centre (ITC) released a 15-point action planto support micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Representatives from the UN and its Member States considered actionsto mitigate the potential socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on food availability and supply, and to attain food security.

A webinarconvened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s (IISD) Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) addressed trade and climate change in the context of COVID-19, showcasing examples of national responses and policies being implemented.

A webinar convened by IISD addressed the interlinkages between trade, public health, and intellectual property rights, especially given the COVID-19 resolution negotiated and adopted for the 73rd World Health Assembly.

Engagement with China included an EU-China summit on 22 June where European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, drew attention to “an unbalanced trade and investment relationship” between China and the EU.

Selection Process for Next WTO Director-General

Amid efforts to bring about the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he will step down on 31 August 2020, cutting his second term short by one year. The selection process for the next Director-General normally spans six months, but following a 10 July announcement by WTO General Council Chair David Walker (New Zealand), the process has been shortened, with the third and final phase now scheduled to begin on 7 September.

Eight WTO Members (Egypt, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Moldova, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and the UK) submitted nominations for the post of WTO Director-General to succeed Azevêdo. Following the closure of the nomination period on 8 July, candidates are meeting with WTO members at a special General Council meeting from 15-17 July to present their views and take questions from the membership. They will then have the remainder of July and all of August to continue making their case for the role.

This country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

States presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations in a two week-long conference which included a high-level political forum on sustainable development and a three-day ministerial meeting held under the UN Economic and Social Council. The theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Beckles in her presentation of TTs first VNRs noted that it was centred around eight of the 17 SDGs and they were incorporated into TT’s national development strategy and vision 2030. The eight SDGs are good health care (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).

She explained that TT’s plan focused on putting people first by nurturing asset; delivering good governance and service excellence; improving productivity through quality infrastructure and transportation; building globally competitive businesses and placing the environment at the centre of social and economic development.

Beckles said, “Our commitment to “Leaving No-One Behind” has been anchored in the strengthening of the country's public policy framework through vision 2030 and the implementation of several policy initiatives directly related to SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5 and SDG 10.”

She noted that while TT and the world suffered tremendous losses due to covid19, this country minimised economic contraction through adjustments, reforms, and private sector support.

“Government has taken a multi-dimensional approach, with the introduction of a number of financial and economic measures to minimise contraction of the economy and maintain economic activity.

“This was in conjunction with the creation of a 'Road to Recovery' committee which comprised representatives from government, private sector, civil society, labour and academia, which was established to develop a plan for the reopening of society and the road to economic recovery for the post-pandemic period,” Beckles said.

She highlighted the progress within the health system through improved statistics in mortality rates with the Perinatal Information System which improves evidenced-based clinical decision-making for mothers and their new-born babies.

Beckles noted that, “The system contributed to the annual decline in the maternal mortality rate between 2015, from 42.9 per 100,000 live births to 12.3 per 100,000 live births, in 2018.

“Our nation's health sector also recorded a decline in the under-five mortality rates from 13.9 per 1,000 live births in 2016 to 11.3 per 1,000 live births in 2018.”

Beckles further noted TT’s moves to provide education for all with the increase of in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centers (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) through the increased participation of women in politics and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).

“The increase of the national minimum wage from $15 per hour, to $17.50 per hour, was in part aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable. These measures are further supported by a robust legal and policy framework which includes child protection and Gender -Based Violence units in our police service, she said.

Climate change, a big concern for small island developing states (SIDS) was of key importance to TT, Beckles pointed out and its contribution has been continued reduction in overall cumulative emissions from the electricity generation, industry, and transportation sectors.

Beckles added that TT continued to strive for strong institutions with the collaboration of government, law enforcement, academia, and civil societies among others for its effectiveness, but there remained challenges.

She said, “Undoubtedly, TT has made commendable strides. We are more cognisant of the challenges that could hinder our realisation of the 2030 Agenda. Climate change, citizen insecurity, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and the uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic can all undermine our development ambitions.”","Beckles present TT’s SDG goals progress to UNFile photo: Pennelope BecklesThis country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

The government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Prime Minister James Marape’s speech to the UN High-level political forum was delivered by National Planning Minister Sam Basil. It showcased the achievements and challenges of PNG. The conference was conducted at the APEC Haus early this morning via the United Nation’s website.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals range from Good Health and Well Being to Eliminating Poverty, Hunger and Climate Action.

Being a member of the United Nations, PNG adopted “Agenda 2030’ in the 70th session of the General Assembly in 2015.

This means PNG has agreed to measure its performances on development against the global benchmarks using indicators of the 17 SDGs.

In the first five SDGs, where it focuses on Ending Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well Being, Quality Education and Gender Equality, Prime Minister Marape says the population living below the extreme poverty line as per the last national survey has improved from 53 percent of the total population in 1996 to 39 percent in 2010.

The Prime Minister has noted improvement in health statistics that shows an increase in life expectancy rates but made mention that more focus needs to be given to health issues like TB and Malaria.

The other 12 SDGs include decent work and economic growth to responsible consumption and production.

In these different goals, the Prime Minister noted that the local economy has grown from an average of 6 percent between 2010 and 2014, highlighting a peak in 2013 at 13 percent before declining in 2015 to a 9.5 percent.","Share the NewsThe government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

That breaks down, currently, to four active cases in Prescott-Russell, six in SDG, and one in Cornwall— a decrease in the latter as the health unit marked an additional case as resolved on Friday.

Further information on the case was not available in Friday’s data within the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS).

However other iPHIS data showed only eight unresolved cases within the region; given the provincial criteria for setting a case as resolved is different than what the local health unit uses. The unresolved cases in iPHIS include:

A man in his 60s, whose episode date goes back to March 2, and remains hospitalized in Ottawa;

A woman in her 60s, dating back to March 28, also hospitalized in Ottawa;

A man in his 30s, dating back to July 11;

A woman in her 40s, dating back to July 14;

A woman in her 60s, dating back to July 15;

A man in his 60s, dating back to July 14;

In McIntosh’s case, he is pursuing criminology at Carleton University in the fall. He would like to defend people in court who allege they’ve been wrongly accused. He’s attended, court sessions which also sparked his interest.

“My mom worked for lawyers, ever since I was a kid,” said McIntosh. “I’ve always been around it and it was something I’ve wanted to do ever since I was young.

“I chose Carleton because the program is best suited for what I want to do when I graduated.”

He looks forward to start studying for a career in law, with an aspiration to become an attorney. He also wants to enjoy living in Ottawa as he lived and worked on a family dairy farm his entire life. He notes living in a big city will be interesting as he lived in the country his entire life.

“More people is going to be the biggest thing,” said McIntosh. “More people and more noise in the city.”

He just graduated from Tagwi Secondary School near Avonmore and was part of the web leader and link crew in school. Link crew is for Grade 9s and web leader is for Grade 7s.

“I learned leadership and that it’s important to make everyone feel included and it makes the transition to high school a lot easier for a lot of kids,” said McIntosh. “When I came to school, I knew how scary it was and link crew and web leader helped me find friends in addition to that.”

McIntosh participated in various sports and teams during his high school years, also playing competitive lacrosse for the Cornwall Celtics. He played football, soccer, and ran cross-country, where he won the spirit award.

Nick Seguin, manager of economic development for the counties, told SDG council at their July 20th meeting that the initiative, backed by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario, will be used to send out the SDG Discover Guide to over 50,000 households in the United Counties and in the City of Cornwall. The direct mail initiative will also include a letter from Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry MP Eric Duncan, and an insert from Cornwall Tourism.

The mailing is supported by Duncan and his constituency office. A supplementary direct mail initiative in North Glengarry will also be done as that municipality is not part of MP Duncan’s riding.

Tourism in Ontario is a $75 billion industry according to the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism, and Culture Industries. A recent survey by the ministry pointed to the economic recovery for the tourism industry to pre-COVID-19 levels may take up to five years.

Part of the provincial government’s initial strategy for domestic tourism is to promote hyper-local tourism.

SDG received over $78,000 funding. Part of the funding has been used to hire two summer students as Tourism Cycling Ambassadors.

The students will cycle the waterfront trail, interacting with cycling visitors and promoting tourism in SDG.

SDG Tourism is outfitting the students with its Ride with GPS platform to map out cycling tours to bring visitors in from the waterfront trail to other parts of the counties.

The balance of the funding will be used for online, social media campaigns and digital content for the SDG Tourism website.

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

According to the community, since the inception of the settlement, they have never seen any infrastructural development by either the federal or state government.

Muhammad Adamu and Ardo of Riyom, who spoke on behalf of the community, said building the school was an indication that they were being carried along, adding that the community had never experienced such development.

He said, ""No words of thanks will equate what SDG has done to us. This is what we have been praying for in the last hundreds of years. I am 60 years old and I have never seen this kind of development in Mahanga until now. We appreciate the gesture and hope to have other social amenities like boreholes, hospitals, and electricity.

Adamu, while expressing happiness over the development, however, denied the rumour that the community's name was changed from Rankum to Mahanga, adding that the area where the school was built was not Rankum. He called on Berom communities to join hands together to move the place forward.

The youth leader of the area and secretary to the Ardo, Abdullahi Yusuf Ibrahim, thanked the SDG for showing much concern towards their plight and called on the state government to deploy teachers to handle the school effectively.

He said, ""One of our many wishes is to have primary and secondary schools for our children to be attending. We have been yearning for something like this but could not succeed. Today, Allah has blessed us with this. We are indeed very grateful. Our major problem now is to have teachers who would be giving lessons to our children. ""

Ibrahim, therefore, called on both state goverment and Riyom LG council to complement the gesture by deploying teachers to the school.","Jos — Residents of Mahanga community in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State have applauded the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Office, for building the first primary school in the area.

The SDG Moment is an annual event mandated by Heads of State and Government in the political declaration of the 2019 SDG Summit. It will take place as part of every high-level week of the UN General Assembly from 2020 to 2030.

Speaking on 6 August 2020, Mohammed reminded delegates that the Moment is meant to serve as an “annual SDG check-in” and snapshot of progress, rather than a comprehensive picture of implementation. It will build on the most recent HLPF session, highlight shortfalls in implementation and investment, and showcase interventions underway to increase action.

On the format, she said approximately 20 Heads of State and Government will be able to speak each year, with a three-minute slot. This ensures that all Member States can address the SDG Moment at least once in the coming 11 years.

Mohammed said the proposed criteria for participation each year would require States to: be represented at the level of Head of State or Government; have completed at least one Voluntary National Review (VNR); and commit to discussing their implementation gaps as well as plans for filling those gaps. The line-up for each year also needs to ensure regional representation, gender balance, and representation of countries’ different circumstances.

In 2020, the SDG Moment will take place for three hours on the morning of Friday, 18 September. She said most statements will be delivered virtually, although the possibility of a hybrid format is being considered.

155,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/pandemic-lessons-open-data-for-forest-and-climate-action/,"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Pandemic Lessons: Open Data for Forest and Climate Action,"Since March 2020, we have witnessed numerous parallels between COVID-19 and the climate crisis, including a lack of cohesive, coordinated global intervention and a laissez-faire response to a global emergency.

Inadequate government response to the pandemic has led to preventable deaths from a highly contagious virus, just as inadequate government responses to the climate crisis could result in exacerbated effects by drought, fires or flooding as well as rising food insecurity. These risks are fast approaching their tipping points.

COVID-19 has inundated our lives with numbers and social media updates to the point of statistical overload, a phenomenon WHO refers to as an ‘infodemic.’ The flood of information has occasionally caused the public to question the veracity of certain claims, which in turn has hampered effective public health responses. Nonetheless, the vast availability of data encourages scientists and citizen scientists across the world to disseminate models, ideas and scenarios for better progress against the virus.

Open Data for Forests

The pandemic reinforces the importance of data for interpretation and dissemination. It is a resource that needs to be carefully curated, because leaders, whether in health or in climate science, need to make informed decisions in order to respond to global agendas such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Likewise, citizens will need assurance and transparency to act as individuals and communities, and to advocate for data-driven policy development.

Likewise, forest data transparency is key to supporting higher levels of ambition for the roles of forests in climate change action. Progress in National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMS) in the past ten years has catalyzed solutions for forests and climate action, such as for REDD+. In many countries, greater transparency of countries’ forest-sector data and information has resulted in improved national decision-making, and for the first time, detailed and transparent forest data has been reported internationally, with 50 countries having submitted forest reference emissions levels to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Still, countries’ efforts towards forest data transparency must be strengthened. Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement, robust data collection is central for reporting on emissions and removals, as well as for tracking the progress of Nationally Determined Contributions. An NFMS that is transparent, reliable, relevant, accessible, and sustainable can support climate action on the ground.

What lessons can forest monitoring practitioners take from the ongoing pandemic?

Sharing openly can flatten the curve: With COVID-19, countries that have embraced data acquisition through frequent testing and have been transparent about infection rates have mostly succeeded in flattening the curve of infections. In Germany, testing, tracing, and transparency are credited with building public trust. Likewise, improved data availability combined with transparency could catalyze more collaborative solutions to the climate crisis that could equally buy some precious time to achieve the terms of the Paris Agreement. Climate policies need up-to-date and integrated information: Data sets can be shared at unprecedented speed. While the availability of COVID-19 related data has often overwhelmed data consumers and resulted in conflicting guidance, frequent and integrated forest data is likely to enhance public engagement and collaboration on relevant solutions for forests. Public money means public information: Enormous financial resources have been poured into COVID-19 monitoring. Likewise, national forest data is primarily collected through taxpayer finances, either through national or international cooperation funds. Greater public financing of large-scale data collection and sharing ultimately means greater information available to the public, enhancing public trust and increasing opportunities for investors and researchers. Open, transparent, and reliable forest data can also enhance private investment, which is urgently needed to trigger transformation of forest and land management for climate action and other multiple benefits. Accurate and reliable forest data created from public funds needs to be open and accessible to the public. Overcoming obstacles to sharing: Under the pandemic, open data has accelerated science, but also introduced vulnerabilities. Both media and politicians have sometimes reported promising results before they have been scientifically validated. Among the obstacles to sharing forest data is the concern of inadequate use of the data and lack of intellectual property recognition. Barely 14% of researchers in 2018 shared their data in repositories. Yet, twisting the tragedy of the commons, while 74% researchers value others’ data sharing as beneficial to their own research, both scientists and governments show reluctance to share their own data.

To overcome this resistance, legal agreements that release individual contributors from conflicts with the institutions involved in data sharing are needed, with updated and harmonized measures to ensure anonymity of legal subjects and/or spatial coordinates. Further, data ownership recognition standards should encourage data sharing. Government officials and researchers need to follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guiding principles for data management and stewardship, thereby making the case that in the end the benefits of sharing outweigh the disadvantages.

Forest Open Data Platforms and FAO’s Support

Some existing microdata platforms, such as the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative GFBI, largely compile and share global field data for academic research and require strict rules on confidentiality and control of users. Yet, forest-related information still remains largely scattered across multiple platforms. FAO is working with UN Member States to overcome obstacles to open forest data. Our current efforts include:

the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, which provides country validated forest data, accessible through an interactive platform and dashboards.

the Hand-in-Hand geospatial platform launched recently, representing a major step towards accessible and transparent cross-sectoral geospatial data across agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.

a set of free and open source tools (Open Foris) developed by FAO to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting helping to enhance forest monitoring at national level.

A new FAO project ‘Building global capacity to increase transparency in the forest sector (CBIT-Forest)’ to establish a Global Field Forest Observation Repository with a view to harmonizing legal assurances in data confidentiality, redistribution policies, and quality assurance conditions meeting international data documentation protocols. Microdata inclusion on this platform would contribute to increased standardization, accessibility and data usage.

A New, Transparent Normal?

COVID-19 has increased awareness about the power of data sharing. We hope that this motivates governments and forest monitoring practitioners to share forest data. At the same time, it is important that open databases follow standards to minimize misuse and misinterpretation. We believe that open forest data can strengthen our collective effort to identify and apply solutions for forests as a key response to the climate emergency.

FAO’s support to forest monitoring aims to strengthen data openness standards, while solving conflicts with data protection and confidentiality. In order to achieve reusability, clear and accessible data use licenses must exist. Legal certainty through license to redistribute agreements, ensure data robustness alongside data sensitivity. A Global Field Forest Observation Repository to facilitate data sharing of forest microdata to technicians and academics while supporting international reporting requirements across countries, is a step towards fostering that necessary transparency.

The theme encompasses both the UN’s milestone year and the global crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

UN Member States agreed in June 2019 that the UN’s 75th anniversary will be commemorated under the theme, ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’ In a letter of 8 August 2020, Volkan Bozkir said that given the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global crisis, he suggests a more specific theme for the General Debate, as follows: ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism – confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.’

Bozkir adds that the debate should focus in particular on the most vulnerable, as well as on ensuring efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda “adapt to the crisis,” noting the outset of the Decade of Action for the SDGs.

The Assembly previously reached agreement on other details of the high-level week, in a decision adopted via silence procedure on 22 July 2020 (decision 74/562). By this text, the UNGA’s high-level meeting to commemorate UN’s 75th anniversary will convene on 21 September. It will formally adopt a declaration that has been negotiated by Member States in advance. Following negotiations, a silence procedure concluded without objection on 7 July, and UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande informed Member States that “consensus has been achieved and the text has been finalized.”

The decision indicates that the Summit on Biodiversity will take place on 30 September, the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) on 1 October, and the high-level meeting on the total elimination of nuclear weapons on 2 October. For all of these meetings, the decision authorizes pre-recorded video statements. The video statements “shall have an equal status as any statement made by any other representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall” and shall be included in the verbatim records of the Debate or meeting.

The decision also encourages Member States to hold all side events on virtual platforms to limit the number of people in the UN building.

Immediately prior to the high-level week, the UN will hold the first annual ‘SDG Moment’ on Friday, 18 September. Details are under discussion.","The president-elect of the 75th UN General Assembly has announced the theme for the general debate, which will open on 22 September 2020.

The technical and policy-focused publication titled, ‘State of the Region: Special report on COVID-19,’ acknowledges high levels of policy uncertainty in the region due to the pandemic, as well as the scale and duration of related economic and social shocks, and pace of recovery. The report thus focuses on how regional cooperation can provide governments with more options for recovery in the face of these uncertainties.

The report collates a set of proposals using data collected from 710 survey respondents in business, academia, government, and civil society between 9 May and 12 June 2020. The results show greater levels of pessimism on economic impacts to the region than official estimates indicate. The report points to regional stimulus efforts totaling approximately USD 5.4 trillion, and notes that while policymakers’ appetites are constrained by memories of recent financial crises, “regional economies have space for further stimulus.”

Regional mechanisms, the authors emphasize, can facilitate the design and implementation of coordination and cooperation packages, and build a sense of direction to support future growth. They note that top priorities for regional cooperation include sharing pandemic preparedness practices, vaccine development, and three aspects of trade with respect to essential products: the facilitation of trade as a whole; the removal of export restrictions; and the removal of tariffs.

Observing that the pandemic has both deepened and accelerated preexisting trends, the report notes the importance of human contact, but also opportunities around digital technology and the multitude of connections available. As schools remain shuttered in many parts of the world, the report notes remote learning opportunities, with the caveat that risks remain around the digital divide despite action being taken through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Internet and Digital Roadmap.

To address the “first order” priorities stemming from the pandemic, the report recommends multilateral actions that facilitate regional progress on seven issue areas:

Information sharing; Flow of essential products; Moving beyond gross domestic product (GDP); Facilitating e-commerce; Restarting travel; Minimizing disruption to supply chains; and Contact tracing.

A message from PECC co-chairs Don Campbell and Su Ge highlights that this year marks PECC’s 40th anniversary and that the rationale behind the Council’s establishment still rings true today.

The resource titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals and Your Community Foundation: Guidebook and Toolkit,’ was developed with funding from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. It focuses on Canadian community foundations’ efforts to work in their own contexts, but also provides information for community organizations around the world.

The Guidebook introduces the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs, and the core principles embodied in them, namely universality, local-level action, leaving no one behind, interconnected and indivisible, and partnerships. It highlights that these principles are particularly relevant to community foundations, which seek to convene local actors, foster partnerships, and spark action to address the needs of diverse groups.

The Guidebook also includes information on Canada’s approach to advancing the SDGs nationally. Canada presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the July 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The following year, the Government of Canada released an interim report titled, ‘Towards Canada’s 2030 Agenda National Strategy.’ This report identifies five national priorities: leadership, governance, and policy coherence; awareness, engagement, and partnership; accountability, transparency, and reporting; reconciliation and the 2030 Agenda; and investing in the SDGs.

The SDG Toolkit portion of the resource identifies practical approaches to align an organization’s work with the SDGs. It offers ideas for how a group can select the first steps to take, identify existing alignment with the SDGs, plan for future alignment, and learn from examples of other community foundations.

Among the interconnected challenges for organizations seeking to align with the SDGs, the resource identifies: time constraints, given that the SDGs have a tight deadline for action; and the need to learn a new “language,” build capacity and new partnerships, and break out of silos.

The CFC is also supporting community foundations working on the SDGs through its Vital Signs program, which is prioritizing the collection of data that aligns to the 2030 Agenda to make relevant and standardized indicators available to community foundations. The toolkit notes that, in 2021, community foundations will have the opportunity to use a digital platform to host and share community data aligned to the SDGs.","The Community Foundations of Canada (CFC) has developed a guidebook and toolkit that offers examples, ideas, and steps for aligning an organization’s work with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Published as a report of the Secretary-General on 11 June 2020, the ‘Roadmap for Digital Cooperation’ discusses a set of recommendations developed by a high-level panel in 2019, and provides action points for the way forward.

In July 2018, the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation was established by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to strengthen international and multi-stakeholder cooperation and contribute to the public debate on a safe and inclusive digital future for all. It was chaired by philanthropist Melinda Gates and e-business leader Jack Ma. In June 2019, after a series of in-person meetings of the members and regional consultations, the Panel issued a report titled, ‘The Age of Digital Interdependence.’ A follow-up process to the report engaging UN Member States and over 300 other entities (listed in an annex to the Secretary-General’s report) was coordinated by the Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary.

In the roadmap publication, Guterres notes that effective digital cooperation “is instrumental in achieving the ‘future we want’ and the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is not something that any country, company or institution can achieve alone.”

The report makes recommendations for action by various stakeholders, in order to “accelerate global digital cooperation, seizing on the opportunities that are presented by technology – while mitigating the risks – so that progress towards achieving the Goals by 2030 can be made collectively.”

Among the action points for the way forward:

On the UN as a convener, in 2021 the Secretary-General will appoint an Envoy on Technology to help facilitate a multi-stakeholder policy dialogue on emerging technologies and guide the UN’s strategy on technology trends, which is currently being updated. The report notes that a forthcoming report of the Task Force on the Digital Financing of the SDGs also will contribute to this discussion.

On human rights, dignity, and agency in a “digitally interdependent age,” the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will develop system-wide guidance on human rights due diligence and impact assessments in the use of new technologies.

On Artificial Intelligence (AI), the UN Secretary-General plans to establish a multi-stakeholder advisory body to address inclusion, coordination, and capacity-building for Member States.

The Alliance’s report proposes 64 recommendations to harmonize and scale SDG financing and investment, with particular attention to the European Union (EU).

Released in early August 2020, the report titled, ‘Renewed, Recharged and Reinforced: Urgent actions to harmonize and scale sustainable finance,’ urges public and private leadership to achieve the SDGs. It calls for mobilizing private sustainable investment through fair and transparent risk-sharing agreements and making faster and scaled use of blended finance. The report argues that green investments alone will be insufficient to deliver the SDGs or the Paris Agreement on climate change; the entire economy and the whole financial system must “undergo a sweeping transition to a more sustainable future.” Proposals to deliver this transition include a financial incentive system that uses fiscal measures to rewards companies for creating sustainable stakeholder value and striving for sustainability outcomes.

Fiscal incentives could be used to reward companies for sustainability outcomes.

To move towards sustainability, the report underscores the “imperative of collective behavioral and policy alignment,” stressing that everyone must “row in the same direction in a coordinated way,” from aligning climate scenarios and risk methodologies for banks, to aligning policy lending and private investor flows. The report calls for addressing “inconsistent approaches to metrics” and poor quality, inconsistently disclosed sustainability data. The report recommends fixing these flawed metrics, aligning standards, and providing consistent information, and mandating confirmed disclosures to ensure SDG-related disclosures are built into existing governance structures. The report further calls for embracing partnerships, collaboration, and innovation to fund the Goals, including by investing in technologies and processes for metrics that support SDGs and sustainability.

Among their detailed recommendations, the members of the Alliance call for:

endorsing the Basel Committee’s high-level Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TCFR) to develop a framework for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) risk supervision applicable to global financial institutions;

making sustainability reporting mandatory for financial and non-financial institutions, including through globally harmonized disclosure requirements that go beyond climate metrics to include material SDG-related information and forward-looking data;

increasing the quality, ambition, and standardization of Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) for the 2030 Agenda and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the Paris Agreement, including by establishing an international platform for the development of investable national capital-raising plans and transaction-oriented investor engagement;

ensuring that public subsidies align with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement; and

diversifying and increasing bond issuance across the SDGs and drive green bond principles and standards into the project finance market.

The report responds to the European Commission’s (EC) Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy Consultation and features specific recommendations for the EU. Those recommendations include: requiring standardized ESG disclosures from companies participating in the EU Green Deal Investment Plan; elevating the Shareholder Rights Directive to the status of an EU Regulation; and elevating the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive to the status of an EU Regulation.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) developed the GISD Alliance in collaboration with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), based on the design of the Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development. The Alliance is part of the UN Secretary-General’s strategy for financing sustainable development, and aims to to provide leadership for mobilizing resource for sustainable development and to accelerate and scale up finance and investment for the SDGs.

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);

SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); and

SDG target 16.1 (violence), including homicide rates per 100,000, broken down by sex.

Participants highlighted several ways to address gender inequalities in the ‘SAICM Beyond 2020’ process.

The session on 26 August 2020 was facilitated by Andrea Rother, University of Cape Town, who informed participants that the CoP was initiated to contribute to solving policy problems. In addition to gender, the CoP plans to address cross-cutting challenges in the areas of biodiversity and climate change.

Sara Brosché, IPEN, offered opening remarks to kick off the exchange of ideas, which was conducted entirely in the written chat section of the virtual meeting platform. To set the stage, Brosché highlighted that, without gender equality in the area of chemicals and waste, the SDGs will not be achieved. She noted that women are affected by inequalities in exposure to chemicals and waste. While gender is a socially constructed concept that refers to the norms, roles, expressions, and identities of women, men, boys, girls, and gender-diverse people, she explained that biological sex is also relevant due to biological impacts of exposure to chemicals and waste. Brosché added that gender is often discussed in relation to SDG 5 (gender equality), but targets under SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and others also apply.

Participants proceeded to exchange ideas on a series of three questions. On the first question, “in the context of chemicals and waste, what is your experience with gender equality when it comes to participation in decision-making on a local, national or global level?,” one discussant said they were not aware of chemical legislation that specifically refers to gender issues until participating in the CoP. Others provided examples of gender balance from international organizations and federal governments, while another noted that at the multinational company where they worked, gender and chemicals issues were not on the agenda.

On the second question, “do you think there are gender inequalities when it comes to exposure to and impact of chemicals and waste management?,” a participant said the data indicate that the biggest gender imbalance is due to occupational exposure, where men are more exposed. However, another participant pointed to the lack of gender-disaggregated information on effects of exposure to chemicals beyond the workplace. One participant suggested that men are more directly exposed because they perform “risky tasks,” while impacts on women may be longer-term and under-diagnosed.

On the third and final question, “What actions do you think would help address gender inequalities on a local and global level?,” suggestions included:

Establishing a gender focal point in the SAICM Secretariat;

Establishing a gender working group to develop a gender action plan for SAICM Beyond 2020;

Ensuring that SAICM national focal points have gender expertise;

Incorporating gender into national action plans;

Collecting data on gender and risk assessment;

Using the Global Burden of Disease resource, which provides gender-disaggregated data, to track a SAICM Beyond 2020 target on reducing the gender gap for negative health impacts; and

Developing a repository of existing strategies.

The Chemicals and SDGs Community of Practice will hold its next discussion on 30 September 2020, on the topic of accelerating the implementation of SDG target 12.4 (By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment).

The SAICM Secretariat has formed four Communities of Practice to bring together representatives from different sectors to focus on challenges related to the sound management of chemicals and waste. These voluntary networks comprise members with expertise and interest in specific thematic areas. [SDG Knowledge Hub sources]","The Chemicals and SDGs Community of Practice (CoP), organized by the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) Secretariat, addressed challenges related to gender and sound chemicals and waste management during its first virtual discussion.

The Angels wrapped up the tournament with a 3-1 record after losing in a semifinal game.

Finishing with a 12-5 overall record, the 13U Angels reached the semifinals in all four of the Grand Slam Baseball tournaments they entered.

SDG (Soli Deo Gloria, meaning Glory to God Alone) began its journey June 5-7 in the Back-to-Baseball Blowout held at Signature Park in Braselton. In heartbreaking fashion, the Angels lost 9-6 to the Lambert Longhorns — a team they defeated 9-3 in the qualifying round — in the championship game to finish second in a field of seven teams.

Not to be denied, the Angels next played in the 11-team June Jam Summer Series Week 3, held June 19-21 at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula. SDG beat the Orange Crush from Clemson, S.C., 11-9 in the Championship game to finish 4-1 in the tournament. Crowned Tournament Champions on Father’s Day, each Angel was presented with a championship ring.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

NITI Aayog launched the first edition of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index India Report in 2018 to measure India’s and its states’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030. It was meant to provide an aggregate assessment of performance of Indian states and union territories on social, economic and environmental parameters. Further, it was aimed to serve as a tool to benchmark progress, identify data issues, devise better policy strategies coupled with a sense of competitiveness among the states (NITI Aayog 2018). It was also one the first few attempts by a country to rank its subnational governments by using an index on SDGs (NITI Aayog 2019). The second edition of the report has been recently released. This is an enhanced version with 100 indicators covering 54 targets across 16 SDGs leaving SDG 17 as compared to the base version with 62 indicators covering 13 SDGs (leaving 12, 13, 14 and 17). This is a progressive sign with regard to larger coverage of goals, targets and indicators, and alignment with the National Indicator Framework (NIF), which serves as the backbone of SDG monitoring in the country (MoSPI 2019).

167,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-fatima-a-compelling-visually-lush-religious-drama,"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Fatima,’ a Compelling, Visually Lush Religious Drama","The story of the 20th century’s most celebrated Marian apparitions comes to life in a fine retelling from co-writer and director Marco Pontecorvo and Catholic screenwriter Barbara Nicolosi.

Note: Theatrical and home viewing information for viewing Fátima is available at the film’s official website.

Marco Pontecorvo’s Fátima is the first screen version of the Marian apparitions at Fátima and the “Miracle of the Sun” I’ve seen that feels like the characters are living through the story’s events in the present tense.

That’s more than a little ironic, because it’s also the version that most emphatically places those events in the past, almost but not quite presenting them in flashback from the perspective of an aging Sister Lúcia (Brazilian actress Sônia Braga, Aquarius) discussing her experiences with a skeptical professor of religion named Nichols (Harvey Keitel) visiting her at the Carmelite convent in Coimbra, Portugal, in 1989.

The 2009 art-house indie The 13th Day offered a simpler framing device — Sister Lúcia writing her memoirs — but relied on it more extensively, allowing frequent voice-over narration to carry much of the narrative. The 1991 Portuguese docudrama Apparitions at Fátima (Aparição or Apparition is the Portuguese title) also relied on voice-over, sometimes clumsily.

Neither film was much interested in dramatizing what motivated the adult figures who become effective or formal antagonists to the three visionary children: Lúcia’s disapproving mother; the skeptical parish priest; the anticlerical mayor. Nor was the classic Hollywood version of the story, the 1952 film The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima , which too obviously tried to emulate the crown jewel of Golden Age Hollywood piety, The Song of Bernadette , without matching its depth of humanity or level of craft.

All of these Fátima films emphasized the turmoil in Europe, and in Portugal in particular, at the moment in 1917 when Our Lady appeared, from the horror of the First World War to the oppression of the Church by Portugal’s hardline secular government.

Only Fátima — written by Barbara Nicolosi, Valerio D’Annunzio and Pontecorvo — captures the sense of life going on at the moment that the three children, 10-year-old Lúcia (Stephanie Gil) and her younger cousins Francisco (Jorge Lamelas) and Jacinta (Alejandra Howard), start to talk about having seen a Lady from heaven at the Cova da Iria, the family pastureland where Lúcia watched her family’s flock of sheep.

Above all, there is the grimly regular ritual of residents of Ourém, the municipality where Lúcia’s village of Aljustrel on the outskirts of Fátima is located, gathering to listen in suspense while the mayor (or civil administrator), Artur Santos (Croatian-American actor Goran Višnjić, Beginners), reads the latest list of local soldiers who have been declared dead or missing.

The list is alphabetical, so there are sighs of relief when the first name is uttered that comes after the name one is most hoping not to hear — in the case of Lúcia’s family, that of Lúcia’s brother Manuel. (This is one of the film’s more notable fictionalizations; the relative at war was a cousin of Lúcia, not a brother.)

Filming entirely in Portugal, frequent collaborators Pontecorvo and cinematographer Vincenzo Carpineta (Game of Thrones, Rome) create rich, atmospheric images with a vivid sense of place, from the medieval town center of Ourém — where, incongruously, the mayor holds forth on the triumph of modern secularism over religious superstition — to the rustic houses of Aljustrel and the rugged beauty of the Cova da Iria. (The scenes in Ourém were filmed in the central Portuguese town of Tomar, which has a picturesque medieval town center with a Renaissance-era church dedicated to John the Baptist. The stone village of Cidadelhe, also known as Piñel, stands in for Aljustrel.)

When the Lady appears, the transcendent nature of the experience is suggested not with luminous special effects or heraldic scoring but with subjective, impressionistic camerawork and editing.

“She was as real as you are,” Lúcia insists to her mother, and, indeed, Portuguese actress Joana Ribiero, serene and benevolent in elegantly simple white garments, walks barefoot on the earth of the Cova as naturalistically as anyone else.

But our glimpses of her are brief and partial — eyes gazing at the children; hands extended to them, holding a rosary; a trickle of blood on her breast — interspersed with the empty space that others see (including, at first, Francisco, who doesn’t immediately see the Lady and later sees her but doesn’t hear her voice when her lips move).

This approach seems to me more evocative than, say, overly familiar computerized glowy effects that we’ve seen in any number of superhero movies over the last decade or so. No cinematic technique, no human art of any kind, can accurately recreate the transcendence of a religious experience, and the most effective religious art has never aspired to representational exactness.

For the first time in any film I’ve seen, Lúcia’s mother, Maria Rosa (Portuguese singer and actress Lúcia Moniz), is a developed character: devout, with some education, loving and wanting what’s best for her daughter, but understandably upset and angry over what she can only conceive as a startling pretense taken too far. A moment in which Maria defiantly faces down disapproving neighbors movingly shows us for the first time the mother suffering with her daughter, rather than being just one more voice against Lúcia.

Artur Santos, the mayor, is cast as a sort of Pilate figure, caught between, on the one hand, pressure from political higher-ups in Lisbon and the consequent need to maintain order and avoid awkward viral religious hysteria and, on the other, the gentle but firm resistance of his Catholic wife, Adelina (Iris Cayatte). (The Santos’ relationship is not entirely unlike that of Pilate and his wife in The Passion of the Christ , and an expression of solidarity between Santos’ wife and the pious protesters recalls Pilate’s wife bringing linens to the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene to wipe Jesus’ blood after the scourging.)

The filmmakers don’t shy from some of the more challenging aspects of the Fátima message, from the emphasis on mortification and the offense given to God by sin to the children’s dreadful visions of war and hell. When Lúcia fears that her brother may have been killed in battle, she spends hours shuffling on her knees in prayer in the Cova, trailed by her respectfully concerned father. (The Lady does tell the children, though, not to keep punishing themselves with ropes tied around their waists.)

As the Lady asked a great deal of the three children, Pontecorvo asks a great deal of his young actors; the film rests on their credibility, as the visionaries’ story rested on theirs.

Pontecorvo seems to have a flair for directing children (first seen in his acclaimed feature debut Pa-Ra-Da), and Gil as Lúcia especially is thoroughly persuasive both in rapture and in conflicted confusion. Lamelas brings sensitivity to Francisco and Howard charm to Jacinta.

Keitel’s skeptical Professor Nichols is a very rough functional counterpart to Gilbert Roland’s softhearted rogue in The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, a nonbelieving character meant to serve as a point of entry for non-Catholic viewers.

Perhaps surprisingly, the latter-day segments with Sister Lúcia — which would form a framing story, were it not for a prologue-like opening sequence depicting an early apparition (not of the Virgin Mary but of the Guardian Angel of Portugal) and the somewhat abrupt ending in the immediate aftermath of the “Miracle of the Sun” — wind up being the film’s weakest links.

Keitel and Braga are a pleasure to watch, but Nichols’ line of questioning is too often more sophomoric (or village atheist) than professorial. (If the nails through Christ’s hands would actually have been set in the wrists, does that mean that God deliberately chose the “wrong” location for stigmata?)

If there’s any reason for the latter-day storyline to be set in 1989 — any relevance of the events at Fátima to that moment toward the end of the 20th century, and perhaps by extension any resonance with our own historical moment — it doesn’t come out. (The filmmakers couldn’t have known at the time production wrapped that Fátima would debut in the midst of a global pandemic, eerily resonating with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic in which young Francisco and Jacinta died shortly after these events.)

Notably, while Nichols questions Sister Lúcia at length on her visionary experiences, they never get around to discussing the widely witnessed Miracle of the Sun — where it might have been her opportunity to cross-examine him.

This lapse not only leaves their dialogue more static than it might have been, it also leaves the “Miracle of the Sun” as the last sequence, without any reflection or perspective except what can be provided by closing titles.

Those issues aside, Fátima is easily the most compelling dramatization of the Fátima story to date and fills a long-felt need in the world of religious cinema. It’s sturdy enough to hold up to periodic rewatchings, for example on May 13, the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima.

In a warmer world, decreasing crop yields and rising food prices are expected to strongly jeopardize the achievement of SDG 2 – ending global hunger. Climate change has consequences for food production worldwide, but there are clear differences between regions. Sufficient food is expected to remain available in the Northern hemisphere, while in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia, falling crop yields may lead to higher food prices and a sharp rise in hunger.

In our recent publication in Nature Climate Change, we find that world trade can relieve these regional differences and provide a way to reduce hunger risks under climate change. For example, if regions like Europe and Latin America where wheat and corn thrive increase their production and export food to regions under heavy pressure from the warming of the Earth, food shortages can be reduced.

Global Hunger by 2050

The State of Food and Nutrition Security in the World 2020 reports that globally almost 690 million people were at risk of hunger in 2019. Many factors determine how global hunger will develop in the future, including population growth and economic development, as demonstrated in a study in Environmental Research Letters. Our article uses the “middle-of-the-road” socioeconomic pathway where population reaches 9.2 billion, income grows according to historical trends, and the number of undernourished people decreases to 122 million by 2050. Within this socioeconomic setting, we investigate the impact of different climate change scenarios and trade policies on global hunger by 2050.

The worst-case climate scenario of a 4°C warming leads to an extra 55 million people enduring hunger – a 45% increase compared to the situation without climate change. In a protectionist trade environment where vulnerable regions cannot increase their food imports as a response to climate impacts, this effect rises to 73 million. The largest hunger risks are located in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with respectively a 33 million and 15 million increase in people at risk of hunger in the worst-case climate scenario.

Where barriers to trade are eliminated, “only” 20 million people endure food shortages due to climate change. While this number is high, it is a vast improvement on the 73 million people that would potentially be exposed to hunger without the suggested measures. In the milder climate change scenarios, an intensive liberalization of trade may prevent even more people from enduring hunger owing to global warming. Yet a liberalization of international trade may also involve potential dangers. If Asian countries increase rice exports without making more imports of other products possible, they could well end up with a food shortage within their own borders.

Mobilizing Investment

Our study shows not only that the challenge of ending global hunger is strongly determined by the extent of progress on SDG 13 (climate action), but also that achievement of SDG 2 (zero hunger) is affected by developments articulated in SDG 9 (resilient infrastructure). We find that international trade can relieve regional food shortages and reduce hunger, particularly where trade barriers are eliminated. Such trade integration requires phasing out import tariffs as well as the facilitation of trade through investment in transport infrastructure and technology. Especially in low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa infrastructure is weak. In its 2018 African Economic Outlook, the African Development Bank (AfDB) estimates that between USD 130 billion and 170 billion a year is needed to bridge the infrastructure gap in the region by 2025. Given that infrastructure finance averaged only USD 75 billion in recent years, and the largest contribution is coming from budget-constrained national governments, alternative financing through institutional and private investments could be crucial in the face of climate change.

Crisis and Protectionism

In times of crisis, countries are inclined to adopt a protectionist stance. For example, in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have temporarily closed their borders for the export of important food crops (see IFPRI Food Trade Policy Tracker for updated information). Some commentators warn that such measures can have large detrimental effects on food security. Our study finds that also in the context of climate change, a well-thought-out liberalization of trade is needed in order to be able to relieve food shortages properly.

It’s clear that we need urgent, transformative change to tackle the global nature crisis. In many cases, we already know the solutions. How to stop terrestrial biodiversity loss from habitat conversion is one such case, and it has implications for the entire SDG framework.

Last week, the UN Convention for Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 reported that of the 20 Aichi targets agreed in 2010, only six are being “partially achieved” by their 2020 deadline. The CBD warns that despite encouraging progress in several areas, the natural world is suffering badly and getting worse. Launched in the same week, WWF’s Living Planet Report found that the population sizes of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles have seen an average drop of 68% since 1970.

How can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while feeding a growing population?

The good news is that the scientific community has made great progress in defining the problem over the past decade; we now have a clear and robust evidence base showing the urgency of changing course. There has also been massive progress in scientifically defining what needs to be done. A prime example of this is our knowledge of how to halt and reverse terrestrial biodiversity loss from land use change.

A third recent study, published in Nature on 10 September, shows the possibility of halting and reversing terrestrial biodiversity loss caused by land use change.

Image credit: Leclere et al, Nature

Six Actions to Halt and Recover from Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss

The new study was led by David Leclere of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and involved 58 experts from across 46 institutions including the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). It projects that without further efforts to tackle habitat loss and degradation, global biodiversity decline will continue at a rate close to or greater than that for 1970-2010. Land use change, also known as habitat conversion, is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land. The researchers used ground-breaking modelling and newly developed scenarios to identify six actions needed to stop such losses. These are:

Sustainable increases in crop yields;

Trade increases in agricultural goods with reduced trade barriers;

Reducing the waste of agricultural goods from field to fork by 50%;

Cutting the share of animal calories in human diets by 50% except in regions in which the share of animal products in diets is already estimated to be low (the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and other Pacific Islands);

Increasing Protected Area extent to 40% terrestrial coverage, covering important sites for biodiversity and with improved management; and

Increasing restoration (reaching about 8% of terrestrial areas by 2050) and landscape-level conservation planning that balances production and conservation objectives on all managed land.

By combining the six actions listed above in an integrated strategy, modelling shows that it is possible to avoid more than two thirds of future terrestrial biodiversity losses caused by land use change.

Protecting SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 15 (Life on Land) at the Same Time

The authors of the study considered seven different scenarios to explore whether we could achieve this without undermining other SDGs. In particular, how can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while also feeding a growing population?

Without transformation of the food system, bold conservation efforts could conflict with future food provision by raising food prices. The conservation efforts alone would also not be enough to stop the losses by 2050. In order to achieve this and reduce potential negative impacts on food security, conservation efforts should be combined with simultaneous transformation of food systems, as well as wider action on other drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and biological invasions.

Such transformative change in food and land use systems would also have valuable co-benefits that contribute to other SDGs, such as SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing).

Implications for International Policy

This is the first time that the key combined actions needed to stop and reverse biodiversity loss on land have been identified and backed by robust futures modelling. This research sets out clear and ambitious actions for governments, businesses, and consumers to take on board.

The next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2021 (COP 15) is expected to agree a set of new international goals and targets as part of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework to take us through to 2050. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework will be a critical opportunity to stop biodiversity loss and ensure that people continue to benefit from biodiversity into the future. But for this framework to be effective, it must incorporate bold conservation and restoration efforts as well as food system transformation. Together these can help to tackle the drivers of terrestrial biodiversity loss.

Participants adopted a Declaration that recognizes multilateralism as a necessity for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, and that implementation of the 2030 Agenda is necessary for survival.

The official commemoration of UN75, which took place at a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government joining virtually, focused on the theme of ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’

The UN Secretary-General warned that the world faces a “surplus of multilateral challenges, and a deficit of multilateral solutions.” In January 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres had launched the UN75 initiative as “the world’s largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.” The UN crowdsourced views on its future priorities and solutions from the global public, through a survey of over a million people in all 193 UN Member States; more than 1,000 dialogues in 82 countries across the world; and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.

Improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty.

Presenting findings from the consultation during the high-level commemoration, Guterres noted they demonstrate the public appetite for increased global solidarity, and emphasized that improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty. Guterres identified gender inequality as the “greatest single challenge to human rights around the world” and expressed concern about the “climate calamity”, rising poverty and nuclear weapons.

UN Security Council President Abdou Abarry said the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exacerbated challenges such as the illicit arms trade, human trafficking, and international terrorism. He also noted that there is no other global organization with the legitimacy and convening power of the UN.

The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Munir Akram said his presidency will focus on mobilizing finance to address the pandemic, achieve the SDGs, avoid the climate catastrophe, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. Four youth leaders called for concrete actions to support those who are left behind and to tackle climate change, among other issues.

President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera, for the least developed countries (LDCs), listed five focus areas for the UN: strengthening multilateralism, including through UN reforms; addressing inequality, including the gender gap and digital divide; financing to implement the 2030 Agenda; pursuing holistic approaches to reflect the singular objective of all SDGs; and promoting a people-centric approach. President of the European Council (EC) Charles Michel, for the EU, underscored the need for COVID-19 treatment to be accessible to all. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), called for revitalizing the UN General Assembly and reforming the Security Council. Many other speakers expressed support for UN reform, and emphasized the importance of multilateralism in COVID-19 recovery and progress towards a more equitable, sustainable world for all.

President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa noted that climate change, environmental disasters, transnational crimes, and migration can be solved only through multilateralism. Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Löfven announced that Sweden will host a conference in Stockholm in 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment.

During the event, Heads of State and Government adopted a ‘Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the UN (A/75/L.1).’ In the Declaration, Member States recognize that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago has not yet been realized: it is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics; people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge and safety; the LDCs are falling behind; and complete decolonization has not been achieved. Further, Member States recognize that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agree that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

In the Declaration, Member States resolve to:

Leave no one behind, with particular attention to people in vulnerable situations.

Protect our planet, including through transformative measures, and by building back better and greener.

Promote peace and prevent conflicts, including through preventive diplomacy and mediation, and respect for international humanitarian law.

Abide by international law and ensure justice.

Place women and girls at the center, and accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women’s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains.

Build trust, by addressing growing inequalities within and among countries, and addressing root causes of inequalities, including violence, human rights abuses, corruption, marginalization, discrimination in all its forms, poverty, and exclusion, as well as lack of education and employment.

Improve digital cooperation and ensure safe and affordable digital access for all.

Upgrade the UN, including by supporting ongoing reform by the UN Secretary-General. They also commit to instill new life in the discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council, continue the work to revitalize the UNGA, and strengthen ECOSOC.

Ensure sustainable financing, including by paying assessed contributions in full and on time; and through the full and timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD).

Boost partnerships, by engaging with all stakeholders including regional and sub-regional organizations, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians.

Listen to, and work with, youth.

Be prepared, including by improving the global crisis prevention and response systems; learning and sharing experiences and information to reduce risks and make our systems more resilient; and accelerating development, production, as well as equitable and affordable global access to new vaccines, medicines, and medical equipment.

The bond features two eligibility criteria: a geospatial criterion that prioritizes vulnerable populations; and a governance criterion linked to the involvement of a UN organization. The bond is also the first to use the SDGs as an entry point, not only in ex-post mapping, according to the investment bank that helped Mexico design the bond.

Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit announced the initiative on 15 September 2020 as part of its sustainable financing program and the first part of a recurring finance tool. It is a seven-year bond for USD 890 million to be used through a “SDG localized finance” approach.

Natixis indicates that Mexico’s approach to a sovereign SDG bond could be duplicated by other countries, but “requires a strong bedrock” in three areas: institutional capacity, budget mapping against the SDGs, and sub-national data to inform the geospatial eligibility criterion.

On the geospatial eligibility, Natixis reports that the SDG bond issuances will finance projects located in 1,345 municipalities in Mexico selected because of illiteracy rates, school attendance rates, level of health services deprivation, lack of toilets, drainage or piped water in houses, absence of electricity access or basic equipment such as refrigerators. The geospatial eligibility is based on “very granular open data.”

On the governance eligibility, Natixis explains that the main governance innovation in the bond framework is the involvement of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which had worked with Mexico on its SDG budget mapping.

In UNDP’s press release about the bond, Administrator Achim Steiner expressed hope that other countries will soon follow Mexico by establishing their own sovereign SDG bonds. [SDG Sovereign Bond Framework]","The Federal Government of Mexico issued a Sovereign SDG Bond, the first country to do so.

The launches took place as part of an event on ‘American Leadership in Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.’

The side event was organized by The Brookings Institution and the UN Foundation. It convened virtually on 16 September 2020. John Allen, President of The Brookings Institution, welcomed participants and announced that Brookings is creating a new Center for Sustainable Development.

To set the stage for the event, Fatimata Cham, youth poet and activist, performed a poem that concluded with the assurance, and challenge, that “Hope is the sound of your own voice.”

The multiple challenges we are facing demonstrate the importance of local leaders.

Anthony Pipa, The Brookings Institution, highlighted that the 2030 Agenda is an agenda for all sectors, not just national governments. He said the multiple challenges we are currently facing demonstrate how important local leaders are.

Representatives of US cities and companies discussed their work as “engines of action” to implement the SDGs. From the City of Los Angeles, California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said “Leadership is defined by how we react to things that we did not expect to happen,” and noted that the SDG framework helps to make our choices clear when considering policy options. He called attention to LA’s online dashboard to track its progress, and reported that LA is launching an SDGs activities index to help LA residents find new partners.

For the City of New York, Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner for International Affairs, recalled that in 2018, New York launched a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Since then, over 200 local governments and cities have committed to producing VLRs, she reported.

Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon and the Verizon Foundation, discussed her company’s work in relation to SDG 4 (quality education), especially to address inequalities in connectivity. Yvette Pearson, George R. Brown School of Engineering, Rice University, highlighted the need to incorporate societal input into the design of solutions. She said this requires adjustments in engineering curricula.

Launching the first Voluntary University Review (VUR), James Garrett Jr., Carnegie Mellon University, expressed hope that more universities will follow CMU’s lead. He emphasized the importance of dialogues – with local government, NGOs, and the private sector – when creating the VUR.

Governor of Hawai’i David Ige launched the first statewide review of the SDGs (voluntary state review, or VSR). He reviewed the dialogue process used to develop the VSR, with state and local governments, community organizations, and the private sector working to identify shared goals. He said the state will measure progress through a data dashboard to hold itself accountable.

Ige noted that the SDGs provide a common language “to align our canoes in the same direction.” Hawai’i’s US Senator Brian Schatz said policies need to “paint a picture and paint me in it” – they need to work for people, and the SDG framework ensures that policies work for everyone.

Dustin Liu, UNA-USA Youth Observer to the UN, reiterated the discussion’s emphasis on the role of dialogue with multiple stakeholders by calling for including youth voices at all levels of decision making.

Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO, UN Foundation, said it is inspiring to see how groups are using the SDGs. She shared her experience as a government representative who helped negotiate the SDGs five years ago, saying those negotiators did not expect them to resonate across so many groups. Multiple groups have embraced the Goals because, as Cousens emphasized, they are universal, interconnected, and about real challenges faced by people around the world.

WASHINGTON — With elusive progress on the Sustainable Development Goals in fragile contexts drastically compromised by COVID-19, there is a critical need for effective aid spending, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “States of Fragility 2020” report.

The annual report examined the most fragile contexts in 2020 in two parts: the global state of fragility before the virus struck, and how the resulting pandemic is dramatically impacting that landscape. It examines fragile state progress on the SDGs, and reviews levels of finance available to support them, calling for urgent action by OECD countries to maintain official development assistance levels, support access to other types of financing, and promote policies for fragile contexts.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment ...” — Susanna Moorehead, chair, OECD Development Assistance Committee

Of those living in extreme poverty globally, 76.5% live in fragile contexts — representing 23% of the world’s population. Only small improvements were found in the 2020 analysis of 57 countries and territories, and they are expected to be jeopardized by COVID-19, which has contributed to mass unemployment, increased poverty, heightened inequalities, political unrest, and rising gender-based violence.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health, economic, and social crisis without precedent in living memory. It’s also revealed the immense importance of strong states, efficient governments, and solid social security systems to confront the pandemic,” said Jorge Moreira da Silva, director of the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate, at a launch event on Thursday. “The early estimates, using the most recent projections from the World Bank, suggest that the pandemic will result in 26 million additional people in fragile contexts falling into extreme poverty by the end of this year.”

How off track are the SDGs, exactly? We don't know, but it might not matter Lagging official data makes it challenging to have an up-to-date picture of the pandemic's impact on the SDGs. But it is clear that the goals require renewed support and financing, experts explain ahead of the U.N. General Assembly.

Susanna Moorehead, OECD Development Assistance Committee chair, called the numbers in the report “terrifying” and said the figures show that poverty reduction is not merely off-track, but in reverse. She said DAC must mobilize political momentum and resources for fragile countries by spending ODA more wisely and making funds go further.

In 2018, $76 billion in bilateral ODA went to fragile contexts — more than ever before. After remittances, ODA is the second largest form of external finance to fragile countries, and it has increased every year since 2014.

“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else. They find it hardest to get foreign investment … Official development assistance is under enormous pressure and it is certain that demand will outstrip supply,” Moorehead said. “You only have to think about the humanitarian burden that the world’s facing, and it is DAC donors who will pick up a very substantial part of the costs of that over the course of the next year or so. But fragility, we know, is expensive … if you don’t invest in stability, it costs you more.”

Making ODA more effective means making sure the international community is coordinating assistance and that there is less competition between agencies. It also requires a focus on programs that prioritize resilience and investment in conflict prevention and peace building, she said.

Helder da Costa, general secretary of the g7+, a group of fragile states, said that despite the pandemic, ending active conflict and war around the world must remain the number one priority.

“Conflict prevention cannot and should not be summed up as compilation of ad hoc projects and activities funded and fragmented in analysis and theories. Pursuing stability that rests on a capable state, functioning institutions, and [a] vibrant economy should be our end,” da Costa said. “For the g7+ countries, we did not need a pandemic to learn this hard lesson. Our member countries have been living such a reality for decades.”

OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said that the coronavirus has aggravated multiplied issues of fragility — the burden of which tends to disproportionately fall “on those who are already vulnerable and marginalized.” Before COVID-19, only 8 of the 48 fragile contexts where data is available were on track to meet SDG 1, ending poverty.

Thirteen of the countries examined in the report are categorized as extremely fragile, with the top five being Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 2012 and 2018, the gap in levels of fragility between the extremely fragile states and non-fragile contexts increased every year. In 11 of the 13 extremely fragile states, progress has stagnated on hunger and gender equality-related SDGs while in more than half of nonfragile contexts, progress is increasing or on track for meeting the goal.","“Fragile states need ODA more than anyone else.

The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.

According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.

If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.

Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.

The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council announced that only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries have expressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’

It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

The Alliance was the focus of a high-level virtual meeting on trends, options, and strategies for eliminating poverty.

Thirty-nine countries are listed as members of the Alliance. The Alliance will be led by Interim Coordinator Samson Itegboje, Permanent Mission of Nigeria. Itegboje said poverty is “the number one goal among the SDGs” and the most topical issue facing the global community apart from the impacts of COVID-19.

SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met.

Itegboje said the Alliance must “chart a new course” for poverty eradication. To be effective, he said, a strategy to eradicate poverty must reflect its multi-dimensional nature, incorporating economic, social, cultural and political dimensions.

Olivier Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, said the Alliance is extremely important for three reasons:

The number of people in extreme poverty is still unacceptably high, and this is not a result of natural disasters but of inappropriate policy choices. He called for a policy-oriented study on why people are still poor.

Other stakeholders must be involved in improving global governance practices. He called for collaboration on trade, investment, international property rights, and other interventions critical to the realization of SDG 1 (no poverty).

Developing countries need support to establish social protection floors, due to their current budget deficits.

Schutter informed participants of a process underway to establish a Global Fund for Social Protection. This will aim to coordinate various countries’ efforts to strengthen social protection. It would also work to mobilize resources to support developing countries in bridging financing gaps and establishing social protection floors. Finally, the Fund would also provide a reinsurance facility, allowing poor countries to protect themselves against shocks and thus maintain the functioning of social protection systems.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Mona Juul, said women must be at the center of the Alliance, just as with all other development efforts. She said the Alliance should strive to shift world attention to a resilient development path that leads to human rights for all.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said policymakers should not lose sight of the urgency of climate action, which can unlock “massive economic and social benefits and accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development.” She also reminded participants that the UN’s framework for immediate socioeconomic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a roadmap for a systemic, multifaceted approach.

Mohammed cited a World Bank estimate that COVID-19 could push between 71 and 100 million more people into extreme poverty in 2020, “effectively wiping out progress made since 2017.” On 6 August 2020, the World Bank released a publication on these “new poor,” finding that the global poverty rate was originally projected to fall to 8.2% in 2019, but due to COVID-19, is now projected to increase to 8.8% (baseline) and 9.2% (downside) in 2020.

The discussion during the high-level meeting highlighted challenges in poverty eradication, noting that SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met, as roughly 75% of employed youths work in the informal sector and lack protection, while 126 million young workers still live in poverty.

The report of the meeting provides recommendations emerging from the meeting. These include:

Institute people-centred policies to allow for scaled up investment in universal healthcare, education, social protection, equitable access to digital technology, and support to micro- and medium-sized enterprises;

Scale up investment in agriculture and rural development within the context of national poverty eradication policies and plans;

Implement credible anti-corruption policies and strengthen the integrity of public institutions;

Prioritize reform of judiciary and law enforcement agencies, to provide an enabling environment for allocating resources productively; and

Improve support for developing countries to establish social protection floors.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the high-level meeting – which took place on 30 June 2020 – represents the start of a series of annual dialogues on poverty eradication.

Leading up to the 2020 HLPF session, UN Member States attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration to be adopted during the HLPF’s closing session. However, they were unable to reach agreement on a final text within the time frame of the session. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that this has become the norm, but if the meeting had been taking place in person, governments would have been able to adopt it by a vote. “In the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was found.

On 8 September, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal (E/2021/L.8) for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, “as early as possible during the 2021 session of the Council.”

In the plenary meeting on 14 September 2020, the Council took up the draft decision but did not adopt it. Delegations raised procedural concerns about an exceptional session, and noted that by the current rules, a ministerial declaration should only be considered once per ECOSOC cycle.

Among other objections, Germany for the EU said the text proposed by the G-77/China does not match the document placed under silence procedure during the 2020 session; Canada cautioned against rushing negotiations on such an important text; and Australia said the way forward is to focus on the 2021 HLPF session.

Heads of State and Government will consider the policy menu at a high-level event on 29 September 2020.

Just like people with pre-existing conditions, countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19.

Speakers explained that developing countries are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many ways. As Ghana’s minister for finance said, the pandemic’s effects on Africa are “not a passing frigate, but a … dislocation of at least three years.”

Among the examples given:

Fiji has no active cases of COVID-19, but has lost revenue due to tourism and remittance declines. Similarly, the Maldives felt economic impacts of the pandemic before a case of COVID-19 was discovered locally, as it had to stop tourism for over three months – “the engine of our economic growth.”

Ghana could lose USD 1 billion through illicit financial flows, which is more than its entire health budget.

South Africa has the same debt-to-GDP ratio as Germany, but South Africa’s debt service payments are 4% of its GDP, while Germany’s are 0.7%. “This cannot be the right thing to do” in a time of such dire need, said Vera Songwe, UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). High debt payments mean compromising test kits, tracing programmes, and acquiring vaccines.

Africa has no reserve currency, and will need USD 100billion/year to begin recovery.

The meeting on 8 September 2020 was convened by UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and the finance ministers of Canada and Jamaica. Opening the meeting, the two convening ministers stressed the need for a multilateral response to the pandemic and the related economic crisis. Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Finance of Canada, acknowledged that the least developed countries (LDCs) feel the effects most acutely, lacking the resources to adopt recovery measures. Nigel Clarke, Minister of Finance of Jamaica, said the need for a global response to the pandemic has only increased, as its center of gravity has shifted to developing countries.

International officials then highlighted economic trends resulting from the pandemic, three priorities for policy makers, and the menu of policy options. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said countries with weaker economic fundamentals suffer more from COVID-19, just like people with pre-existing conditions. She said countries that already had high debt levels are in terrible trouble, and tourism-dependent economies “are on their knees.” The priorities now are to: maintain support for these countries until their economies are fully turned around; extend the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) for another year; and invest in education, digital capacity, human capital, health systems, and social protection.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, said the menu of policy options provides measures for emergency response, recovery, and stability. Emergency mobilization measures could include extending and broadening the DSSI, declaring remittance services essential, and extending debt swap lines and special drawing rights (SDRs). Sustainable and inclusive recovering measures could include debt cancellations, debt-for-climate or debt-for-SDG swaps, and scaling up social protection and health coverage. Policy options for enabling a sustainable and resilient future including adopting climate-related financial risk disclosures, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and integrating the SDGs into national budgets.

Members of six discussion groups presented key findings of their work in June, July and August 2020, which generated the menu of policy options. For the group on external finance, remittances, jobs, and inclusive growth (Group 1), Japan reported that the G20 and Paris Club have agreed on an extension of the DSSI, and called for private sector funding. China announced that it is actively considering the DSSI extension. Egypt supported debt equity swaps to finance SDG-related investment.

On recovering better for sustainability (Group 2), the European Commissioner for Crisis Management stressed the need for a “green, digital, just, and resilient” recovery. Related policy options would support strong health systems, resource-efficient growth, and an open and secure digital society. He said this requires both public and private investment to fully align with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Rwanda said that in addition to an extended DSSI, developing countries also need: adjustments to the DSSI terms, debt restructuring, a replenished IDA 20, and access to financial markets at zero cost. “This is the road map” to recover better.

The UK said countries’ recovery plans should incorporate updated and enhanced climate NDCs, and they should align spending with the Paris Agreement. The UK will host the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021 (UNFCCC COP 26).

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) said digitalization can help mobilize finance and is a lifeline in this crisis. The International Development Finance Club (IDFC) said public development banks (PDBs) can help bridge the SDGs, Paris Agreement, and local policies, and momentum us growing between PDBs and stakeholders. IDFC announced that it will hold the ‘Finance in Common Summit’ on 12 November 2020, the first global meeting for all PDBs.

On global liquidity and financial stability (Group 3), Costa Rica announced a proposal for a USD 1 trillion fund to support emerging and poor countries with concessional loans for COVID-19 impacts. The World Bank echoed the importance of concessionality. Ghana said the SDR system should be extended. He cited a “disaster waiting to happen [in 2021] as countries begin to default.”

France and the World Bank indicated support for extending the DSSI. The World Bank added that more participation is needed from the private sector.

The Maldives proposed a tourism fund to ramp up testing in airports to restore trust in global travel. The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) recommended a liquidity and sustainability facility to bring down the rates for debt service payments.

On debt vulnerability (Group 4), Pakistan said participation in the DSSI should not affect credit ratings. The African Union (AU) Commission said extending the DSSI is critical: “African countries need liquidity.”

The US said the G20 and Paris Club could consider further steps in 2021, depending on countries’ actions in the meantime, such as improving public financial management and directing investment to projects that strengthen economic growth).

The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) called or a debt swap for climate change to create a Caribbean resilience fund, which would require 12% of the total public debt (USD 7 billion).

On private sector creditors engagement (Group 5), Senegal said private sector DSSI might be relevant for certain countries, but it is not relevant for all, and “certainly not for Senegal.” Instead, it would “kick the can down the road” for countries that already have expensive commercial debt. Official debt cancellation will be needed for some countries, he stressed.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the aftermath of COVID-19 for developing countries – hunger, starvation, and poverty – will make its health consequences look very small.

Finally, on illicit financial flows (IFFs) (Group 6), Nigeria called for mutual legal assistance to address barriers to international cooperation. The Financial Action Task Force (FATAF) reported that the pandemic has been used to generate illicit funds, which are now flowing out of developing countries just when health services need it most. The solution is to implement the FATAF standards, he suggested.

Oxfam endorsed the recommendation to support the Addis Tax Initiative’s (ATI) 2020 mandate, and called for a UN tax convention to address tax havens, tax abuse, and other IFFs.

The ministers’ meeting will be followed by a Meeting of Heads and State and Government on 29 September to consider the policy options, and a series of thematic and regional meetings from October to December.

A follow-up meeting in December 2020 is being planned in order to benchmark progress in the context of the Decade of SDG Action.

178,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unctad-report-details-economic-social-impacts-of-covid-19/,"Tue, 08 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UNCTAD Report Details Economic, Social Impacts of COVID-19","A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretariat finds that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to “reverse much of the economic and social progress already made” towards SDG achievement. However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

The UN General Assembly (UNGA) requested UNCTAD to prepare the report in its resolution 74/201.

The CBD Secretariat launched the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) on 15 September 2020, during the first of four days of ‘Special Virtual Sessions’ taking place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to the eight transition areas, GBO-5 reviews progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which were adopted by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 10) in October 2010, and were set for the 2011-2020 period. GBO-5 draws on indicators, research studies, and assessments, including the IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as well as national reports submitted to the CBD.

Conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions, among other areas of progress reported in GBO-5.

The report highlights ten areas in which progress can be viewed:

almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems;

the rate of deforestation has fallen globally by about one-third compared to the previous decade;

where good fisheries management policies have been introduced, the abundance of marine fish stocks has been maintained or rebuilt;

an increasing number of successful cases of eradication of invasive alien species from islands has been reported;

a significant expansion of protected area has been reported;

conservation actions have reduced the number of extinctions;

the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization has come into force and is fully operational in at least 87 countries and internationally;

national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) have been updated in line with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 by 170 countries (85% of CBD Parties);

there has been an increase in the available data and information on biodiversity; and

financial resources available for biodiversity through international flows have doubled.

The report suggests pursuing a “portfolio of actions” that draws on efforts related to: enhanced conservation and restoration of ecosystems; climate change mitigation; action on pollution, invasive alien species, and overexploitation; more sustainable production of goods and services; and reduced consumption and waste.

Also highlighted during the launch event was the second edition of the Local Biodiversity Outlooks (LBO-2). LBO-2 focuses on local biodiversity and stories of resilience among indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). It proposes six transition areas aligned with GBO-5:

Cultural transitions towards diverse ways of knowing and being;

Land transitions towards securing customary land tenure of IPLCs;

Governance transitions towards inclusive decision-making and self-determined development;

Incentives and financial transitions towards rewarding effective culturebased solutions;

Economic transitions towards sustainable use and diverse local economies; and

Food transitions towards revitalising indigenous and local food systems.

Joji Carino, Forest Peoples Programme, launched the report as part of the 15 September event. According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, Carino said IPLCs are underrepresented in national strategies and action plans, “despite agreement that putting culture and the rights of IPLCs at the heart of biodiversity strategy can bring about positive outcomes.”

The event also launched a review of progress towards the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020.

On 24 September 2020, the Hub featured sessions on how nature can support achieving the SDGs, with a focus on: nature for climate; nature for water; and scaling up financing. The session on Nature for Climate emphasized the role of ecosystems in climate change mitigation, with one participant saying the world has woken up to the fact that nature underpins our economy and the spread of COVID-19 has confirmed that protecting nature is about protecting ourselves. The benefits from protecting nature are delivered immediately and accrued to locals, he reminded. He stressed as the necessary next steps: defunding deforestation; promoting equity and social justice; and prioritizing natural climate solutions in economic recovery.

The world has woken up: protecting nature is about protecting our economy and ourselves.

Other key messages included:

forests and nature can deliver a third of the needed emission reductions, and reversing their degradation will be fundamental for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement;

natural climate solutions have moved to the center of the climate change debate, and they are increasingly understood to be an essential complement to decarbonization in climate action; and

nature-based solutions, however, have only received 3% of global climate finance.

In a joint statement, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called for: placing nature at the heart of sustainable development; building a green, inclusive and circular economy; and mobilizing action from every corner of society. Zac Goldsmith, Minister for Pacific and the Environment, UK, said his government will increase the share spent on nature-based solutions in its climate finance.

A session on Nature for Water highlighted how nature-based solutions can build long-term water security. Key messages included:

Water is finite, but our need for it is growing – this relationship needs balancing.

Communities, cities, corporations, and other stakeholders are already engaging in activities that integrate nature-based solutions into water management while generating social and economic benefits.

Trust is a crucial element for ensuring acceptance for nature-based solutions that require investments, and a lot more can be accomplished when various stakeholders work together.

Further efforts are needed to: quantify the benefits of nature-based solutions to build an evidence base for support; nature-based solutions and “grey solutions” need to be assessed holistically; and enabling environments for nature-based solutions need to enhanced.

Among other success stories, Xanthea Limburg, City of Cape Town, explained how the city’s water strategy builds on the experience of successfully avoiding “day zero” in 2018 (when the municipal water supply almost had to be cut off) and includes the principle of working with nature. Ulrike Sapiro, The Coca-Cola Company, said that, of her company’s 300 water replenishment projects that seek to replenish all water the company uses in production processes globally, 230 are dedicated to working with nature.

Stuart Orr, WWF, observed a growing interest in mainstreaming nature-based solutions from investors who see water scarcity-related risks affecting their assets. As constraints to mobilizing financing, Gilles Kleitz, French Development Agency, identified a lack of: technical and performance standards for nature-based solutions; active dialogue with consultancies on performance; and rigorous financing models for NBS.

On 25 September, the Nature for Life Hub focused on business and finance. A key theme was the need to disrupt business-as-usual by placing nature at the center of decision-making. Participants discussed ways to better align goals to protect, restore and sustainably manage nature with goals for sustainable economic development and financial investment. During this event, the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge was launched. Through this Pledge, 26 financial institutions committed to protect and restore biodiversity through their finance activities and investments.

On 28 September – dubbed “global ambition day” – global leaders and stakeholders showcased commitments to promoting a nature-based planetary safety net. A Nature Finance Forum presented key message including:

governments must de-risk investments to create incentives for the private sector;

governments alone cannot create change – philanthropists also need to target their efforts;

businesses must be mobilized to reduce their own carbon footprints and to help establish enabling environments for entrepreneurs; and

finance is needed for Indigenous stewards and to protect the poorest communities who depend on biodiversity

The Day included a Leaders’ Event to mark the launch of the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, developed by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Belize, Bhutan, Colombia, Costa Rica, EU, Finland, Kenya, Seychelles and UK, along with intergovernmental and NGO partner organizations. The pledge was launched in support of the first UN Summit on Biodiversity, on 30 September 2020, and the post-2020 biodiversity framework, which countries are expected to agree on at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China (CBD COP 15) in 2021.

Endorsers and supporters of the pledge commit to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, through ten specific actions. At the time of the event, the pledge had attracted endorsements by 70 countries and numerous non-state actors, and hosts expected this number to keep rising.

Opening the event, Volkan Bozkır, President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), lamented that none of the Aichi Targets on biodiversity have been fully achieved, and expressed hope that the September Summit “elevate the political discourse on biodiversity” and become an important step on the road to Kunming.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for the new global biodiversity framework to provide a roadmap for implementation. He commended leaders for launching the pledge and called on everyone to make 2021 “nature’s year.”

In pre-recorded statements, government leaders underscored:

There is a need to recognize the interdependence between people and ecosystems.

The current market system fails to capture most ecosystem values. Natural capital needs to be restored, and societies must change how they finance, produce and consume.

Goals related to the pledge include zero biodiversity loss, nature-positive development, carbon neutrality, and resilience.

Biodiversity conservation is a strategic investment in health, jobs, livelihoods and food security, and protects humanity from diseases.

Urgent, practical and ambitious actions are needed, including robust goals and strong monitoring mechanisms.

All parts of governments should engage in implementing the pledge, and concerted action is needed from governments, businesses and civil society.

Indigenous experience and knowledge should be harnessed, and local communities need to be enlisted to support implementation.

Economic recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate the goal of “saving our life support system.”

Business and civil society leaders highlighted that:

Economies and businesses depend on nature.

Humanity is pushing the planet dangerously close to a tipping point that could result in irreversible destabilization of the system.

Governments need to create the conditions for the private sector to achieve the biodiversity targets.

Financial institutions have announced a Finance for Biodiversity Pledge that includes a target of collaborating and sharing knowledge, engaging with companies, setting targets and reporting on them publicly, by 2024.

60 major faith traditions will develop “faith long-term plans” to protect nature.

Equity, justice and women’s rights should be at the heart of efforts to halt biodiversity loss.

Nature is fundamental for protecting human health.

Closing the day, CBD Executive Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema called on all stakeholders to come together in global solidarity to take urgent action. UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen outlined five areas where transitions are necessary: food systems; resource extraction; energy systems; green infrastructure investments; and land degradation. She called on governments to ensure all post-COVID-19 stimulus packages include “green strings” and reminded that “failure is not an option.”

The fourth day focused on Local Action, with ten winners of the Equator Prize announced.

The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariat reports that it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.

In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’s Montreal Protocol has facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.

The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, which came into force in January 2019. It calls for reducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

In her message on the International Day, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that if fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment will prevent 0.4°C of global warming.

Despite the COVID pandemic affecting the community, it was announced the United Way of SDG would be helping even more agencies and programs in 2020. “In 2019, the United Way grew its allocation membership from 13 agencies who we assisted to fund 14 programs, to 14 agencies and 16 programs,” said Labossière. “This year, we’re proud to say that we grew yet again. We’re actually funding the 16 agencies and assisting with 20 programs.”

Article content During the kick-off event, the executive director also discussed the ways in which the way funds collected are tallied. Long gone, several years ago, is the familiar thermometer way of announcing the amount raised. It’s been replaced by what Labossière called an impact-based analysis of funding. The practice enables the organization to increase the impact it has on the many programs and agencies it assists. “A dollar to the United Way is spent in collaboration in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing cost-sharing expertise in building, together, this community we call home,” said Labossière. “We continue to fundraise, as dollars are vital to the survival of our partner agencies and are necessary to run the programs that we choose to fund. “We invest your money, right here in our community, where it is needed most.” More On This Topic United Way/Centraide of SD&G launches annual campaign United Way of SDG Community Campaign supporting more agencies United Way / Centraide of SDG in the black, adds new member agencies In all, the United Way of SDG pledged to invest $337,786 to the agencies it assists. The topic of COVID was addressed during the kickoff. Labossière said she believed several factors had led to area residents not being as impacted by the virus as they could have been. These included strategic partnerships the United Way of SDG had established over the last few years, such as with the Social Development Council of Cornwall and Area, as well as the 30 or so members of the Regional Emergency Response Council. In addition, she also praised the generosity of not only the citizens of Cornwall and SDG, but also of the city itself.

This included Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall and Area executive director Ron Graham, as well as John Hoyles, of Ontario 211. In addition, Steven Douris, himself a big brother with the organization, spoke to a local mother, who’s two children have benefited from the BBBS’ mentoring programs. Identified only as Maureen, the woman told listeners how both her daughter and her son were matched with mentors, which then allowed them to blossom in later years. “It’s unbelievable how much it has helped,” she said. “For my son, he’s been given healthy male role models which obviously I cannot be for him. My daughter is a bit shy and her big sister, and her big sister’s family, because they have all welcomed her into their home, they have brought her out of her shell.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

A key theme of the 30-minute video was the importance of strategic partnerships and collaboration to effectively meet the challenges of poverty in our community, and how the United Way of SDG strives to be a leader in poverty reduction.

“A dollar to the United Way is spent in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing costs, sharing expertise and building together the community we call home,” said Juliette Labossière, Executive Director of United Way of SDG, during the live virtual event.

The United Way/Centraide of SDG members continued to grow in 2020 with the organization funding 16 local agencies and 20 programs compared to 14 agencies and 16 programs in 2019. In 2020-2021, the United Way of SDG will invest $337,786 into the community through these 16 agencies who all fall under the organization’s three pillars: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be and building strong and healthy communities.

Labossière further talked about the increased relevancy of The United Way of SDG and several local organizations during the current pandemic, touching on how strategic partnerships with the Social Development Council of Cornwall & Area, 30 members of the Emergency Response Council, and the generosity of the City of Cornwall and citizens across our entire region contributed to fewer people being negatively impacted by the pandemic than could have been. It was the advocacy and a coordinated approach through these partnerships that enabled the United Way of SDG to distribute $530,000 into our region over the last 5 months. This included Akwesasne, Cornwall and all of our counties.

The work to ease our way out of the pandemic, however, is far from over and the United Way of SDG worries about the real social impact of the pandemic that will emerge in the next few months.

“I urge you to think about the United Way as the united front that will assist our community and non-profits to weather this upcoming storm and support the community on all levels as necessary,” Labossière asked of the viewers as their support is vital to the United Way’s continued work in the community.

David Booyink, Campaign Chair, also shared a few words on why he volunteers, “I’ve always had this growing desire since I was a young boy to save lives, to make a difference.” Volunteering is a way everyone can help, and the United Way of SDG urges you to research its member agencies and look for opportunities to get involved.

Maureen Miller, a mother of two, shared how volunteers changed her life. She discussed her experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall (a United Way of SDG member agency), emphasizing just how much of an impact the program has had on her kids’ lives. It has given them the support and friendships they need to find happiness and explore new opportunities that they may not have had if not for the mentorship of their Big Brothers and Big Sister.

And to end the live event, John Hoyles, Executive Director of the Community Information Centre of Ottawa, shared an important resource that everyone in SDG can use. 211 is an informational helpline and website that connects people to the right information and services to navigate life’s challenges. This resource saw a 20% increase in SDG during the first few months of COVID-19 and Hoyles expects it will increase in popularity as we move into winter.

“The most important thing for us is to get more people to know about 211,” Hoyles stressed as this is a service for people to turn to when they have nowhere to go. His goal is to “make 211 just as known as 911,” and encourages viewers to help spread the word about this lifeline for the people who need it.

The United Way of SDG is happy to announce that it has already raised $620 to kick-off its 2020 Campaign, It needs our community’s support now more than ever to push us through the next few challenging months.

185,https://guardian.ng/news/lagos-launches-maiden-sdg-week/,"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Guardian,Lagos launches maiden SDG week | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News,"The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

According to the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals and Investment, Mrs Solape Hammond, the endeavour is a symbol of the State’s strong leadership, vision and commitment towards greater development.

Hammond also stressed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s spirited resolve to address the development needs of Lagosians, particularly in the face of the ongoing pandemic.

“The outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) has heightened the call for renewed dedication to sustainable development by governments at various levels, which Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has taken as a great priority and infused in the state’s development agenda codenamed THEMES (Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy, Entertainment and Tourism as well as Security and Governance).

“While the pandemic has significantly exacerbated some of the problems Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are set to solve, it has also triggered the necessity for more concerted actions in addressing many developmental issues troubling our world,” she asserted.

Hammond disclosed that the event, in commemoration of the United Nations’ Global Goals Week, will run till the end of September 2020, and will mobilise collaborative efforts to connect SDGs actors and cross-sector stakeholders with a view to identifying solutions, reviewing progress, amplifying awareness, collaborating and reaffirming commitment towards accelerating efforts to achieve the 17 SDGs and the 2030 agenda.

She explained that the State Government is setting lofty precedence in the country, and perhaps in Africa by effectively mobilising individual action towards the attainment of the SDGs, and added that the administration would continue to drive, extract and utilise available platforms towards improving the living standard of the people.

In his remark, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on SDGs, Mr. Lekan Fatodu, said the focus is to double up our efforts and galvanise more actions towards the attainment of the global goals.

“Lagos State is reputable for audacious strides and accomplishments. And these remarkable traits are consistently being brought to bear in our approaches towards realising the SDGs. This maiden SDGs Week is a clear demonstration of our acknowledgement of many dynamic and relevant ways of amplifying the significance of the SDGs and, more importantly, a strategic way of identifying and attracting passionate drivers of the SDGs in Lagos State to join hands towards achieving the goals.

“The effort to reach everybody, including the most vulnerable and marginalized, requires strong community and citizen engagement and organic participation. This strategy holds great value as we approach the last decade of SDGs,” he affirmed.

Fatodu further stated that “the Sustainable Development Goal Week is a proactive and ground-breaking initiative to implement joint efforts towards meeting the targets and indicators of the SDGs”.

While applauding the unalloyed contributions of prominent individuals, Corporate Institutions and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Governor’s aide revealed that “the initiative will further bring to fore the need for urgent and collective effort towards finding sustainable solutions to current and impending challenges facing humanity”.

The SDGs week will feature sustainable development-related activities that are intrinsically linked in their purpose to fast-track efforts towards progress in realizing the SDGs. Some of these activities include the Open Goals Adoption by top state functionaries and prominent Lagos residents, the Neighbourhood Outreach Campaign to enlighten citizens on their roles in achieving the Goals and an SDGs discourse with CSOs and youth groups that are focused on the SDGs.

The highlight of the week will be the distribution of support items and relief materials donated by corporate organisations and well-meaning Lagosians to vulnerable people in some communities and the disbursement of exercise books to primary schools in rural communities. This is in tandem with the ‘Turn It Around’ theme of the Global Goals Week, which seeks to empower people and communities to stem the negative tide of the pandemic as the deadline for the achievement of the global goals draws nearer.

In support of the Lagos SDGs Week and SDG 2 – Zero Hunger, the Old English Bakery will open all its outlets across Lagos State, where thousands of free loaves of bread will be given to Lagosians.

Amongst the reputable organisations and individuals supporting the inaugural Lagos SDGs Week are Procter & Gamble, Post Assurance Brokers, accomplished entrepreneur and global SDGs advocate, Mr. Tonye Cole; CEO, Post Assurance Brokers, Mr. Lekan Ajisafe; Human Resources expert, Ms. Mary Dinah and businessman, Akogun Lanre Alfred.","The Lagos State Office of Sustainable Development Goals and Investment (SDG&I) has launched the first edition of the Sustainable Development Goals Week as part of efforts to inspire citizen’s commitment, advocacy and action towards promoting and accelerating the realisation of the SDGs in Lagos State.

Saving and protecting SDG's rural heritage, one old barn at a time Supplied

Article content My hometown could have looked very different today. Just after the Second World War in downtown Toronto, large swaths of late Victorian buildings were demolished to put up the Gardiner Expressway and construction began on what is now a cement and steel celebration of height in office towers and condominium buildings. And then, in 1965 a most spectacular 64 years-old stone and marble homage to money was demolished for what is now the iconic Toronto Dominion Centre, a full block of sleek black glass and steel anchoring Bay Street in the psyche of our nation. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Saving and protecting SDG's rural heritage, one old barn at a time Back to video A cemetery of sorts for the Corinthian columns of this dismantled Bank of Toronto building plundered for the modernist ground-breaking design was created along the Scarborough Bluffs, a park now popular for wedding photos. In 1972, two men took a road trip around Ontario and Quebec to document barns. One man was Eric Arthur a professor of architecture at the University of Toronto and a Companion of the Order of Canada. The other man was Dudley Witney photographer and writer.

Article content At a time in Toronto when architecture was focused on topping this sleek beauty of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s TD Bank Complex and the pending start to the CN Tower they set out to study the humble barn. The product of their quest was The Barn: A Vanishing Landmark in North America. The first sentences of their introduction to the book summarizes the motivation for these two men to seek out the agricultural structures which are a beacon to rural life: “Is it possible that millions now living in North America have never seen a barn, let alone been in one. In the foreseeable future, there is more than a possibility that, for many, the kind of barn illustrated in these pages will not be there to see. When one considers the exposure of our old barns to the winds of change,… the marvel is that any are left for those who would try to comprehend the secrets that they hold.” Possibly in rural communities, the ordinary barn does not hold the extraordinary draw it does for city-folk like us. If you were to ask us why we chose Apple Hill to live and work on our organic farm it is most definitely because we fell in love with our stone house and the three barns and not necessarily in that order. At Springfield Farm, we are fortunate to have three examples of barn architecture from the large dairy barn, the mid-sized Drive Shed and the smaller shingled Chicken Coop. While my barn-love went immediately to the large dairy barn, it is the Drive Shed that holds the most promise for our future operation as an AgriTourism destination and equally as an outstanding example of barn architecture having withstood well over 100 years of use and weather.

Article content There is something awe-inspiring in standing inside these barns and looking upwards at the hand-chiseled beams and trusses. One can imagine the day that the barn was raised and the men that climbed precariously to lift each truss in place without the assistance of modern machinery and safety precautions. In South Glengarry, the go-to barn restorers are Hamelin’s Restoration and co-owner Bob Hamelin provided his insights on barns in our region during a recent interview: “From the point of view of someone who has had the privilege of being part of several barn preservation projects in SDG over the last 24 years, in and around Glengarry, my brother and I have earned the reputation of being the old barn brothers. We regularly receive calls to come have a look at an old barn or granary to give our humble opinion on its condition. I never pass up the opportunity to visit a neighbour who has concerns about his aging barn. Usually the conversation starts with we would like to save it, but we aren’t sure it’s worth it…” Barns were a must have for our ancestors in Glengarry. For me it was my grandparents. They needed their barn to survive and to feed their family. The barn was part of the family, it was part of daily life. They stuck with it through the good times and the hard times. Part of the enjoyment I get when visiting a barn is piecing together the story it tells — changes that were made over the years, efforts to patch up damage when money was scarce, ingenious methods to hold something up when you could only use what you had available on hand, renovations made to accommodate new equipment when you had a good year… It reminds me that I’m not the first to work on the barn and hopefully not the last.

Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Article content A testimony to the respect an old barn can inspire is when I think back about some of the most extensive restoration projects I have done with clients from the city, Montreal or Toronto, who purchased property in SDG. Several of them confided in me that if there hadn’t been an old barn on the property, they probably wouldn’t have bought it. Funny thing — these people had very little use for the barn, but they were so impressed with the structure, and they imagined the history behind it, and they imagined that maybe one day they would use it for something too…They were convinced it was worth it. I feel we should save our last barns — it is worth it. For me saving doesn’t necessarily mean a full restoration, saving could just mean hiring a qualified person to patch the roof, or brace a failing timber, fix a section of crumbling stone wall… Just care enough to save it for the time being. Who knows what the future holds, you might need that barn yet! And Hamelin’s perspective is shared by Stratford Architect, Krista Hulshof Duynisveld, Veld Architecture Firm and Co-Founder, Ontario Barn Preservation Society when she states: “Barns contribute to our cultural rural heritage landscape. They are important and iconic landmarks in the countryside. Much like in the UK, where your mind’s picture is that of small farms, with brown brick buildings and hedge rows, barns are part of their preservation plan to maintain their iconic landscape. They contribute to agritourism. Their simple shape and form is so embedded in our culture that we teach children that a barn looks like a red heritage barn, not a long low modern barn!”

Article content There is a lot to learn about the vernacular development of communities. The barn types and construction tell us a lot about the heritage of the people there. I think this type of research can really contribute to the revitalization of rural communities. The ecology of settlement, and construction is fascinating. It makes me very sad when one (barn) goes missing as I drive familiar routes. I feel a hole in the landscape where it no longer stands. They are disappearing faster than I would like, that is why, despite my time constraints with a small family and growing architecture practice, I couldn’t wait any longer to start the Ontario Barn Preservation group and begin an inventory of barns across Ontario. Thankfully, in South Glengarry, as well as in the rest of SDG, there is growing support and interest for the preservation and re-purposing of barns. Through the COVID-lens, the opportunity is upon us as a community to collect an inventory of our barns, those with significant heritage or purpose, those with owners who are concerned for the future of their barns and those that possibly could be moved to a local park area and preserved for generations to come. We should not want to miss an opportunity to become an AgriTourism destination with the added attraction of hosting barn tours and heritage talks. And, as a community we should be cautioned by Toronto’s tale of demolishing the artistry of their buildings for the cause of modernization. Are we rural or urban? Why not make your next COVID-19 project a Sunday drive down memory lane and through our beautiful fall countryside to find that barn worth saving! M. Eleanor McGrath is a member of the Standard-Freeholder’s community editorial board.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

188,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/boosting-education-for-greener-forests/,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Boosting Education for Greener Forests,"With every new forest fire or flood, and with every new report on the loss of wildlife or increase in desertification, we are reminded that we urgently need greater attention and efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the world’s forests. Fewer natural disasters, a more stable climate, healthier people, and stronger economies are just some of the benefits that we stand to gain from helping forests to thrive.

But do we know enough about the world’s forests to take care of them properly?

There is growing international concern over the quality and availability of training and education needed both to prepare those whose daily work and decisions most closely impact the sustainable management of forests, and to inform new generations who will look after forest resources in the future.

We can only guess at how many children these days dream of being a forester when they grow up – likely too few. For the sake of our forests, we have to turn this situation around.

We need talented students to enter forest education programmes. We need well-trained forest managers and policymakers. We need to provide more opportunities for informal training and continuing education for forest communities and forest owners and businesses. And we need to reach the broader public.

After all, there is important work to do.

Internationally agreed targets for improving lives and protecting the planet recognize the vital importance of forests, which provide livelihoods for over a billion people, including more than 2,000 indigenous cultures.

SDG 15, for one, aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

Other SDGs, such as those concerned with clean water (SDG 6) and the elimination of hunger and poverty (SDGs 2 and 1), depend to a great extent on the sustainable management of forests and urban green spaces.

To ensure that forests fulfil their potential in helping to achieve many development goals, including SDG 13 (climate action), we need to enrich forest education and inspire a new generation of forest managers. This is no easy task.

Heads of forestry from across the world are meeting online for the 25th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Committee on Forestry and 7th World Forest Week. Here, FAO and international partners are unveiling details of an assessment of forest education being conducted across six regions.

The first of its kind, the survey will gather comprehensive information on where, how, and how well forest education is being taught, from primary and secondary schools to technical and vocational institutions and universities.

The survey (open for responses until 31 October) is part of an ambitious project led by FAO, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO). The project, funded by the German government, aims to enhance forest education at national and local levels, and to address the considerable deficiencies in forest education in many parts of the world.

There are several ways we can try to achieve this. Providing easy access to information on forest education and to learning materials, including through web-based platforms, will expand the opportunities of forest-related learning to a far wider audience.

And instilling young children with an appreciation of forests, the many benefits they bring, and the need to manage them sustainably is also key to inspiring the next generation of foresters.

For this last reason, Germany is also supporting an FAO project to bring targeted forest education to schoolchildren aged 9-12, starting with a pilot lesson series tailored for Tanzania and the Philippines. The interactive lessons are designed to help children understand how forests help combat climate change and contribute to food security, lives, and livelihoods.

Forests are the most biologically diverse ecosystems on land, home to the majority of terrestrial species of animals and plants. If forest education remains insufficient, outdated, and deteriorating in many places, we will struggle to keep pace with changing societal demands on forests and increasing pressures on forest resources.

We need to improve forest education – and more widely, public understanding of forests and forestry – to help to prepare current and future generations to do a better job of protecting land and water resources, biodiversity, and livelihoods.

The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

Fully traceable sustainable seafood;

Decarbonized shipping (“set sail for zero”);

Harnessing ocean electricity;

Mapping the ocean; and

Ending waste entering the ocean.

During the review event, five CEO Roundtables addressed these tipping points. The review resulted in an Outcome Document of the 2020 CEO Roundtables on Ocean, identifying actions business can take to advance the five areas. On sustainable seafood, the outcome document recommends: contributing to standardize traceability data, harmonize standards and promote interoperability of traceability platforms through the seafood value chain; and increasing the recognition of seafood in the climate and food agendas.



On decarbonizing shipping, recommendations include: providing incentives to develop and scale up low- or zero-carbon fuels, and support transparency and financial capacity; engaging with governments and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in setting up a global research and development fund and calling for further policy action; and sharing best practices regarding technology for zero-emission vessels.



On harnessing ocean energy, the document highlights action areas related to: developing a framework for global strategic planning by governments, in dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and increasing standardization of the industry and setting up global certifications and key performance indicators.

On ending waste entering the ocean, the document calls for: defining the “rules of the game” such as through dependable regulations for the private sector, to facilitate greater public-private collaboration to end ocean plastic; and determining the institutions needed to rapidly scale plastic pollution solutions across countries, as well as funding them.



On mapping the ocean, the outcome document recommends: conducting a gap analysis to take stock of ongoing ocean data initiatives, and data and information needs; and identifying enabling factors and the necessary means to implement them, including support for developing countries, in collecting, sharing, and using ocean data.

On delivering on the Decade of Action, participants identified barriers and actions for business and governments to realize the ambitions highlighted in the Ocean Stewardship 2030 report. SDG 14 (life below water) addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Four of the targets of SDG 14 are due to be achieved by 2020.

The report titled, ‘The Human Cost of Disasters: An Overview of the Last 20 Years: 2000-2019,’ was issued on 13 October – the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The report serves as a reminder to countries of their commitments under the Sendai Framework, to enact national and local DRR strategies by 2020, and highlights the urgency of taking action on climate change.

The report finds that 7,348 major disaster events occurred between 2000-2019, killing 1.23 million and affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), and resulting in USD 2.97 trillion in economic losses. This represents an increase over the previous twenty-year period, during which 4,212 natural disasters killed 1.19 million and affected 3.25 billion people and caused USD 1.63 trillion in economic losses. A significant portion of the increase was driven by a rise in climate-related disasters, like extreme weather events such as floods and storms, which nearly doubled from 3,656 to 6,681. Shifting rainfall patterns and greater precipitation variability also contribute to the increase by placing the 70% of global agriculture that is rain fed, and 1.3 billion people dependent on it, at significant risk.

Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century.

The report recommends that countries improve disaster risk governance by strengthening vision, plans, guidelines, funding, and cross-sectoral coordination. While the report credits improvements to early warning systems and disaster preparedness and response for “a reduction in loss of life in single-hazard scenarios,” it highlights the “increasingly systemic nature of disaster risk.” Events’ overlap and interplay with other risk drivers, including poverty, climate change, population growth in hazard-exposed areas, uncontrolled urbanization, and biodiversity loss, expose the need to further strengthen disaster risk governance, the report notes. The report warns that inability to understand and manage systemic risk jeopardizes the achievement of the Sendai Framework and the SDGs.

To mark the International Day, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for DRR Mami Mizutori also held a public online conversation. The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote coherence between DRR and climate change adaptation in national strategies for DRR and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Espinosa stressed the need to enhance “efforts to address climate change and help build resilience to it.”

Mizutori called for “an integrated approach which recognizes the increasingly systemic nature of risk and how climate interacts with other drivers of risk.” “Coherence between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction is a defining issue for disaster risk governance in the 21st century,” she said.

The researchers divide the suggested interventions into three focus areas:

On the farm—including training for farmers, developing climate-resilient crops, and improving livestock feed (USD 9 billion);

Food on the move—ensuring food can get from the farm to market, through investments in storage, transport, and other infrastructure (USD 2 billion); and

Empower the excluded— measures to ensure the poorest are included, such as steps regarding social protection spending or training for rural youth (USD 3 billion).

This Ceres2030 project was led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). The researchers used two interlinked research approaches to develop their findings. The first involved the development of a machine-learning tool to analyze over 500,000 published reports and articles. This tool helped the team of 78 researchers from 23 countries to summarize the evidence from over 20 years of agricultural development literature. The second part of the research involved economic modelling. The researchers created a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to show how much it would cost to end hunger, increase incomes and protect the climate by 2030.

The proposed additional USD 14 billion per year until 2030 would represent a doubling in the amount of aid currently given for food security and nutrition each year. The researchers note that it must be accompanied by an additional USD 19 billion a year from low- and middle-income countries’ own budgets.

The research findings support an integrated approach, recognizing that “agricultural interventions are more effective with a population that enjoys at least a minimum level of income, education, with access to networks and resources such as extension services and robust infrastructure.” The research also revealed that it is more effective to create integrated portfolios of interventions rather than to support improvements in isolation from one another.

Regarding women’s empowerment, the researchers indicate that the evidence base is sparse, due to the fact that only 10% of the papers reviewed considered gender differences in the outcomes of the interventions.

The researchers organize their 10 key recommendations for donor governments based on the three focus areas for interventions, as follows.

Empower the excluded:

Support participation in farmers’ organizations

Invest in vocational programs for rural youth that offer integrated-training in multiple skills

Scale up social protection programs to help create a bridge for people living in poverty to find productive jobs

On the Farm:

Invest in information and training, particularly for women, to increase the uptake of new technologies

Ensure new environmentally-friendly farming methods are also economically viable

Support the adoption of climate-resilient crops

Increase research on how to help small-scale producers in water-scarce regions

Target improvements in the quantity and quality of livestock feed to small and medium-sized commercial farms

Food on the Move:

To reduce post-harvest losses, look beyond the storage of cereals to also focus on other food groups and other parts of the food value chain

Invest in the infrastructure, regulations, services and technical assistance needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that supply or buy from small-scale farmers

The findings from the review of literature were published by Nature Research in a new research collection of peer-reviewed journal articles.

The Standards aim to meet the need for clear guidance and fill a knowledge gap for businesses seeking ways to make a positive impact. The Standards provide a common language to help private equity, venture capital, and other funds in private markets achieve social and/or environmental impact through their investments. The Standards were developed by the UNDP initiative ‘SDG Impact,’ along with industry experts. SDG Impact seeks to empower investors and businesses to support and authenticate their contributions towards achieving the SDGs.

In launching the Standards, Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, SDG Impact, said they will help focus approximately USD 4 trillion toward sustainable investments and solutions that can address challenges related to health, poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner highlighted the private sector’s role as a ‘first responder’ to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the provision of technology, innovation, skills, services, and employment, saying the private sector can now also play a critical role in building back better.

The Standards are:

focused on impact management and decision making, and emphasize transparency and governance;

flexible so they can be used by funds of any size, at any stage of development, and at any location;

grounded in existing principles, and provide context for applying other tools and frameworks, including metrics, taxonomies and reporting frameworks; and

In many parts of the world, autumn is the time to gather the harvest and count our blessings. This year’s trials and tribulations have taught us that while we can count on blessings bestowed by other humans to overcome the COVID-19 crisis, we are wholly dependent on blessings bestowed by nature to survive and flourish.

The efforts to suppress the pandemic have limited our daily activities beyond mere inconvenience. They also made us realize that our lives are supported by a large number of essential personnel, including those who grow and deliver our food.

And the bigger truth that emerged from the pandemic is that human health is interlinked with the health of the planet. When we overstep the boundaries of nature’s tolerance, we open the gates for such unmitigated disasters as zoonotic diseases.

As humanity grows larger and wealthier, so does its demand for land to produce food and accommodate urban development. Almost three quarters of planetary land’s surface has already been transformed from its natural state, and the pace of conversion is accelerating, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the very foundation that supports our existence.

Land provides more than 99.7% of our calories. To feed the global population that is projected to reach ten billion by 2050, an extra 593 million hectares of agricultural land, an area nearly twice the size of India, will be required. If land conversion for agriculture continues at the current rate, only 10 per cent of land will be left in its natural state by 2050.

The good news is that while healthy land is finite in quantity, changes in consumer and corporate behaviors together with more efficient land use planning and management can help us meet the demand for essential goods and services without compromising our stock of productive land resources.

To protect ourselves, we must work together with nature. Land degradation neutrality is an international commitment (SDG Target 15.3) where countries work together to stop, prevent and reverse the loss of productive land. Already, 90 out of the 124 countries committed to achieving this goal have set voluntary national targets which amount to over 400 million hectares of land restoration. Land degradation neutrality is a framework that policymakers can use to address vulnerabilities in the global, regional and national economies exposed by the pandemic to address land degradation, food insecurity, sustainable development well-being and climate targets.

Healthy land is a safety net for everyone, but especially for such vulnerable groups as rural women and youth who rely on land for their livelihood. As we are gearing up for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the UN Food Systems Summit, we have a tremendous opportunity to invest in a healthy and sustainable relationship with nature, to grow, nourish and sustain not just ourselves, but our environment, as the World Food Day 2020 slogan proclaims. It is our new social contract for nature.

At home in Mauritania, we say “If you watch your pot, your food will not burn.” We can no longer accept the reality where over 820 million people are undernourished while one-third of all food produced each year is lost or wasted. Our inefficient consumption and production are a threat to the planet’s health and to our own future. We need to watch our pot, so that no one goes hungry today, with plenty of good food left over for tomorrow.

During the last three weeks, the following countries have indicated their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR):

Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, Nicaragua, and San Marino, for their first VNRs;

Cabo Verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Japan, Namibia, and Tunisia, for their second VNRs; and

Colombia, for its third VNR.

The following 30 countries had already expressed an interest as of 30 September 2020:

First-time presenters: Angola, Bolivia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, and Myanmar;

Second-time presenters: Bahamas, Bhutan, Chad, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Zimbabwe; and

Third-time presenters: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has indicated that no more than 42 countries will be able to present VNRs during HLPF 2021, due to time constraints.

An informal “group of friends” made up of UN Member States, established in 2019, will support the countries presenting VNRs in 2021. The group is coordinated by the delegation of Mexico to the UN.

The 2021 session of the HLPF will convene from 6-15 July under the auspices of ECOSOC. It will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ HLPF 2021 will review nine SDGs in depth:

Goal 1 (No poverty);

Goal 2 (Zero hunger);

Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing);

Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth);

Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities);

Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production);

Goal 13 (Climate action);

Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and

Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

One outcome of the HLPF is expected to be a ministerial declaration adopted at the end of the ministerial segment. At the 2020 HLPF, governments did not reach agreement on the ministerial declaration. UN Member States had attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration leading up to the HLPF, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were unable to finalize negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that if the meeting had taken place in person, governments could have voted on the draft, but “in the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was reached.

In September 2020, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, but the Council did not adopt it. ECOSOC President Munir Akram indicated that he would to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

Akram has explained that notwithstanding the lack of agreement on a Ministerial Declaration, in the HLPF discussions, Member States:

Expressed their firm commitment to a multilateral response to COVID-19;

Stressed that vulnerable countries must not be left behind in the recovery;

Called for adequate financing, debt relief and debt waivers to be provided, particularly for low- and middle-income countries; and

Acknowledged that once developed, a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone and everywhere, rich or poor, at affordable prices.

He said governments expressed that the means of implementation for the SDGs must be strengthened to meet both the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda, and the need for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited, in particular, financing, sustainable infrastructure and investment, international trade, science and technology, capacity building and partnerships.

The Strategy was launched in June 2019 in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

The Strategy aims to enable the UN system to support the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the SDGs, the Agenda for Humanity prepared for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy will be implemented for five years and then reviewed and updated as needed.

The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.

The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.

Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”

Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.

The UNGA’s Third Committee (social, humanitarian, and cultural issues) is considering a draft resolution on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/C.3/75/L.9).

The Access2Markets portal enables firms to look up information on tariffs, taxes, rules of origin, product requirements, customs procedures, trade barriers, and trade flows statistics for imported and exported goods. Developed in response to requests from stakeholders for information on trade agreements and duty discount eligibility, the portal helps break down the EU’s trade agreements with more than 70 countries – and the rules of each – into practical information that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can more easily access and understand.

A European Commission press release highlights that, while small businesses represent 88% of all EU exporters and support an estimated 13 million jobs, their exports account for a third of EU exports. Accordingly, the release emphasizes, “global markets are an important source of growth for European small and medium-sized companies” and that meeting small businesses’ needs in the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.

For exporters who encounter trouble, the portal features a set of tutorials and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that guide users through the process. Where trade barriers or other obstacles are observed, a dedicated contact page allows users to submit a query to the Directorate-General for Trade of the European Commission.

The portal also delivers the trading conditions to import goods to the EU. For importers, the portal features product codes (harmonized system, or HS, codes) and information that determines what import duties and national or local taxes need to be paid on which products and in which jurisdictions.

The portal was presented at an event titled, ‘The Road to Recovery: Empowering Small Businesses to Trade Internationally.’ European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis described the tool as a “one-stop-shop” that “will help European firms to make the most of the EU’s network of trade agreements and get the best access to the markets, products and inputs they need to grow and stay competitive.” [European Commission News Release] [Access2Markets Portal]","The European Commission has launched an online portal to help companies in the region overcome obstacles to accessing global markets and export their products to over 120 countries.

The webinar took place on 16 September 2020 with the participation of 400 experts and actors in the area of chemical safety.

In an overview of the eChemPortal, Valérie Frison and Sally De Marcellus, OECD, recalled that it was developed in collaboration with the European Chemicals Agency and with government contributions, and launched as a prototype in 2007 to contribute to the sharing of knowledge, information, and data priority of the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The new website was launched in February 2020 with an improved design and user experience.

The OECD representatives said the portal: enables searches by substance identification, chemical properties and effects, and classifications; searches data from multiple sources simultaneously; provides direct free access to information; and describes the type of review data have undergone. Information from third-party data sources supports health and environmental decisions concerning chemicals management for all stakeholders regardless of geography or purpose.

The portal includes approximately 800,000 substance records from 34 databases of authorities and international organizations regarding chemicals, pesticides, and biocides. The number of data sources participating in eChemPortal is continuously increasing. Over four million searches were conducted in 2019 by users from industry, government, academics and the general public.

In an exchange of country experiences, Gerlinde Knetch, German Environment Agency (UBA), said UBA prioritizes chemicals that pose the greatest risks but there are gaps in the portal’s data and information in this regard. However, the portal represents a good example of bringing all databases together in a ‘one-stop shop.’ She highlighted the April 2020 launch of the SAICM Knowledge Platform, and the portal’s contribution to the platform’s data and information component.

Jake Sanderson, Environment Canada and member of the steering group for the eChemPortal, highlighted the inclusion of two Canadian databases in the portal. He noted his government’s frequent use of the portal, which he said is internationally recognized as the repository for chemical information used by regulatory authorities for risk assessment and prioritization. He stressed the importance of data quality and reputation, and increased participation of developing countries, and suggested that the portal could offer more collaboration opportunities between regulators.

Representing industry and academic perspectives, Violaine Verougstraete, Eurometaux (non-ferrous metals producers and recyclers in Europe), addressed trends in Europe, including the EU Green Deal, which, she said, all lead to a less toxic future. She mentioned the revision of measures to address pollution from large industrial installations, and said industry should view chemicals management, which is also about value chains and downstream users, as a global issue.

On students’ use of the eChemPortal, Verougstraete said students welcomed the number of databases included in the portal, but stressed the need to know what is behind the data and whether the data are reliable. In addition, they said common formatting would be helpful, noting possible confusion when assessing data from different databases.

During the question and answer session, panelists suggested that OECD provide hands-on training and video tutorials on use of the portal, and said potential data sources could undergo a review process before being included in the portal.

The OECD representatives said the portal: enables searches by substance identification, chemical properties and effects, and classifications; searches data from multiple sources simultaneously; provides direct free access to information; and describes the type of review data have undergone.
Information from third-party data sources supports health and environmental decisions concerning chemicals management for all stakeholders regardless of geography or purpose.
The number of data sources participating in eChemPortal is continuously increasing.
She mentioned the revision of measures to address pollution from large industrial installations, and said industry should view chemicals management, which is also about value chains and downstream users, as a global issue."

Panelists focused on ways to facilitate dialogue among researchers, policymakers, and communities to advance sustainability goals in the areas of food systems and land use, urbanization, and health.

The conference themed, ‘Science for a Sustainable Future,’ took place virtually on 8 October. Researchers came together with UN officials, government representatives, civil society leaders, experts, and policymakers to discuss how by working together we can “solve our most critical sustainable development challenges” and achieve the targets set out in the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Ahead of the conference, Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN President and Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, US, and Magdalena Skipper, Editor-in-Chief, Nature, issued a joint statement warning that our progress on the SDGs “lags far behind,” with the COVID-19 pandemic exposing the gaps between the latest scientific developments and policymaking. Highlighting “increasingly frequent zoonotic diseases,” climate change, biodiversity destruction, and “unprecedented” income and wealth inequalities among today’s challenges, the statement identifies the need to find a more inclusive path to solving problems that brings together scientists and technologists with policymakers and stakeholders, “listens across the generations,” and includes under-represented and marginalized voices.

Opening the event, Sachs said deep transformations are needed to address multiple global challenges to sustainable development and establish shared prosperity, social justice, environmental sustainability, and decent governance. He called for: technological pathways to sustainability that improve well-being and align with sustainable development; engaging natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, and human sciences in an interdisciplinary manner; engaging multiple stakeholders, including science and engineering communities, policymakers, and civil society; and enabling a better informed public to be “carriers of the ethics of the common good,” informed by science.

Guido Schmidt-Traub, SDSN Executive Director moderated a panel discussion on food systems and land use.

Michael Obersteiner, University of Oxford, highlighted the need to “bend the curve” on biodiversity. He outlined the role of quantitative assessments in bringing together stakeholders and establishing trust among them. Obersteiner said bringing local implementation to the global level through knowledge networks and feedback loops is key to accelerating transitions.

Jessica Fanzo, Johns Hopkins University, described the Food Systems Dashboard that brings together data on 175 food systems indicators. She said researchers need to better communicate their findings to policymakers, with studies integrating multiple perspectives.

Jillian Campbell, CBD, highlighted the importance of building a monitoring framework for a post-2020 biodiversity framework. She stressed the need to do more to “convince the public.”

Ashish Kothari, Environmentalist and Founder of Kalpavriksh, India, emphasized the need to engage custodians of biodiversity in decision making and establish forums where hybrid knowledge systems can be built. He stressed the need for bottom-up approaches to biodiversity management and conservation.

During discussion, panelists outlined the role of data in supporting poor countries’ efforts in the land-use sector, the need for different systems of knowledge, and the need to protect biodiversity to prevent future “zoonotic spillovers.”

Mark Fischetti, Scientific American, moderated a session on urbanization. Panelists identified challenges to sustainable urbanization, provided examples of where science made a fundamental contribution, and highlighted lessons from the global South.

Chan Heng Chee, Ambassador-at-Large, Singapore, and Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at Singapore University of Technology and Design, highlighted Virtual Singapore – a three-dimensional (3D) city model tool that helps conduct virtual experiments such as planning for solar energy generation and safe cycling routes. She stressed the need to involve citizens in making cities “more livable and more lovable.”

Aromar Revi, Indian Institute for Human Settlements, identified the need to balance opportunities of urbanization against poverty and risk, and highlighted the potential of urbanization to accelerate post-COVID-19 recovery in India.

Susan Parnell, University of Bristol, urged focus on building institutions to deliver sustainable urbanization. She underscored the need to understand micro-processes and build a “cohort of people” committed to sustainable cities. Parnell warned against the “one science fits all” approach, decoupled from ethics and robust methods.

Luis Hernán Sáenz, Cómo Vamos Cities Network, Colombia, highlighted the Urban Footprint study and the Multidimensional Urban Poverty Index. He called for promoting more effective governance in line with SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals) by including citizen science to leave no one behind and improve evidence-based decision making.

A panel session on health, moderated by Amy Maxmen, Nature, focused on the role of science and policy in achieving SDG health targets, and lessons learned from the COVID-19 response.

Chikwe Ihekweazu, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, called for mechanisms to push science to answer pressing questions rather than letting it “trickle down” into policymaking.

John Reeder, World Health Organization (WHO), urged researchers to provide tailored responses to the questions policymakers are asking, focusing on the specific context. He said scientists need to articulate priorities that are translatable into real public health impact.

Miriam Were, Champions for an AIDS-Free Generation, pointed to the lack of people’s perspectives in discussions on science and policymaking, and urged focus on community access to basic health services.

David Heymann, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, highlighted the importance of communicating scientific findings to those affected by their impacts.

Panelists further highlighted the need to: continue to inspire young people to choose science as a career path; and promote mentoring programs that pair researchers in industrialized and developing countries throughout the project cycle and beyond.

In closing, Skipper and Schmidt-Traub highlighted key takeaways, including the need for strong engagement with people and communities, the importance of data availability and access to improve strategies for bringing scientific communities and data users together, and the need to “cut across silos” in communicating scientific findings. Skipper said a white paper based on these outcomes will provide a set of recommendations on how to achieve better integration of science, policy, and community.

Cities are responsible for 70% of global energy consumption and 80% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as participants were reminded by Christoph Heusgen, Permanent Representative of Germany.

The meeting convened on 23 October 2020 under the auspices of the Daring Cities Forum. Daring Cities is a series of virtual events aimed at “urban leaders taking on the climate emergency.” It is taking place from 7-28 October 2020.

Multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism.

Speakers discussed the ICLEI Blueprint, a proposal for “multilevel collaboration in the age of inclusive multilateralism,” in the words of Frank Cownie, Mayor of Des Moines, US, and ICLEI Vice President and spokesperson to the UN. Cownie said the Blueprint calls for local and regional governments to be at the heart of the “new UN.” The Blueprint is built on four “cornerstones”:

Global engagement through annual high-level consultations with the Chief Executives of the UN System;

Regional engagement through increased collaboration between the UN Regional Commissions and UN host cities;

National engagement with UN Country Coordinators through national associations; and

Local2030 hubs and local engagement, by mobilizing additional resources to champion local and regional governments engaged in the work of the UN.

Yunus Arikan, ICLEI World Secretariat, said the need for multilevel governance is increasingly being recognized within the UN system. Peter Lange, Foreign Federal Office, Germany, added that multilevel cooperation is a logical progression from multilateralism. Stefan Wagner, City of Bonn, stressed the importance of cities’ involvement in multilateral fora, especially the UN. Sabine Drees, Association of German Cities, called for increasing the visibility of sub-national movements.

Participants exchanged views on the various roles of a voluntary local review (VLR) of SDG implementation. Maimunah Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, said VLRs are a tool to: facilitate civic engagement in local decision-making; support the mainstreaming of SDGs in local plans and strategies; guide public investments; and facilitate connections and peer learning with other cities and regions. Shipra Narang Suri, UN-Habitat, added that VLRs can mobilize and galvanize action, in addition to being a monitoring tool.

Riina Jussila, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said VLRs can also support communication between levels of government. She described VLRs a “new means of SDG implementation.”

The meeting included a focus on the City of Bonn, Germany, which released its first VLR on 6 October 2020. The Mayor of Bonn, ICLEI President Ashok Sridharan, presented the VLR to participants. He said it uses 46 indicators, and is seen as a tool to engage and communicate with stakeholders.

Local officials shared insights from Bristol, UK, Catbalogan, Philippines, and Quelimane, Mozambique. Manuel de Araujo, Mayor of Quelimane, said his city was the first in Mozambique to devise a climate adaptation plan and has since shared its experience with other cities in the country.

UN-Habitat reported that it is providing guidance to cities on developing their VLRs, beginning with Florence, Italy, and Moscow, Russian Federation.

A website for the campaign from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint provides resources for raising awareness and regulatory action.

Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

The manufacture and sale of lead paint is still permitted in over 60% of countries, and is a source of lead exposure, especially for children and workers. Young children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure because lead affects the developing brain, potentially resulting in reduced intellectual ability. Paint with high lead levels are still available and used in many countries for decorative purposes, although alternatives without added lead are available.

Eliminating lead paint will help achieve SDG targets 3.9 (substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030) and 12.4 (by 2020, achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, and significantly reducing their release to air, water and soil to minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment).

ILPPW 2020 will take place from 25-31 October 2020, engaging governments, civil society organizations, health partners, and industry, all of whom are organizing campaigns throughout the week of action. ILPPW aims to: raise awareness about health effects of lead exposure; highlight the efforts of countries and partners to prevent led exposure, particularly in children; and urge further action to eliminate lead paint through country-level regulatory action.

The ILPPW website provides a range of materials to support campaign activities have been developed by the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint (Lead Paint Alliance). These include infographics, posters, web banners, graphics, and a social media kit. It also includes a list and description of registered events, as well as fact sheets, Questions and Answers, resources on the risk of lead and lead paint, and ways to eliminate lead in paint.

Thus far, registered events during ILPPW 2020 will take place in Australia, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam. Registered activities include rallies, drama and dance, school programmes, and media and advocacy events, including lobbying activities for national legislation on lead-free paint.

The various events aim to, inter alia:

strengthen or enforce existing lead paint laws;

increase consumer awareness about the health and environmental impacts of lead exposure, including on children;

increase public awareness and support for eliminating lead paint;

ensure draft lead paint laws are supported by stakeholders;

encourage implementation of new lead paint laws;

urge the paint industry to stop using lead-based ingredients in paints;

develop safe school standards without lead paint on buildings;

increase industry support to phase out the addition of lead to paint; and

convince policymakers and regulators to begin work on developing a law to eliminate lead paint.

Established in 2011, ILPPW is an initiative of the Lead Paint Alliance, which is jointly led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Alliance promotes the global phase-out of lead paint through establishing legally binding measures to stop the manufacture, import, export, distribution, sale and use of lead paints in every country.

202,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/escwa-tool-shows-costs-of-violence-against-women/,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ESCWA Tool Shows Costs of Violence Against Women,"The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) has released guidance on the costs of domestic violence to a state’s economy and its impact on public health. Such information enables policymakers to identify the systemic loss of a country’s economic potential, and revise budgets to support prevention and protection. SDG target 5.2 calls to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.”



The report estimates that 500,000 working days are lost to marital violence annually, as women exposed to domestic violence are typically less productive and tend to take more time off, resulting in an economic loss for them and the economy as a whole. Sexual violence can result in unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages and reproductive health issues.

Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The tool features case studies from Egypt, the UK, Viet Nam and Palestine. In Egypt, the study finds that approximately 5.6 million women experience violence at the hands of their husband or fiancé annually, and the cost for women and families due to violence is approximately LE 2.17 billion. The study reports that disseminating the findings has led to increased recognition of the impact of violence against women on the entire economy and increased advocacy, resulting in:

an increase in the Ministry of Planning’s budget for violence against women-related activities;

an increase in the number of female police officers; and

development of a new draft law on violence against women that is under consideration by parliament.

The UK case study finds that the total cost of domestic violence to society is approximately £23 billion, of which £3.1 billion is borne by the state through support to the criminal justice system, health system, social services, social housing, and legal aid bills to support victims. Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The case study on Viet Nam highlights how the survey results have contributed to increased awareness of the impact of domestic violence and enhanced service provision. UN Women and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have supported the Government of Viet Nam to pilot an ‘Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence,’ which features a referral system, health care and protection. The pilot also supports the police and criminal justice system to enhance services to survivors of domestic violence. Training has increased the expertise of government personnel and researchers working on domestic violence, positioning them to undertake future costing exercises, and to feature relevant questions in national statistical surveys.

A compilation of lessons learned from the case studies highlights key recommendations for conducting costing studies, given their potential impacts: devote enough time to the preparatory phase for a costing study, including engaging the government to ensure ownership of the findings and a commitment to implement recommendations; consider the study’s scope, including clear definitions of what is included and what age range is selected; employ innovative and participatory approaches, such as a case study of a particular service or area; design the questionnaire to ensure that the methodology is culturally appropriate; produce and disseminate robust estimates; and develop an advocacy plan and use the findings at the outset, such as developing an advocacy plan to target key government leaders and engaging the media to maximize dissemination of the findings and raise awareness among the public and policymakers.

The tool proposes steps for Arab states to cost domestic violence, including considerations related to ethical guidance, site selection, data availability, and methodology and type of costs.

The high-level event convened in the margins of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 30 September, in a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government and ministers joining virtually. The Summit focused on the theme, ‘Urgent Action on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development.’

The opening segment included a “fireside chat” between the heads of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). They described biodiversity as a “shock absorber,” and said the time to “pollute our way to wealth” has passed.

Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said degradation of nature spans economics, social justice, and human rights, and can result in geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Many expressed concern that none of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Speakers warned that biodiversity loss threatens food security, water supplies, and livelihoods, as well as our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events.

Munir Akram, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), said political will, not finance, is key to contain “economic greed” and “policy negligence.” UNGA President Volkan Bozkir called on Member States to use the Summit to build political momentum towards a post‑2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Kunming, China in 2021. “Kunming must do for biodiversity what Paris did for climate change,” said Bozkir, by placing the biodiversity discourse firmly on the political agenda.

A plenary session followed, during which participants highlighted the connections between biodiversity, societies, and economies.

Two Leaders’ Dialogues focused on addressing biodiversity loss and mainstreaming biodiversity for sustainable development, and on harnessing science, technology and innovation, capacity building, access and benefit-sharing (ABS), financing, and partnerships for biodiversity.

This year’s work will include negotiating the 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of the UN’s operational activities for development (QCPR).

On 5 October 2020, the Committee, chaired by the Permanent Representative of Nepal, held an in-person session to adopt its programme of work for the year. The Committee also began its general debate on the theme of ‘Building back better after COVID-19: Ensuring a more equitable global economy, inclusive societies and sustainable recovery.’

We must take full advantage of the improvements we have made to the UN development system, to help countries recover better from COVID-19.

The Chair said the Committee will focus on issues affecting groups of countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). He also highlighted:

the Food Systems Summit being planned for 2021,

the Committee will discuss the modalities for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028, through a high-level event convening from 22-24 March 2023, in New York, and

it is time to conduct the QCPR, which takes place every four years and was last conducted in 2016.

In a keynote address to the Second Committee, Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, said the international community cannot squeeze water from a stone: developing economies and emerging markets cannot find financial resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic without significant debt restructuring. He expressed support for the issuance of special drawing rights.

Stiglitz also called for multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes, such as by creating a minimum global corporate income tax at the level of 2%. He added that greening economies can be timely, targeted, labor-intensive, and provide good stimulus.

Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said COVID-19 stimulus packages will be most effective if they prioritize public investments that contribute to achieving the SDGs, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and digital infrastructure.

Member States speaking during the debate emphasized the need for stronger international cooperation to face the “seemingly endless cycles” of COVID-19, especially in States that lack recovery financing. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged “vaccine multilateralism” to ensure equitable, universal, and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Another delegate suggested considering vaccines and therapeutic treatments as global public goods.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) noted some government’s “retreat” from the development agenda and climate change commitments. She also noted the inability of SIDS to access available climate finance because of “cumbersome processes and competition with other better capacitated countries.”

Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) said “there should be no rollback of existing commitments,” and it is vital to promote full participation of people with disabilities, women and children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. He supported new approaches to addressing the debt crisis and maintain jobs, particularly in the LDCs. The general debate continues until 9 October 2020 in a virtual format.

Also during the Second Committee’s in-person meeting on 5 October, UN Deputy Secretary‑General Amina Mohammed’s provided a briefing on the 2020 QCPR, noting that it takes place at the outset of the Decade of Action for sustainable development.

Recalling that the previous QCPR in 2016 “paved the way for the deepest transformation in the history” of the UN development system, Mohammed reported that the UN has since established a new coordination system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda, including a funding compact with Member States. In May 2020, during the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, she said governments decided to move forward on other mandates set out in the 2016 QCPR, including to operationalize a new regional architecture, strengthen support to multi‑country offices (MCOs), and bolster independent system‑wide evaluations for accountability.

Mohammed said that now, to help countries recover better from COVID-19, “we must take full advantage of the improvements we have made” to the UN development system. She called on Member States to give strategic direction to this process through the 2020 QCPR, particularly in the following ways:

Additional resources are needed in priority policy areas, including climate change, economic transformation and employment, women’s empowerment, and digitalization;

At the country level, the UN is introducing integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs, and the QCPR can provide clarity on expectations;

Coherence between the UN’s pillars;

On leaving no one behind, the QCPR “can give visibility to those excluded and on the margins,” including persons with disabilities and women and girls. She said the process can also clarify Member States’ expectations for a recovery from COVID‑19 that is anchored in inclusive and green economies, and noted that greater investment is needed in data for evidence‑based decision‑making; and

Completing the “unfinished business” of the 2016 QCPR, such as meeting the targets of the funding compact.

In addition to deliberations on its official agenda items, the Committee will hold three other events. A joint meeting with ECOSOC will address ‘Developing sustainable infrastructure and utilizing science and technology in response to COVID-19,’ on 14 October. A virtual side event on ‘Disaster risk-informed and resilient COVID-19 recovery’ will take place on 15 October. An annual dialogue with the executive secretaries of the UN regional commissions is scheduled for 19 October.

Action on draft resolutions is expected to take place in November.

Uncategorized SDG Group: Leading Into The Next Normal Through the Power of Data & Analytics by Analytics Insight October 27, 2020

SDG Group is a Global Data & Analytics Consulting Firm, offering in-depth expertise that empowers its clients’ strategies to become data-driven enterprises and bridges the gap between data and business decisions.

With a global presence, the company’s mission is to transform data into better business decisions, making the results of its projects a core and sustainable differentiator for its clients. SDG Group believes in “Data As A Transformational Asset” (“D.A.T.A.”), meaning data is used as the basis for new ways of performing various functions and operating as a business.

The company has a technology-agnostic approach, which allows the firm to innovate its value proposition with the latest and best technologies to provide the ultimate data and analytics solutions in the market.

Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis

When the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world, SDG Group looked for opportunities to use its data and analytics expertise to help. They collaborated with global healthcare experts and used the latest technologies to develop, DocDot, a revolutionary AI-assisted remote diagnosis app, recognized by The World Health Organization (WHO) for being one of the most innovative digital health solutions worldwide. The app detects vital signs remotely to help healthcare professionals safely visit patients and enables the digital health taskforce to manage and monitor patients and customers through a Patient Management Dashboard.

SDG Group also collaborated with the Red Cross on its “Red Cross RESPONDS Plan.” The initiative takes action to address COVID-19 in all affected areas of society; emergencies, health, social inclusion, education, employment, and the environment. SDG Group deployed an Open Data Platform that made data centralized and current, and the actions of the Red Cross transparent to the public and key stakeholders.

Helping Clients Overcome New Challenges

In addition to assisting in healthcare and nonprofit organizations, SDG Group manages the pandemic’s impact on its clients. The company helps them create new strategies and solutions to thrive in the “next normal.”

A primary focus is moving data and analytics into the Cloud. SDG Group believes the Cloud is critical for reacting quickly to disruptions because it provides an agile, secure, scalable, and reliable way to extract data. The Cloud also enables its clients to focus more on getting value from data, instead of only spending time managing and maintaining infrastructure.

Another concentration related to the Cloud is Data Sharing. SDG Group believes that having a single data vision where there are no information silos is the most optimal way to address business challenges. The company facilitates Data Sharing within its clients and, in parallel, ensures they have reliable data and speak the same data language through effective Data Management and Data Governance practices.

Also, a Digital Analytics Strategy is more critical than ever now that digital channels are the only means for connecting with people and finding new business opportunities. SDG Group helps its clients discover new ways to reach their customers. With a customer-centric vision, the company developed SDG Eagle Digital Analytics, a solution that provides a comprehensive view of data from all channels.

The economy and recession are also concerns.

DPS, Gurugram, conducts webinar on parenting skills

Delhi Public School, Sector 45, Gurugram organised the Wellness Webinar Series 9.0 ‘Let’s Talk – Parenting’ to discuss effective parenting skills which help us as a society to nurture strong, responsible and happy children. The discussion was moderated by school director-principal Aditi Misra. The eminent panelists comprised psychologist and relationship therapist Vichitra Dargan Anand, counsellor Sonia Pillai as well as author and educator Rohit Kumar. The panel also included DPS Gurugram vice principal Santvna Thadani; dean, student welfare, Sapna Dhawan, and parents’ body representatives Sachin Chugh and Nipun Marya. The webinar was attended by 6,485 people and garnered 1,400 views on Facebook.

Aditi Misra initiated the discussion by greeting all the panelists and asking them to share one parenting lesson which they learnt from their parents and imparted to their children and another lesson which they didn’t carry forward. The discussions brought forth important lessons in parenting, like giving respect to all, involving children in important family decisions, perseverance, generosity and active listening skills etc,

While discussing the different styles of parenting, Anand said that it is her firm belief that building a child is like building a skyscraper with a strong foundation. Marya observed that parents should not compare their children with others as each child is unique. Pillai said parents must build a circle of trust with their children. The speakers emphasised various techniques of positive parenting in today’s time. Kumar said parents should be good role models for children. Chugh felt that as parents one must never forget to hug and cuddle one’s children. A very effective positive discipline tool that was explained by Kumar was – ‘no correction without connection’.

Thadani advised parents to be good listeners and love their children and Dhawan stressed on the importance of inculcating strong values. The discussion was concluded by a rapid-fire round wherein the panelists answered questions posed by the moderator. Misra thanked the panelists for sharing their insights.","Ahlcon International School, Mayur Vihar, celebrated the SDG-Fest 2020 on a virtual platform to mark the fifth anniversary of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with unprecedented fervour and zeal.

208,https://www.newagebd.net/article/120128/waste-management-in-sdg,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",newagebd.net,Waste management in SDG,"A New Age file photo shows a pile of wastes filling up a canal at Rasulpur at Kamrangirchar in Dhaka. — Indrajit Kumer Ghosh

PEOPLE use wide a range of goods for their livelihood, comfort and amenities. The use or consumption pattern of goods varies because of changes in the way of life, predominantly contributed by economic development, technological diversity and population growth. The goods that people use for sustenance are discarded as they reach the end of their use. Waste management comes at play in protect the environment to manage the discarded goods.

The goods that people use can be divided into two principal categories: solid and liquid. Different streams of wastes originate from these two categories. Streams of wastes like perishable household wastes, construction and demolition wastes, electronic and electrical wastes, rubber, metal, glass, plastic, hazardous medical wastes, etc originate from the solid waste category. Industrial effluent, grey water, black water, paints, chemicals, etc fall in the category of liquid waste. Wastes in each of these categories and streams have the potential to damage every fabric of the environment. To prevent any harmful effects, each waste stream is handled in different ways.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015 provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are an urgent call for action by all countries, developed and developing, in a global partnership. They recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all the while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The common purpose and objective of both waste management and Agenda 2030 are to protect the environment for human benefits. The goals that the Agenda 2030 adopted for a sustainable development involve a range of functions and activities. Those functions and activities are also found in waste management. The 3R — reduce, reuse and recycle — approach in waste management is recognised globally. It encompasses a series of activities with contribution to the environment and society. For example, reuse activities create jobs, save energy, cut disposal costs, reduce the use of virgin raw materials, reduce CO2 emission, extend life of landfill and reduce pressure on land.

Waste management value addition

Goal 1 has the target to ‘end poverty in all its form everywhere’ through the development of social protection systems with targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. Waste management prevents the emission of greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbon, CO2, etc which improves environmental degradation narrowing down the risk of human vulnerability to natural disaster. Waste management also prevents the pollution of water, another area of human vulnerability.

Goal 2 eyes ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. Food security is a global concern against the backdrop of the population growth and shrinking agricultural land which include cropland, forest, mangrove forest, river, lake, tea estate and salt span etc. Countries are losing agricultural land every year because of population settlement, infrastructure development, industrialisation, etc.

Food loss and waste annually contribute to 3.3 gigagrams of CO2 equivalent. If a fourth of the food loss or wastes across the globe could be avoided, it could feed 750 million people. Food loss and waste affect the food supply chain, lowering income for food producers and wholesalers, increase consumer cost for food and constrain the access of low income groups to food. Minimising food loss, which waste management compliments, can improve food security and environmental gains.

Goal 3 ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all in all stages. In Bangladesh, there is a large informal recycling sector in different streams of wastes. The glass recycling sector recycles about 180,000 tonnes of discarded container glasses every year. According to industry sources, the economic value of this quantity of discarded glasses at waste pickers’ level is estimated at Tk 180 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 1 a kilogram. The value of glass recyclables at the wholesaler level is estimated at Tk 450 million, with the aggregate sales rate of Tk 2.50 a kilogram. It is estimated that annually about 96,000 tonnes of plastic waste is recycled across the country. This plastic waste has Tk 288 million in economic value at the waste picker level. Recycling has created employment for thousands of people which gives them an earning.

Goal 6 ensures an available and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Leachate percolating from decomposing waste goes into surface and ground water systems, if not protected. Given the composition and character, municipal solid waste can contain 20–50 per cent of water which it releases as it decomposes. Leachates, if not treated, contaminate ground and surface water. Besides leachate, millions of litres of black water and industry effluents from households and factories are also released into the environment. These are elements of a potential contamination of surface and ground water and it happens quietly. For example, one gallon of paint can contaminate 10 million gallons of drinking water. Waste management requires the treatment of all liquid wastes before being discharged into the environment. This requirement has a direct contribution to ‘sustainable management of water and sanitation’. There are instances that large water body such as rivers, lakes, etc get ruined when ‘waste management’ does not work.

Goal 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Waste treatment technology producing biogas and power from waste provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces waste volume, mitigating pressure on land for waste disposal which can contribute to food security. Second, the residual of biogas can be converted into compost to use as soil stabiliser. Biogas from organic wastes or furnace oil from tyre recycling can be used as additional fuel in waste-to-energy plant where waste has low calorific value. Residuals in waste-to-energy plant, ie bottom ash, can be converted into slag and slag can be used in cement industry to produce bricks, slabs, etc, which can be used in construction works such as the preparation of road base, footpath, etc. The reuse of glass items from cullet consumes 40 per cent less energy than making new glasses from virgin raw materials on the grounds because cullet dissolves at a much lower temperature. Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66 per cent. Around 900 litres of oil, a person’s two months’ water use and two people’s energy consumption for a year, can be saved by recycling just one tonne of plastic wastes.

Goal 9 aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and fostering innovation. Waste management through the promotion of the reduction approach encourages industries to produce less waste in the production process where innovation is the key. Industry to sustain in the long term needs to have in-house waste management like effluent treatment plants to treat liquid wastes. Through the reuse approach, waste management promotes an extended use of product and also alternative use through recycling.

Goal 11 makes cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Human settlements in cities and towns cannot be safe with heaps of garbage on their front yard or backyard. Waste management through community activities can involve people to do their part of waste management for a safer living environment.

As countries develop, more urbanisation takes place and construction and demolition waste, a harmful component of waste stream, is on the rise. Generally, the largest part of construction and demolition material is concrete, which encompasses around 70 per cent of waste generated before recycling. There is a range of environmental and economic benefits in recycling concrete rather than dumping it in a landfill.

The benefits include cheaper source of aggregate, reduction in landfill space required for concrete debris, using recycled material as gravel that reduces the need for gravel mining and, increasingly, high-grade aggregate for road construction is available only at greater distances, increasing the associated economic and environmental cost impacts associated with the longer haulage distances versus using recycled aggregate.

Goal 12 targets a sustainable consumption and production pattern. Sustainable consumption and production is about the use of products and manufacturing process of products that will produce minimal waste, which invokes the 3R approach of waste management. The 3R approach minimises resource consumption in the level sufficient for basic need, which is the reduce component, use goods and materials until they can be repaired or fixed to perform its function recurrently, which is the reuse component, and reprocess the materials being discarded into new products, which is the recycle component. This approach increases resource efficiency, contributing to sustainable consumption and production. For example, it takes 1.5 tonnes of water, 22 kilograms of chemicals and 243 litres of fossil fuel to produce one computer. An extended use of a product can reduce the consumption of water, chemical and fossil fuel and also reduce waste generation. Its overall impact comes on environmental improvement.

Goal 13 encourages urgent action to combat climate change and its impact. As decay starts, waste emits methane, a greenhouse gas, impacting climate change. The emission of methane is visible in landfill during the dry season. Methane is also a cause of fire in the landfill. As waste burns, CO2 is generated. CO2 is another greenhouse gas. The contribution of the 3R approach to mitigating climate change is found in waste, energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land use change and forestry sectors. In the waste sector, methane emission is reduced by gas recovery in the landfill. Energy recovered from waste reduces emissions from fossil fuel. Reduction in food loss and waste is an action in the agricultural sector to combat climate change. Food loss and waste represent the wastage of resources, including the land, water, labour, and energy resource used to produce food. It strongly contributes to climate change because greenhouse gases are emitted during food production and distribution activities, and methane is released during the decay of food waste.

Goal 14 conserves and sustainably uses the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Goal 6, 12 and 14 are interlinked. An uneconomical consumption of materials in production and irresponsible discharge of waste combined with absence of waste management has not ensured the availability and sustainable management of water bodies like the River Buriganga, the River Turag and the River Balu. An irresponsible discharge of plastics in the world oceans threaten marine lives.

Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manages forests, combats desertification and halts and reverses land degradation and halts biodiversity loss. Activities embedded and innovations in the 3R approach have all potentials to address the issues stated in Goal 15 on Agenda 2030.

The SDGs are for public good to improve different facets of environmental sustainability. Goals are attached to human well-being and environmental improvement through a series of activities. A wide range of activities in waste management are naturally aligned with the SDGs. An improved waste management directly complements the achievement of the SDG. While 11 of the 17 goals get direct contribution, 6 receives indirect support from waste management.

After two deadlocked secret ballots today at County Council, the Mayor of South Glengarry came out on top when the winner’s name was drawn from a hat to settle the role.

Fraser, North Dundas mayor, had put his name forward as a candidate in the annual vote for warden at the County Council table, alongside the incumbent Prevost, South Glengarry mayor.

‘Warden’ is the title for the head of council at the upper-tier SDG municipal government. The position is not directly elected by the people but is instead decided each fall by the 12 local mayors and deputy mayors serving on the Cornwall-based council.

Today’s initial vote produced a 6-6 tie, a result replicated on a second try. So CAO Tim Simpson and Clerk Helen Thomson placed all of the ballots into a hat, and Thomson announced Prevost’s re-appointment after reaching in to decide the matter.

While it was the third time in recent memory a vote for warden has been decided this way, the result produced the first three-time warden in SD&G’s 170-year history.

“It is an honour to be named Warden of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry for a third time,” said Prevost, who first served in the position in 2000 before being returned to the role for a second time late last year. “COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the residents and businesses of SDG over this year. I look forward to meeting the challenges of 2021 and with the help of my colleagues around the council table, as well as administration, we will work to ensure a strengthened new year for everyone.”

Both contenders for the position agreed the prosperity of the United Counties was paramount in light of the global pandemic.

“I congratulate and look forward to working alongside Warden Frank Prevost, as well as my council colleagues, as we are all committed to doing our best for the residents of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry in the year to come,” said Fraser.

The provincial data was not updated on Monday due to the statutory holiday. It will be updated on Tuesday morning, with any changes reflecting what was provided by local public health units as of Monday afternoon. The province will also provided updated lists of cases disclosed within schools and child-care centres on Tuesday morning.

So far, October is outpacing all other months when it comes to the disclosure of new cases. From Oct. 1-11, 66 new cases have been confirmed within the EOHU, compared to a total of 72 cases confirmed in September. If new cases continue on the pace they are being confirmed this month, the EOHU could break 100 or more cases this month by Halloween.

The EOHU reported a new hospitalized case on Monday, bringing the total currently in hospital to four. At least one is being treated in Ottawa, where the others are being tended to has not been disclosed. None of the four is in an intensive care unit.

There are now three active outbreaks at congregated care settings within the EOHU, but the health unit’s outbreak page does not indicate where the third one is located. COVID-19 outbreaks are listed at Foyer St-Jacques Nursing Home in Embrun (started Sept. 14) and at the Residence Prescott-Russell (started Oct. 7).

The EOHU’s next scheduled briefing is on Tuesday afternoon.","The number of active cases is a bit higher than Friday, at 90, as the 15 new cases were offset by other cases being set as resolved by the EOHU.
All of the new cases since Friday afternoon’s EOHU update are located in Prescott-Russell and SDG, with cases added on Monday as follows: one each in Clarence-Rockland, Champlain, Hawkesbury, and South Glengarry; three in North Glengarry; and, two in Russell.
Nine newly confirmed COVID-19 cases were disclosed by the Eastern Ontario Health Unit on Thanksgiving Monday, bringing the number of new cases disclosed over the long weekend to 15.
The province will also provided updated lists of cases disclosed within schools and child-care centres on Tuesday morning.
From Oct. 1-11, 66 new cases have been confirmed within the EOHU, compared to a total of 72 cases confirmed in September."

Cornwall/SDG hospitals say they remain prepared for COVID-19 cases Back to video “We’ve taken a multi-layered approach to ensure our hospital can provide exceptional care for local patients – no matter the circumstance,” said Jeanette Despatie, CEO and president of Cornwall Community Hospital. Despatie referenced the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its passengers quarantined at Nav Centre last February, in noting CCH has been well-prepared for potential COVID-19 patients for many months, and that the hospital’s approach has always “been robust, and continues to evolve to meet the needs of patients during this challenging time.”

Article content Unlike in the early spring, area hospitals – and all of the facilities across Ontario – are dealing with COVID-19 while offering a lot of the regular services that had been suspended during the first wave. But the months of experience and opportunity to work at establishing safe processes for maintaining services – including diagnostic tests/procedures or outpatient surgical clinics – has been invaluable. Over the months since the pandemic began, Despatie said, CCH has provided staff and physicians with additional education and simulation training, as well as training in infection prevention and control measures. She said that, over the longer time period, the hospital has had the opportunity to purchase additional equipment required to expand patient capacity, should the situation worsen. “We’ve reconfigured our flexible spaces to identify up to a 30 per cent increase in bed capacity, should we need it,” Despatie said. “Fortunately, we’ve also been able to expand our supply of (PPE).” More On This Topic Cornwall, SDG hospitals to receive money for infrastructure upgrades Cornwall and area hospitals preparing to slowly resume regular service Plenty of COVID-19 capacity within SDG hospitals, for now At Winchester District Memorial Hospital, capacity hasn’t changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 late in the winter, and precautions and restrictions remain in place. Cholly Boland, the hospital CEO, said that, like all hospitals in the province, WDMH eventually restored outpatient and non-urgent surgical services, but that it did not alter the facility’s inpatient capacity.

Article content “Most of our surgical patients are admitted and discharged on the same day, and do not occupy an inpatient bed,” Boland said. Boland added the hospital has more people coming to its emergency department than was the case in the spring, and that “we’ve configured our waiting room and screening process to accommodate that increase.” And while Hopital Glengarry Memorial Hospital in Alexandria also is well-prepared and capable of treating patients with the COVID-19 virus, CEO and president Michael Cohen said there’s a very big difference between the spring and now for many hospitals in the region, in that the demand for inpatient beds “has never been greater. . . in the spring, the hospital system suspended elective activity in order to free up capacity and staff to respond to the pandemic. Provincially, elective activity resumed, and, at the same time, the wait for long-term care has never been higher. “I’ve been in the business for over 25 years, and I’ve never seen (Alternate Level of Care) numbers so high.” Cohen said that, regionally, over 700 patients are waiting for placement in hospitals. “Unfortunately, the (LTC) sector is suffering from outbreaks, staffing shortages and isolation requirements that limit and impede the flow of patients from hospitals,” Cohen said. “We’re just not able to access these beds as quickly as we once did. “Collectively we’re working with the province to develop temporary alternatives to get readily available beds into the system soon, which should bring welcome relief.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

214,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/oecd-launches-two-pilot-reports-on-city-approaches-to-sdgs/,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,OECD Launches Two Pilot Reports on City Approaches to SDGs,"The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched two pilot reports as part of its Territorial Approach to the SDGs program. OECD plans to launch an additional three reports at its upcoming roundtable on cities and regions for the SDGs.In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors note that the SDGs provide “a long-term vision and an integrated framework to rethink the ‘new normal’ through the lens of sustainability” and to engage local stakeholders in co-creating more resilient cities and regions. The two pilot reports focus on Bonn, Germany, and Kópavogur, Iceland.

The Bonn report recommends considering the transport needs of a growing and elderly population when promoting public transportation to reduce air pollution.

The city of Bonn has linked its 2030 Sustainability Strategy with the SDGs to address key challenges faced by the city and to manage trade-offs across economic, social, and environmental policy outcomes. The report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the Sustainable Development Goals in Bonn, Germany,’ shares how Bonn plans to provide affordable housing (SDG 11), expand and maintain green spaces (SDG 11), shift to clean forms of energy and transport (SDGs 7 and 13), and provide employment opportunities for all (SDG 8), particularly low-skilled workers (SDG 4). It reports that Bonn’s City Council declared a climate emergency in July 2019, and in November 2019 adopted a resolution to make Bonn climate-neutral by 2035.

The report recommends key actions to make the most of a territorial approach to the SDGs in Bonn, including:

Using the SDGs to strengthen the link between the climate agenda and the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, such as by managing the trade-offs between providing additional affordable housing and maintaining and developing green spaces, and by considering the transport needs of a growing and elderly population when designing measures to promote public transportation to reduce air pollution;

Continuing efforts to mainstream the SDGs in budgeting processes to ensure resource allocation to implement the Sustainability Strategy and the 2030 Agenda and to ensure policy continuity across political cycles;

Developing actionable, evidence-based guidance for policy decisions, building on Bonn’s sustainability reporting and OECD data on the city’s distance from the SDG targets;

Better leveraging the potential of the private sector to contribute to the SDGs; and

Fostering direct involvement of cities and municipalities in national processes for implementing, measuring and reporting on the SDGs.

Kópavogur, Iceland, has a high performance on many SDG targets, but progress on some environmental SDGs is hindered by car dependence and per capita municipal waste. The report titled, ‘A territorial approach to the Sustainable Development Goals in Kópavogur, Iceland,’ provides guidance on how the SDGs can help to address these and other challenges through an integrated approach. Specific recommendations include using the SDGs as a tool for public service motivation to attract new staff, creating a national-level Task Force to strengthen vertical SDG coordination, and using the SDGs as a budgeting tool to prioritize resources allocated to the strategic plans supporting the implementation of the local strategy.

The Third OECD Roundtable on Cities and Regions for the SDGs will convene from 16-17 November 2020, co-organized by the OECD and the County of Viken, Norway. It will focus on the theme, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs as a framework for long-term COVID-19 recovery strategies in cities and regions.’ Participants will discuss how the SDGs can help cities and regions shape and implement COVID-19 recovery strategies by sharing lessons, considering how to harmonize SDG measurement frameworks, and building on the OECD localized indicator framework, which measures the distance to the SDG targets for over 600 regions and 600 cities.

One session will discuss a policy brief titled, ‘OECD Policy Responses to COVID-19 in cities,’ that shares ten lessons for building back better in cities, related to clean mobility, public spaces, and circular economy, among other areas. Also during the roundtable, OECD will launch three additional reports on a territorial approach to the SDGs, focusing on Flanders, Southern Denmark, and Viken.

Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C scenario.

The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.

There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.

Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.

A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.

“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”

The Protocol is available for comment for one month, from 13 October till 13 November.

Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, launched by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020. The Framework was developed with 70 leading global investors representing USD 16 trillion in assets. [Publication: Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol] [UNEP FI Press Release]

216,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/survey-finds-surge-in-private-investment-needed-for-sdg-achievement/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Survey Finds Surge in Private Investment Needed for SDG Achievement,"A survey of the world’s top 300 investment firms finds that investment is not going where it is needed to achieve the SDGs: only 20% of firms are aware of the SDGs and only 13% of their USD50 trillion of investment is linked to the SDGs. The survey explores how to close the emerging market sustainable investment gap to achieve strong returns and significant, positive impacts.

Between July and August 2020, Standard Chartered surveyed the world’s top investment firms, with combined total assets under management (AUM) of more than USD50 trillion. The results show that:

Almost two-thirds of respondents’ AUM are currently invested in Europe and North America;

Asia makes up 22% of AUM;

Only 10% is invested in the Middle East, Africa, and South America combined; and

Currently, 68% of respondents’ investments are related to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure).

The company shared the findings in an interactive report titled, ‘The $50 Trillion Question,’ which argues that sustainable investment is gathering pace, as 81% of firms have moved beyond screening to a more integrated, focused approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment. However, this progress is not enough: SDG investment is “still trillions of dollars short of the capital needed to meet their 2030 target.” Further, the “vast proportion” of ESG strategies do not relate directly to meeting the SDGs; the report argues that conscious consideration on how impact can be delivered to meet the SDGs is critical for ESG investment to deliver on the 2030 Agenda.

The main barriers to emerging-market investment are reported to be: market volatility, bribery and corruption risk, government and interference in business, heightened political risk, and expected returns not justifying the increased use. On barriers to benchmarking investments against the SDGs, 55% of respondents said the SDGs are not relevant to mainstream investment, and 47% said that SDG investment is too difficult to measure. In addition, 66% said they do not make investments that contribute to the SDGs. At the same time, 50% responded that they plan to start measuring investments against the SDGs.

On tools and incentives, 63% of respondents said more SDG investment would be spurred by favorable tax treatment of SDG-linked investments, as well as more evidence that investing in SDGs will not lead to underperformance.

The report argues that the COVID-19 pandemic “has made the imperative to act even stronger.” The report suggests that the SDGs can become a strategic framework for simultaneously achieving returns and impact. According to 74% of investors surveyed, a green recovery that focuses on cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as part of a “build back better” approach is now a global priority. In addition, 61% said the COVID-19 crisis has encouraged their firm to direct investment towards a green recovery.

The report also features a section on how Standard Chartered is helping to close the SDG capital gap. In 2019, Standard Chartered launched the world’s first Sustainable Deposition, in which every dollar deposited is referenced against sustainable assets that support SDG delivery. Standard Chartered first highlighted the multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for private-sector investors to help achieve the SDGs in emerging markets in a report, ‘Opportunity 2020: The Standard Chartered SDG Investment Map.’ [Publication: The $50 Trillion Question] [Business Wire press release]","The survey explores how to close the emerging market sustainable investment gap to achieve strong returns and significant, positive impacts.

217,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-synthesizes-messages-from-47-vnrs-presented-in-2020/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,DESA Synthesizes Messages from 47 VNRs Presented in 2020,"The UN has released a synthesis report of the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) conducted in 2020. A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

In September 2020, DESA released a synthesis of the 2020 VNRs with a specific focus on the reported impacts of COVID-19 in each country.

The Forum convened in a virtual format from 11-13 November 2020.

Debates focused on the role multilateral action can play to enhance action in a number of areas, including: addressing challenges posed by climate change, new technologies, migration, and global inequalities; improving biodiversity governance; and strengthening South-South platforms. Dedicated sessions addressed, among other topics, drug policy and public health, conserving nature to avoid pandemics, city action towards a green and equitable recovery, supporting vulnerable populations during pandemics, and education in the post-COVID-19 era.

Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for fully integrating climate and environmental action into stimulus packages to rebuild sustainable and inclusive economies and societies. He proposed three “lines of action” to put the world on a trajectory towards limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels:

Mobilization of a “global coalition for carbon neutrality” in 2021 to “leap forward towards carbon neutrality,” while taking into account “the common but differentiated responsibilities of one and all”;

More preventive action, including through channeling more finance to adaptation; and

Enhancing private and public financing for climate action.

The Forum included the Finance in Common Summit where representatives from multilateral development banks (MDBs) explored pathways towards economic and social recovery while redoubling efforts to achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Private sector actors joined the business track of the Paris Peace Forum to improve the collective response and resilience to the pandemic, while reforming production and trade systems at the same time.

Several initiatives were launched during the Forum. The Ministerial Meeting of the Alliance for Multilateralism launched the ‘One Health’ High Level Expert Council, which will “aim to gather and disseminate reliable information on the links between human, animal, and environmental health in a context of biodiversity erosion.”

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) launched the OECD-UNDP Framework for SDG Aligned Finance to help public and private actors identify and prioritize investments that contribute to the SDGs.

The Paris Peace Forum is an annual event that focuses on governance solutions in the areas of peace and security, development, environment, new technologies, inclusive economy, and culture and education. It is organized with support from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the EU, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), among other partners.

The outcome will be sent to the upcoming fifth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA).

The fourth meeting of the ad-hoc open-ended expert group on marine litter and microplastics (AHEG-4) convened virtually from 9-13 November 2020. It was the final meeting of the AHEG, with the experts having completed their mandate from UNEA.

As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, at the opening of the meeting, officials drew attention to the impacts of COVID-19 on single-use plastics, noting in particular the burden on waste management posed by disposable masks and other personal protective equipment that contains plastic.

Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream” activities will be needed to prevent pollution.

Delegates discussed a stocktaking conducted by the Secretariat of current actions on marine litter and microplastics, and considered the effectiveness of current responses to the problem. The Secretariat found a predominance of “downstream” efforts that are performed at the national and sub-national level, and focused overwhelmingly on awareness-raising activities and beach-clean-ups. Almost unanimously, delegates agreed that “upstream activities” related to pollution prevention are going to be key to addressing this challenge.

The Group agreed to a Chair’s summary, which was hailed as a neutral and factual document and contained a “non-exhaustive list of response options to marine litter and microplastics.” They annexed the summary to the report of the meeting, which will be presented to delegates at UNEA-5. Delegates supported the summary as a balance of views shared during the entire AHEG process, acknowledging that the document was not a negotiated outcome. However, several reiterated their hope that the summary would include stronger language on the need to establish a negotiating process towards a new global agreement on plastic pollution.

UNEA-5 is expected to consider these options, including whether to endorse a global agreement, when it convenes virtually in February 2021.

This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

The Council discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tropical forests and timber, and debated whether to extend the treaty that governs the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).

As reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the Council session opened with the preliminary findings of an ITTO study on the impacts of the pandemic on the tropical forest sector and the tropical timber industry. The report notes that the entire timber and forest products sector was affected by severe drops in consumption, production, employment, and trade, but tropical timber and products were hit even harder.

“Many enterprises are failing, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, and unemployment, rising poverty, and reverse migration (from urban to rural) is putting new pressure on forests and their resources. Supply chains have been disrupted, and the resulting changes may completely reshape supply and value chains in the post-pandemic period. The bottom line, suggests the ITTO study, is that tropical timber may not recover until 2026,” according to ENB. One delegation noted the need for strong ITTO leadership over the next 12-24 months.

The Council also debated whether to extend the 2006 treaty that governs the ITTO, the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006, which is due to expire in December 2021. The treaty expires on 7 December 2021 unless the Council decides to extend, renegotiate, or terminate it.

ENB reports that delegates who spoke indicated support for extending the Agreement for another five years, but some Member States said they would need time to complete domestic and legal consultations before they could formally agree on such a decision. This decision was postponed until ITTC-57, which will meet just before the deadline for the treaty to expire.

The Council also adopted the ITTO Biennial Work Programme for 2021-2022, and decisions on:

the next phase of the ITTO’s New Financing Architecture, instituting a programmatic approach to financing and streamlined project cycle;

the extension of the current ITTO Strategic Action Plan (SAP) through 2021 so the ITTO Secretariat can prepare and present a new draft SAP; and

the selection of the next ITTO Executive Director.

The Council Chair said the adoption of five key decisions during the meeting was due to rebuilt trust between the caucuses and a restored “sense of family” within the ITTO. As reported by ENB, the pledging of USD 3.5 million during ITTC-56, “most of it from ITTO’s traditionally largest donor, Japan, that had withheld donations in the wake of ITTO’s financial impairment scandal, plus the news that some USD 40 million may be forthcoming soon from various pending funding proposals, helped buttress this sense that ITTO is slowly but steadily making its comeback.”

The Council agreed to convene its next session from 2-7 November 2021 in the ITTO host city, Yokohama, Japan.

223,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/5-ways-businesses-can-rebuildbetter/,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: 5 Ways Businesses Can #RebuildBetter,"By Zahid Torres-Rahman

We are a decade away from the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, yet when they were set in 2015, very few people would have anticipated a global pandemic affecting almost every country and territory across the world in 2020. The predictions are dire, from the projected number of people who will die from the virus, to the impact on food security, livelihoods and markets, to the effect on the social fabric of many communities.

However, among the crisis and chaos, there is also a real opportunity to rebuild better following the pandemic, in a way that leaves vulnerable people and communities significantly better off than they were before.

Decent jobs must be top priority as “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic.

Business Fights Poverty has conducted extensive collaboration with businesses, organizations and individuals, and held online events in July and during the UN’s high-level week in September. Through these discussions we have identified five primary ways that businesses can help with the global effort to rebuild better.

1. Demonstrate a purpose beyond profit

There will be increasing demand from employees, customers, investors, and other stakeholders for companies to more actively articulate and demonstrate their wider societal purpose beyond profits (recognizing that firms with purpose also do better financially). Such purpose should include tackling inequality, protecting human rights, supporting climate action and acknowledging their carbon footprint, and being better at, and more transparent about, measuring impact. Practical measures could include a company’s board of directors issuing a “Statement of Purpose” committing to bringing a positive return for their communities and stakeholders, not just shareholders.

2. Support the most vulnerable people and communities within value chains

The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing fragilities in global value chains. Such fragilities include micro, small, and medium enterprises without the cash reserves to endure the economic impact of lockdowns, and hourly workers without access to sick pay or social protection. We have produced an action toolkit, which is free to download from our website, looking at vulnerable workers whose health is at risk due to exposure to the virus, and those whose livelihoods are at risk because they depend on export sectors that have ground to a halt. Articles on tackling hidden labor and a video on enhancing social justice in global supply chains offer additional insight.

3. Invest in building new skills and personal resilience

COVID-19 has been hugely disruptive to the world of work and learning, accelerating trends towards automation and new technology. There is an urgent need for upskilling and reskilling workers – not only with technical skills, but also with the soft skills that are increasingly demanded by employers.

As “Building Back Better” becomes the prevailing theme for rebounding from the pandemic, decent jobs must be top priority. With support from The Lab at the International Labour Organization (ILO), Business Fights Poverty has created the Better Jobs Action Toolkit to provide guidance to businesses and organizations on ensuring that recovery efforts prioritize decent work.

We have also launched an innovative partnership with life sciences company Bayer, to explore how a wider uptake of “self-care” approaches can reduce pressure on health services, improve health incomes, and empower individuals and communities. Learn more through this online discussion.

4. Prioritize action on equity

The pandemic has affected people differently, based on their gender, race and income level. Women have been more exposed to infection as they make up the majority of front-line health workers. Women also are often in the most vulnerable positions in workforces and value chains, they have faced a surge in domestic violence, and they taken on the burden of unpaid care. At the same time, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery in the U.S. and the resulting protests have exposed deep-rooted, systemic racism and an urgent need for action.

Natalie Deacon of Avon writes that flexible, digital earning opportunities can support women’s well-being and avoid the rolling back of gender gains. On 3 December 2020, Business Fights Poverty will host a one-day online learning and collaborative event on gender equity in pandemic responses. Uwe Gneiting from Oxfam America also shares thoughts on how businesses can tackle inequalities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

5. Build system-level partnerships

COVID-19 has highlighted how truly interconnected we all are as well as the large-scale challenges we face, such as inequity and climate change. So, we need to rethink how we partner – shifting from traditional, transactional-style partnerships to ones that bring together multiple partners from across a company’s value chain, among peer groups, with government and civil society. With Seth Green, founding director of the Baumhart Center, an interdisciplinary center at Loyola University Chicago that prepares leaders to tackle society’s most pressing challenges, we created a “How To” video for companies on how to partner for transformational change.

The global pandemic is far from over and the consequences will be felt for many years to come. Business Fights Poverty will continue to play a key role in helping businesses to respond to threats, build trust, and connect partners for purposeful collaboration. It’s crucial that we leverage the learnings and changes brought on by COVID-19 to forge ahead into the Decade of Action to improve millions of lives by 2030.

The future vitality of the world’s forests, and the globally significant environmental services they provide, are increasingly under threat from human activities. Deforestation and forest degradation have negative impacts on biodiversity and hydrological services, and contribute to climate change.

Current Global Framework for Forest Loss

Global forest loss is addressed under a range of international agreements and conventions, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has specific provisions for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries).

In 2007, the international community recognized the importance of forests and land use as a key area for climate change mitigation when the Bali Action Plan called for policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries. In the wake of this important milestone, the year 2008 saw the launch of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and the UN-REDD Programme, under which countries work through a readiness process towards participation in REDD+. At the 2013 UN Climate Change Conference, countries approved the Warsaw Framework, which detailed the requirements for country participation in REDD+, notably including the requirements for forest reference (emission) level submissions, the benchmarks for assessing each country’s REDD+ performance.

Results of Countries’ REDD+ Efforts

Since the Warsaw Climate Change Conference in 2013, countries have made tremendous progress in preparing for, implementing, and reporting on their REDD+ actions. An FAO publication launched on 28 October 2020, titled From reference levels to results reporting: REDD+ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – 2020 update, provides an update of the results achieved so far. Let’s take a closer look at progress as of September 2020.

Fifty countries submitted 60 FREL/FRLs to the UNFCCC for technical assessment. These forest reference (emission) level (FREL/FRL) submissions collectively cover a forest area of approximately 1.35 billion ha (33% of global forest area).The countries that submitted a REDD+ FREL/FRL to the UNFCCC are responsible for around 75% of global deforestation (according to FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment). In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL.

In addition, 82% of the FREL/FRLs were national in scale, and 80% used historical average emissions/removals to construct their FREL/FRL. Thirteen countries reported REDD+ results to the UNFCCC through 17 results submissions (in the REDD+ technical annex of their biennial update reports). Results have been reported for all REDD+ activities, although no single country covered all REDD+ activities. The majority of all reported results came from reducing emissions from deforestation (98%). The combined REDD+ results reported total 9.03 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil.

The majority of all reported results came from reducing emissions from deforestation (98%). The combined REDD+ results reported total 9.03 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq). Most of these (90.4%) are emission reductions reported by Brazil. The UNFCCC published 45 FREL/FRL technical assessment reports, and 14 technical analysis reports of REDD+ results. For 43 of the 45 finalized technical assessments (96%), countries had submitted a modified FREL/FRL, and 33 of these 43 modified FREL/FRL submissions (77%) changed the FREL/FRL value as a result of the technical assessment. The reporting process triggers methodological improvements that help countries move towards more robust sample-based approaches. With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency.

The reporting process triggers methodological improvements that help countries move towards more robust sample-based approaches. With these improvements, countries also increase the reporting of uncertainty, which is crucial for transparency. Finally, six funding proposals for REDD+ results-based payments were approved by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The fund approved results-based payment proposals from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, and Paraguay totaling USD 361 million.

The most frequently mentioned objective in reference level submissions is to gain access to results-based finance. In 2017, the GCF launched the pilot program for results-based payment with a total envelope of USD 500 million.

To date, six countries have been awarded results-based payments, with two more countries (Argentina and Costa Rica) planning to present their proposals at the GCF board meeting in November 2020.

Moving Forward Amid COVID-19

Building on the considerable amount of work on REDD+ over the past decade, significant progress has been observed in recent years. Initiatives like UN-REDD Programme, the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) have played important roles.

However, with the unexpected challenges that 2020 has brought us, we need to ensure that we stay on track. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, moving REDD+ forward will be more important than ever, as the pandemic may result in even greater pressure on forest resources. REDD+ actions are here not only to avoid potential negative post-COVID realities, they are here to prevent similar catastrophes. The pandemic sweeping across the world is a crisis in which human activities have played a key role. It is up to us to ensure that it does not further negatively impact our planet.

We also need to work with countries to ensure that forest monitoring efforts result in quality forest data, which can drive higher ambitions for forests and the climate. This is fundamental to ensure the integrity of the REDD+ process and for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

COVID-19 found a perfect storm in Brazil, which has the sixth-largest population in the world and the seventh-highest level of inequality.

The health and economic crises triggered by the pandemic have exposed our multiple inequalities. While Brazil’s population is now paying the high price of pandemic unpreparedness and government irresponsibility, the planet is bound to pay an even longer-lasting price for environmental recklessness and devastation.

This warning comes from 105 specialists from the Civil Society Working Group for the 2030 Agenda in the latest Spotlight Report on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Brazil, which monitors the implementation of the SDGs. This fourth edition is based on the analysis of 145 of the 169 global SDG targets. The report shows that there is no progress in 88% of the environmental targets – only two out of 91 show progress. In addition, more than a third show regression, another third is either threatened or stagnant, and 17.6% of them have no data available.

Environmental Issues: Worsening Statistics, Shrinking Resources

Deforestation hit a record level this year, increasing by 35% in the Amazon (between June 2019 and June 2020) and 30% in the tropical Atlantic Forest, which had already lost 75% of its area throughout history. While 43 million people were hit by droughts, the 2019 budget on disaster prevention was the lowest in 11 years, and less than a third of it was disbursed.

The report shows also an increase in pollution, land grabbing conflicts, and violence against indigenous people and human rights defenders. In this context, it must take a great deal of disregard for governing for the current administration to cut bodies of democratic governance, keep civil society out of discussions, and lose international partners in the Amazonian Protection Fund, which resulted in stopping disbursement for projects led by CSOs[1].

Moreover, due to the administration’s lack of transparency, we do not have recent data on subsidies for fossil fuels, internal consumption of solid materials, or the amount of hazardous waste generated or disposed.

Economic and Social Issues: Less Public Money, More Inequality

The pandemic is highlighting the consequences of fiscal austerity policies. As those policies were implemented, legislation that increases inequality was simultaneously reinforced. A 2016 constitutional amendment established a cap on public investment in health, education, science and technology, and social assistance, effectively transferring wealth from the bottom to financial investors for the resources cut from the programmes used to pay off debt interests. It is not surprising that, of the 85 SDG targets linked to the social dimension analyzed in the report, 68% show no advancement whatsoever in the last two years (2018-2019).

In 2019, when 77 million people (37% of the population) lacked access to basic sanitation and unemployment, and job informality rose sharply, only 1.26% of Brazil’s federal budget targeted poverty reduction programmes, the same ratio since 2016. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) will have to update its hunger map because, according to our National Statistical and Geographic Institute (IBGE), hunger in Brazil reached more than 5% of the population for the first time since 2013.

Other social indicators are also worrying, including:

Brazil is the fourth, in absolute numbers, in child marriage and sexual abuse cases against children and adolescents. In 2019, these were the highest since 2011[2].

Violence against women and LGBTI+ population increased, while the budget for the VAW Program decreased 75% in the past five years.

HIV infections have increased in the North and Northeast regions (the poorest ones) and follow a pattern that points to structural racism: black people make up 60% of the deaths associated with HIV in these regions.

Governance Issues: Perceptions, Rights, and Regulations

Corruption in Brazil has worsened for three years in a row, based on citizens’ perceptions. In 2019, out of 180 countries, Brazil occupied the 106th position in the Corruption Perception Index, and saw a 20.1% increase in deaths from police intervention alongside the dismantling of the social participation policy: the National SDG Commission created in 2016 was dissolved by Presidential Decree 9.759 in April 2019. This decree also affected approximately 500 commissions and councils that had the participation of civil society representatives.

The Brazilian federal administration is openly opposed to the 2030 Agenda, as evidenced by its deregulating policies, weakening environmental protection agencies, and denying science and the climate emergency. The latest attack on the SDGs was published on 26 October 2020: Presidential Decree 10.531/2020 replaces the 2030 Agenda with the Federal Strategic Development Plan 2031. The plan seeks to justify a proposed regressive tax reform, policies of privatization for health and education, and social exclusion by reinforcing the traditional binary family arrangement, among other things[3].

It is symptomatic that while we are experiencing an extraordinary public health event, specialists are being replaced by unqualified military personnel. The current Minister of Health – Brazil’s third since February – is an Army General ready to follow the science-denying orders from the President.

Many of the rights-based accords currently in the multilateral arena were negotiated with leadership and participation of the Brazilian diplomatic corps. These same agreements are under threat at the national level, a situation that affects people and planet beyond our own borders. Losing Brazil on the path to sustainable development and environmental responsibility is a risk neither Latin America nor the world can afford, especially in this accelerated Decade of Action.

Launched ahead of World Cities Day 2020, the publication highlights the importance of local leaders and city governments in implementing the SDGs, and notes that VLRs are gaining in momentum.

‘Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines on Voluntary Local Reviews’ was launched on 30 October 2020. The guidelines were developed by ESCAP and the Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanisation (PPSU) in partnership with cities in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand.

In the report’s foreword, Stefanos Fotiou, ESCAP, and Norliza Hashim, PPSU, explain that by pursuing sustainable urbanization, cities can be “change agents” and help solve the climate crisis, unsustainable resource use, widespread inequality, discrimination and injustice. This is particularly true of Asia-Pacific cities, where most of the world’s urban population lives. They add that most of the global SDG indicators have an urban dimension, and about one-third of SDG indicators are measured at the local rather than national level. Therefore, the authors write, “any country serious about [achieving the SDGs] will find the path to sustainable development runs through its cities.”

The report notes that VLRs can help cities and regions to: localize the SDGs; demonstrate their capacity and commitments; rethink their planning process; better engage local communities to understand their needs; and get communities involved meaningfully in recovery strategies and long-term development efforts.

However, no specific template or official format exists for VLRs. The publication provides the first region-specific guidance on how to conduct a VLR and produce a report.

The guidelines build on existing resources to provide practical tools, checklists, and templates for conducting a VLR. The resources are designed to be complimentary with the respective country’s Voluntary National Review (VNR). The publication includes an overview of the VLRs produced already by several Asia-Pacific municipalities, including: Hamamatsu, Japan, which reviewed all 17 SDGs and has incorporated them into its 30-year development plan; Kitakyushu, Japan, which includes a focus on pollution abatement; and Shimokawa, Japan, highlighting extensive stakeholder engagement.

Observing World Cities Day 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “local action is the key” to rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic and engaging in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. He said that the pandemic response has brought the value of communities “into sharp focus…. Let us maintain this recognition of their value.”

UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif said the only way to achieve the SDGs is to create wider opportunities for communities to “network, co-create and finance their initiatives.” She said the value of communities “goes far beyond supporting emergency responses…. communities must be at the centre of designing their own, longer term solutions.”

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

‘State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs‘, a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020 prepared by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES);

‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’ which provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation; and

‘Guidelines for Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs)’ in a VLR Series by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).

Its polycentric, non-hierarchical governance features could be used as a model for other environmental crises.

The brief, authored by Mari Luomi, highlights that multilateral governance of energy remains scarce and fragmented, as does governance of sustainable energy. However, Luomi notes that “there have been some breakthroughs, including the establishment of the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative, the SDGs, and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).”

Luomi argues that two major energy challenges must be overcome to achieve sustainable development: energy poverty and climate change. Five decades after the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment recognized the harmful environmental effects of energy production and use, scientists have determined that limiting global warming to safe levels requires leaving at least two-thirds of fossil fuel reserves unburned.

The author recalls that the MDGs did not include an energy- specific goal, possibly because of a “long-standing disagreement between the Global South and North on whether energy was primarily a ‘social and economic good’ or an ‘environmental bad.'” She reports that the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) initiative aimed to refocus the debate by emphasizing both the role of energy in sustainable development and the importance of protecting the environment (McDade, 2013), and its three targets adopted in 2011 influenced the negotiations on SDG 7, amounting to a “rather successful attempt to merge the access and transition agendas into one.”

To achieve SDG 7, the brief says that governments and other stakeholders must form partnerships and coordinate significant transfers of technology and financing, especially to support the most vulnerable. As an early adopter of multi-stakeholder approaches, Luomi concludes, the sustainable energy sector provides positive examples and lessons for other areas of global governance.

In a joint declaration the Banks pledge to align financing decisions with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The Summit took place virtually from 9-12 November 2020. It was organized by the Government of France in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will be marked in December 2020. It was also envisioned as a key milestone ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26), the UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), and the Generation Equality Forum.

The organizers noted that public development banks provide the funding for large infrastructure projects in the energy sector, among others, and are key for redirecting finance from projects that rely on fossil fuels to lower-carbon projects. Public development banks make 10% of all global investments from public and private sources.

The banks issued a joint declaration pledging to increase their focus on the climate emergency. The signatories “commit to align our activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to reach zero net emissions as early as possible. The Banks also “will mainstream resilience and adaptation in our strategies and operations and enhance action to fund the definition and implementation of national adaptation plans. We will help redirect private financial flows in support of low-carbon and climate-resilient sustainable development.”

Pledges also address: the energy transition; biodiversity, oceans, and nature; health; gender equality; digitalization; and leaving no one behind. The declaration highlights the need for a “global framework for SDG-compatible finance.” Further on SDG financing, it supports the convergence of practices towards “core standards” set out in the 2018 report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance. The declaration cites instruments to shift more investment to sustainable assets, such as by using a shadow price of carbon and providing information on SDG reporting.

The declaration ends with a section on “the road ahead,” which notes that the second Finance in Common meeting will be convened in 2021 to take stock of the first initiatives and set up a method for monitoring progress on the declaration.

Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP), said that building on the pledge, the governments that fund each public development bank must ensure their mandates tie lending practices to lower emissions.

Before the Summit, a group of European development banks issued a separate pledge to phase out fossil fuel investments, and said they will work towards a stronger position on investment in coal in time for COP 26.

The first of its kind, the webinar focused on the theme, ‘The Future of Trade and Environment: Interactions with Geneva’s Youth.’

The event was held in the context of the WTO Trade and Environment Week. Gergana Kiskinova and Romain Williams, WTO, moderated the discussion.

The event began with opening remarks from two ambassadors, who provided background to the event and shared perspectives on the role of young people in international discussions taking place in Geneva.

Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and Chair of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), stated that the current generation of young people will face major environmental challenges. Emphasizing challenges posed by unsustainable consumption patterns and single-use plastics, he urged young people to decide what kind of future they want and look at how they can both create and protect it. Blackman encouraged all schools in Geneva to be champions of environment and sustainability to enable Geneva’s young people to become world leaders in climate change awareness and plastic-free zones.

Bettina Waldmann, Ambassador of Germany to the WTO, recognized that this generation is “very much aware of the ecological challenges we face.” She highlighted the importance of greater engagement among trade diplomats and youth. Recognizing that global trade has an impact on our ecological system, Waldmann said the WTO “can and will be” part of the solution. She further noted the EU Plastics Strategy, which addresses plastic pollution, covering the material’s entire lifecycle.

Students from the German School of Geneva gave a presentation on the problem of plastic waste, using Barbados as an example for Europe to follow. They outlined how Barbados gradually phased out single-use plastics over time rather than introducing a complete ban overnight. The students called for efforts to halve plastic waste by 2050, and mentioned plant starch as an alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics.

Students from Institut Florimont delivered a presentation on trade in goods and the role of clean transport. While global trade in goods is made possible by multiple forms of transport, they said freight is responsible for 7% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Among solutions, the students mentioned greater investment in green transport and shifting to consumption of more local goods.

Karsten Steinfatt, WTO, applauded the realism and ambition from the students. He pointed out that the WTO takes into consideration the entire lifecycle of products, and products that come from far away do not always have a bigger carbon footprint. Steinfatt said it is necessary to inform consumers to help them choose the most environmentally friendly products. He also emphasized that the WTO does not advocate “trade for trade’s sake,” but rather prioritizes “good trade,” beneficial for the economy as well as the environment.

After some dialogue between the ambassadors and the students, Brianna Kerr, Director and Head of Impact at Kua, Sydney, Australia, delivered the last presentation. She introduced Kua – a student-created company that sources ethical coffee from smallholder farms in Uganda. Prioritizing a circular model, Kua rethinks waste by collecting customers’ coffee grounds and distributing them to local farms in the Sydney area. The company uses its profits to fund climate resilience projects in Uganda. Kerr hoped to open source Kua’s business model so that other social entrepreneurs could replicate it in their countries.

The ambassadors then offered concluding remarks. Waldmann wished to continue conversations with youth in future WTO Trade and Environment Weeks, and stated that the German Mission is ready to sponsor upcoming events.

Blackman hoped the event would become a permanent fixture of future Trade and Environment Weeks, and expressed readiness to work with young people in Geneva to take their ideas forward through a Geneva-based network of youth interested in trade and environment.

“The global coronavirus pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt,” he said. “The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe.”

The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, certainly seems to agree with Defoe (see below) that the world should now look on things with “differing eyes”.

“Another plague would remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes, than those which we looked on things with before.”

These are the words of Daniel Defoe in A Journal of the Plague Year, a vivid account of life in London in 1665 when bubonic plague wiped out 15 percent of the city’s population, and brought the economy of the whole of England to a standstill.

Many of those who didn’t die, lost their livelihoods, and just as in the global pandemic of 2020, after a period of fear, isolation and hysteria, the great and pressing concern was how to build a better world from the devastation. Defoe’s graphic description of the plague, and the subsequent economic ruin has distinct echoes for our times.

Some economists are forecasting a V-shape recovery; a fast bounce-back. But many more suggest the most likely outcome will be an L-shaped impact – a rapid dip followed by a long period of no significant growth, perhaps continuing for many years.

The United Nations, in its response to the pandemic is perhaps facing the greatest test since its inception in 1945. But the organisation is determined not to be blown off course in its pledge to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

The task of finding a way through this world-wide catastrophe has fallen to 71 year old Mr Guterres who became Secretary-General of the UN in 2017 having served two terms as Prime Minister of his native Portugal. The leader of the country’s Socialist Party, he was widely admired at home and abroad for his support for humanitarian causes. He began his career at the UN as High Commissioner for Refugees where he became convinced that sustainable development would be essential for the eradication of poverty and inequality.

Since his appointment as Secretary-General, he has enthusiastically championed the UN’s blueprint of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to achieve “a better and more sustainable future for all”. These include an end to poverty and hunger, promotion of good health and education, gender equality, clean water provision, clean energy and action on climate change.

This holistic response to the root causes of conflicts – integrating peace, sustainable development and human rights – was going to be challenging enough without an unforeseen global crisis like the Covid-19 virus.

The UN had hoped to achieve their SDG aims by the end of the decade, but the pandemic has thrown a giant spanner in the works, threatening destabilisation in many of the developing countries of the world, most notably in Africa, where progress was being made towards the SDG target.

Mr Guterres, attending a virtual high-level UN the meeting aimed at finding solutions to tackle the damage done by the pandemic to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, warned that Covid-19 would cause “unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world”. He predicted that millions would be pushed into extreme poverty, that there would be famines of “historic proportions”, and that we would witness the sharpest contraction of the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis – because of a microscopic virus,” he said.

He said that there must be immediate, collective action in six crucial areas: Global liquidity and solutions to debt; incentives for creditors; incentives to boost sustainable development; a crackdown on illicit financial dealings; the alignment of incentives in global financial systems with SDGs to boost confidence and relaunch investment in sustainable development; and finally, the creation of an over-arching global framework to aid rapid recovery.

“All our efforts must go towards building sustainable and resilient pathways that enable us not only to beat Covid-19, but to tackle the climate crisis, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty and hunger,” he said.

“Getting through Covid-19 and recovering better will cost money, but the alternative will cost far more. This is a global crisis and it’s up to all of us to solve it. Let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future.”

Mr Guterres has been at pains to insist that in the pursuit of sustainable economic recovery world governments must build upon the UN’s SDG blueprint. There was a triple imperative, he told the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in May, to stem the pandemic, safeguard development gains already made, and ensure that all recovery efforts followed the SDG 2030 Agenda.

“Working together, with our foot on the pedal and our eyes on the (SDG) 2030 Agenda, we will get through this crisis and reach our destination, protecting hard-won development progress and accelerating our joint efforts,” he said. “Our objective remains clear; to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.”

One element of the SDGs is gender equality, and Mr Guterres singled out the role of women in the world economy. The pandemic, he said, had laid bare the extent to which national economies are sustained by the unpaid domestic labour of women. He urged governments to tackle the issue in the post-pandemic world to ensure a better recovery. “Returning to our previous path is simply not an option,” he said.

His words were echoed by ECOSOC president, Mona Juul, who said that the pandemic had exposed the disproportionate burden on women who perform unpaid care work and are overrepresented as frontline health workers. She said that the inclusion of a gender perspective, as enshrined in SDG, into social and economic responses to the virus was essential.

Mr Guterres emphasised that bold action taken now, based on the UN’s SDGs, would not only protect the weakest, it would help ensure a stronger recovery. And he again stressed the regularly-quoted phrase that he would “leave no-one behind”. The recovery, he said, had to be focussed on building inclusive and sustainable economies that are more resilient in the face of future global challenges.

At the beginning of the year, the UN announced a “Decade of Action” for SDGs. The conversation at the time was about how to build momentum in the final ten years of the initiative. In its 2019 SDG report, the UN had warned that progress towards the goals was slowing, even reversing in some areas.

Now there are many who paradoxically believe the pandemic, far from being an unanticipated obstacle to SDG progress, may help reinvigorate the project. The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), for instance, pointed to the way many businesses supported communities and the vulnerable during the pandemic, showing a willingness to help society and go above and beyond the normal.

UKSSD blogger, Emily Auckland, said: “It is only by working together that we will create a post-pandemic future that is fairer, just and sustainable.”

Failure to respond quickly at this point in history, said Mr Guterres, could jeopardise progress already made towards achieving SDGs. The UN has drawn attention to several areas where a substantially improved outcome might be achieved because of the effects of the pandemic – one being the question of remittances.

Remittances – the money sent by migrant workers in developed nations to their families in poorer countries – currently account for more than five percent of GDP in as many as 60 low-income countries. During the pandemic, this flow of cash has been dramatically reduced, causing great hardship in developing countries.

But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the global remittance system, said Gilbert F. Houngbo, president of the UN agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He called for an overhaul of money-transfer systems to ensure more of the cash reaches needy families, and less is lost in transfer fees. IFAD is currently in negotiation with financial technology firms, mobile operators, banks and postal networks to find a solution to high transaction costs.

Mr Guterres focussed specifically on the effects upon mental health as a result of the pandemic, especially among the young. “Mental health is at the core of our humanity,” he said. “The virus is not only attacking our physical health, it is also increasing psychological suffering. Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief and anxiety will continue to affect people and communities.”

His observations were confirmed in late May 2020, when the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warned that more than one in six young people worldwide had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus.

The ILO reported that under 30s had been particularly hard hit, claiming that their financial prospects could be blighted for decades. Guy Ryder, the ILO’s Director-General said that many young people would simply be left behind. Youth unemployment in the EU for instance, which still stands at around 15 percent, had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, he said.

This was just one aspect of the potential fall-out from the pandemic. Mr Guterres also drew attention to the plight of the world’s developing nations, especially those in Africa, whose progress towards the UN’s SDG targets was being thrown off course as a result of the economic damage caused by coronavirus.

Mr Guterres had earlier called on UN member states to adopt a “war economy” to fight the effects of the virus. Defeating coronavirus, he said, was the first stage, but the world should seize the opportunity to create a global economy which was more “inclusive and sustainable going forward”.

“We need to prepare for a recovery for a better economy, a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” he said. “We don’t need to replicate exactly the economy of the past. Many things will change, I would say irreversibly in our lives.”

He said that the world needed to use the current situation wisely; “to seize it as an opportunity” to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability in national economies. He also expressed the hope that another effect of the pandemic would be to force governments to re-evaluate relationships with the environment, and redouble efforts to combat climate change.

Unsurprisingly for a man who sees his fundamental role as UN Secretary-General to be the achievement of the eradication of poverty and inequality, Africa is at the heart of his Covid-19 concerns.

As the virus began to spread across the continent, Mr Guterres called on warring factions in several African states to agree to a general ceasefire, in the hope that the pandemic would somehow make peace easier to achieve.

Mr Guterres knows that the pandemic will not be defeated until Africa is safe. Economic instability could lead to catastrophic collapse in the region, leading in turn to more conflict, famine and an upsurge in migration.

“In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people,” he said. “Economic growth has been strong; the digital revolution has taken hold. A free trade area has been agreed. But the epidemic threatens Africa’s progress. It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.”

It was already the case, he said, that African exports were in serious decline because of coronavirus, and demand in the continent’s tourism industry had all but dried up. The opening of a pan-African trade zone, upon which so much is staked, and which was due to take place in 2020, has been postponed as a direct result of the pandemic.

Mr Guterres praised the way African countries had moved rapidly to establish regional co-operation to fight the spread of the disease, including co-ordinated quarantines and lockdowns. He also commended African governments for drawing on their experience of epidemics like HIV/Aids and Ebola in the fight against rumour and misinformation, debunking anecdotal speculations and overcoming mistrust of government agencies.

But the international community, he argued, had to step in to help strengthen local health systems, and try to avoid a financial crisis which could push millions of Africans into poverty.

Elsewhere, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shone the spotlight on the effect of the pandemic on environmental issues, insisting that the world’s response must not be seen as simply a philanthropic reaction. Sustainable recovery and development will need to be fully future-proofed, she said. The threat posed by rising global temperatures increases the likelihood of more pandemics, flooding, droughts and the destabilisation of economies.

Meanwhile attention has also been focussed on the generational response to the crisis. Those reaching adulthood in the early 21st century – Millennials and Generation Z – were initially accused of having too carefree an attitude to the virus, even being blamed for helping to spread infection. But it is becoming clear that the response of young people is leading to intergenerational innovation to find ways to survive and grow.

Millennials and Generation Z make up nearly 40 percent of workers in fragile areas such as childcare, restaurants, and tourism – and are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of measures designed to tackle Covid-19. But these young people are also collaborative, comfortable with electronic communication and the use of technology, and above all, adaptable.

They are the generations most likely to seek out sustainable brands, say economists. Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is a pioneer of in this field. In 2018 their 28 Sustainable Living Brands grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business – up from 46 percent the previous year. Much of this growth, Unilever believes, is down to the attitudes of younger generations.

Elizabeth Uviebinené, the British author of Slay in You Lane: The Black Girl Bible, summed up this opinion, saying: “Despite the uncertainty ahead, I take comfort in the fact that millennials are a resilient and adaptable generation because we’ve always had to be, and this setback will be no different.”

The Business & Sustainable Development Commission, launched in Davos, Switzerland in 2016, believes that at least $12 trillion could be unlocked through the expansion of sustainable business over the next decade, creating up to 380 million new jobs by 2030.

Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, the Director of SDG Impact at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), says that the pandemic has exposed the world’s weaknesses, and “reminded us about how interconnected all our fortunes are”.

“We now have the opportunity to create a better, stronger, more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for all,” she says. “Rather than assume that the pandemic makes our task harder, we should capitalise on the opportunity and space it provides to challenge conventional wisdom.”

In 2018, KPMG reported that of the world’s 250 largest companies, only 101 mentioned SDGs in their corporate reporting, and of these, just eight made the business case for SDGS.

Ms Davidsen says: “Too often the SDGs are used as just another reporting lens to communicate existing activities differently, rather than to make different decisions. While interest in the SDGs has been building, business leaders tell us they still do not have all the tools and information they need.”

Her role, as the pandemic recedes, is to build a common business framework to guide companies, creating a greater sense of confidence in an uncertain time, she said.

António Guterres believes that people have finally become conscious of the seriousness of the virus and its effects, and now understand that global solidarity and co-ordination of action was required not only to defeat coronavirus, but also to keep the wheels of the world economy turning.

Despite the apparent chaos in the global response to coronavirus, the conflicting advice of experts, the attempts to pin blame, the rhetoric of leaders like Mr Trump, the failure to follow WHO guidance by some, the opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties by others, Mr Guterres remains optimistic that the world can recover, and a new, equitable future be created.

And it would seem that his cautious optimism is shared. Global Web Index, a London-based consumer research body, believes that optimism is a key factor in navigating the coronavirus crisis – and its extensive market research appears to bear that out.

An internet survey of 14,000 people across 13 countries conducted during the height of the pandemic in March 2020 found a reassuringly high level of optimism for recovery among respondents, though there were significant variations between countries.

China saw the highest levels of optimism at 93 percent, while in Japan only 17 percent were hopeful of a positive outcome. In the USA and UK, there was an approximate 50:50 split between confidence and pessimism. According to Global Web Index, good communication appears to be the key to maintaining consumer optimism, with those who felt well-informed being generally less concerned for the future.

The Great Plague of 1665 was the first time the citizens of England had suffered such pestilence since the dreadful years of the Black Death in the 14th century. It took them by surprise in much the same way as coronavirus shocked a modern world where such events were seen as things of the past. The Black Death wiped out almost 45 per cent of England’s population in the mid-1300s, and in doing so, also obliterated the feudal system, laying the foundation for a modern nation. Similarly, the Great Plague, followed the next year by the Great Fire of London, allowed the city to transform into a progressive capital. From calamity can come hope.

In his journal of the plague year, Daniel Defoe echoes this conviction with a grimly comic observation that there may yet be cause for hopefulness:

“This is a world of corpses strewn in the streets and pits, yet in the deadcart itself a drunken piper wakes up to cry, ‘But I an’t dead tho’ am I?’”

The team currently includes portfolio managers David Finger, Kofi Tweneboa-Kodua, Robbie Miles and Shibo Wang, as well as product specialist Alexandra Russo.

The new equity funds will closely follow eight larger themes: social inclusion, health, financial inclusion, education, food security, water, clean land/circular economy and energy transition.

The team will select companies that offer solutions to issues addressed by one or more of the SDGs. This in turn will allow the team to tap into specific themes and topics, for example education technology within the education theme or sustainable agriculture within food security.

The Allianz Positive Change fund, for example, will invest a minimum of 90% of its assets in the shares of international companies providing solutions to achieve the UN SDGs.

Meanwhile, the Allianz Clean Planet fund targets companies offering products or solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges related to three dimensions of a clean environment: clean air, clean land, clean water.

The third new strategy, the Allianz Food Security fund, allocates to companies offering products or solutions that actively contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes along the entire food supply chain across production, transportation, quality and safety of food.

For all three strategies up to 50% of their assets may be invested in the emerging markets. The SDG-aligned strategies also take an active approach to ESG integration, including a detailed assessment of the most significant risk factors, and exclusion criteria.

The three new strategies will sit alongsid the group’s existing thematic funds, which include the Allianz Global Water and Allianz Smart Energy funds.

Commenting on the launches, Fruschki said: ‘While each company that we consider eligible for an SDG strategy has a clear role to play in achieving the relevant SDG, the exact extent of its contribution to the UN goal can be difficult to quantify. That makes a thorough, qualitative research process essential.’

‘Given the global focus on the UN goals, companies that directly support them are likely to benefit from increased interest and growth. This may represent a strong investment case generating sustainable returns,’ he added.

The 17 sustainable development goals of the UN have 169 underlying targets, addressing global challenges related to society and the environment. According to UN, $2.5trn of capital is needed annually to finance the achievement of the goals.","Allianz Global Investors has launched three thematic strategies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Citywire Selector has learned.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

New Delhi: United Nations Development Program and Invest India have launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical SDG enabling sectors, that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development.

“India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally. Invest India is pleased to have partnered with UNDP India to develop the first-ever 'SDG Investor Map for India'. This initiative is an instrumental stride in India's development trajectory, and I believe it couldn't have come at a better time. We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India”, Deepak Bagla, CEO & MD, Invest India, said on the launch occasion.

Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India said on the occasion, “The Map comes at a critical time for India. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financing gap for the SDGs in India has only widened further and decades of development progress is nearly on the verge of reversal. Investing in the SDGs at this point is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ and making the economy and our societies more resilient and sustainable. Enhanced productivity, technology adoption and increased inclusion are all critical factors that this map uses to identify the most attractive sectors for investors.”

Key highlights of the SDG Investor Map:

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust Private Equity and Venture Capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability. The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors.

The map has also identified eight White Spaces, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs within a 5-6-year horizon. However, these require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

Nearly 50% of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs in excess of 20%.

84% of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).

83% of the identified IOAs address job creation and industrialization needs, 70% focus on inclusive business models and 50% leverage digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

Notable IOAs include ‘Online Supplementary Education for K12’ (Education), ‘Tech-Enabled Remote Care Services’ (Healthcare), ‘Digital Platforms to service input/output needs of farmers to enable easy access to markets’ (Agriculture) and ‘Access to credit by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Low-Income Groups especially through digital platforms for Income Generating Purposes’ (Financial Services).

The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in SDG enabling sectors and IOAs, bridging the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Moreover, investing in the SDGs is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhancing India’s resilience to future threats.

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability, push forward the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology will be of essence to India as it grapples with the challenges of a post-COVID economy.

By mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest, the SDG Investor Map lays out pathways that can bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for 6 SDG-enabling sectors including Education, Healthcare, Agriculture & Allied Activities, Financial Services, Renewable Energy & Alternatives and Sustainable Environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks. This ensured that the Map’s findings were truly reflective of market sentiment.","UNDP, Invest India launch SDG investor map for India, 18 investment opportunities areas identifiedNew Delhi: United Nations Development Program and Invest India have launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical SDG enabling sectors, that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development.
Invest India is pleased to have partnered with UNDP India to develop the first-ever 'SDG Investor Map for India'.

Tall tower, full power.

SDG County council recently voted to support more funding for a project that will have a new, 200-foot tower constructed to bolster two-way radio communications for transportation staff.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG County council looks to budget for new communications tower Back to video

Trevor Baker, operations manager, transportation and planning services, in a key information report to council said the bad news is, required repairs to the existing tower in the Newington area, including the tower and anchors would be cost-prohibitive — especially considering it’s not safe anymore for workers to service it by climbing it, that each time fixes would be needed for the antenna, a costly crane needs to be on site.

The good news is, much of the $231,000 total for the project is already accounted for — $106,000 from the existing reserve, and $30,000 budgeted in 2020 for upgrades that has gone unspent.

That leaves $95,000, a sum that council said it will include in the 2021 budget and will of course be reviewed at a later date.","Article contentTall tower, full power.

239,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-index-finds-no-european-country-on-track-green-deal-brings-potential/,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG Index Finds No European Country on Track, Green Deal Brings Potential","The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) launched the 2020 edition of the Europe Sustainable Development Report (ESDR). The ESDR 2020 provides an updated SDG Index and Dashboards for European countries, reports on spillover effects on other countries, and makes recommendations for strengthening SDG implementation and the European Green Deal.

The ESDR 2020 is the second report on the SDG progress of the EU, its member states, and other European countries. The report is part of a broader series of Sustainable Development Reports tracking the performances of countries and municipalities around the world on the SDGs. The 2020 ESDR examines six policy levers and tools for implementing SDG transformations in the EU:

A New European Industrial and Innovation Strategy for the SDGs; An investment plan and financing strategy aligned with the SDGs; Coherent national and EU SDG policies; Coordinated Green Deal and SDG Diplomacy; Regulations on business standards and reporting; and SDG monitoring and reporting framework.

The report finds that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, “no European country was on track to achieve all 17 SDGs by 2030.” The region faces the greatest challenges on sustainable agriculture and diets (SDG 2), climate (SDG 13), biodiversity (15), and in addressing inequalities in living standards across its countries and regions (SDGs 1 and 10). The authors report that unsustainable diets, high and rising obesity rates, and unsustainable agriculture and farming practices are contributing to the EU and partner countries “performing especially poorly” on SDG 2.

The Nordic countries again performed the best on the SDG Index. Finland placed the highest, with a score of 81.10. Other countries in the top five are: Sweden (81.02), Denmark (80.05), Austria (77.35), and Norway (77.03). Even these countries face challenges on several SDGs. Finland, for instance, received red scores (classified as “major challenges remain”) on SDG 2, SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG 13. Sweden scored red on SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15.

The report features a leave no one behind score that tracks four dimensions of inequality: poverty, services, gender, and income. Countries with a higher score have fewer population groups that are being left behind. Norway (87.03), Finland (86.69), and Iceland (84.23) placed the highest. Greece (57.82), Bulgaria (47.97), and Romania (47.74) ranked the lowest.

On COVID-19, the report observes that suppressing the virus remains an urgent priority for the EU. The EU has recorded more cases and deaths from COVID-19 than the Asia-Pacific region. The authors underscore the need to strengthen the EU’s preparedness, coordination, and resilience for pandemics in order to achieve SDG target 3.d on preparedness for global health security issues, and to prepare for climate-related and other risks. The report further recommends using the SDGs as a framework to build back better and investing in green infrastructure, digitization, and responsible consumption and production, combined with efforts and investments to boost education and skills throughout Europe and coordinated efforts to reform tax systems, particularly digital taxes.

The report highlights the potential of the Next Generation EU-COVID-19 recovery package and the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2021-2027) to put Europe on a path towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient recovery. SDSN Executive Director Guido Schmidt-Traub called on the EU to “provide global leadership on the goals.” He said the EU has the tools in place to achieve the SDGs internally, but they “must be more clearly organized around the six transformations.” In addition the EU must be prepared to “promote SDG and Green Deal diplomacy ahead of the climate and biodiversity COPs in 2021.”

The report includes the 2020 International Spillover report, which shows how unsustainable supply chains and trade-related spillovers from the EU have “serious environmental, social and economic consequences for the rest of the world.” For example, unsustainable supply chains lead to deforestation and increased biodiversity threats, hindering global progress on SDGs 13 and 15. EU imports of clothing, textile, and leather products are linked with 37 fatal workplace accidents and 21,000 non-fatal accidents per year. The report recommends that the EU address negative international spillovers by reducing trade in waste, enacting coherent trade and external policies, strengthening tax cooperation and transparency, and applying EU standards to exports.

The German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, and the European Network of Political Foundations provided support for the report. SDSN and IEEP produced the report in collaboration with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), SDSN Germany, and national and regional SDSN networks in Europe.

240,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/pacific-islands-report-on-sdg-efforts-for-blue-pacific/,"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Pacific Islands Report on SDG Efforts for Blue Pacific,"At the two-year mark of the Pacific region’s sustainable development plan, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat has released an update report measuring progress on the SDGs. It focuses on nine action areas contained in the 2018 Quadrennial Pacific Sustainable Development Report that aim to contextualize the SDGs to Pacific realities.

The nine action areas, which align with a commitment by the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, are:

Addressing vulnerability and increasing inequality; Tackling gender gaps and high youth unemployment; Continuing to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth; Intensifying multi-sector efforts with increased finance to address non-communicable diseases; Strengthening efforts to tackle the dual threats of climate change and disasters; Addressing the consequences of population growth and poor waste management practices; Continuing to address de-risking issues and the high cost of sending remittances; More effective use of existing and new finance and stronger coordination; and Increasing investment in the collection and use of timely and accurate disaggregated data.

The report makes recommendations for the nine action areas. To address vulnerability and reduce inequality, it recommends that countries strengthen existing social protection and economic empowerment measures, develop education policies and programs to promote disability inclusive education, and mainstream an inclusive approach to ensure all development, including COVID-19 response and recovery, delivers shared benefits that include vulnerable groups.

To promote sustainable, equitable economic growth, the authors recommend that countries address the lack of data, methodologies and limited statistical capacity in the region to monitor SDG progress, adopt the Action Plan for the Regional Longline Fisheries Strategy, with indicators to measure progress, and support the work of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to improve labor conditions and address modern slavery conditions in the fisheries sector.

To build resilience and tackle climate change and natural disasters, countries are urged to ensure that local, national, and regional climate change adaptation planning process are effective and informed by up-to-date information.

The report also examines the Pacific region’s processes on the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), by which several countries decide to report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The report points to opportunities for strengthening capacity to involve stakeholders at national and sub-national levels, ways to strengthen linkages between budgets and plans, and ways to build and sustain data to better inform policy, planning, and budgets.

Nine member countries of the Pacific Island Forum had produced VNRs by 2019 and four more countries reported in 2020. The 2019 VNRs identified a number of challenges facing the national governments that reported: human and institutional capacity constraints; lack of political will and ownership to respond to the cross-sectoral nature of sustainable development; lack of alignment at national level with global and regional commitments, including the importance of localizing global goals, targets and indicators, lack of stakeholder engagement with government agencies, civil society and the private sector; limited capacity to collect and analyze data; and insufficient financial resources and capacity for resource mobilization.

On gender equality, the PIF report reaffirms the need to increase the participation of women in Pacific economies, and the need to reduce the high rate of violence against women and girls. The report also reviews progress under the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration (PLEGD) and analyzes country progress reports for the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 25-year review. The report recommends advocating for decent work opportunities for all and continuing to address the root causes of gender inequality.

On the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, the report states that it has caused “unprecedented disruption” and is “likely to undo gains previously reported in 2018” as well as in the last two years. The report observes that COVID-19 has affected the region’s good progress towards sustainability in the fisheries sector, efforts to address the high costs of remittances, and progress to improve returns and increase community involvement in tourism.

At the report’s launch, PIF Secretary-General Meg Taylor said the report “confirms the slow progress on our development targets in the Pacific.” Despite some significant achievements, she said the report highlights increasing vulnerabilities, deepening inequalities, and limited access to infrastructure and basic services, including inconsistent access to affordable and quality health care, and a need to improve access to quality education. She called for the region to work together to accelerate progress on SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water), and SDG 15 (life on land).

Taylor also highlighted the Forum’s ongoing work to develop the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, and she said that at least 90% of its member countries are expected to have completed their first or undertaken their second VNR by 2022.

Preceded by the South Asia People’s Forum on SDGs, the Forum reviewed the status of SDG achievements and the actions taken by the South Asian governments towards resilient and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including Bhutan and Pakistan, that will present their second Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in 2021.

Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP, advocated greater action on strengthened social protection and financing economic recovery through innovative financing strategies, accelerating digital transformation and greening recovery through the use of clean technology. She also reiterated the commitment of ESCAP in continuing to work closely with member States and other partners in the region.

H.E. Mr. Mohamed Aslam, Minister of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure, the Maldives, summarised the devastation caused by the pandemic on the Maldives economy, including loss of jobs of over 22,000 people. He called upon the South Asian countries to join hands and foster sustainable recovery to achieve the SDGs through meaningful partnerships and collaboration in addressing the challenges faced by countries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

SAARC Secretary-General H.E. Mr. Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, further highlighted cooperation initiatives such as the SAARC Emergency Fund to curb the pandemic's impact and urged member states to put SDGs at the center of all policy making and recovery planning.

The brief warns that while the world has enough money to fund sustainable development, there is a financing gap and a persistent digital divide to achieve the SDGs.

The brief, authored by Elena Kosolapova, argues that “technology, finance, and capacity building, together with inclusive and equitable globalization and trade, regional integration, and enabling environments” can help address climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, poverty, and hunger, among other challenges. It acknowledges that without transferring technological and financial resources to developing countries, the world cannot achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The brief traces the history of sustainable development finance since the UN Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, and outlines the current global regulatory landscape for financing sustainable development and climate action, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the Paris Agreement.

According to the brief, “financing remains a major bottleneck”— a challenge exacerbated by “slow growth, high debt, growing trade restrictions, increasing environmental shocks, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” It argues the world could bridge the financing gap to achieve the SDGs, estimated at between USD 2.5 and USD 3 trillion per year, if about 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) went to sustainable development. However, “‘substantial backsliding in key action areas’ has been observed,” the brief warns, including a drop in official development assistance (ODA) of 4.3% in 2018, and a decrease in ODA to least developed countries (LDCs) of 2.2% in real terms. The brief notes that “developed countries’ pledge of raising USD 100 billion per year in climate finance has also proven difficult to achieve.”

The brief outlines “persistent gaps” between developed and developing countries’ access to and use of existing technologies, and points to “a persistent digital divide.” Recognizing technologies’ potential to “promote sustainable development and leave no one behind,” the brief cautions about possible risks that could compromise achievement of the SDGs, such as exacerbated inequalities and job loss, and recommends any tradeoffs be addressed.

Improved alignment between development cooperation and climate action, the brief argues, “can help ensure development financing activities do not undermine sustainable development,” which, it says, can be achieved though leadership, renewed commitment, political will, and global partnership.

The brief was published as part of the ‘Still Only One Earth’ series, which assesses “the successes and shortcomings of five decades of global environmental policy,” focusing on climate action, sustainable energy, wildlife trade, and biodiversity, among other issues.

Only countries and stakeholders making new and ambitious announcements were given a speaking slot during the virtual event. The 111 speakers included Heads of State and Government as well as non-governmental actors representing youth, subnational governments, business, Indigenous peoples, and civil society.

The golden thread of climate action should weave through every international gathering in 2021. COP 26 President-designate Sharma

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin report of the event, which took place on 12 December 2020, indicates that statements coalesced around four themes: new and enhanced Paris Agreement medium-term plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs); long-term low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategies, as requested by the Paris Agreement, and mid-century, net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) and GHG emissions targets; adaptation plans and strategies; and climate finance.

Seventy-five leaders announced new commitments, some of which had been communicated in recent months or days, or indicated ongoing work. Among the major announcements were China’s NDC-related commitment to lower its CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% by 2030, from 2005 levels; the European Union’s NDC-related pledge to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030; and the UK’s NDC-related target of reducing GHG emissions at least 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Additional pledges included:

Net zero-related pledges by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden;

by Argentina, Barbados, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Malawi, Maldives, Nauru, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Sweden; Adaptation pledges by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and

by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Marshall Islands, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Uruguay, and Vanuatu, among others; and Climate finance pledges including from Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, and the UK.

The Cities Race to Zero – part of the global Race to Zero Campaign – was joined by 72 new cities and local authorities from Belgium, China, Denmark, and the UK. And companies from the manufacturing, industry, aviation, transport, technology, and fashion industries offered mitigation pledges.

In his closing remarks, COP 26 President-designate Alok Sharma, UK, announced that the UK will double its climate finance contribution to USD 15.5 billion over the next five years.

In all, Sharma said 45 NDCs, 24 net zero commitments, and 20 adaptation and resilience plans were announced during the event. He called for “the golden thread of climate action to weave through every international gathering” in 2021.

The ‘Climate Dialogues’ programme included a number of mandated events for 2020 and fostered discussion of emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

The Climate Dialogues comprised nearly 60 openly webcasted events over ten days between 23 November and 4 December 2020, and were conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), as well as the Chilean Presidency of COP 25 and the incoming UK Presidency of COP 26. Several non-broadcasted events for Parties also convened to discuss outstanding negotiation issues, such as on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (market and non-market mechanisms) and common time frames for nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

During an Opening Segment, Marianne Karlsen, SBI Chair, stressed that the Climate Dialogues would ensure that key tasks scheduled for 2020 were conducted. Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, SBSTA Chair, highlighted that the Dialogues would permit interaction with the various constitutive bodies and deepen understanding of outstanding issues.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted recent “encouraging signs,” including a growing number of commitments to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said that for these targets to be credible, they must be reflected in national plans and policies as well as NDCs. She urged more progress on finance, including on the goal for developed countries to jointly mobilize USD 100 billion per year by 2020.

COP 25 President Carolina Schmidt noted the importance of non-state actors as key players, and welcomed recent announcements on carbon neutrality from major economies such as China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. COP 26 President Alok Sharma said the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December will provide a platform for leaders to make announcements on mitigation, adaptation, and support. He called for long-term strategies towards net-zero emissions.

During a segment titled the ‘Presidency’s Open Dialogue between Observers and Parties,’ Sharma stressed that achieving net zero and building resilience are only possible through joint efforts between parties and non-party stakeholders. He said the latter are vital for encouraging parties to raise ambition.

In the ensuing discussion between observer constituencies and parties, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the Dialogues indicates that key insights included:

Governments must work with all stakeholders in formulating their enhanced NDCs;

COVID-19 recovery should be undertaken in a way that also advances the green transition and the necessary structural transformation of economies;

According to the Production Gap Report 2020, fossil fuel production must decline by 6% per year until 2030 for Paris Agreement goals to be met, and yet G20 governments have committed over USD 230 billion to fossil fuels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic;

It is beneficial for a COP host country to “have its own house in order” to better encourage others to raise ambition;

COVID-19 and climate change are gendered crises, and both the recovery and climate action must be ambitious, inclusive, and gender-responsive;

Multilevel action is key to raising national ambition, and efforts by subnational and regional governments should be formally recognized;

Enhanced NDCs must focus on decent and good job creation, protect human and labor rights, and include workers and organizations in their creation; and

Young people have continued to organize despite the pandemic, and parties should give space and resources for youth to self-organize.

During the concluding segment, Julio Cordano, COP 25 Presidency, stressed that the COP 25 and 26 Presidencies and the Secretariat are “extremely well-coordinated” in their planning. Archie Young, COP 26 Presidency, highlighted the UK’s new NDC, which commits to a 68% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, and announced that the UK will host a series of bilateral and multilateral conversations with negotiating groups and parties in 2021.

Guyana, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said: the virtual format is not appropriate for negotiations; there is a “deficit of ambition” on pre-2020 commitments, which developed countries should address; and adaptation is lagging behind mitigation in the negotiations. Germany, for the EU, called for an inclusive, productive, and ambitious set of discussions between now and COP 26 on transparency and Article 6.

Speakers also emphasized the importance of continuing discussions, ensuring that the recovery from COVID-19 is consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, and the need to meet finance and mitigation commitments and operationalize the long-term goal on adaptation, among other priorities.

In her closing remarks, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa urged parties to “work like [they] never have before” to complete the necessary work at COP 26.

Speakers looked forward to continuing the dialogue at two virtual events the week after the Climate Dialogues concluded. The Thimphu Ambition Summit, taking place on 9 December 2020, will showcase leadership by least developed countries (LDCs) on climate action. The Climate Ambition Summit 2020, taking place on 12 December 2020, will mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals based on five focus areas, namely people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The goals are measured according to 247 indicators set at the global level in 2019.

On indicator assessment, Mustapa said for Malaysia, 128 indicators or 52 percent were available while 73 indicators or 29 percent needed to be developed.

“A total of 13 percent or 31 indicators are not available while 15 indicators or six percent are not relevant to Malaysia,” he said.

Mustapa said the national SDG progress status was also measured based on the performance of 108 statistical indicators.

Among aspects that showed positive progress was under the people focus area, with the overall incidence of poverty improving to 5.6 percent (405,441 households) in 2019 from 7.6 percent (525,743 households) in 2016, he said.

Meanwhile, the prosperity focus area showed the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at constant prices grew 3.9 percent in 2019 compared with 3.6 percent in 2018.

“In line with the growth in the digital economy especially in the new normal following Covid-19, the percentage of individuals using the Internet has risen 3.0 percentage points to 84.2 percent in 2019 from 81.2 percent in the preceding year.

“For the Internet usage in the cities and rural areas, they increased 2.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively,” he said.

He added that all elements comprising the five focus areas would be continued in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) after having been incorporated into the country’s developmental policies such as the 11th Malaysia Plan and Shared Prosperity Vision 2030

“In fact, a new approach will be taken under 12MP to deal with poverty through a targeted programme based on local needs across all races.

“This is because the poverty issues differ according to demographics and current situations. The way to handle it must suit the local conditions,” he explained.

According to him, the SDG implementation requires commitment from all quarters to continue the people development agenda.

“Hence the role played by the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia on SDG (APPGM-SDG) is very critical to assist in achieving the Agenda 2030 goals.

“The group, which was established following the Dewan Rakyat approval on Oct 19, 2019, comprises 10 Members of Parliament including me,” he said.

Mustapa said APPGM-SDG was involved in SDG at the Parliamentary level by conducting local issue mapping activities and recommending solution ideas.

In the first phase, the group made field visits to 10 parliamentary constituencies in four states.

Next year, he said, APPGM-SDG would do the same programme in 20 parliamentary areas, especially in states that were not visited in 2020.

“The implementation of SDG goals is a continuation from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended in 2015.

This article is part of the series — Post-Pandemic Development Priorities.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to ensure universal access to energy, increased energy efficiency and expanded use of renewable energy through new economic opportunities and jobs by 2030 through well planned, strategic, intergovernmental and time-bound actions. With the motto “leave no one behind,” it seeks to close the electricity access gap and also intends to strengthen inter-linkages between SDG 7 and other SDGs. For the sake of its agenda, SDG 7 encourages cross-border grid connections, on-grid renewable energy solutions and decentralised options that are required to respond to the differing needs of countries and regions.

Indeed, billions of people worldwide are benefited from SDG 7. Hence, it is imperative to review the situation in the Bay of Bengal region, where the electricity demand and supply gap is negative and is expected to grow over the period by 2030. Under the circumstances, is there any scope for cross-border grid connection in this region to meet this increasing demand? What are the constraints, if any, in achieving the aims of SDG 7? This brief essay will focus only on conventional energy with special attention to access to electricity.

BIMSTEC at a glance

Rapid economic growth, industrialisation and increasing demand for goods and services has led to a rising trend in primary energy consumption per capita in all BIMSTEC countries namely, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar. As per the BIMSTEC Energy Outlook 2030 the total primary energy supply in the BIMSTEC region in 2008 was 772 millions tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), which is estimated to increase to 1758 Mtoe by 2030. During the same period, the total primary energy consumption was 539 Mtoe in 2008 and estimated to increase to 1210 Mtoe in 2030. Coal continues to remain the primary source of energy supply. The share of oil in total primary energy consumption is expected to decline from 31 percent in 2008 to 29 percent in 2030; it nonetheless accounts for the largest share which is closely followed by an increase in the consumption of electricity from 13 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2030.

Most of the BIMSTEC countries are dependent upon imports to meet their primary energy needs — India’s import dependency was 41.5 % in 2018, Bangladesh was 16.8 % in 2014, Nepal was 16.7% in 2014, Sri Lanka was 57.5 % in 2017 and Thailand was 64 % during December 2018-19. Nonetheless, the fact remains that despite being dependent upon external sources for energy requirements, the BIMSTEC region itself is endowed with abundant natural resources comprising of coal at 324 billion tonnes, oil at 664 million tonnes, natural gas at 99 trillion cubic feet, biomass at 11 billion tonnes, hydropower (large) at 328 GW, and renewable energy potential of more than 1,000 GW.

Increasing cross-border trade in electricity will be an important component of an integrated strategy aimed towards ensuring energy security in the region.

The per capita electricity consumption in the region is still abysmally low though most of the BIMSTEC countries have made significant improvements in ensuring access to electricity. Except for Bhutan, the per capita electricity consumption of all the other BIMSTEC countries is below the world average of 3501 kWh/capita in 2019. The situation of the Bay region is stark in comparison to major global economies like the United States (13,375 kWh/capita), Australia (10,519 kWh/capita), France (8,835 kWh/capita) and United Kingdom (4,794 kWh/capita). Nepal accounts for very low consumption (177 kWh) while Bhutan has more than 9,000 kWh, Myanmar 442 kWh, Bangladesh 550 kWh, Sri Lanka 759 kWh and India 1,141 kWh in 2019. The BIMSTEC countries, therefore, must tap into the resources available within the region to ensure energy security. The share of electricity in primary energy consumption will increase in the near future, but supply will remain inadequate. Increasing cross-border trade in electricity will, therefore, be an important component of an integrated strategy aimed towards ensuring energy security in the region.

Cross-border energy cooperation within BIMSTEC: Some pressing issues

The first BIMSTEC Ministerial Conference on Energy was held in New Delhi, India, in 2005 where the “Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation in BIMSTEC” was formulated. Further, a MoU has been signed on BIMSTEC Grid-Interconnection by the member countries in 2018. BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection aims to expand energy trade among member states and accelerate development of new hydro-power projects, interconnection of electricity and natural gas grids, implementation of viable renewable energy projects, and sharing of experiences, knowledge and information on energy efficiency programmes. The experts argue that cross-border electricity network will not only ensure quality supply of power at a lower cost, but also enhance energy efficiency. However, resource scarcity has become one of the major concerns in this regard.

Cross-Border Sub-Regional Energy Trade Possibility

It is worth-noting, energy cooperation in the BIMSTEC region has been evolved through bilateral arrangements, with India being the central figure because of its geographical location and large economy. The bilateral arrangements between India-Bhutan, India-Bangladesh and India-Nepal are well established now where the contiguous zone comprising of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) may emerge as a hub of energy resources for the BIMSTEC. In this regard, India’s national policy on cross-border electricity trade (CEBT) assumes central importance. The first draft of the guidelines on CBET issued in 2016 was opposed by Bhutan and Nepal on the grounds that electricity could only be exported to India by companies that were owned by the respective governments of these countries or by those having at least 51 percent equity investment of Indian public or private companies after obtaining a one-time approval from the designated authority. Under the amended guidelines issued in 2018, these restrictions were removed although exports (imports) were still subject to generation capacity exceeding (falling short) of demand.

The bilateral arrangements between India-Bhutan, India-Bangladesh and India-Nepal are well established now where the contiguous zone comprising of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) may emerge as a hub of energy resources for the BIMSTEC.

Consequentially, cross-border multilateral efforts are yet to develop. The time has come to critically evaluate the factors that have hindered progress along this path so far. Too much dependency on bilateralism sometimes creates obstacle to promote cross-border multilateral cooperation. The inherent link between energy and electoral politics in the BIMSTEC region in general and BBIN in particular has led to the perception of energy as a political good rather than an economic good, which can change the situation for the betterment of the common people across the border. The political labelling of energy has led to the failure to account for the economic cost of non-cooperation. More so, keeping a balance between environmental concerns and developmental activities sometimes appears as a serious challenge. Mutual political understanding and good will is the need of the hour to implement SDG 7 goals for ensuring energy for all. Or else, the BIMSTEC countries will remain dependent on imported energy despite its abundant resources.

Counties Council supported the move at its December 21st meeting.

The move follows a contentious meeting in November when it appeared that not all areas of the county were working together on a rural education plan.

“I think the best way forward for us and develop an advocacy document that we can really use to promote rural education,” CAO Tim Simpson said adding that it wasn’t just for the region but at provincial conferences and with government officials. “I think this is the way to go.”

Simpson said the goal was to engage a consultant that had experience in education and knows how to navigate around the education system, school boards and get data to assist in creating a plan.

If approved, he said that he would be seeking input from councillors, staff, and public to create a terms of reference for the education consultant and then undergo the Request For Proposal process.

Once selected, a working group would be formed to work with the consultant on a plan with the hopes of completing it by Summer 2021.

Simpson did not say what the composition of a working group would look like or if there would be public input in creating the plan.

He said the timing to undergo this planning process was right.

“Everyone is consumed with COVID-19 right now so it is a good time to do this,” Simpson said. “Hopefully it will dove-tail nicely with getting a real professional document so we can go forward and say ‘look, you’ve told us rural education is important, here’s a way forward in our region that we think you should talk to us about.’”

Counties councillors were supportive of hiring a consultant.

“I think it will bring all the pieces together and it’s nice to have the non-political view on this,” said Councillor Kirsten Gardner (South Dundas). “Hopefully we will be able to get a consultant that not only knows about education but also funding formulas that the government uses. I think this is the way and hopefully we’ll find someone good.”

Councillor Jamie MacDonald (North Glengarry) said that he thought this was the best idea going forward and that having someone who is not politically involved will “bring everybody in together” on a plan.

Councillor Al Armstrong (North Dundas) said he would like to see a consultant who does not necessarily come just from an educator or school board background.

“With no disrespect to any of them, but that does sort of skirt the fine line of repetition in a different coat,” he said. “As we all spend a certain amount of time in certain vocations, you do become a bit familiar and forget the fact that we’re looking for a bit of innovation.”

He added that during the County’s strategic planning process, many councillors voiced their concerns about rural education in SDG Counties.

“We’ve all indicated we’re not really happy with the education system that we have,” Armstrong said. “One of our main priorities was to change the approach to how we get our youth prepared for life so the same-old, same-old is not going to work.

Councillors unanimously supported the action request and Counties CAO Tim Simpson said that the consultant would be a item for the draft 2021 budget.

As mentioned in the book ""Summa de Arithmetica"", by the ""father of accounting and bookkeeping"" Luca Pacioli, in 1494, it is a simple calculation in which the rule number is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years required for doubling. Using this rule for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it can be shown that if per capita GDP grows at 1 percent per year, then it will take roughly 70 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today. On the other hand, if per capita GDP grows at 3 percent per year, it will take only a little more than 23 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today.

Thus, even small differences in the growth rate of the economy over long periods of time may lead to dramatically different standards of living for the people of a country. So, what are the characteristics of an economy that make it grow faster than others? What policies can the government take to accelerate the pace of economic growth? Regarding such questions, Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas remarked, ""The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.""

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 acknowledges the importance of economic growth. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has brought in sudden and drastic disruptions that have ravaged the world economy and will most likely produce the greatest rise in global unemployment since World War II. For Bangladesh, the economic fallout from Covid-19 will be multidimensional in nature and massive in magnitude. For example, as of October 2020, real GDP growth for Bangladesh in 2020 has been estimated to be 1.6 percent by the World Bank and 3.8 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Earlier in April, the World Bank had forecasted that on a disaggregated level, real growth in Bangladesh economy in 2020 would be 3.5 percent for the agriculture sector, 2 percent for the industry sector and 3.5 percent for the services sector. At this rate, the agriculture sector would create 0.10 million more jobs, whereas the industry and services sectors would create 0.21 million and 0.9 million less jobs respectively, compared to 2018-19, assuming that employment-to-GDP elasticity would remain equal to that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the level of employment would be equal to that in 2016-17. This suggests that the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 may reduce employment in services and industry sectors, but create jobs in the agriculture sector, which would reverse decades of gradual structural transformation and stall the development of the economy.

Such dismal predictions seem to reflect the ground reality since, as of June 2020, at least 50,000 low-income individuals left Dhaka and returned to their village homes after losing their jobs due to the pandemic.

SDG 8 also asserts the need for decent jobs. Unfortunately, despite the rapid economic growth, Bangladesh has struggled to provide productive employment and decent jobs for its young labour force. In 2017, the youth unemployment rate was as high as 10.6 percent, whereas the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Regrettably, the unemployment rate among the youth who had completed tertiary-level education was 13.4 percent. This implies that the education system in Bangladesh is being unable to endow young people with market-relevant skills. In 2018, the share of the youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) was 26.2 percent in Bangladesh compared to the global average of 21.2 percent. These issues are particularly disconcerting because the country is now at the juncture where it may be able to reap the demographic dividends if it can gainfully employ its enormous young population.

The International Labour Organization has estimated that the fall in working hours in South Asia due to Covid-19 in the first two quarters of 2020 would be equivalent to 161 million full-time 40-hour-per-week jobs. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling has estimated that almost 140 million people in five South Asian countries and 12.37 million in Bangladesh may lose their jobs due to the pandemic. A survey by the Asian Development Bank has shown that the number of online job postings in Bangladesh in April 2020 was only 13 percent of the number of online job postings in April 2019. As of April 2020, 71 percent of urban slum-dwellers and 55 percent of the rural poor had no jobs due to Covid-19.

In the book ""Youth Employment in Bangladesh: Creating Opportunities—Reaping Dividends"", which I co-authored, we put forward a few suggestions for achieving SDG 8 in Bangladesh that are more relevant now in the context of Covid-19. These include: i) creating a database of youth NEET; ii) linking youth with employers; iii) revolutionising the education system so that it can build analytical competence and instil critical thinking skills in students; iv) increasing availability of technology and internet, particularly in the rural areas; v) reforming technical and vocational training to address the current need of industries; vi) ensuring equal employment opportunities for all without discrimination, prejudice or nepotism; vii) improving access to information at national, regional, and local levels; viii) promoting self-employment through entrepreneurship; ix) providing career counselling for the youth from an early stage; x) fostering an enabling environment for female youth; xi) training informal workers; and xii) seeking employment opportunities abroad.

The requested amount, coupled with funds the network hopes to receive from neighbouring municipalities such as Prescott-Russell and the City of Cornwall, as well as members, sponsors and stakeholders, would be enough for the EOAFN to have a $150,000 annual core funding.

EOAFN executive director Tom Manley asked council on Monday to consider a three-year partnership with the organization. The partnership would entail SDG providing the network with a proposed $25,000 a year. The EOAFN strives to promote small-scale agriculture, artisan food processing, agri-tourism, and local food consumption.

The Eastern Ontario Agri-Food Network (EOAFN) is hoping a partnership can be struck with the United Counties of SDG.

“For example, currently (the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs) offers a current program which requires 50 per cent matching funding and without core funding, an organization like EOAM cannot apply for those grants.”

Having core annual funding, Manley said, would allow the EOAFN to have core staff, essential services, networking activities, and training for operators.

“This would make sure that the operators see value in the services and are prepared to pay membership fees to contribute to that core funding,” he said. “It becomes a catch-22 situation — ‘show me the value and I will pay the membership fee,’ but we can’t show you the values without having the core funding.”

According to Manley, some of the value the EOAFN could offer operators include asset mapping, online marketing, promotional activities and regional distribution. This would also lead to the organization of more special events such as farm tours, and local food festivals.

Several councillors were weary of allocating the requested sum, stressing they would rather see a business plan beforehand.

“Personally, I’d rather see a business plan associated with a request of this nature,” said Coun. Carma Williams. “I know you’ve been around for a while — is there any such thing in existence?”

According to Manley, such a plan does exists and can be found on the organization’s website.

“There are so much work to do and so many different aspects of agri-tourism,” said Williams. “It’s very complex and the temptation — from my perspective anyway — is trying to be everything to everybody and meanwhile being nothing to anyone. It can happen.

“I think it’s important to really focus efforts so that actual concrete things can happen. I have more questions with regards with ensuring that the things would actually be accomplished here.”

In order to address Williams’ concerns, Manley told council he would invite SDG to appoint one of its members to serve on the EOAFN’s board.

The decision by SDG council on whether to allocate the funding request is set to be taken during 2021 budget deliberations, set to begin in February.

252,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-wonder-woman-1984,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Wonder Woman 1984’,"Gal Gadot is back starring in the sequel to the 2017 movie currently in theatres just in time for Christmas.

Wonder Woman 1984 is bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don’t have the nerve to be.

In its fairytale tone, 1980s setting, and moral earnestness, it reminded me of Superman II, and in other ways it reminded me of Batman Returns. Nobody involved got the memo that comic-book movies in the shared-universe era of Marvel and DC films must be grounded in irony or cynicism or both.

Indeed, WW84—the only title seen onscreen—barely acknowledges that it’s meant to be part of a shared universe.

Remember that WWI-era photograph of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor that Bruce Wayne dug up in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and sent to Diana Prince by way of connecting with a mystery super-woman who might be needed again? (If you don’t remember? “WW84 is agreeably diverting” might be all you need to know.)

That bit of detective work kind of suggests that Diana (Gal Gadot) has been keeping a low profile for the past century, right? I’m not going to say that WW84 entirely forgets that, but I’m not saying it’s real concerned about it either.

After a prologue flashback to Diana’s native Themyscira — in which eager young Diana (played again by Lilly Aspell, now 13) learns a hard lesson from her aunt, Robin Wright’s stern General Antiope, about taking shortcuts and cheating truth — we catch up with Diana, nearly 70 years after her WWI exploits, working at the Smithsonian in antiquities and doing occasional superheroics. (Without quite staying out of the news, she presumably doesn’t leave a lot of photo or video evidence for Bruce Wayne to overlook.)

It’s a good thing, I guess, that Wonder Woman isn’t much more than a rumor or an urban legend, because Diana Prince isn’t much of a secret identity. Glamorous, confident, physically capable, Diana makes no effort to hide behind a façade of Clark Kent timorousness or Don Diego foppish decadence. She doesn’t even wear Lynda Carter glasses like she did in 1918.

It’s not hard to see why vulnerable, accident-prone Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), a new hire whose areas of expertise include gems, is so taken with Diana that, when the notion of having a wish granted is brought up, her first thought is to be — what else? — like Diana.

What do you wish for when you are Diana? Obviously, someone to share it all with. And not just someone, but Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who died heroically at the end of Wonder Woman.

The granting of wishes is also very much on the mind of a self-promoting would-be oil magnate and wealth guru named Maxwell Lord (The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal), whose TV ads blend Norman Vincent Peale-esque positive thinking and Kevin Trudeau-ish pyramid-scheme hucksterism. He’s part Gordon Gekko, part Gene Hackman Lex Luthor.

WW84 gracefully dovetails these characters’ comic-book destinies and desires, along with a DC Comics MacGuffin called the Dreamstone (which may put viewers in mind of Marvel’s Infinity Stones, though as with most DC/Marvel convergences DC got there first), into an elegantly simple plot that gives us two classic Wonder Woman villains — along with a global crisis of nearly Infinity War proportions.

Like the big comic-book movies of the 20th century — particularly the Tim Burton Batman films — the villains are more interesting than the hero.

Wiig brings pathos and sweetness to the improbably named Barbara Minerva, who is both awed by Diana and also can’t help resenting her perfection a bit. Then Barbara’s life turns a corner, and her pleasure at being noticed by men and flirted with by the likes of Max Lord is palpable.

As she and Diana find themselves on equal footing, the awe falls away and the resentment comes to the fore. At the same time, Barbara finds her empathy (for example, her solicitude for a homeless man for whom she regularly buys food) slipping away.

As Max, Pascal is simultaneously larger than life and smaller than he seems; you can feel him willing himself to be the titan of wealth and power he presents himself as, but hasn’t quite managed to become.

If some viewers are reminded at times of another self-promoting, womanizing figure of that era whose success has allegedly been less than represented, it’s worth noting that WW84 humanizes Max, whose deepest motivation is to make his young son Alistair (Lucian Perez) proud of him.

Ultimately, WW84 is as goodhearted toward all as its heroine, which is both its strength and its weakness.

Gadot’s Wonder Woman remains, like Christopher Reeve’s Superman, an attractively aspirational hero, a vanishing rarity in contemporary comic-book cinema. Yet there was a tension and pathos to the character of Superman, who as Clark Kent was as invisible to Lois Lane as Barbara was to men before turning that corner.

The pathos of Superman was also connected to the loss of the alien homeworld he never knew and the instigating death of his foster father, Jonathan Kent, whose salt-of-the-earth Kansas values inform Superman’s Boy-Scout character.

Wonder Woman, as appealing as she is, has none of that. It’s true that she lost Antiope to a German bullet in 1918, but Themyscira is still very much there and her mother Hippolyta is still queen.

There’s no real secret-identity duality to struggle with, and Diana’s one emotional attachment in a man’s world, to Steve Trevor, is complicated only by the fact that he’s dead. Until, you know, he isn’t? And then emotional complications do arise, and Diana finds herself facing a moral dilemma like the one Barbara faces.

Steve aside, Diana’s emotional isolation and uncomplicated perfection threatens to make her boring, a bit like Marvel’s Thor circa The Dark World — a much less perfect character, to be sure, but also a bit like Superman without the tragedy and pathos.

In the last half-hour of its 2½-hour run time, WW84 bogs down with overextended, overwrought conflict and a rushed attempt to do justice to Barbara’s ultimate transformation into Wonder Woman’s most iconic villain — a move that should have been deferred to another movie.

Add Cheetah to a long list of perennial comic-book antagonists, from Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy (Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom) to the Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan versions of the Joker, who became “one and done” villains of the week on the big screen.

I still enjoyed WW84, partly for the appealing leads and partly for the morally earnest fairytale storytelling. I wish comic-book movies tried more to be like this, and less like Avengers: Infinity War or Thor: Ragnarok or Justice League.

Caveat Spectator: Action violence; brief sensuality and implied nonmarital sex; brief bad language, including an instance of profanity. Teens and up.","Wonder Woman 1984 is bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don’t have the nerve to be.
And not just someone, but Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who died heroically at the end of Wonder Woman.
Gadot’s Wonder Woman remains, like Christopher Reeve’s Superman, an attractively aspirational hero, a vanishing rarity in contemporary comic-book cinema.
Wonder Woman, as appealing as she is, has none of that.
I wish comic-book movies tried more to be like this, and less like Avengers: Infinity War or Thor: Ragnarok or Justice League."

Article content An architectural and engineering design looking into the feasibility of accommodating new office space within the Warden’s House will cost up to $50,000. In its report asking to proceed with the work, administration said the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the need for additional office space. Although council approved the request from administration to move to the design phase, several members had harsh words for the aging building — some of them categorizing it as a money pit. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG council weary of investing in Warden's House Back to video EVB Engineering was initially retained in order to provide a structural review of the building. It determined that the Warden’s House does not meet the Ontario Building Code’s strength requirement for office space. According to rough estimates by EVB Engineering, upgrading the building for office space use could end up costing upwards of $400,000 — $300,000 in upgrades and $100,000 to create a corridor link between the current office space and the Warden’s House.

Article content The Warden’s House sits adjacent and attached to the former jail, part of the SDG administration building at Water and Pitt streets in Cornwall. SDG has spent money renovating and restoring the building’s exterior over the past several years, which is now brown-brick construction. The work done in the past however, did not address the improvements needed to use it as office space. “I don’t disagree with the thinking of using this office space, but my read of the documents leads me to believe that it could end up being scary,” said Coun. Steven Byvelds. “There are some preliminary numbers in the report that point to $450,000 and that’s just the big ball park numbers. But when you start peeling layers on these old buildings, it can become a challenge. “I guess the risk for the county is that we spend this $50,000 and it’s through funding, but then we might get less funding for the remaining $400,000.” “I don’t disagree with that stance,” answered Michael Jan, manager of infrastructure. “The Warden’s House could have designated substances that could be very costly to remove. This funding would give us a design that we could potentially shelve, at no cost to ourselves, for a future fit up when we deem the time is right.” County treasurer Rebecca Russell told council SDG could have access to $100,000 through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP). This stream of funding was established in order to build or renovate health and safety-related projects in long-term care, education, and municipalities to address critical local infrastructure needs.

Article content “That $100,000 can be used for capital projects in relation to COVID,” said Russell. “Our intention is to apply for that funding.” Russell also said SDG had also recently received $353,000 through the second phase of the Safe Restart Agreement which, although can’t be used for capital, can be used in order to cover operating deficits. “I think we need a turnkey price on this before we make a decision,” said Coun. Jim Wert. “In the farm world, sometimes we talk about holes that have no bottoms. I would hate for us to go too far down the road on that.” Byvelds compared investing in the building as putting lipstick on a pig. “Now we know that that building is severely deficient in a lot of areas,” he said. “You could end up with a study that tells you that you need to shut that building down until you rehabilitate it and then what are you going to do? “Sometimes you’re better off knocking it down and building something new later on.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

The funding comes from the recently launched Sustainable Development Goals Impact Facility (SDGIF), a multi-stakeholder financial and capacity building platform, that bridges entrepreneurship, social innovation, and blended capital to create sustainable economic and social returns.

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative. We hope that this go beyond the three windows and be a permanent intiative,” he said.","A total of 32 fledgeling and aspiring local entrepreneurs received N$2.5 million worth of grant funding on Tuesday.
